# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CCC Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses, and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

Dublin is the capital city of the Republic of Ireland and is located on the east coast of the country. Once home to Vikings, the city has grown around the flood plains of the River Liffey and is now a home to 592,713 Dubliners (Census, 2022). Spread over its 117 km2 are markers of a rich history and culture that have been shaping the city's identity for over a millennium.

The city is characterised by its medieval core around which stunning Georgian neighbourhoods with public squares providing a space for social and economic activities grew. These spaces continue to thrive and provide Dubliners with spots to relax and enjoy a bit of nature in the city; many make up Dublin's network of parks. The Grand Canal and Royal Canal that envelop the inner city were once full of canal boats moving goods to and from the port to the city and to the rest of country. Today, you will still see boats, but you will also see citizens cycling next to the canals on segregated paths or simply lingering and enjoying a moment.

Dublin has a rich natural endowment, which has throughout its existence provided citizens of the city with opportunities to innovate and make Dublin the city it is today. A city that is leading in innovation, is thriving with culture, and is diverse. Moreover, in its 1000-year history, Dublin has defined itself as a city that is resilient; having experienced battles and struggles and in history that is more recent the impacts of the Great Recession, Dublin and its citizens always emerge stronger and more unified. Dublin brings out the best in its people, who make the city unique and give it its spirit.

As the city council responsible for the city, Dublin City Council develops and implements key statutory and non-statutory plans that shape life in the city. Dublin City Council's Corporate Plan puts forward our vision and mission for both the city, and Dublin City Council, as an organisation and the principles by which we will be guided in all elements of our work on climate action. Our vision and mission in the Corporate Plan for 2020-2024 are:

Our Vision: A dynamic, sustainable city, that is future-ready, built on thriving, inclusive neighbourhoods and communities, a strong economy, a vibrant cultural life, and compact, connected growth.

Our Mission: To drive the sustainable development of the City through strong civic leadership and delivery of effective services that promote the well-being and quality-of-life of citizens and communities.

Beyond the Corporate Plan, DCC has several other plans that are shaping the low carbon climate resilient future of the city, these are:

Climate Action Plan 2024-2029 – Climate Neutral Dublin 2030: (Which was developed to meet our National Climate Objectives while serving as the first iteration of our Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CNAP) for the Climate City Contract as part of the Mission)
Dublin City Development Plan 2022-2028
Dublin City Local Economic &amp; Community Plan 2023-2025 Forthcoming

Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 has three targets that are interdependent:

A 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in line with our National Climate Objective by

, and and neutrality by 2050. We will achieve and exceed this using our participation in the EU Mission for 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities (Net Zero Cities) to accelerate this transition through collaborative partnerships and use systems innovation to realise opportunities, efficiencies and critically, co-benefits that improve health and well-being. Dublin City will achieve neutrality by 2030. (This means reducing anthropogenic emissions by 80% by 2030 through reducing consumption of fossil fuels and increasing sinks of carbon via green and blue spaces.)

A Climate Resilient City prepared for the known and unknown impacts of climate change.
A Just Transition meaning that the actions we take do not cause harm.

Beyond these targets recognising that climate change is the single biggest threat to health and well-being, we anticipate that our plan will realise co-benefits that we will monitor and capture namely we will see improvements in:

Air Quality (currently measured through Dublin City Air and Noise)
Water Quality (measured by various stakeholders)
Soil Health (not currently available)
Biodiversity (Flora and Fauna) (currently not consistently monitored)
Noise Levels (currently measured through Dublin City Air and Noise)
Population Health and Well-being (data is at the National level, and work is needed to understand local data)
Social Cohesion (survey – Your Dublin, Your Voice)
Economic indicators (quarterly – Dublin Economic Monitor)
Traffic volumes (monitored daily via Traffic Asset Management System)
Temperature comparisons across the city to better assess the urban heat island effect
Measuring ground level Ozone
Aero allergens
Monitoring of disease vectors – mosquitos, flies, ticks, and invasive species.

We need to improve our data collection and capacity for analysis. This will require data harmonisation and collaboration. We have experience in collaborating on data collection. For example, some monitoring of key species undertaken by NGO's and ecologists on behalf of the LA's, Dublin Port, and NPWS - to create and maintain a comprehensive inventory of species and habitats in Ireland; to undertake scientific surveys and research, and compile monitoring data, to assist in the provision of specialist advice in relation to public policy, designations, and the protection and management of wildlife habitats and species. Also, voluntary reporting via the Biodiversity Data Centre which has a database and maps for most/all native species. This is strong demonstration of how partnerships with public sector, academia and communities can deliver

Ultimately, for DCC participation in the Mission is an opportunity to improve quality of life for all people who live, work, study and visit the city. We know that this is achieved by engaging deeply with citizens, businesses, the private and public sector, and understanding how by working together we can improve the lives of all as parents, business owners etc. Importantly, as we are part of the EU Mission for 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities, this action plan will evolve as we work with citizens, businesses and academia to exchange knowledge and ideas to develop innovative solutions to increase our city, our home's resilience.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Introduction

The introduction outlines the local geographic and policy context in which the city's 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan is being developed and describes the gap it addresses in broad terms. It includes:

The administrative territories included in the city's 2030 climate neutrality target. Where applicable, any districts or emission sources within these administrative boundaries that are excluded from the target of climate neutrality by 2030¹. Table I-1.1 summarizes this narrative in a snapshot.
Key data on the administrative and political organisation of the city, its demographic and socio-economic characteristics, and climate-relevant sectors.
A clear description of the relationship of this CCC Action Plan with existing climate policies and strategies (further detailed in Module A-2), and how it builds on them to address the gap (if any) to climate neutrality.
Background information on the work process of developing the city's CCC Action Plan, highlighting its connection with the other Climate City Contract components (2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments and 2030 Climate Neutrality Investment Plan).
A description of future steps, planned timeline and milestones for future iterations for the continuous development of the CCC Action Plan.

Introduction

¹ By default, the participating city would commit the whole city or entity to become climate-neutral. However, where duly justified, the city may propose to exclude one or more district(s) or sources of emissions from the 2030 deadline, but in this case should commit to a strategy of climate neutrality for these districts as soon as possible, and of course no later than 2050. In this context, districts will be considered as neighbourhoods or zones of special interest of a city administered or governed by some type of “district council”.

neighbourhoods and communities, a strong economy, a vibrant cultural life, and compact, connected growth.

Our Mission: To drive the sustainable development of the City through strong civic leadership and delivery of effective services that promote the well-being and quality-of-life of citizens and communities.

As the new Corporate Plan is being developed a revised vision (Figure 2) and mission are being agreed by the elected representatives and the executive.

Figure 2 Vision for City 2025-2029

Beyond the Corporate Plan, DCC has several other plans that are shaping the low carbon climate resilient future of the city, these are:

Climate Action Plan 2024-2029 – Climate Neutral Dublin 2030: (Which was developed to meet our National Climate Objectives while serving as the first iteration of our CAP for the Climate City Contract as part of the Mission)
Dublin City Development Plan 2022-2028
Dublin City Local Economic &amp; Community Plan 2023-2025 Forthcoming

To support the delivery of these plans DCC has nurtured several programmes. Specifically, DCC has an award-winning Smart City Programme. Initiated in 2015 to experiment with new concepts and ideas, today Smart Dublin is facilitating over 100 live projects. Using the Quadruple Helix model, Smart Dublin has brought together citizens, government, academia and industry to facilitate the growth of our innovation ecosystem. We have developed new 'Smart Districts' across Dublin that facilitate experimentation as living labs. New processes have been developed and championed to help foster and scale up innovation in our business community, for example our Small Business Innovation Research Programme. We have worked with our local research community to identify cutting-edge solutions that respond to urban challenges – air quality (iScape), active travel (Dublin Cycling Buddy) and improve our service delivery (SBIR Gully Monitoring). Climate action is central to our smart cities' initiatives, and we are actively building our data sets to inform how we take action.

# Our Commitment for Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 ;

As with our Expression of Interest (EOI) to join the Mission our targets are focused on the administrative boundary of Dublin City Council. In the EU NUTS system Dublin is considered to include our neighbouring local authorities of Fingal County Council, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and South Dublin County Council, it is anticipated that as the four Dublin Local Authorities work together through the Dublin Metropolitan Region Climate Action Regional Office (CARO), that the territory will expand. Notably our neighbour local authorities face the same challenges, yet are

determined to lead and achieve neutrality, well in advance of our national targets.

The administrative area of the city includes Dublin Port, with whom we work to deliver the Dublin Bay Biopshere Programme

Being part of a community of 112 Cities determined to lead in the journey to climate neutrality, to achieve neutrality in manner that does no harm compliments and strengthens our vision and mission. The Mission provides a unifying narrative to bring stakeholders out of their silos to create systems change.

We achieved change with our first plan. We understood that we needed to build bridges between our silos; necessary and essential to achieving neutrality. Now we need to make sure that we use the bridges every day, and build new ones to create as many opportunities as possible for connections to be made that allow us to exchange knowledge, ideas and to build skills and capacity.

The Mission will enable this through the Climate City Contract process which will be key to bringing harmonisation to the of statutory and non-statutory plans, programmes and projects that shape the City by providing a shared narrative for co-creation and collaboration with citizens, academia, business and national government to achieve climate neutrality, and more importantly improving life for people.

The EU Mission for Dublin City Council and the city is an opportunity to accelerate our ambition and transition to neutrality; critically ensuring we achieve our vision for the city (Figure 2), which is emerging with the development of our forthcoming Corporate Plan 2024-2029

## Climate Policy Context

Ireland's success in contributing to Europe's climate objectives, as per the EU Green Deal is intimately interconnected with the success of its major cities - Dublin City and Cork City. Since the adoption of the Low Carbon Development and Climate Action Act in 2015 and its amendment in 2021 Ireland has produced four National Climate Action Plans, a National Adaptation Framework, 12 sectoral adaptation plans at the National level, 31 local authority climate change adaptation plans (now being revised to local authority climate action plans) and most recently Ireland's Long-term Climate Strategy - National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), the National Planning Framework and National Development Plan - Project Ireland 2040 have sought to address sustainable land-use by requiring city and county development plans to consider how planning addresses climate change. Despite the volume of plans and actions, progress has been limited and Ireland as, a whole is off course.

Reviews of Ireland's progress on climate action by the Climate Change Advisory Council and academic researchers point to the need for systems change, as the current siloed approach is non-functional. Additionally, there has been a greater call for local authorities to play a significant role in Ireland's transition to a low carbon future. This is welcomed, however, the increased role for local authorities does not come with consideration for the knowledge and expertise that exists within each local authority that enables the delivery of programmes and projects that contribute to improved quality of life in Ireland's cities, towns, and villages and how this expertise can inform the journey to climate neutrality from the local to the national level. Specifically, the need for systems innovation that is enabled and empowered by collaboration achieved through adaptive governance.

We acknowledge that multilevel governance is viewed by the EU Commission as being critical to climate neutrality. Ireland currently employs a multi-level governance approach, with clearly delineated roles for various levels of government, and agencies, which has contributed to non-functional silos. Adaptive governance provides calls for the level of government, in this instance the city, to lead due to their knowledge and expertise, moving away from a hierarchy and non-functional silos. As such our approach is advocating for this shift in governance to enable delivery, and achieve the systems change and innovation necessary to building policy coherence to unlock the path to climate neutrality.

# Greenhouse Gas Baseline

The overall emissions for the Dublin City Council area have been calculated for the baseline year of 2018 and are estimated to be 2,042,365.621 tonnes of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (tCO₂e). (It is acknowledged that when converted to a per capita number this is below the per capita average at the national level, this highlights the need for an improved methodology). Of this 32% is commercial, 27% is residential, and 25% is transport. The baseline methodology was developed by the City's energy agency, Codema and details on the methodology are available here.

Our 2018 emissions baseline is provided in Appendix 3 of Climate Neutral Dublin 2030. We acknowledge that it is a starting point and we are taking action to address its completeness. A critical public service is ensuring that citizens are provided with accurate information and evidence, this is essential to building trust and relationships that are the backbone of collaboration and co-creation, necessary for climate action.

Our climate action plan – Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 is actively addressing the emission from these key sectors. Critically we are actively increasing vegetation in the city to sequester emissions and improve air quality, water quality, and noise levels. The recent State of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) Report 2024, highlights the necessity and value of conventional CDR, specifically the role of land use in durable carbon dioxide removals.

The sequestration potential of our greening strategies is absent from our baseline inventory, and since 2018 we have been increasing green cover in the city and are aiming to increase this by more than 12 sq, adding to our existing 20 sq km. At present we also have 60,000 street trees and are aiming to plant 40,000 more. This also does not account for planting on private property which has increased and we are encouraging to reduce flood risk and urban heat island impacts.

Acknowledging the assumptions held in the current methodology applied for the baseline, DCC is moving towards projects using whole life carbon assessments (embodied and operational). Additionally, to overcome a longstanding issue related to project funding – value for money – projects will also be considering carbon avoided as part of their assessments. Recent publications by the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland on the Real Cost of Retrofit and construction costs of new builds, shows that accounting for the carbon impacts and other co-benefits provides an additional rationale; as the costs of retrofit and new builds are almost at par on a per square meter basis. This will be discussed further in the IP.

# Targets to 2030 and beyond

Ireland is off target even though there was a decrease in emissions of 1.9% in 2022 (EPA, 2023). In 2022, Ireland's GHG emissions were estimated to be 60.76 Mt CO2eq million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2eq). While the reduction is welcome, the latest report indicates that Ireland will not meet the National Climate Objective of 51% by 2030 (EPA, 2023). This is likely attributable to the siloed approach deployed to date, that has led to a focus on who is responsible for what, rather than an understanding of the interdependencies and interconnectedness of emissions.

Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions (including LULUCF) under the With Existing Measures and With Additional Measures scenarios out to the year 2030
Figure 3 Ireland's Emissions (Source EPA)

We know we have to do our bit for all sectors – Built Environment, Transport, Electricity, Industry, and Agriculture, and Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry, (LULUCF sector is made up of six land use categories (Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland, Wetlands, Settlements, and Other Land) and Harvested Wood Products), We now have an Amended Act that requires us to meet new targets -  $51\%$  by 2030 compared to 2018 and Neutrality by 2050. While there are sectoral ceilings there is no target for the public sector as was the case in 2020. It is as a whole. In other words, our plan must enable all sectors to reduce emissions. Emissions from one sector are inextricably linked to another - Farmers need roads to bring food to the businesses that occupy buildings, which use energy transmitted and distributed by utilities under the roads, to cook the food that feeds you.

We know that as climate science advances and the understanding of the impacts of human activity on the planet deepens, targets will shift. Already the IPCC (2023) has stated we need to accelerate action to limit warming to 1.5 degrees.

While 592,713 people live in the city, our daytime population is 1.5 times this (CSO, 2022). The emissions from their commute, the goods and services they consume, and their activities cannot be spatially constrained. Like people, emissions do not stop at county borders.

Similarly, the impacts of climate change such as flooding, storms, heat waves, and drought are not limited by geography. In 2023, the need to act has never been more evident both globally and locally. From record breaking rainfall in July for Ireland that resulted in multiple flood events across Dublin, to wildfires engulfing Canada and Southern Europe, our climate has and is changing, yet we can still act. DCC will lead by decarbonising our building stock and changing the way we work, to demonstrate what is possible and needed for a climate resilient city, prepared for a future with climate change.

Our first climate change action plan covered the years 2019 to 2024. In the lifetime of our first plan, we met and exceeded our emissions and energy efficiency targets for 2020. In 2021, it is estimated that DCC consumed over 161 GWh of Total Primary Energy, emitted over 30,500 tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  at an estimated cost of €11.4 million. While this is positive, a large proportion of the reduction is attributable to the increasing percentage of renewables on the national grid. An ongoing challenge is the thermal element, which has only recorded a marginal reduction in the same period

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

We aim to build on our first plan's successes and learnings. As with the first, this plan is a living document that will respond to the science (IPCC) and to changes in National and EU policy. The EU Mission for Dublin City Council and the city's is an opportunity to accelerate our ambition and transition to neutrality

This plan covers the period 2024 to 2029. In this time, we will reduce our emissions by over 51% (80%) from the 2018 baseline ahead of the 2030 target and make Dublin City resilient without causing harm. We will use our status as an EU Mission City to accelerate our ambition and transition to climate neutrality (80% reduction) by 2030. An ambitious goal that together with Cork City and over 100 cities across Europe we will work towards, by engaging our citizens and other stakeholders. As will be highlighted in the next section and in the action plan we are building capacity to link actions to net zero target. For us, a strategic priority is building our capacity for data collection, management and analysis, and using data as an opportunity for collaborative partnerships.

Our plan has three targets that are interdependent:

A 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in line with our National Climate Objective by 2030, and neutrality by 2050. We will achieve and exceed this using our participation in the EU Mission for 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities (Net Zero Cities) to accelerate this transition through collaborative partnerships and use systems innovation to realise opportunities, efficiencies and critically, co-benefits. Dublin City will achieve neutrality by 2030. (This means reducing anthropogenic emissions by 80% by 2030 through reducing consumption of fossil fuels and increasing sinks of carbon via green and blue spaces.)
A Climate Resilient City prepared for the known and unknown impacts of climate change
A Just Transition meaning that the actions we take do not cause harm.

The plan was developed to meet both the National Climate Objective and the EU Mission targets. Beyond these targets recognising that climate change is the single biggest threat to health and well-being, we anticipate that our plan will realise co-benefits that we will monitor and capture namely we will see improvements in:

Air Quality (currently measured through Dublin City Air and Noise)
Water Quality (measured by various stakeholders)
Soil Health (not currently available)
Biodiversity (Flora and Fauna) (currently not consistently monitored)

## Challenge into an Opportunity

We need to improve our data collection and capacity for analysis. This will require data harmonisation and collaboration. We have experience in collaborating on data collection. For example, some monitoring of key species undertaken by NGO's and ecologists on behalf of the LA's, Dublin Port, and NPWS - to create and maintain a comprehensive inventory of species and habitats in Ireland; to undertake scientific surveys and research, and compile monitoring data, to assist in the provision of specialist advice in relation to public policy, designations, and the protection and management of wildlife habitats and species. Also, voluntary reporting via the Biodiversity Data Centre which has a

database and maps for most/all native species. This is strong demonstration of how partnerships with public sector, academia and communities can deliver.

# Changing Engagement: More than a Formality.

Ultimately, for DCC, participation in the Mission is an opportunity to improve quality of life for all people who live, work, study and visit the city. We know that this is achieved by engaging deeply with citizens, businesses, the private and public sector, and understanding how by working together we can improve the lives of all as parents, business owners etc

While we must engage in formal processes that are set out in legislation for public consultation, as detailed and demonstrated here, with our most recent city development plan:

The plan included pre-draft consultation with the elected members, the general public, key stakeholders, infrastructure providers, sectoral groups, statutory agencies and adjoining local authorities. The pre-draft public consultation extended over a ten-week period with the launch of an issues paper in February 2021.

The consultation strategy included a number of public information events including five online webinars to encourage as much public engagement as possible. There was also active use of social media including an information video. Over 750 written submissions, together with the opinions and comments arising from the public consultation webinars, were taken into account when formulating the draft development plan. The number of submissions and contributions reflects a high level of interest in the future of the city.

In considering the views expressed by the public at the pre-draft stage, the elected representatives proposed over 1,000 strategic directions to include in the draft development plan. Following consideration of the draft development plan prepared by the Chief Executive, the elected members proposed further motions for amendments to the draft plan. All changes agreed by the City Council were incorporated into the draft plan which went on public display from 25th November 2021 for a period of 12 weeks.

Over 4,300 submissions/observations were received in response to this stage of the public consultation process and the Members, having considered the views expressed by the public proposed over 500 motions giving direction to the Chief Executive regarding strategic and policy issues to amend in the Draft Development Plan. The Members resolved to amend the Draft Plan at Special Council Meetings in July 2022 following consideration of the Chief Executive's Report on submissions received and the Chief Executive's Report on motions received. As these amendments constituted a material alteration to the Draft Dublin City Development Plan, the Council resolved to place the proposed material alterations on statutory public display for a period of five weeks from the 27th of July 2022.

In addition to the public display which took place in locations throughout the city including all public libraries and area offices, all public documents were placed on the website specially designed for consultation on the Draft Plan – www.dublincitydevelopmentplan.ie and the City Council's dedicated social media sites were used to publicise the material alteration display period. Over 1,000 submissions/observations were received on the proposed material amendments and 120 motions were received from Councillors. The Members of Dublin City Council then considered the material amendments to the Draft City Development Plan 2022-2028 and the Chief Executive's Report on submissions received and the Chief Executive's Report on motions received at Special Council Meetings held on 1st and 2nd of November 2022 and resolved to adopt the Draft Plan.

The adoption of the plan is a reserved function of the elected members under the

Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended). The adopted Dublin City Development Plan 2022 - 2028 takes effect from 14th December 2022.

We know that people are busy and may not have the time to participate in a statutory process, as such we need to engage in novel ways that will encourage participation in formal consultation, but also identify how we might improve statutory processes, as society is changing and we need to evolve in how we engage, and this begins with implementation.

# Towards the Implementation of a Transformative Climate Action Plan

Dublin City's participation in the EU Mission is an opportunity to unlock the barriers to systems transformation needed to achieve neutrality.

To support our participation in the EU Mission our statutory local Climate Action Plans – was developed to respond to the bold objectives of the EU Mission. From our experience with our first CAP we have learned that successful implementation of our climate action plan cannot be achieved without systems change.

More critically, that the "change as usual" approach is not sufficient, we need whole systems change. To achieve systems change we need to fully understand the systems that shape our cities and the factors that allow the current systems to persist, such as behaviour, siloed working, incoherent policies, lack of resources (time and finance) and fear. Then to take that knowledge and understanding to develop new solutions that are rooted in interdisciplinary collaboration. We know that this process will not be simple, we still have a city to run, to maintain, that requires functioning roads, waste collection systems, and other services. We cannot shut down; therefore, transformation must be an active and deliberate process, using planned initiatives as catalysts for transformation.

In recent years, it has become clear that siloed work is unfit for purpose. Triggering systems change requires, instead, an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach. While DCC staff in charge of the Plan see climate action as an opportunity for more interdisciplinary and proactive ways of working, DCC staff identified several challenges to embracing such an approach. These include:

Climate action is recognized as a responsibility of the City Council, however, greater clarity is needed on how to weave in to day-to-day tasks and responsibilities.
Staff are pre-occupied with 'firefighting' and with the public acceptance of transformative policies, they feel time is poor, and feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of the changes that the net-zero transition entails.
Day-to-day work practices and organization may hinder the staff's capacity to contribute to the Plan as needed, e.g. very specific key performance indicators leading to a narrow focus and trade-offs between teams' efforts.

The OECD will contribute to enable and build the capacity of DCC to embrace a challenge-led and systemic approach to the CAP implementation, as part of the organisations' efforts to support Governments across the OECD in their transition towards net-zero.

Building our capacity in this space will play an essential role in future iterations of the CCC which are anticipated to be revised fully every two years, enabling us to co-create with external stakeholders solutions to the challenges we identify together.

# 2 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

Part A "Current State of Climate Action" describes the point of departure of the city towards climate neutrality, including commitments and strategies of key local businesses, and informs the subsequent modules and the outlined pathways to accelerated climate action.

# 2.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

Module A-1 "Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory" details and describes the latest GHG inventory, where available from 2018 or more recent, referring to a clearly stated geographic boundary. The aim of this section is to establish the emission baseline and to establish the emissions gap to 2030 climate neutrality according to the inventory specifications defined in the Cities Mission's Info Kit for Cities² and the process outlined in the CCC Action Plan Guidance and Explanations. It includes:

Definition of geographic boundary of the GHG inventory and, if applicable, excluded areas, sectors, scopes, sources, gases.
An explanation of any (current) mismatch between the boundary of the GHG inventory and the climate-neutrality target, including actions planned to address the mismatch.

# GHG Emissions Baseline inventory

The baselines provided here are for the administrative boundary of Dublin City Council, excluded from this baseline is the AFOLU sector.

## Baseline for 2018: Context

### Mitigation

As part of our submission, we have uploaded our baseline as provided to us by our energy agency following a bespoke methodology that has been submitted to Covenant of Mayors via My Covenant. The methodology and a report "Dublin Regional Energy Master Plan" has been uploaded to provide context for our baseline.

The inventory has been produced using data that is publicly available. A key challenge with the methodology is that it deploys a synthetic methodology to estimate energy use from which to calculate emissions in the residential and commercial sectors. The methodology relies on building energy ratings, year of build and typology to estimate the energy use and in turn the emissions. A key challenge is that a BER is an estimate of potential energy use not actual energy use. This is further compounded by the requirement for a building to have a BER in order to be rented or sold. A BER certificate is valid for 10 years, and if not renewed it defaults to the lowest energy rating. As such estimation for the built environment do not reflect actual energy use. Emerging research is unveiling challenges with the BER rating system highlighting the underperformance of high rated BER buildings. This points to issues with an absence of rigorous verification, and a need for accompanying behaviour campaigns.

A gap in our emissions inventory is the AFOLU sector. Within Dublin City there are large swathes of green space that are not accounted for, approximately 17% of the city's area is green space. Further our measures undertaken to increase green cover are not captured. Although not covered by AFOLU as a coastal city, work is ongoing to understand, with a view to expand, the seagrass coverage, which is noted for its ability to capture carbon and reduce the energy of ocean waves. As a coastal city with a UNESCO Biosphere designation, there is a valuable understudy carbon sink that needs to be conserved to ensure its long-term contribution to carbon dioxide remove at a global scale.

### Dublin City Council's Energy and Emissions Profile

Dublin is capital city of Ireland and Dublin City Council (DCC) is the municipality responsible for administering a wide range of public services across the city area. Codema, Dublin's Energy Agency, calculated the overall emissions for the area served by DCC to be 2,183,270 tonnes of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (tCO₂e) in 2018. (It is acknowledged that when converted to a per capita number this is below the per capita average at the national level, this highlights the need for an improved methodology). Data collected as part of the Dublin Region Energy Masterplan (DREM) project, including 2016 census data, was used in Codema's methodology for the 'Baseline Emissions Inventory' (BEI). Figure 7 below illustrates the percentage of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions attributable to each sector, including the proportion directly controlled by DCC as 1.8% for the municipality and 4.5% by tenants of social housing.

This section outlines the types and quantities of energy consumed by DCC's operations, as well as the energy performance improvements achieved. As an Irish public body, DCC must report all attributable energy consumption to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's (SEAI) Monitoring and Reporting (M&amp;R) system. The M&amp;R systems show a total of nearly 111 gigawatt hours (GWh) of final energy consumption in 2022, which represents 160 GWh in primary energy requirement. The breakdown of across the significant energy users is shown in Figure 8 below

According to data submitted to the M&amp;R system and shown in shown in Figure 9 DCC has been making progress on energy performance improvement for more than a decade. The graph shows a  $40\%$  improvement in energy efficiency since the Baseline. DCC is currently engaged in preparatory work to attain ISO50001:2018 Energy Management System certification. Achieving and maintaining this internationally recognised standard will bring further impetus to these efforts and support the decarbonisation of DCC's operations.

DCC Annual Energy Performance Compared to Glidepath
Figure 9 - DCC Annual Energy Performance (Source: Codema / SEAI)

The energy types consumed by DCC can be organised into three main categories of electricity, thermal (natural gas and heating fuels) and transport (diesel and petrol). The emissions associated with each of these categories are shown in Figure 10 within the Gap-to-Target section. The total energy-related emissions in 2021 were 30,216 tonnes of carbon dioxide  $(\mathrm{tCO}_2)$ , with electricity responsible for the largest proportion with just over half, of which  $25\%$  was attributed to Public Lighting. DCC's Public Lighting Improvement Strategy will reduce the electricity demand from Public Lighting and these efforts are complimented by the decarbonisation of the national electricity grid. Natural gas consumption was responsible for  $36\%$  of DCC's energy-related emissions and the on-going programme of electrification of the thermal load will reduce this amount. With approximately  $10\%$  of the energy-related emissions, the diesel vehicles within the DCC account for the vast majority of the emissions within the transport category.

# Closing the Gap to Target

Dublin City Council is subject to public sector energy efficiency and energy-related emissions targets (as are all public and civil organisations), with performance evaluated through the SEAI's Monitoring and Reporting Framework. A spreadsheet model called the Gap-to-Target (GTT) model is used to analyse progress to date and highlight remaining emissions reductions required by DCC to meet the 2030 targets. In order to maximise the benefits of national grid decarbonisation and on-site renewables, public sector emissions targets focus on reducing the emissions associated with the thermal and transport categories, these are referred to as non-electricity related emissions. Progress on emissions targets is measured against a baseline calculated from the average across 2016, 2017 and 2018. There was a reduction of  $21\%$  in energy related emissions by 2022, however the vast majority of this was attributed to grid decarbonisation. Non-electricity related emission fell by only  $3\%$  in the same period, leaving a Gap-to-Target of  $48\%$  to achieve the combined  $51\%$  by 2030 under public sector policy. Figure below illustrates the anticipated energy-related emissions reductions that Dublin City Council will achieve through successful implementation of proposed decarbonisation projects pipeline.

# Dublin City Council's Social Housing

Dublin City Council is responsible for the allocation, maintenance, and refurbishment of its social housing stock, but not for the day-to-day energy use of its tenants. Nevertheless, the Council can proactively address these emissions by implementing energy efficiency enhancements. To gather the most up-to-date insights into DCC's social housing, the Council's social housing data and reports from 2022, along with the Building Energy Rating (BER) Research Tool provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), serve as the primary sources. The BER serves as a certification indicating the energy efficiency level of a property, with an 'A1' rating signifying the highest energy efficiency and a 'G' rating representing the lowest level of efficiency.

From 2009 to 2022, there has been a significant decrease in lower-rated BERs, with a reduction of  $72.1\%$  for ratings D1, D2, E1, E2, F, and G. Additionally, there has been a significant increase in higher-rated BERs, specifically A1, A2, A3, B1, and B2 categories. Moderate efficiency ratings (C1, C2, and C3) remain dominant, representing  $47.8\%$  of buildings in 2022.

# Adaptation Baseline

Making Dublin resilient to climate change is a target of the CAP, this calls for adapting the city and build residents' adaptive capacity for a future where we live with the impacts of climate change, such as flooding, extreme temperatures, and extreme weather events, that are locked in and are prepared for the unknown impacts.

Uncertainty adds to the challenge of implementing actions that contribute to the city's resilience. Despite this DCC has made progress in the implementation of actions that contribute to our overall resilience, particularly in the use of nature-based solutions to respond to flood risk in the city. However, we have not adequately responded to other known climate risks, such as heat. (Research through the CARO is planned for 2025 to address this)

Further, the long-term challenge is ensuring that the adaptation actions we implement are just. The implementation of city development plan is vital to making the city and residents resilient to climate change. The decisions we make about land-use and land-use change will determine our adaptive capacity. The location of housing, employment determines our vulnerability and exposure to climate risk.

We need to map our hazards, risks and vulnerability and use this to inform our decisions and investments. Critically this needs to be done regularly, as during the time that this plan has been written in 2023, Ireland experienced the driest June on record, followed by the wettest July and Storm Betty. This demonstrates that climate change is not only sudden events, but slower onset events with cascading and compounding impacts.

The Climate Change Risk Assessment that has been updated in the process of developing this plan, highlights that the frequency and intensity of events will increase in future, but that there are still unknowns.

Climate Risk Matrix
Figure 14 Climate Risks for Dublin City (Source : KPMG 2023)

As illustrated in the climate risk matrix above, projections indicate that the level of risk associated with some hazards (e.g., river and pluvial flooding, heatwaves and droughts) will increase while the level of risk will remain the same for others (e.g., severe windstorms and groundwater flooding). Risks associated with some hazards are expected to decrease due to projected reductions in hazard frequency, such as cold spells and heavy snowfalls.

Pluvial flooding poses a relatively high risk for Dublin City and occurs on frequent basis with a moderate impact associated with the inundation of assets and road infrastructure. The risks associated with pluvial flooding are projected to increase in the future as a result of projected increases in the frequency of hazard events and also due to an increase in the areas, assets and populations exposed to these hazards.
River flooding and coastal flooding occurs less often, but with a greater overall impact on Dublin City primarily due to direct and substantial damage to assets and infrastructure, disruption of transport networks and mobilisation of pollutants with detrimental impacts on bathing water areas. The risks associated with existing hazards such as river and coastal flooding are projected to increase in the future.
Severe windstorms are currently experienced on a very frequent basis across Dublin city and result in wide-ranging impacts, including damages to power and communication infrastructure and disruption to transport networks. Projections indicate no significant change to this frequency.
Dublin City experienced both a heatwave and drought in 2018, while a heatwave was also recorded in 2022. The most notable and costly impacts relate to the management of facilities at key recreational areas, and increased use of mechanical cooling. Projected increases in the frequency of heatwaves and drought conditions will mean that events currently experienced on an infrequent basis will become more frequent.
Recent experiences of cold spells and heavy snowfall events in 2018 (e.g. Storm Emma) and 2022, demonstrated the wide range of impacts for Dublin City. These included, amongst others, road closures, disruption to public transport, power outages, an increase in the frequency of trips and falls, and impacts on water resources. Projected increases in average temperature and decreases in

the frequency of snowfall indicate a decrease in the frequency of cold spells, heavy snowfall, and their associated impacts.

Groundwater flooding is currently experienced rarely in Dublin City and has limited impacts such as damages to roads and transport disruption. Groundwater flooding is also thought to be unchanged in the future.

## Limitations and Key Recommendations:

This Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) report has been developed on the basis of the most-up-to-date climate projection data available for Ireland at the time of writing. This data focuses on changes in average climatic conditions for a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5). Where risks have been identified as part of this initial qualitative CCRA, furthermore detailed assessment should be undertaken as part of semi-quantitative and/or quantitative site specific CCRAs which employ the full range of projected changes in climate parameters (including extremes) and more up-to-date climate projection information where available.

The CCRA report focuses on the direct risks posed by climate change for Dublin City and the implications of these for Dublin City Council. It is important to note that climate change will also pose indirect risks for Dublin City as a result of changes in climate conditions at international and global scales. These include amongst others forced migration of populations, increase in vector-borne disease and disruption of supply chains, Resulting in economic shocks with social consequences

sensors, which measure greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, as well as air quality parameters and weather variables, will provide a real-time visual pulse of the city, reflecting differences in land use, seasonal cycle in vegetation growth, weather events and even hourly patterns of traffic moving in and around the city streets. DCC is keen to see how this partnership will strengthen our capacity to communicate the impacts of our policies. The challenge here will be scaling and financing the project in a manner that ensures public good remains at the core.

Further, DCC is also actively supporting the continuation of Terrain AI, a multidisciplinary research collaboration to understand the impact of human activity on land use.

Recognising the compounding challenges of climate change and the demands that emerge with a growing global population. Terrain AI is exploring innovative AI and computational methodologies in how we collect, fuse and model multi-thematic data in order to develop a better understanding of GHG exchange across our farms, forests, peatlands and urban spaces. These improved GHG monitoring methodologies and standards will be adapted &amp; scaled for other regions and countries across the globe.

Funded initially by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) (now Research Ireland) and Microsoft Terrain AI develops new cloud-based, automated workflows and machine learning data toolsets for profiling and characterising environment types for more effective and precise carbon mitigation policies and practices.

Terrain-AI is advancing the standards of measurement, monitoring, verification and reporting of carbon stocks and emissions across complex environments. Researchers are developing innovative AI solutions and technologies, integrated with computational models, to provide more accurate estimates of carbon fluxes across scales, and a deeper understanding of the effects of human activities, to enable decision makers to develop more effective climate mitigation strategies.

Ultimately, Terrain AI is developing a rolodex of data sets, alongside a standardized cookbook for processing data that can be accessed by researchers and policy makers, to gain a deeper understanding of policy impacts.

For Dublin City, this presents an opportunity for delivering evidence-based policy enriched by data insights that can tell a rich picture of the impacts of projects, programmes and plan.

Further at the National level there are several initiatives that will contribute to an in depth understanding of emissions. Ireland has recently joined International Carbon Observatory System (I-COS, and the Irish Centre for High-end Computing is involved in Destin-E.

## 2.2 Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

Module A-2 "Current Policies and Strategies" lists and assesses existing policies, strategies, initiatives, or regulation from local, regional, and national level, relevant to the city's climate neutrality transition. This assessment contributes to identifying the gap (if any) between the emissions reduction due to existing initiatives and the city's 2030 climate neutrality target. Filling this gap by identifying additional actions and levers to achieve the city's emission reduction target is the focus of this Action Plan. The assessment of current policies and strategies offers hence a starting point for exploring the impact pathways (See Part C). The module includes:

Comprehensive list of local relevant policies, strategies, concepts, as well as of regional and national legislation that impact local climate action.
Descriptive assessment of the current climate-relevant policy context, summarising the objectives and implementation concepts, addressing e.g., spatial planning, energy, local economy, circular/bioeconomy, waste, transport, housing, urban greening/nature-based solutions).

# A-2.1: Description &amp; assessment of policies

Ireland's climate policy ecosystem is complex and continually evolving. We aim to provide a high-level overview of the policies at various levels of government from EU and International to city level and their impact on climate governance at the city level (Figure 20). In this section we provide a summary of policies and where possible their relevance to and impact on the city's climate neutrality ambitions. The actions in the CNAP and Climate Neutral Dublin 2030, respond to these policies by applying a systems approach.

## EU and International

### IPCC AR6

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published AR6 Synthesis Report, which is based on the content of the three Working Group Assessment Reports: WGI – The Physical Science Basis, WGII – Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, WGIII – Mitigation of Climate Change, and the three Special Reports: Global Warming of 1.5°C, Climate Change and Land, The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.

A message from AR6 Synthesis Report is that the current pace and scale of climate action are insufficient to tackle climate change. Adverse impacts from human-caused change will intensify and extremes become more widespread and pronounced with every increment of warming. The challenge ahead is to cut emissions quickly and sharply, scale up practices and infrastructure to enhance resilience and do both along numerous dimensions.

The report highlights the path forward; tried and tested options are available now, they need to be designed for diverse contexts, scaled up and widely applied. Mainstreaming effective and equitable climate action now via integrated adaption and mitigation in ways to provide wider benefits will reduce losses and damages for both nature and people, as well as improving health and livelihoods, reducing poverty and hunger and resulting in clean energy, water and air.

&gt; "Our choices will reverberate for hundreds, even thousands of years."

### Global Stocktake

The Global Stocktake was established in the Paris Agreement as a process to assess the world's collective progress toward the goals of the Agreement. Each stocktake is a two-year process and occurs every five years. The first stocktake began at the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties in Glasgow (COP 26) in 2021 and will conclude at COP 28 in 2023.

The stocktake occurs in three phases. Phase 1 includes collecting and preparing information. This phase runs from November 2021 until June 2023, with phase 2, a technical assessment, started in June 2022 and will also conclude in June 2023. Phase 3 is a consideration of outputs, focusing on the implications of findings from phase 2, and will occur during COP 28 in November 2023.

The result of phase 3, and the purpose of the stocktake is to:

Identify opportunities and challenges in enhancing action and support in collective progress
Identify possible measures and good practices
produce recommendations for strengthening action and enhancing support

### Relevance &amp; Impact

Since AR5 there has been increasing acknowledgement that cities are key stakeholders in delivering action on climate change. The Cities IPCC Conference held in Edmonton, Canada in March 2018, solidified the importance of cities for AR6 and AR7, resulting in the forthcoming Special Report on Cities and Climate change. Dublin City Council's first climate action plan was one of the 76 poster presentations in Edmonton, demonstrating our commitment to action. AR6's and the Global Stocktake at COP28 both call for accelerated action provides confirmation for our ambition to achieve neutrality, our hope is that the special report further confirms applying a systems approach to achieve action.

### WHO Breathe Life Campaign

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

1

Breathe Life is a joint campaign led by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, World Health Organisation, United Nations Environment Programme, and World Bank to mobilise cities and individuals to protect our health and our planet from the effects of air pollution.

BreatheLife combines public health and climate change expertise with guidance on implementing solutions to air pollution in support of global development goals. Key solutions for transport, waste management, household air pollution, energy supply, industry, and food and agriculture are the basis for the campaign.

BreatheLife connects governments by providing a platform for air quality managers and decisions makers from cities, regions and countries to share best practices and demonstrate progress in their journey to meeting WHO air quality targets by 2030. The campaign shares stories of success to empower individuals and governments to accelerate solutions.

The network of organisations and governments of different levels active in the campaign represents over 490 million people.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

Recognising the need to protect and improve our understanding of air quality in Dublin, DCC has committed to the WHO Breathe Life Campaign. In launching the Breathe Life Campaign with the Comhairle na nOg, (DCC's youth council) DCC has made a commitment to future generations to ensure that Dublin is a city with clean air, clean water and a high quality of life. As a signatory we have to date incorporated air quality and climate action into our City Development Plan and to continue incorporating both into all policies. As per national and regional policies decarbonisation zones, low emission zones, and strategic energy zones in the Development Plan will act to ensure future air quality, and further the progress made to date using quiet zones and lower speed limits. Further, we work at the regional level with neighbouring local authorities and the EPA to deliver a regional air quality management plan. A recent partnership with Google AirView has allowed us to gain hyperlocal insights into air quality and contribute to implementation of policy to protect air quality. Finally, Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 has embedded a health impact assessment to ensure that air quality is maintained.

## UN Sustainable Development Goals

'The SDGs are a bold commitment to finish what we started, and tackle some of the more pressing challenges facing the world today. All 17 Goals interconnect, meaning success in one affects success for others. Dealing with the threat of climate change impacts how we manage our fragile natural resources, achieving gender equality or better health helps eradicate poverty, and fostering peace and inclusive societies will reduce inequalities and help economies prosper. In short, this is the greatest chance we have to improve life for future generations.' (United Nations Development Program, 2023)

Ireland had a key role in furthering 'Transforming our World', the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. The 17 SDGs were brought about by the joint facilitation of the Irish and Kenyan UN ambassadors, who consulted with UN member states, civil society, the private sector and more, to commit to ending poverty and inequality, and to tackling climate change. (Flanagan and Kirwan, 2020).

## Relevance &amp; Impact: The SDGs and Local Authorities

'We recognize that sustainable urban development and management are crucial to the quality of life of our people. We will work with local authorities and communities to renew and plan our cities and human settlements so as to foster community cohesion and personal security and to stimulate innovation and employment. We will reduce the negative impacts of urban activities and of chemicals which are hazardous for human health and the environment, including through the environmentally sound management and safe use of chemicals, the reduction and recycling of waste and the more efficient use of water and energy. And we will work to minimize the impact of cities on the global climate system.' (United Nations, 2015)

The role of Local Authorities is key to implementation of the goals and the Dublin City Council's Climate Neutral Dublin 2030, brings together the dimensions of biosphere, economy and society.

In creating a vision of an open, social, resilient and resource-full city, we have the ideal opportunity to create connection and build on the Sustainable Development Goals by creating interconnected systems in the furtherance of reducing carbon emissions and creating a healthier and more sustainable Dublin.

Where possible we have used indicators that are part of the SDG framework to monitor the actions we are taking to address climate change and to capture co-benefits and align with national reporting.

## UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disability

Adhering to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability is vital to ensuring that our transition is just and does not harm. The UNCRD requires that action be taken to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity. Persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

In October 2024, the Irish Government approved ratification of the Optional Protocol to the UNCRPD, signalling a commitment to addressing inequalities for disabled people. The UN has highlighted that disabled people are among those most adversely affected by Climate Change and stresses the importance of including disabled people in mitigation and adaptation policy measures. This is critical to achieving a transition that is just, equitable and inclusive.

## UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)

The CBD was signed by 150 government leaders at the Rio Earth Summit and entered into force in December 1993 with three main objectives, 1) the conservation of biological diversity; 2) The sustainable use of components of biodiversity; 3) the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of utilization of genetic resources. During the fifteenth meeting of the conference of the parties (COP15) the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework was adopted and with it a significant milestone toward the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals was reached.

## EU Revision of Energy Efficiency Directive

In March 2023 the EU agreed to reform and strengthen the EU Energy Efficiency Directive. This is one of the proposals presented in the Fit for 55 and a step further in delivering the European Green Deal (the EU's long-term growth strategy to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050) and the REPowerEU Plan (the EU strategy to stop dependency on Russian fossil fuel imports).

The revision to the Energy Efficiency Directive has given legal strength to the requirement for EU countries to take energy efficiency into account in policy, planning and major investment decisions both in the energy sector and beyond. It established an EU energy efficiency target of 11.7% for 2030, requiring EU Member States to collectively ensure an additional reduction of final and primary energy consumption. There is also greater responsibility placed on the public sector to increase energy efficiency; they must take energy efficiency requirements into account for procurement of products, services and works in addition to a new annual energy consumption reduction target of 1.9% (baseline 2021).

The revised directive includes the first ever EU definition of energy poverty, putting a stronger focus on alleviating energy poverty and empowering consumers. Member States are required to implement energy efficiency improvement measures as a priority among people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers, low-income households, and where applicable, people living in social housing.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

Public sector progress on energy efficiency is reported by the SEAI in the Annual Report on Public Sector Energy Performance and this regular monitoring and reporting has contributed to the overall improvement recorded across the sector. Dublin City Council, along with the other three Dublin Local Authorities, have all recorded improvements in energy efficiency (DCC -41%) and reductions in energy-related GHGs (DCC - 19%), illustrating progress is being made however there is acknowledgement that the rate of improvement needs to be accelerated. With the greater responsibility being placed on public bodies, there is recognition that the level of support and resources made available to local authorities must be increased and rolling out

funding such as the SEAI's Pathfinder Programme will be important in this regard.

## Energy Performance in Buildings Directive (recast)

The Energy Performance in Buildings Directive was recast in 2018 and the amended text has been approved and is to be transposed into national legislation by a date in 2026. The provisions of the recast EPB Directive seeks to act as a catalyst for the phasing out of fossil fuels, increase in renewable energy, support the deployment of electric vehicles and bicycle use, as well as improving the Minimum energy Performance Standards in buildings. The recast EPB Directive differentiates between residential and non-residential buildings and places an onus on the non-residential sector to lead the renovation of building stock.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

Within the Irish context, the National Climate Action Plan 2023 assigned the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) as the lead coordinator for the National Building Stock Plan of the public buildings portfolio and the SEAI has issued guidance to public bodies in this regard. This action was initiated in anticipation of the EPB Directive's transposition and seeks to facilitate a critical review of the portfolios of public bodies across the country and achievement of a reduction in final energy consumption of at least 1.9% per annum and the renovation of at least 3% of the floor area of public buildings per annum. Local Authorities like Cork City Council and Dublin City Council are designated as National Portfolio Leads under the SEAI's guidance to drive renovation in public buildings.

## Nature Restoration Law

In July 2023 the EU passed the Nature Restoration Law. It is the first continent-wide and comprehensive law of its kind, covering wetlands, forests, grasslands, rivers, lakes, heath and scrub, rocky habitats, dunes, pollinating insects, forests, urban green spaces, agricultural ecosystems, marine ecosystems and river connectivity. Its objective is to restore ecosystems, habitats and species across the EU's land and sea areas. These actions will enable long-term and sustained recovery of biodiverse and resilient nature, contributing to achieving the EU's climate mitigation and adaptation objectives, as well as international commitments.

EU countries are expected to submit National Restoration Plans to the Commission and monitor and report on progress.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

Ireland voted in favour of adopting the law and 11 of Ireland's 13 MEPs voted in favour of the Nature Restoration Law earlier in the process in March 2024, with Ciaran Cuffe of Dublin constituency a key voice throughout its passage into law. In budget 2024, the Irish government set aside a €3.15bn Climate and Nature Fund to support implementation of nature restoration measures across the country. Under the Nature Restoration Law countries will have to develop a Nature Restoration Plan to achieve the objectives set out and a first step in that process has already been taking in Ireland with the establishment of a new Independent Advisory Committee on Nature Restoration. While the Committee will be taking a national perspective, having Dublin-based committee members may contribute towards nature in the city being appropriately recognised. The Chairperson of the Committee is Dr Aoibhinn Ní Shúilleabháin of UCD, who chaired the Citizen Assembly on Biodiversity and another UCD colleague on the Committee Professor Tasman Crowe, has undertaken research on the Dublin Bay Biosphere, as well as chairing the National Biodiversity Forum.

The challenge that persists is the financing and funding to realise nature restoration. Dublin City Council is taking demonstrable steps towards engaging the public on the value of nature restoration through biodiversity centres.

## EU Green Deal

The purpose of the EU Green Deal is to ensure at least 55% less net greenhouse gas emission by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels), no net emission of GHGs by 2050 and economic growth decoupled from

resource use, all under the principles of a just transition. To achieve these goals, the EU Green Deal encompasses transformational change across sectors: transport, industry, energy systems, built environment, nature restoration and circular economy.

## EU Mission: Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities

European cities can substantially contribute to the EU Green Deal target of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030. Cities take up 4% of the EU's land area and are home to 75% of EU citizens. Globally, cities consume 65% of the world's energy and account for more than 70% of CO2 emissions. The aim of this EU mission is to deliver 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030, acting as experimentation and innovation hubs to enable all European cities to follow suit by 2050. Using Climate City Contracts, portfolios of research and innovation projects and global knowledge exchanges, a network of national, local and regional authorities will support the cities transition to climate neutrality.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

Participation in the EU Mission provides the mechanisms by which Dublin City Council can accelerate partnerships to reach climate neutrality in a manner that is just and increases the city's resilience

## EU Mission: Adaptation

The EU Adaptation Mission supports the EU Green Deal and contributes to putting the EU's Adaptation Strategy into practice. Its objective is to accompany 150 European regions and communities towards climate resilience by 2030. The mission will accomplish this by helping the regions and local authorities to better understand, prepare and manage climate risks. In addition to testing and deploying innovation solutions needed to build resilience.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

Participation in the Adaptation Mission provides Dublin City Council with an opportunity to share knowledge and experience to insure the resilience of the city to climate change impacts.

## National Level Policy

## Project Ireland 2040: National Planning Framework

National Planning Framework under Project Ireland 2040, the overarching policy and planning framework for the social, economic and cultural development of our country. The National Planning Framework (NPF) is the Government's high-level strategic vision for shaping future growth and development in the country. The NPF seeks more concentrated growth with 50% of overall national growth to be targeted towards the five main cities, including Dublin.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

The objectives of the NPF to which all planning must accord with are as follows:

Guide the future development of Ireland, taking into account a projected 1 million increase in our population, the need to create 660,000 additional jobs to achieve full employment and a need for 550,000 more homes by 2040;
Of the 1 million extra people, 25% is planned for Dublin, recognised as our key international and global city of scale and principal economic driver; 25% across the other four cities combined (Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford), enabling all four to grow their population and jobs by 50-60%, and become cities of greater scale, i.e. growing by twice as much as they did over the previous 25 years to 2016, and with the remaining 50% of growth to occur in key regional centres, towns, villages and rural areas, to be determined in the forthcoming regional plans – Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs)
Enable people to live closer to where they work, moving away from the current unsustainable trends of increased commuting;

Plan for and implement a better distribution of regional growth, in terms of jobs and prosperity;
Transform settlements of all sizes through imaginative urban regeneration and bring life / jobs back into cities, towns and villages;
Co-ordinate delivery of infrastructure and services in tandem with growth, through joined-up NPF/National Investment Plan and consistent sectoral plans, which will help to manage this growth and tackle congestion and quality of life issues in Dublin and elsewhere

# National Development Plan 2021-2030 (National Investment Plan)

The National Development Plan sets out the Government's over-arching investment strategy and budget for the period 2021-2030. It is an ambitious plan that balances the significant demand for public investment across all sectors and regions of Ireland with a major focus on improving the delivery of infrastructure projects to ensure speed of delivery and value for money.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

In terms of climate action extensive efforts have been made to ensure that the NDP will support the Government's climate ambitions. For the first time in Ireland, climate and environmental assessment of the NDP measures has been undertaken, along with an assessment of the alignment of the plan as a whole with the ideals of a green recovery plan. Commitments are made to further reforms of the Public Spending Code and to the treatment of Energy Performance Contracts. Most significantly, €5 billion in additional carbon tax receipts over the period of the NDP have been allocated to increase capital investment levels in energy efficiency.

## Public Spending Code

The Public Spending Code is the set of rules and procedures that apply to ensure that these standards are upheld across the Irish public service. The Code brings together in one place all of the elements of the value-for-money framework that has been in force up to now, updated and reformed in some respects.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

As a public body, Dublin City Council, needs to ensure that we are getting the best value for the resources available to us. Critically we must ensure that, climate change considerations are part decisions on expenditure of public monies.

# National Energy and Climate Plan (Long term strategy)

National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) are the framework within which European Union Member States must plan their climate and energy objectives, targets, policies, and measures to the European Commission. Member States were required to develop NECPs on a ten-year rolling basis. Its aim is to outline our energy and climate policies in detail for the period from 2021 to 2030 and looks onwards to 2050. The NECP covers five dimensions of the EU Energy Union:

Decarbonisation
Energy efficiency
Energy security
Internal energy markets
Research, innovation and competitiveness.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

The NECP brings together the policies, targets, tools and associated material from across Government bodies and departments in one document. It is an opportunity to 'lock-in' a systems approach for climate action and to achieve lasting systems change.

## CAP24
#
Comhajria Cathrach
Shalia Aihu Clash
Dublin City Council
Climate Neutrality Action
Plan
O

Climate Action Plan 2024 was launched in December 2024 and is the third annual update to Ireland's Climate Action Plan 2019, and the first under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. The plan will implement the carbon budgets and sectoral emission ceilings as well as setting a roadmap of action to halve our emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. Accompanying the plan is the Annex of Actions, containing specific actions that are required to meet the targets set out in the plan.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

CAP24 was the first national climate action plan to contain a chapter explicitly outlining the role of local authorities in climate action. This represents a recognition by the Irish Government of the importance of local authorities in climate action. Notably the actions in this chapter acknowledge Dublin City Council and Cork City Council's participation in the EU Mission and provide a commitment to supporting both through the creation of a national mirror group.

## Ireland's Provisional Greenhouse Gas Emissions 1990 – 2022

Ireland is legally obliged to report data on greenhouse gas inventories to the relevant European and international institutions. The EPA is responsible for compiling and reporting this data for the period of 1990 – 2022 to the European Commission and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Due to the National Climate Objective and the associated carbon budgets, climate action plan review and sectoral reporting, the EPA published the provisional inventory data in July 2023 to facilitate the required monitoring and reporting processes.

These figures were based on the interim energy balances provided by the SEAI and the latest data from other data providers. The data is compiled using methodologies in line with UNFCCC reporting guidelines and include emission data from sources within the EU's Emission Trading Scheme.

The 2022 provisional total national greenhouse gas emissions (excluding LULUCF2) are estimated to be 60.76 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2eq), which is 1.9% lower than emission in 2021. Emissions are over 0.5% lower than pre-pandemic figures in 2019. Including LULUCF, provisional national total emissions for 2022 decreased by 1.8% to 68.07 Mt CO2eq.

The provisional national total emissions including LULUCF for 2022 and latest emission estimates for 2021 are 137.36 Mt CO2eq. This accounts for 46.6% of the first five-year Carbon Budget of the 295 Mt CO2eq carbon budget for the period 2021-2025. This leaves 53.4% of the budget available, requiring a 12.4% average annual emission reduction from 2023-2025 to stay within budget.

## CCAC Annual Reports

In the Annual Review 2023 the Climate Change Advisory Council stated that, "at the current rate of policy implementation, Ireland will not meet the targets set in the first and second carbon budget periods unless urgent action is taken immediately, and emissions begin to fall much more rapidly. Ireland's first task is to reduce and ultimately prevent emissions of greenhouse gases. To support this there must be effective and consistent engagement with communities, ensuring there is a fair and equitable transition, while building and maintaining public support and action."

The CCAC recommended the following:

Government must address areas of uncertainty in how Ireland will reduce its emissions. The sectoral emissions ceiling for the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry sector must be set, and it must be clear by how much each sector must reduce its emissions.
Government needs to identify and remove barriers to policy implementation by ensuring adequate funding and planning reform at scale and speed.
Key actions need to be implemented now to prevent longer-term damage and increased costs to society and the economy.
Government must adopt new approaches to address emission reductions, creating investment and enhancing skills across the economy, particularly in areas such as retrofitting and renewable

energy.

The establishment of a Just Transition Commission is recommended to ensure that Ireland achieves its climate objectives in a way that is fair and equitable and protects vulnerable people and communities.
The Government should support opportunities that reduce emissions and make Ireland better prepared for the impacts of climate change

## Relevance &amp; Impact

The CCAC under the legislation is tasked with monitoring Ireland's progress on climate action and providing recommendations on directions for achieving targets. Their assessment of local government performance is essential to understanding what actions need to be taken- the pace and scale.

## Carbon Budgets

Under the Low Carbon Development and Climate Act Amendment (2021) the Climate Change Advisory Council is responsible the development of Ireland's three 5-year climate budgets.

The first three carbon budgets cover the following five-year periods: 2021 to 2025, 2026 to 2030, and 2031 to 2035 (although the budget for the third period is provisional). All greenhouse gas emissions and all relevant sectors are included in the carbon budgets.

They are as follows:

: 295 Mt CO2 eq. an average of -4.8% for the first budget period.
: 200 Mt CO2 eq. an average of -8.3% for the second budget period.
: 151 Mt CO2 eq. an average of -3.5% for the third provisional budget.

Figure 16 Carbon Budgets

The above graph represents the proposed carbon budgets in the context of recent historic emissions, and the EPA "With Additional Measures" projections of emissions based on the implementation of the 2019 Climate Action Plan.

In 2018, Ireland's emissions could be broken down by sector as follows:

|  Waste | 1.4% | 3.7%  |

## Relevance &amp; Impact

Progress on staying within our carbon budgets will determine policy direction and actions needed.

## LA CCAP Guidelines

Under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, each local authority is required to prepare a local authority climate action plan for its administrative area. The plans are to be consistent with the most recent climate action plan and national adaptation framework. A set of statutory guidelines assist in the development of the local authority climate action plans, ensuring a consistent approach across local authorities while allowing for tailoring where required. The plans are to address, and integrate, mitigation of greenhouse gases, climate change adaptation and strengthened alignment with national climate policy, delivering effective local climate action.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

The guidelines provide direction for local authorities in the development and implementation of their climate action plans.

## National Adaptation Framework

The National Adaptation Framework provides the policy context for a strategic national adaptation response to climate change in Ireland. Under the Framework, the relevant Government Departments, Agencies and local authorities prepare sectoral and local adaptation plans. A second iteration of plans will be prepared under a new NAF approved in June 2024. The National Adaptation Framework sets out the national strategy for the application of adaptation measures by a local authority in its administrative area to reduce the vulnerability of the State to the adverse effects of climate change and avail of any benefits that may occur.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

Local authorities need to engage in the development and implementation of the sectoral adaptation plans. This is essential to achieving a systems approach and coherence across the sectors.

## National Waste Management Plan for a Circular Economy

The National Waste Management Plan for a Circular Economy has been prepared by the Local Government Sector arising from its obligations under the Waste Management Act. The Plan sets out a framework for the management of waste for the period 2024 – 2030 and adopts the Ambition of 0% Waste Growth for every individual each year for the lifetime of the plan. The Plan sets out targets for the reduction of waste from households, businesses, and the construction sector and includes targets for improved compliance on the segregation of waste and the reuse and repair of materials.

Core Policy 2 of the Plan relates to Climate Action and supports the delivery of the measures and actions prescribed in the Climate Action Plan to contribute to achieving the national climate targets. Circularity is a key driver of the National Waste Management Plan and is a common denominator across all sixteen focus areas in the Plan with associated targeted policies and priority actions for implementation.

# Relevance &amp; Impact

The National Waste Management Plan for a Circular Economy is where circularity meets climate action and where the benefits of improved practices on waste prevention and management will contribute to the achievement of Ireland's climate targets over the coming years. More work in this area is needed and progressing projects like A Connected Circular Economy, play a role in increasing the rate of circularity in all sectors to reduced "wasted" emissions.

# Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland' (2021)

'Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland' is the government's housing plan to 2030. It is a multi-annual, multi-billion euro plan which will improve Ireland's housing system and deliver more homes of all types for people with different housing needs.

The government's overall objective is that every citizen in the State should have access to good quality homes:

to purchase or rent at an affordable price
built to a high standard and in the right place
offering a high quality of life

The government's vision for the housing system over the longer term is to achieve a steady supply of housing in the right locations with economic, social and environmental sustainability built into the system. It is estimated that Ireland will need an average of 33,000 new homes to be provided each year from 2021 to 2030. The policy has four pathways to achieving housing for all:

supporting home ownership and increasing affordability
eradicating homelessness, increasing social housing delivery and supporting social inclusion
increasing new housing supply
addressing vacancy and efficient use of existing stock

The pathways contain actions to be taken by government departments, local authorities, State agencies and others. The pathways are supported by actions to enable a sustainable housing system.

# Relevance &amp; Impact

Dublin City Council is the largest landlord in the country and is simultaneously through the planning system a key stakeholder in the delivery of housing. Recognising that an existing building is the lowest carbon building DCC is prioritizing retrofit of existing social housing and adaptive re-use to meet the demand for housing, while insuring low carbon construction. Notably the primary industrial activity within the city's administrative area is cement production. Supporting this sector to shift to circularity, for example, ash from the Waste to Energy facility is provided to cement companies, and reduce energy use is critical.

# Building Control Acts

The Regulatory Framework for Building Control includes the Building Control Acts 1990-2014, Construction Products Regulations, Market Surveillance and Energy Performance in Buildings Regulations. The purpose of regulation in a civilised society is for the health and safety of the citizen and the protection of the environment.

# Relevance &amp; Impact

In this context the purpose of the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office (NBC&amp;MSO) is to promote a culture of compliance with the building and construction products regulations through a five-pillar programme which includes:

Education and training -31 building control authorities, professions and stakeholders involved in the building process.

## National Biodiversity Action Plan

Ireland is home to globally important populations of birds, fish, mammals, invertebrates, plants and fungi across a wide range of terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. The seas and coasts surrounding our island support vast colonies of seabirds, abundant fish and cold-water coral reefs, whales and dolphins, as well as rich algal and invertebrate communities. On land, there is a wealth of species in our mountains, peatlands, turloughs, woodlands, grasslands, lakes, rivers, and coastal habitats. Over 31,000 species have been recorded in Ireland and its surrounding seas and many more have yet to be discovered.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

Action for biodiversity has increased significantly in recent years, with a strong emphasis being placed on collaboration with landowners and local communities to enable a collective response to the challenge. A wide array of initiatives, projects and funding streams are delivering positive change for a range of habitats and species all across the country. Many actions for biodiversity are focussed on accelerating the restoration agenda and promoting the sustainable use of biodiversity. This will increase the resilience of biodiversity to climate change and support achieving the targets in the Biodiversity Climate Change Sectoral Adaptation Plan required under the National Adaptation Framework.

At EU level, the Multiannual Financial Framework (2021-2027) sets the ambition to provide a minimum of EU annual spending to biodiversity objectives, starting with 7.5% in 2024 and at least 10% in 2026 and 2027. It is recognised that biodiversity action within the EU requires at least €20 billion per year stemming from 'private and public funding at national and EU level', of which the EU budget will be a key enabler. This funding will be delivered through existing programmes such as the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), the European Regional and Development Fund (ERDF), the EU LIFE Fund and the Horizon Research and Innovation Fund

## National Policy Statement on the Bioeconomy

As part of Project 2040, and following a public consultation process the government published the first National Policy Statement on the Bioeconomy in March 2018.

Through this commitment the government recognises that the bioeconomy is crucial for decarbonisation, sustainability and circularity, while also providing an impetus to competitiveness and rural and regional development and employment.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

The key actions needed to expand the bioeconomy, as set out in the National Policy Statement, include: promoting greater coherence between the many sectors of the bioeconomy strengthening the development of promising bio-based products and growing the relevant markets for them accessing funding available at EU level as well as leveraging private investment

## Food Vision 2030

The Food Vision 2030 Strategy is a new ten-year Strategy for the Irish agri-food sector (taken to include primary agriculture, food and drink processing and manufacturing, fisheries, aquaculture and fish processing, forestry and forestry processing and the equine sector).

Its vision is that Ireland will become a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems (SFS) over the next decade. This will deliver significant benefits for the Irish agri-food sector itself, for Irish society and the environment. In demonstrating the Irish agri-food sector meets the highest standards of sustainability – economic, environmental, and social – this will also provide the basis for the future competitive advantage of the sector.

By adopting an integrated food systems approach, Ireland will seek to become a global leader of innovation for sustainable food and agriculture systems, producing safe, nutritious, and high-value food that tastes great, while protecting and enhancing our natural and cultural resources and contributing to vibrant rural and coastal communities and the national economy.

The Strategy consists of 22 Goals, grouped into four high-level Missions for the sector to work toward:

A Climate Smart, Environmentally Sustainable Agri-Food Sector

Viable and Resilient Primary Producers with Enhanced Well-Being

Food Which is Safe, Nutritious And Appealing, Trusted And Valued at Home and Abroad

An Innovative, Competitive and Resilient Agri-Food Sector, Driven by Technology And Talent

## Relevance &amp; Impact

The city plays a role in the food system and has developed a food strategy, Edible Dublin, with consideration to Food Vision 2030.

## Ireland's International Climate Finance Roadmap (2022)

Ireland's International Climate Finance Roadmap is an integral aspect of Ireland's climate policy, foreign policy and development cooperation. It forms part of Ireland's contribution to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, Agenda 2030 and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as we seek to deepen our partnerships towards an effective and concerted response to the global climate crisis. Ireland's climate finance contributes to the primary objective of Ireland's International Development Policy, A Better World, to reach the furthest behind first and to channel support to those most at risk of being left behind.

Ireland's International Climate Finance is primarily grant-based and targets developing countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, mainly through supporting climate adaptation actions. It is chiefly provided by the following Government Departments: Department of Foreign Affairs; Department of Finance; Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications; and Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Ireland's international climate finance is provided through the following primary channels: bilateral, via Irish Aid programmes at Embassy level; multilateral, via international climate and environment funds, Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and International Financial Institutions (IFIs); and via Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) working in developing countries.

## Relevance &amp; Impact

Understanding the landscape of finance in Ireland is necessary to identifying the levers needed for insuring adequate finance to achieve climate action. There is potential to learn from our development aid policies to apply within Ireland.

## Smarter Travel – A Sustainable Transport Future

Published in 2009, Smarter Travel – A Sustainable Transport Future set out a vision for transport to 2020 centred on the following key goals: (1) to reduce overall travel demand; (2) to maximise the efficiency of the transport network; (3) to reduce reliance on fossil fuels; (4) to reduce transport emissions; and (5) to improve accessibility to transport. Policy instruments in the sector can be divided into the categories of regulation, economic and fiscal instruments, information and education, and investment.

## Regional Level Policy

### Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy

The Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area, 2022-2042 has been prepared and published by the National Transport Authority in accordance with Section 12 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 2008. It sets out how transport will be developed across the region, covering Dublin, Meath, Wicklow and Kildare, over the period of the strategy and has been approved by the Minister for Transport in accordance with the relevant legislation.

### Relevance &amp; Impact

The Transport Strategy plays a key role in reducing emissions associated with the transport sector.

### Greater Dublin Drainage Strategy

Greater Dublin Drainage (GDD) is a project to develop a new regional wastewater treatment facility and associated infrastructure to serve north Dublin and parts of the surrounding counties of Kildare and Meath. As our population and economy grows, so too does the volume of wastewater. The amount of wastewater generated in greater Dublin is projected to increase by over 50% in the period to 2050. We must collect and treat this wastewater so that the treated water can be safely returned to the environment.

### Relevance &amp; Impact

GDD represents the next major step in the development of our wastewater infrastructure for Dublin and the surrounding counties. Once operational, the GDD project will have the capacity to provide wastewater treatment for the equivalent of half a million people living and working in this area.

GDD is a key part of Uisce Éireann's investment in new wastewater infrastructure in greater Dublin and will protect public health, safeguard our environment and facilitate growth to 2050.

## Regional Spatial Economic Strategy

The primary statutory objective of the Strategy is to support implementation of Project Ireland 2040 – which links planning and investment through the National Planning Framework (NPF) and ten- year National Development Plan (NDP) – and the economic and climate policies of the Government by providing a long-term strategic planning and investment framework for the Region.

### Relevance &amp; Impact

The RSES has been implemented in policy by way of review by local authorities in the region of all City and County Development Plans and Local Economic and Community Plans (LECPs), to ensure their consistency with national and regional policy. Key state agencies and sectoral bodies are also required to consider their strategies and investment plans in light of the adoption of the RSES.

## Dublin Region Air Quality Plan 2021

## Noise Action Plan for the Agglomeration of Dublin

The plans set out how the Council deals with local noise nuisances and complaints along with planning, development and traffic management issues in addition to the identification of priority areas and measures to help mitigate and manage noise from the relevant human activities contributing to the noise levels at those locations. In addition, the noise action plan also assesses the impact of noise on Quiet Areas [existing or new] and considers the measures that may be required to maintain sound quality at these sites. The plans do not, however, cover noise in relation to health and safety in the workplace, noise inside any means of transport, noise caused by military activities in military areas or noise from natural environmental sources, i.e. wind, waves, wildlife.

## City Level Policy

There are a range of plans, projects and initiatives that are interconnected and will contribute to our climate neutrality objectives. The relationship between these plans is illustrated by Figure 17 here at a high level the statutory plans must align with each other and inform the non-statutory plans. Statutory plans are required to go through a public consultation process. Going beyond the requirements DCC holds workshops and webinars to engage people and elicit their views.

# Land-Use Planning: City Development Plan 2022-2028

The Dublin City Development Plan (2022-2028) is a plan which sets out how the city will develop to meet the needs of all residents, workers and visitors. The aim of the plan is to improve the quality of life for its citizens, and make sure that Dublin City is an attractive place to live, work and visit. The plan's policies and objectives:

guide growth and development,
provide a strategy to achieve proper planning, and
Show how we will achieve sustainable development that is development that meets our needs now and won't comprise future generations meeting their needs.

Sustainable land use and compact growth are at the core of current national and regional planning policy in Ireland. The National Planning Framework (NPF) is the Government's high-level strategic vision for shaping future growth and development in the country. The NPF seeks more concentrated growth with  $50\%$  of overall national growth to be targeted towards the five main cities, including Dublin.

The NPF Strategy aims to support the future growth and success of Dublin as Ireland's leading global city of scale, by managing growth. The NPF projects that Ireland's population will increase by 1 million by 2040, of this approximately  $25\%$  will be in Dublin City and its suburbs. Managing this requires compact, smart, sustainable growth with  $50\%$  of new city housing constructed within the existing footprint of the city.

In response to this the Dublin City Development Plan 2022-2028 sets out key policies and objectives to:

promote the ongoing development of key undeveloped urban sites within the city
Reduce urban sprawl to outlying counties.
consolidate and regenerate key sites identified as Strategic Development and Regeneration Areas (SDRA)
Manage growth through the ongoing consolidation of existing urban lands and infill development
Target development of key regeneration sites and lands served by existing and planned public transport.

Specifically, our strategic approach to land use is based on the following principles:

To ensure that land-use zoning across the city spatially facilitates the aims of the core strategy and the objective to develop a compact, connected, low carbon, and climatically resilient city.
To ensure that land is appropriately zoned in order to accommodate the expected growth needs of Dublin City within the lifetime of the plan and to ensure the protection of community and social infrastructure, and critical ecosystems services, through the application of appropriate land-use zoning designations in order to provide adequate facilities and amenities to meet the growing needs of the city.
To provide for balanced and sustainable development by promoting, in particular, a mixed-use pattern of development with a move away from more traditional forms of single mono-use zoning.
To ensure that the most efficient use is being made of the city's land in line with the principles of the 15-minute city, and that the redevelopment of under-utilised and brownfield land is promoted in order to consolidate and add vitality to existing centres.
To promote the intensification of development adjacent and close to public transport nodes and corridors in order to minimise trip generation and distribution and to promote sustainable compact urban form.
To ensure that the city's zoned enterprise and employment lands are integrated with key supporting infrastructure to provide for more intensive forms of employment.

The Dublin City Development Plan 2022-2028 can be found here:

Critically a new requirement of planning permissions is the provision of Climate and Energy Statements:

Climate Action Energy Statements: In order to ensure that all future development integrates the principles of energy efficiency in the built environment and the use of efficient and renewable sources of energy, all applications for significant new developments, or for significant refurbishment projects, shall be required to submit a Climate Action Energy Statement as part of any overall design statement for a proposed development. This statement shall also provide outline information relating to the anticipated energy performance and CO2 emissions associated with the development as well as information outlining how the potential of district heating and other low carbon energy solutions have been considered in relation to the development.

This is facing challenges due to our GHG baseline lacking detail. This is the reason a detailed baseline is a priority. A detailed picture of emissions across the city, will enable us to assess the climate and energy statement received in a manner that ensures land use decisions align with our emissions targets and ensure that developers use renewable sources, follow circular economy principles, and sequester carbon through appropriate planting.

Supported within the city development plan are strategies that strive to increase the green cover of the city. The Greening Strategies for the Liberties, Stoneybatter, the North East Inner City (NEIC), and the Grafton Street Quarter (Heart of Dublin Public Realm); were specifically developed as these are areas where there are significant deficits of green space, for example in the Liberties, there is 0.7m2 per person, in Stoneybatter, there is 1.6m2, and in the North East Inner City, there is 1.89m2. The recommended amount is 20 to 25 m2. As such, increasing the amount of green space in these areas is essential. Works are ongoing in these areas and have been well accepted by the public. Two strategies are in the process of being implemented in the last 5 years, namely the Liberties Greening Strategy, which was published in 2015, and the NEIC Greening Strategy in 2018.

On foot of these strategies in the last four years, four new parks have been introduced into the city centre: Bridge foot Street Park, Wolfe Tone Square, Diamond Park, and James's Walk linear park. During this time upgrades have been undertaken in existing parks in line with the city's play strategy.

It is notable that our emissions baseline does not account for the increase in green cover across. As such we are working with academic partners to better understand not only the carbon sequestration potential but the improvements in air quality and water quality.

**Edible Dublin Food Strategy:**

Growing from Eat the Streets Festival, Edible Dublin is an initiative by Dublin City Council that will set out how we feed a City in a time of climate change. This strategy will follow the principles of a just transition; enabling us to work towards a city where all residents of the City have equitable access to nutritious food for their health and well-being, now and in the future.

Through this strategy we aim to: 1. Enable knowledge exchange between rural and urban areas, and between generations; 2. Work to improve food skills and knowledge, in addition to building a greater understanding amongst the public and businesses of food production, preparation, distribution and waste prevention; 3. Improve the health and wellbeing of the City's residents through better access. All of which will contribute to making the City and its residents resilient to climate change impacts on the food system.

To accomplish this, the strategy has developed four action areas:

## SUMMARY:

Growing from Eat the Streets, the Edible Dublin Food Strategy is a key action in Dublin City's climate action plan - Climate Neutral Dublin 2030. To nurture knowledge exchange, Edible Dublin's actions are based on four pillars:

) Healthy citizens, Healthy City
) Growing Food at Home
) Cooking and Creating
) Farm to Fork and Back

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

## ACTIONS:

Dublin City Council is collaborating with: Safe Food, the Health Service Executive, the Eastern Midlands Regional Waste Management Office, chefs, businesses, academia, Fáilte Ireland, Community Roots, Spade Enterprise Centre, Dublin Food Chain, Be46, Grow It Yourself, Airfield Estate, Pocket Forests, Comhairle na nÓg, Environmental Protection Agency. Food Cloud to realise a climate resilient food system that supports health and well-being.

## SUCCESS &amp; IMPACT:

Edible Dublin is the first food strategy to be adopted by Dublin City Council. Recognising that we all need to eat, Eat the Streets and Edible Dublin, have taken a creative approach to strengthen our relationship with food, that has nurtured a greater understanding and appreciation of where our food comes from, the impacts of our food waste and our dependence on the natural world around us.

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

## CHALLENGES &amp; OPPORTUNITIES:

Realising the Edible Dublin Food Strategy was possible because of opportunities that emerged from Eat the Streets. Dublin City is part of Milan Urban Food Policy Pact, UAEU (Urban Agenda for EU) Thematic Partnership on Food and CULTIVATE, participation in these initiatives provided the City Council with opportunities to exchange knowledge and share cultural stories and practices, that allowed the City Council to move forward and include food resilience as an essential climate action.

## NEXT STEPS:

The Eat the Streets Festival is an important part of Edible Dublin's development process and its ongoing implementation by providing an opportunity for local food enterprises and thought leaders to connect with the community and grow, cook, create and discover together. The City needs to continue to the grow Eat the Streets beyond the festival, into a year round programme to provide opportunities in every season.

## Community Climate Action Programme

Our Community Climate Action Programme demonstrates carbon reduction, community cohesion, enhanced climate resistance and better use of resources at the community level. The programme also demonstrates how knowledge support can strengthen the capacity for climate action and belief amongst our most disadvantaged communities that they can deliver positive changes in their own community.

With funds received from the Department of Climate and Communications, Dublin City Council will help community groups develop bespoke climate action projects which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, build climate resilience and transition to a lower carbon economy. Communities receive 100% funding for projects up to €100k in value, with communities encouraged to take a holistic approach to their actions by focusing on five thematic areas; Community Energy, Travel, Food and Waste, Shopping and Recycling (circular economy) and Local Climate and Environmental Actions (nature-based solutions).

## Citizen's challenges with CCAP

There is no 'one size fits all' when working with community groups. They can have different structures, knowledge base, experience, ambition and capacity to deliver projects.

Groups also have very different motivations; in respect of the Community Climate Action Programme these emerged as either a desire to save money, an opportunity to enhance community services or forward climate/nature related interests. Occasionally groups were driven by two and very rarely all three motivations.

In order to deliver the best possible outcomes, it is essential to have a complete understanding of each community group, their motivations, limitations, ambitions and their ability to deliver on their action projects. It may also be necessary to provide additional supports to help them achieve their aims.

Dublin City Council is committed to ensuring a just transition; we provided a grant writer with knowledge of the climate challenge and experience of community needs/desires and their limitations and who had the ability to communicate effectively. This was in addition to the services offered by the Community Climate Action Officer. The grant writer helped communities translate their ambition and desires into climate related actions and advised how these actions would support local and national targets.

Upon the successful awarding of funding specific community groups were offered additional supports in the form of a community champion with past experience in delivering projects, who would meet regularly with the community to help strengthen their understanding of climate change and provide advice and support to effectively manage their projects.

In delivering the Community Climate Action Programme we have identified barriers that led to groups failing to make an application or questioning their ability to deliver a project. These include but are not limited to the following; technology, primarily setting up an online account, saving or uploading information and not being able to view the application in full, confusion over what the application form was seeking, a lack of understanding of the climate challenge and how their proposed actions contribute to adaptation or mitigation, English as a second language or poor literacy skills, time availability due to other commitments, lack of strategic thinking when planning project delivery, limited mentoring support, funding challenges, primarily based on the model presented by the funding body which did not support the delivery of many of the actions or required volunteer groups to secure bridging loans and the ability or perceived ability of groups to deliver what can be a complex set of actions.

The Community Climate Action Programme is a strong model for engaging community groups and allowing them the opportunity, with support where necessary, to design bespoke climate action projects. For many this is the first time they have considered engaging in a climate action project and with the right model we can build their understanding of climate change and the actions needed to adapt to and mitigate against the likely impacts. In addition to implementing essential actions we will also strengthen our communities and by saving money these communities will be inspired to explore more opportunities to take climate action and in

## Transport

### Dublin City Centre Transport Plan 2023

Recognising that transport patterns are intertwined with land use patterns, and there is a need to ensure that places of employment, education, leisure and housing are well connected by high quality active travel routes and public transport to reduce emissions; DCC in partnership with the National Transport Authority, have published the draft Dublin City Centre Transport Plan 2023. The publication of this plan meets an objective of the Dublin City Development Plan 2022 -2028 which was adopted by the elected members in November 2022, and of the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area, as approved by the Minister for Transport in December 2022.

For transport DCC has set out very challenging and ambitious targets to be achieved, including a 40% reduction in general traffic and significant increases in walking, cycling and public transport. This will be achieved through reducing traffic in the city centre and shifting the design of the city centre so that public transport, walking and cycling being prioritised. The plan draws lessons from the response to the Covid pandemic whereby low traffic volumes allowed very ambitious changes to be undertaken in areas such as Capel Street, Nassau Street and along the North and South Quays. The traffic management changes envisaged as part of this plan aim to significantly reduce volumes of car traffic in the city centre, opening up space for the sustainable modes, and significantly improving the public realm by allowing greening and the development of new public spaces for residents, workers and visitors to the city centre.

## RELATED ACTIONS IN CND 2030:

## Public Realm Plans

In addition to our city centre transport plan, Dublin city has a number of public realm plans to College Green Plaza that will support active travel plans and greening strategies across the city.

## Greenway – Dublin Port

In 2024 a cycle and pedestrian greenway was created in the Northern Part of Dublin Port which offers viewing points overlooking the Tolka Estuary. Mature pine, willow and sycamore trees have been retained along the route and 200 specimen trees and over 5000 smaller trees and wildflowers plants added to create a new linear park with the intention of connecting visitors to our natural heritage, another 800m section will be added by 2026 and plans are in place to continue the green to link with a similar feature on the Southern end of the port.

## DART+ Programme Update

DART+ is the transformative programme that will ensure train travel is at the heart of Ireland's sustainable transport network. Funded under the National Development Plan by the National Transport Authority, DART+ is an investment that will double the capacity and treble the electrification of the Greater Dublin Area network, facilitating sustainable mobility and development to enhance quality of life in our capital and its surrounding counties. The overall programme will provide electrification of lines on DART+ West to Maynooth/M3 Parkway, on DART+ South-West to Hazelhatch and DART+ Coastal North to Drogheda. DART+ Coastal South will also see key infrastructure works as far as Greystones to allow more trains to operate.

The first new electric/battery DART trains are set for service in late 2024. These trains will use electrical charge as far as Malahide at which point they will convert to battery power as they continue as far as Drogheda where they will be recharged ready for the return journey. These trains will replace the diesel trains currently operating on this route.

Freight access from the hinterland is primarily achieved via road transport. With Irish Rail seeking to electrify its fleet which will reduce noise as well as pollution opportunities may exist to transport more goods via rail.

The Dublin Coastal Trail encourages visitors to explore the unique coastal towns and villages and engage with the wide variety of experiences on offer such as taking a boat tour on the bay, sampling local food or discovering a new location with a guided tour. The trail takes in a wide range of scenic features we have bordering our beautiful Dublin Bay; whether it be the Bull Island Nature Reserve, a haven of local and visiting wildlife, the cultivated charms of St. Anne's Park and Rose Gardens, or the historically rich treasure trove of Sandymount Strand, the Great South Wall and the Poolbeg Lighthouse all accessible to everyone from across the region by our DART and Commuter services.

## Built Environment :

Local authorities in Ireland provide social housing to individuals and families based national policy, set by the Department of Housing, Local Government, and Heritage. Specifically, the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the Regional Spatial Economic Strategy (RSES) emphasise the importance of achieving compact sustainable growth and accelerated housing delivery while promoting people's quality of life through 'healthy place-making'. It is a National Policy Objective (NPO 4) to "ensure the creation of attractive, liveable, well designed, high quality urban places that are home to diverse and integrated communities that enjoy a high quality of life and well-being". The NPF focuses on the link between public health/ community wellbeing and the physical design of the environment, recognising that health can be influenced by decisions on land use and the layout of the built environment.

Further, fostering sustainable communities is also an objective of the government's 'Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland' (2021), through government reforms of Part V and developing new guidance on achieving the most appropriate tenure mix within communities and new guidelines for Local and Economic Community Plans. Additionally, the National Climate Action Plans has set an objective of retrofitting social housing stock to a BER B2 or cost optimal to meet our National Climate Objective

As the largest landlord in the country, with a stock of 214 flat complexes and 10,000 houses, Dublin City Council has acknowledged that while it will be challenging to meet housing targets and climate targets simultaneously, this is an opportunity to demonstrate and set the standard for sustainable living. We will build on our experience with energy retrofitting to prepare our housing for climate change. Our flagship project will be Lower Dominick Street West. The first phase of this project involved the creation of digital twin to assess how we could meet national ambitions. Specifically, the national ambition to achieve a retrofit of 500,000 homes, and 36,000 social housing homes by 2030 may have higher carbon emissions costs if we do not fully consider embodied carbon and life cycle carbon. Dublin City's social housing presents an opportunity to fully understand the options available to us to achieving this retrofitting target at the least cost to the state, while meeting the immediate and pressing demand of providing social housing. The results of the digital twin demonstrated that deep retrofit represents both the least cost terms of capital and carbon. Building on this work, the second phase of this project will demonstrate climate resilient housing retrofit that enables and encourages residents to live sustainably with ease through the provision of, for example: green spaces to grow, play and create; shared spaces to meet and innovate; segregated waste facilities, renewable energy generation (solar PV, geothermal and micro wind generation where feasible), and mobility options (shared bikes, micro mobility and EV charging).

Beyond our own buildings key public sector bodies such as the Office of Public Works, Health Services Executive, and Third level institutions, have buildings (and operations) in the city that they must decarbonise, under the public sector energy efficiency programme. Since 2010, public sector bodies are required to report their energy management and performance data annually to SEAI. This was formalised under SI 426 of 2014. Reporting energy use requires that public sector bodies report energy management and performance against a baseline year. Data is provided for an annual cycle and entered into the M&amp;R, covering consumption by fuel type and drivers of demand. This information is then verified and validated by

SEAI assessors and used to produce a scorecard on savings performance for the year and for the 2020 target.

Dublin City Council's Building control team ensure that technical construction standards are applied and met, and as such are able to ensure that private residential and commercial buildings achieve meet building performance directives. Further, for existing buildings in need of retrofit Dublin City Council through Sustainable Energy Communities is able to drive private residential and commercial retrofit. Communities across the city are able to receive funding through Dublin City Council to development energy master plans that will help decarbonise their communities. Several of the city's SECs have gone beyond energy and have developed biodiversity plans and circular economy plans for their communities.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the regulator responsible for monitoring the quality of drinking water and enforcing drinking water quality regulations. Irish Water as the national utility is responsible for managing the delivery of water services to homes and businesses in Ireland. They are concerned with supply, quality and waste treatment. DCC is responsible for surface water drainage and flood management, and on the latter, we work with the Office of Public Works (OPW).

Water is supplied in Dublin on a Regional basis. The Region includes all of Dublin City and County and parts of Wicklow and Kildare. On a typical day, 540 million litres of water is collected from our rivers, cleaned, and made safe to drink at four main treatment plants. Three of these treatment plants are operated by Dublin City Council on behalf of Irish Water at Ballymore Eustace (Liffey), Roundwood (Vartry) and Ballyboden (Dodder). Treated water is delivered to the Region's 1.5 million customers through a series of service reservoirs and a network of 7,200km of underground pipes, of which over 2,400km are in the city. Most of our water is gravity fed however in some elevated areas pumping is required.

DCC continues to provide citizens with information on water and water conservation. Water conservation tips for domestic and commercial use are available on our website. Education on water treatment processes is also provided. The key message is that while Ireland may receive a high amount of rainfall, that water requires treatment before it can be consumed and there is a limited capacity. With climate change, our water supply is becoming more variable and as a result, DCC works closely with Uisce Eireann to ensure security of supply.

Ensuring security of supply requires maintaining water courses. To meet the Water Framework Directive (WFD) obligation of achieving 'good' status for all rivers, DCC has a number of ongoing projects to address both water quality and flood risk; these include a project to deculvert the River Camac, restoring the river to a more natural state over time is beneficial. The project will also involve identifying and remedying urban pollution sources. This is also being done in conjunction with an existing Greenway proposal, in tandem with Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) funded projects in the area. There is another project to restore the River Santry to a more natural state that will increase carbon sequestration potential in the city, while protecting properties from flooding.

Climate change is impacting on rainfall patterns in Dublin, which were previously low intensity long duration type rainfall events but are now shorter and far more intensive. The existing drainage infrastructure was not designed to deal with this type of rainfall and, as a result, there have been a number of localised flood events in recent years.

In response to this, DCC Flood and WFD Division in liaison with the DCC Climate Action Team has agreed that a number of nature-based water retention measures will be used at different locations across the city. These will have the dual effect of reducing the rate of surface water runoff into sewers, thus reducing the risk of downstream and local flooding, as well as improving the water quality of that runoff. Additionally, all public realm projects will include nature-based solutions to mitigate flood risk. We have produced sustainable urban drainage guidance for developers and householders.

## Waste:

Waste Policy is set by National Government and follows a polluter pays principle. Privatisation of waste removal occurred in 2012. In 2017, the Government announced a policy to discontinue the use of flat fees for household waste collection. The discontinuation of flat fees enables service providers to price services to

incentivize waste reduction and increased recycling. The government has established a Price Monitoring Group to monitor pricing throughout the implementation period and have agreed to an annual subvention payment to incontinence wear dependents.

The management and prevention of waste is undertaken by the EPA, regional offices, and local authorities. The EPA has a mandate through the Waste Management Act, 1996 to enforce laws related to environmental protection and to license waste facilities. The EPA collects and analyses waste data to monitor trends and inform policy. A recent national report on waste shows the following:

Ireland generated 3.2 million tonnes of municipal waste in 2020, up 4 per cent from 3.1 million tonnes in 2019
1.3 million tonnes of municipal waste generated in Ireland was recycled in 2020, resulting in a recycling rate of 41%
Of the municipal waste recycled in 2020, 959,100 tonnes went for material recycling (up 12 per cent on 2019) and 350,204 tonnes were composted (up 16 per cent in 2019)
A rounded 1.4 million tonnes, or 42 per cent, of Ireland's municipal waste went for incineration with energy recovery in 2020.
Ireland's landfill rate for municipal waste was 16 per cent in 2020, up slightly from 15 per cent in 2019.
39% of Ireland's municipal waste was exported for recycling or recovery in 2020.

It is evident that the reduction of waste is an ongoing challenge and DCC together with the EPA and its regional office, the Eastern-Midlands Waste Region (EMWR) must move towards a circular approach.

In this regard DCC has prioritized initiatives that promote the transition to circular economy through MODOS and is currently completing a feasibility study with Belfast City Council, investigating what is needed to create and support "A Connected Circular Economy" on the Island of Ireland that supports our collective transition to a zero waste and low carbon future.

DCC have developed specific programmes to support citizens in reducing their waste at the household and individual levels, for example:

Clothing Waste Prevention Pilot: Waste Management Services have created a new textile waste project that aims to prevent good clothing from becoming waste and support the transition to a circular economy. A new guide on 'How to Organise a Clothes Swap' was written to assist anyone who wishes to plan their own clothes swapping event. Community groups are also invited to borrow a 'Clothes Swap Kit' containing the equipment, such as rails, signage boards and hangers, they may need to hold this type of event. The new guidebook can be viewed or downloaded at https://bit.ly/DCCClothesSwaps.
Bulky Household Waste Collection Service: Dublin City Councils online bulky waste ordering system is now fully digital, and customers can now request and pay for a service collection 24/7 as the entire process is fully automated through the Citizen Hub Platform. Customers can now complete the ordering process from beginning to end including making secure payment without the need to go through our customer services department.

The City Development Plan also sets out the following in relation to constructions waste:

Waste Management Plans for Construction and Demolition Projects: To have regard to existing Best Practice Guidance on Waste Management Plans for Construction and Demolition Projects as well as any future updates to these guidelines in order to ensure the consistent application of planning requirements.

## Economy and Society:

A core goal of the DCC corporate plan is 'To work towards achieving a green, low carbon city'. This aligns with national policy, Innovation 2020, which sets out Ireland's vision to become a Global Innovation Leader, driving a strong sustainable economy and a better society. DCC recognises that achieving this requires collaboration with citizens. There are several departments through which DCC promotes the growth of the green economy and innovation, namely the Transformation Unit, Economic Development Office and Local Enterprise Office (LEO), Smart Dublin and most recently the Community Climate Action Programme.

## Local Economic and Community Plan 2024-2029

The LECP 2024 – 2029, for adoption in 2024, will set out the City's strategic goals for the City's local economy and community development, alongside yearly action-led implementation action plans. The focus of the LECP is on social and economic issues and goals that can be addressed by the City Council, local businesses, community and voluntary organisations and state bodies. The LECP is a key framework through which climate action interventions can be delivered.

DCC is in the midst of producing its statutory Local Economic and Community Plan (LECP). The LECP sets out high levels goals that drive the whole city's development. The LECP includes plans for the economic and community development of Dublin City. These two parts are interconnected and overlap in the high-level goals, objectives and actions. The overall aim of the LECP is to improve the quality of life and wellbeing of citizens and to develop and implement actions at a local level that will strengthen the community and economic dimensions of the City over a six-year period. The opportunity to have in-put into this early stage of the development of the Plan offers citizens and businesses the best chance of influencing the overall shape and outcomes of the Dublin City Local Economic and Community Plan and ultimately to ensure that Dublin City grows and develops in a manner that improves the quality of life for all who live, work, study in and visit the city now and in the future. The plan ensures effective utilisation of available resources, to support economic and community development initiatives in Dublin.

The Transformation Unit sits within DCC's Corporate Services and Transformation Department and is charged with the task of making DCC's services and operations more agile and responsive to a rapidly changing environment. The Transformation Unit oversees and drives a transformation programme for the organisation and works with departments who are implementing change. As part of its work, the Unit has undertaken a service mapping exercise which looks at how customers access services with a view to:

Developing a corporate approach to service delivery.
Standardising and simplifying processes.
Reducing duplication and inefficiencies by clustering complimentary services.
Prioritising services which should be delivered by the Customer Services Centre and,
Prioritising services for online delivery.

Economic Development and LEO are focused on enabling businesses to thrive in Dublin. The LEO combines the expertise of Enterprise Ireland with the broad reach of the Local Authority. The LEO develops local enterprise plans putting micro and small business at the heart of job creation locally. New Protocols have been developed with key agencies, such as Revenue, Dept. of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, Skillnets, Microfinance Ireland and the Credit Review Office to ensure citizens have access to all Government supports. Additionally, Economic Development focuses on providing guidance for new businesses and support for businesses in the city.

Social Enterprise Awards: DCC actively supports social innovation and social enterprise development. Most notably through the Dublin City Social Enterprise Awards.

Local Enterprise Week: DCC has sought to mainstream eco-innovation through hosting events during Local

Enterprise Week (LEW) and advocating that green growth and eco-innovation are on the agenda of supported event where possible. DCC has also sponsored and supported a number of relevant events. These include: Startup Weekend Sustainability (September 2018), and Fast Fashion Hack (February 2019). Partnerships: DCC has partnered with, and part funded the Profit with Purpose initiative which includes engagement and awareness raising, a Responsible Innovation Summit, a Business Spirit Award which highlights eco and social innovations among businesses, and the Profit with Purpose magazine.

## Sustainable and Smart Tourism

Another area in which we are integrating climate action in to is our Dublin City Council Tourism Strategy 2023-2028. The strategy sets out the following

Dublin is the most important overseas tourism destination in the country and tourism is a central pillar of the city's economy. DCC recognises it plays a pivotal role in the ongoing development of the tourism industry for the city, but also as a driver for tourism nationally. We will use this responsibility to work to ensure that we expand our value proposition as we implement this tourism strategy for the city. In this strategy, we have widened the scope of who we believe the Dublin tourism experience should include, and created the mechanisms to ensure that many voices, neighbourhoods and activities have an active role in its implementation and success. This ambition is supported by the new Dublin City Council Development Plan 2022-2028.

## Our Tourism Vision:

Dublin is a city where people, their places and the things they do are at the heart of a thriving and sustainable tourism offer. Visitors can include anyone, from anywhere, and tourism in Dublin can happen anywhere and be about anything. People value tourism as an important part of our social, cultural, environmental and economic health and experience Dublin as a safe and clean city where all visitors can connect to its many people, places and stories.

## Our Tourism Goals:

We have identified three goals that have shaped our tourism strategy.

Human: serves a people-centered and community-based growth agenda.
Sustainable: is proactive, accountable and measurable toward our climate goals.
Innovative: is future-facing, creative, collaborative and digitally-advanced.

## Our Strategic Tourism Pillars:

We have identified the following six strategic tourism pillars that will set the foundation for our new Tourism Strategy (2023-2028):

People
Places and Spaces
Culture
Climate Action and Sustainability
Innovation
Data and Insights

In order to connect our tourism strategy to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development, we have tied each tourism pillar to a specific Sustainable Development Goal. The SDGs we have connected our Strategy to are SDG No 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG No 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 12 Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns, SDG No 13 Climate Action and SDG No 17 Partnerships for the Goal. We have also adopted the UNWTO (United Nations World Tourism Organisation) definition of sustainable tourism to underpin this work.

# Climate Action and Sustainability

We recognise that enabling a more sustainable tourism industry is a key action toward achieving the goals of our National Climate Action Plan. We will also ensure that our tourism ambitions serve the broader climate aims and obligations within Dublin's City Development Plan 2022-2028, which are to develop a city that is: low carbon, sustainable, and climate resilient.

## To achieve this, we will:

**Embed** the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the UNWTO Sustainable Tourism definition within our tourism development strategies and frameworks. Dublin will become the first Irish city signatory of the UN Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism which will create a structured road map and reference point for achieving our sustainable tourism goals.

**Prioritise** our new tourism initiatives towards local and domestic visitors, which will have a lower environmental impact and distribute visitors throughout the breadth of the city.

**Implement** the Local Authority actions of the new National Tourism Policy.

**Promote** the success of existing sustainable tourism experiences, parks, venues and sustainable visitor movement and transport options. We will work toward recognised sustainability accreditation for Dublin City Council operated venues and visitor experiences reducing the carbon footprint of our tourism spaces in Dublin City.

## How do we know we have succeeded?

We have made meaningful progress in reducing our tourism carbon footprint in line with our climate objectives and goals as stated in the Dublin City Development Plan 2022-2028.

We have created new tourism initiatives to attract a mix of local and domestic visitors with the least impact on the environment and city resources.

We have increased promotion of our sustainable tourism products, such as our UNESCO Dublin Bay Biosphere as well as sustainable experiences and modes of transport through cooperation with national tourism and transport agencies and international tourism marketing bodies.

We have certified all of our cultural venues and visitor experiences with a recognisable and standardised sustainable tourism accreditation.

In developing the strategy Dublin City Culture Company engaged with DCC's Climate Action Team and further progressing work to support the hospitality sector be part of the journey by engaging with Earth Check to develop a baseline for the sector in the city.

## Smart Dublin

DCC's Smart Cities –Smart Dublin - initiative is proving to be successful in engaging private sector and academia in the development of innovative solutions to challenges facing Dublin. Through Smart Dublin, DCC is part of MasterCard's global 'City Possible' programme through which it piloted a new economic development platform to develop better insights into local economic performance. Smart Docklands DCC's flagship Smart District was created to provide a platform for start-ups, big tech, the city and academia to come together and innovate. It is No. 1 globally for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) strategy for Smart Locations of the Future by FDI Magazine. Smart Docklands has the support of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), Enable, Google, Autodesk, Vodafone, MasterCard, Microsoft, and Softbank

# Research and Academia

Dublin City is home to world class third level institutions that contribute to Dublin City Council's vision of creating a city that is dynamic, sustainable, future-ready, built on thriving, inclusive neighbourhoods and communities, a strong economy, a vibrant cultural life, and compact connected growth. As public sector bodies all third level institutions within the city are required to develop climate action plans that enable us to achieve our National Climate Objectives. However, their influence and capacity goes beyond the city. Students of third level institutions are the next generation of climate leaders in Ireland and globally. Third level institutions are keenly aware of their power and capacity to accelerate action well beyond the city. Being based in a city with ambitions, adds to their global influence.

Further the city's third level institutions have been supportive of Dublin City Council's ambitious to achieve climate neutrality.

By engaging effectively with third level institutions in our City, we actively respond to the Sustainable Development Goals:

SDG 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all' SDG 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable

For example, through DCU's MSc in Climate Change pilot capstone programme, DCC engaged with four students to work on projects in relation to resource management, fast fashion and textile waste, climate change education and community engagement in relation to illegal dumping in the NEIC. DCC Staff are now considering how to best apply the students' findings.

TCD approached DCC in April 2022 to pilot a sustainability focused internship programme. Over a six-week period beginning in August, eight students undertook projects with the law department, waste services, environment and transport, libraries and the arts office. Staff who engaged with students were impressed with the students and their capacity to deliver high quality work in a short time frame.

Through these partnerships we have not only been able progress vital work, but we have been given a unique perspective on the solutions to the challenges we face by the next generation of leaders.

Further, through Smart Dublin, DCC BETA Projects, and LEO, staff have been engaging with leading academic researchers to undertake projects that benefit the city

Building partnerships with third level institutions in the city has led to the actions in Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 under the Creative City Foundation which strives to expand these valuable knowledge networks.

A vital demonstration of the value of academic researchers is Dublin Bay UNESCO Biosphere Biodiversity Conservation and Research Strategy 2022-2026. The strategy sets out planned biodiversity conservation and related research actions of the Dublin Bay UNESCO Biosphere (DBUB) from 2022-2026. It aims, firstly, to provide a coordinated framework for biodiversity conservation and research activities to be undertaken by the Dublin Bay Biosphere Partnership; secondly, to provide clarity regarding these planned activities to all stakeholders within the DBB. It builds on the themes and objectives set out in the Periodic Review of the North Bull Island UNESCO Biosphere (DCC, 2014), which sets out the following vision statement:

"Our vision is to celebrate and promote a wider appreciation of the natural and cultural heritage of Dublin Bay, to capture the inherent passion of the community for the Biosphere concept and for the Dublin Bay Biosphere to be an exemplar for a new wave of Biospheres in the world network."

The strategy reflects the current funding model which is insufficient to maintain and restore natural habitats. To achieve this objective a comprehensive study detailing the state of current species and habits is required from which a detailed and thorough management programme could be developed.

A conservative estimate for a comprehensive survey would likely cost €200k with ongoing research and restorations projects estimated to cost €1-2.5m per annum.

The recent EU Nature Restoration Law, which was supported by the Irish Government, provides the impetus to deliver on this action and this could be supported by the recently established Independent Advisory Committee on Nature Restoration

Formalising our relationship with all third level institutions in the city will compliment and strengthen existing relationships while broadening and diversifying our engagement with third level in terms of disciplines and experience. Importantly, a formal approach would guarantee continuity of existing initiatives by building in redundancy to ensure a programme continues when a staff member leaves or retires.

## Creative Climate Action:

DCC has over the last four years engaged the arts and culture sector to engage communities across the city in conversations around community climate action, food and climate change, and active travel. The success of artistic practice in creating change has led to DCC's first biodiversity artists in residence programme.

These ambitious artists' residencies aim to transform Dublin City Council's Executive and Elected Members' ability to incorporate Biodiversity as an embedded value in their aims. Artist-led projects will originate from working within the council, exploring ideas and ways of thinking that will lead to innovative outcomes, from intimate encounters to building robust structures that support community engagement, empower and instil information sharing and project visibility by harnessing the transformative capacity of artistic thinking for change, positive action and deep understanding of challenges and solutions. Outcomes and artistic values will feed into the council's Climate Action Plan 2024 and onwards. This project is funded by Creative Ireland, through the Creative Climate Action Fund.

This project will be carried out over 24 months and will involve embedding artists in the organisation over three 'seasons', or distinct periods of six months, to support making biodiversity a key consideration in projects, and enabling DCC to reach their environmental and climate action goals.

Comments

The 95 Actions in Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 across the four foundations, implementation actions and operations and service delivery actions are those which are led by DCC. Many of the actions require partnership and collaboration with external stakeholders who are listed in the following sections. The 8 CNAP actions are led by external stakeholders, DCC is a collaborator and facilitator in the implementation of these actions, primarily through our steering group, challenges, and engagement.

CND 2030 Action – DCC Led:

Increasing the sequestration of carbon through greening strategies is priority for the city, as currently we do not have an accurate assessment of the land types and land cover in Dublin City to understand the impacts our greening measures have had on sequestration. In 2018 the percentage of the city's total 117 sq km approximately 17% green (~20sq km), based on our greening strategies and the target to increase available green space to 20-25sq m per person, this would see an additional 12 sq km of green space in the city.

CNAP Actions – DCC Supported

Codling Wind Park will produce 1300MW of renewable energy avoiding 1.7 million tonnes of CO2e per annum, its impact on Dublin City is not fully clear and will need further assessment, as the energy produced will be consumed at a national level. This project will primarily impact on built environment and IPPU. It will benefit transport and enable the transition to EVs.

Cement production is the only industry within Dublin City's administrative boundary. ECOCEM is actively decarbonising cement production Ireland and welcomed the requirement for a 30% clinker substitute in all government projects. This will extend beyond and have impacts on the construction sector as a whole.

Residential and non-Residential retrofit presents another challenge for decarbonisation. DCC plays a role in this through sustainable energy communities (SEC), and planning permission where applicable in terms of the technical side. Further, we play a role in behaviour change that can

support a reduction in emissions through encouraging less consumption.

Measures to improved public transport services are essential, DCC supports the delivery of Bus Connects, Dart+ and MetroLink to ensure that people have options to move through the city. We need to progress work to ensure that connectivity between these modes allow people to walk, cycle or scoot the first or last part of their journey.

# 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

This module aims to document the conclusions of a systems and stakeholder mapping aimed at identifying systemic barriers and opportunities. In conjunction with the GHG inventory and the policy baseline analysis in the previous two modules of Part A, the analysis reported here serves as a basis for designing actions that address these barriers or exploit the underutilised opportunities in Part C. The results of this analysis as provided here include:

A description of the main systems related to the city's GHG emission domains, e.g., technological/infrastructural, institutional/ regulatory, organisational, financial, political, social and behavioural systems.
A description of barriers and opportunities for each of the systems above. This includes gaps (infrastructural/ technological, institutional/ regulatory, organisational, political, financial, behavioural or social) as well as an evaluation of unexploited resources (e.g., renewable energy sources, digital technologies, etc) or circumstances.

# A-3.1: Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

# The System and Systemic Barrier(s)

The primary challenge to realising climate neutrality is silos. We began to build bridges between our silos through the implementation of our first climate action plan. Now we need to make sure that we use the bridges every day and build new ones to create as many opportunities as possible for connections to be made that allow us to exchange knowledge, ideas and to build skills and capacity. Critically, this will also us to create more resilient systems across the city – we need to build external bridges to ensure that we reach neutrality.

As has been demonstrated in the previous section there is a breadth and depth of plans that impact on capacity to implement effective climate action. Figure 20 has attempted to capture the relationship and influence of these plans and policies on the city by sector. The complimentary figure here, Figure 21 Sectoral Stakeholders and Level of InfluenceFigure 21 illustrates who the stakeholders are in each of these sectors and which level they operate. Green are at national level, red are regional and blue are at city level. It is complex, it is evident why silos persist. Notably there are organisations namely regulatory bodies that have a role in more than one sector, for example the EPA at the national level are responsible for environmental regulation across all sectors. At the regional level the Eastern Midlands Regional Assembly, shapes land use policy at the regional level and therefore has a role in all sectors. Ultimately the impacts and decisions made at the national level exert pressure down towards the city level, where the sectors and their policies meet and are translated into practice.

In certain instances, namely energy, the city council has no direct control in the generation and transmission of energy, except as consumer and can use our position to shape the energy sector. Reducing emissions is primarily the responsibility of the grid operators, yet, as the planning authority we have a role in enabling construction of renewable energy projects. What is clear is that while some stakeholders have technical responsibility, everyone has a responsibility to enable

the changes needed.

Removing this barrier of perceived "sole ownership" of a sector or an aspect is priority for climate neutrality, and to ensure that risks of carbon leakage, lock-in and maladaptation are minimised.

# Barriers to Opportunities – Systems Approach using health

We know that collaboration is needed to reduce emissions. Through implementing our first plan we began exploring ways to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and the use of systems thinking. We began applying health lens to our work.

# Triaging Our First Climate Action Plan

The Climate Action Team has since October 2021 has meet regularly with the Dublin Public Health team, on foot of Dublin Climate Action Week 2021. The meetings have been considering how health can be used as a narrative for climate action. An outcome of these meetings has been

the development of two tools – Climate Triage &amp; First Aid Framework and a Climate Readiness Toolkit, to support embedding a systems approach.

The Climate Triage Framework emerged from separate discussions around the EU Mission and how to monitor Dublin City's climate vitals beyond CO₂e. Climate Neutrality by 2030 or 2050 as per the National Objective is not a finite end point, but a state of existence that needs to be maintained by continuous monitoring, to understand what is working, what is not, and what needs to change. This is achieved by monitoring other factors that can provide insights. For example, a reduction in transport emissions could be achieved by banning all vehicular access to the city. However, this could result in poor air quality in other areas and carbon leakage. Another example is the roll out of bicycle lanes assumes that drivers will shift to becoming cyclists, when this does not happen, we wonder why. As such we need to monitor ex-ante and ex-post to understand the challenges that may emerge and how they should be addressed and by whom.

Further, in an emergency situation, individuals within teams have roles that are interdependent, and dependent on actions of others. Climate action is not dissimilar, and the concept of triage for climate action is not new. The Climate Triage Framework is intended to show the interdependencies and relationships between actions and climate risks, while serving as a means for identifying gaps and opportunities for further collaboration. Further, in the context of the Mission as a means for identifying needs for resources and partnerships to respond to climate change.

# Climate Triage &amp; First Aid

An emergency with potential mass casualties requires triage to prioritise action and monitor response. Climate change impacts and actions are compared to health responses, with statements like the "Planet is sick". If the planet is sick and the illness is climate change, then like any illness or disease, a treatment plan is required.

This process can be applied at the city scale and at action level. It is meant to be used in conjunction with the Climate Readiness Toolkit.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 22 Climate Triage Tool

# Climate Action Vitals

Climate mitigation action focus primarily on $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$, it is not the only measure of climate action success. Other critical vitals that provide important indicators of success are:

Weather patterns (rainfall, temperature) and events (frequency and intensity)
Air Quality
Water Quality
Soil Health
Biodiversity (Flora and Fauna)

Noise Levels
Population Health and Well-being
Social Cohesion
Economic indicators
Traffic volumes

Critically, each of these vitals should not be considered in isolation. Their 'health'/ status should contribute to the monitoring, assessment and analysis of an action, project, or programmes' contribution to climate objectives. (The Climate Readiness Toolkit in the Appendix 8 our new climate action plan Climate Neutral Dublin 2030, is intended to be used to support detailed monitoring and analysis of an action from inception to implementation and beyond). Returning to the example of cycle lanes, triaging we may uncover that safety is the number one concern that prevents people from using cycle lanes even those that are segregated, because unwanted driver behaviour is not policed.

## Climate Triage Process

Moving from the vitals, the triage process begins with a check for danger. In the context of climate change this is the hazards, risks and vulnerabilities posed by climate change to the city. Action F16 and F16a in the previous CCAP are focused on developing a methodology for assessing climate risks and the associated costs of adaptation, using a case study of the bridges crossing the Liffey. This informed the development of this approach.

Next steps involve assessing how are the risks are impacting on

A – the Vitals
Are they causing poor air quality, water quality, soil etc.?
B – Utilities, Networks,
Are they adding stress to water network, electricity network, communications networks
C – Road network, and Transport
Are they preventing movement through the city
D – Environmental Damage, Flooding, Biodiversity Loss,
Are the risks resulting in wide scale damage across the city?
Are we experiencing sudden onset climate events?
Are we experiencing slow burn events?

The assessment informs our actions, and continuous monitoring further determines the direction of action and what needs to be done.

Highlighted above, data is essential to monitoring climate action. Critically, data analysis that considers and monitors correlations between data sets will provide a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the impacts our actions on climate change.

## Prevention

Awareness and education initiatives are essential to enabling and empowering residents of the city and businesses to climate action.

## CCAP Triage – Collaboration &amp; Cooperation

### Internal

Applying a triage approach to our first climate action plan (Figure 23) and transport actions within that same plan (Figure 24) highlights the importance of a whole of council approach to the climate action plan. Every department has a role, and interdisciplinary collaboration is needed, as well as the need to collaborate with external stakeholders.

# Gaps and Opportunities to Address

Through this approach see the gaps and opportunities that are needed to address to become resilient to climate change and climate neutral. This list is high level and not exhaustive but has informed Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 and the strategic priorities of this climate city contract.

Data

How do use data sets to monitor and assess?
How do we collaborate with data owners (Met Eireann, CRU, ESB, Eirgrid, Uisce Eireann/Irish Water, NTA, NPWS)

Bringing coherence to legislation –
What are the contradictions and tensions that inhibit action?
How can community renewable energy projects be realised in the city, i.e. Croke Park and Aviva Stadium, by changes in legislation
How can farm to fork and back, circular food systems be realised?

Finance and procurement –
The mission provides an opportunity to access private finance, however, 'how' is the challenge. How do we unlock private finance in a transparent manner for public good, in a context whereas public bodies we are not in a position to access private finance – how do we make Dublin attractive to investors for the benefit of SMEs
Green Public Procurement as prevention?
Cost of Carbon
Environmental
What is the cost of not doing and continuing with the status quo
How can grants be conditioned to realise co benefits and drive behaviour change?

# The Approach for Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 and the CCC

Following our review and reflection on the existing plan (its development and implementation) as well as initial discussions with key internal stakeholders it was identified that the current plan needed to be consolidated and needed to embed more deeply a collaborative approach to achieve the systems innovation demanded by the Mission. We needed to move away from a laundry list of actions, to a strategic web of interdisciplinary and interdependent actions. The foundations were developed based on this recognition, and are hoped to promote interdisciplinary collaboration, as the five themes allowed for siloed working to persist.

To verify this, a staff survey was developed. The survey sought to understand perceptions of individual's and the Council's role in addressing climate change in the context of the Mission.

Staff were requested to complete a survey asking the following questions:

Based on your current understanding, what is the main objective of the EU Mission for 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities?
How do you see your role contributing to the EU Mission?
In your role, do you find that you have the resources (staff, support and finance) to implement climate action? Scale of 1 to 5
How do you see your role contributing to Dublin City's obligations under the Amended Low Carbon Development and Climate Act 2021?

Dublin being part of the EU Climate Neutral and Smart Cities is to you (choose max 3 options)
a. an opportunity to accelerate the green transition
b. an opportunity to embed climate action in our operations and service delivery
c. an opportunity to collaborate across the organisation
d. another project to undertake that adds to your workload
e. a challenge because we have limited powers
f. a challenge because we lack leadership
g. a question mark: you are undecided and need to learn more

What do you see as the opportunities for Dublin City in the Mission?
What are the barriers facing Dublin City in the Mission?
Do you have ideas on how these barriers could be addressed?

Actions, as with the first plan, needed to be developed through workshops and one to one discussions with teams and individuals with current responsibility. The workshops were also an opportunity promote collaboration, ensure the interdisciplinary nature of the actions and that actions have multiple co-benefits. A series of workshops with staff were planned to discuss and deliberate.

Foundations and Connecting Actions Review (in person)

Story Slam – Communication (in person)

Reaching neutrality by 2030 through the Mission will be a challenge but not impossible. The process will be iterative as the Climate Action Plan is a living document that will respond to science and changes in policy and legislation. We recognise, that its implementation will require ongoing engagement with staff through workshops, and external stakeholders to address capacity gaps.

Further Figure 23 demonstrates the necessity to work with all stakeholders in the city to drive this transition forward. Especially to build bridges across our silos to address the key barriers to acceleration which are policy coherence and cohesion; the absence of which has created increasing inequity and reduced the financial attractiveness of Ireland to investors.

The table below section A.3.2 provides a summary of stake holders and where they may be key in as levers in the various emissions domains.

Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and County and City Management Association (CCMA)

It is important to highlight two key stakeholders in local government in the Irish context. The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) was established in 2012 as an agency of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and is primarily funded by the local authorities it serves. The LGMA provides a range of professional services to all 31 local authorities and seeks to enhance and support local authorities with the delivery of their services. As local authorities have become more involved with leading and delivering on climate action within the communities they serve, the LGMA has sought to increase the support they provide to local authorities in this area. LGMA climate action initiatives to date have primarily been supporting decision-making, commissioning of reports and facilitating training.

The LGMA also work closely with the County and City Management Association (CCMA) on climate related reporting and guidance for local authorities. The CCMA describes itself as the representative voice of the local government management network, which is comprised of the chief executives of the City and County Councils, as well as assistant chief executives of Dublin

City Council. The CCMA are a non-statutory body that represents its members on relevant external committees and steering groups and in consultations with government departments. The strategic objectives of the CCMA are set by the CCMA Executive, which is comprised of eight local authority CEs. The CCMA also operate through committees acting upon specific areas of interest for the local government sector. While a case could be made that all of these committees have environmental and climate implications, the two committees explicitly dealing with these areas are the Climate Action, Transport, Circular Economy, and Networks Committee and the Water, Environment and Emergency Planning Committee. LGMA act as a point of contact for the CCMA for wider stakeholder engagement and provide support too.

It is important to note that the role of both LGMA and CCMA extend beyond climate considerations to incorporate the full range of services delivered by local authority such as those relating to finance and procurement, housing, HR and governance. Many of these areas can also have implications for the Net Zero objectives of Dublin City Council. Perhaps the most influential part of the work of the LGMA and CCMA are the decisions made at committee level. The LGMA have five committees and members are chief executives and Directors of Service from various local authorities, as well as representatives from relative government departments and other stakeholders. The CCMA committees take a "collaborative engagement and partnership" approach, and each committee has a list of partner agencies / state bodies / shared services. For example, the CCMA's Climate Action, Transport and Networks Committee lists the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC); Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH); Department of Transport (DoT); Department of Community and Rural Development (DCRD); An Garda Síochána; Mét Éireann; Environment Protection Agency (EPA); Office of Public Works (OPW); Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI); Transport Infrastructure Ireland; Road Management Office (RMO); Road Safety Authority (RSA); Climate Action Regional Offices (CAROs); National Broadband Ireland (NBI); Climate Change Advisory Council; Joint Utility Local Authority User Forum (JULA); Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC).

Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B represents the core of the CCC Action Plan, shaped by local authorities, local businesses, and stakeholders, comprising of the most essential elements: scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, action portfolios and indicators for monitoring, evaluation, and learning.

## 3.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Module B-1 “Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways” lists and describes impact pathways, early and late outcomes and direct and indirect impacts³ (co-benefits) according to and adapted from the NetZeroCities Theory of Change and the CCC Action Plan Guidance – clustered by fields of action.

List of impact pathways, selected from or inspired by the NetZeroCities Theory of Change, including early and late outcomes (strategic objectives) and levers of change structured along the fields of action.
Descriptions of the impact pathways, summarising their relationship with key priorities and strategic interventions and with the analysis developed in Part A

³ The NetZeroCities Indicator Framework, a set of indicators for monitoring direct and indirect impacts of the impact pathways may be useful when selecting impacts, as can the numerous Factsheets available in the Knowledge Repository on the NZC Portal.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

# Foundations for Achieving Our Vision

Achieving climate neutrality requires collaboration. Our plan is structured our four foundations A Resilient City, A Resource-Full City, A Creative City and A Social City that are connected by actions that are interdependent. (These actions are further supported by our operations and service delivery actions; all can be found in Climate Neutral Dublin 2030). These foundations were identified through internal consultation with staff through surveys, and workshops asking staff - who are a community within the city and represent people of different ages, gender and race, who have a lived experience of the city - what their vision of Dublin would be in 2030. Overwhelmingly, people had future visions of a city that is greener, has a vibrant cultural scene, and is safe to move around by foot, by bike, or public transport, and has restaurants that serve in season and locally grown food. That we are all proud of our city and respect it

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 25 Foundations and Actions in Climate Neutral Dublin 2030

To support systems thinking, and to briefly explain why actions are associated with multiple indicators, building on the experience of our first climate action plan we moved monitoring away from one action and one KPI to groups of actions monitored by a headline indicator and cross cutting indicators. This approach is further supported by the Climate Readiness Toolkit.

At present we monitor the emissions stemming from our operations and service delivery on a yearly basis and this is reported in our CCAP Annual Reports; based on analysis undertaken by Codema and reported to SEAI's public sector monitoring and reporting system. Our emissions were decreasing, and this was attributable to the increasing volume of renewables on the national grid. Citywide emissions are included in the National Inventory and reductions are not in line with targets. Further, the latest EPA projections show that Ireland as a whole is off target.

Further DCC has signed the voluntary EU Covenant of Mayors (CoM) for Climate and Energy. This

commits us to supporting the implementation of the EU 55% greenhouse-gas reduction target by 2030 and the adoption of a joint approach to tackling mitigation and adaptation to climate change. However, our actions on mitigation need to cover citywide emissions to align with the CoM. This needs to be addressed in our new plan.

As stated, we need to spatially link our emissions while also giving consideration to social, environmental and economic factors. This is work that we will achieve through partnerships with academia such as Terrain AI,

## Adapting to Climate Change

Making Dublin resilient to climate change is a target of CCAP, this calls for adapting the city and residents for a future where we live with the impacts of climate change, such as flooding, extreme temperatures, and extreme weather events, that are locked in and are prepared for the unknown impacts.

Uncertainty adds to the challenge of implementing actions that contribute to the city's resilience. Despite this DCC has made progress in the implementation of actions that contribute to our overall resilience, particularly in the use of nature-based solutions to respond to flood risk in the city. However, we have not adequately responded to other known climate risks, such as heat.

Further, the long-term challenge is ensuring that the adaptation actions we implement are just. The implementation of city development plan is vital to making the city and residents resilient to climate change. The decisions we make about land-use and land-use change will determine our adaptive capacity. The location of housing, employment determines our vulnerability and exposure to climate risk.

We need to map our hazards, risks and vulnerability and use this to inform our decisions and investments.

## Theory to Practice: Collaborative Systems Change

The process for developing the first CCAP was collaborative, though it focused on fostering internal collaboration. That was intentional, as was focusing on what Irish Local authorities are responsible for. The plans were criticized for not being ambitious but- you can't have systems change without an understanding of the current system.

We will need to take internal collaboration further and develop a deeper understanding of the barriers to our leadership in climate action, and identify the changes needed to enable ownership across the organisation.

We will need to realise our vision and mission by actively engaging residents of the city, academia, businesses and communities to achieve systems change that improves quality of life for all.

Climate mitigation actions focus primarily on CO₂e, it is not the only measure of climate action success. Nor does it capture the targets linked to climate adaptation actions. Other critical vitals that provide important indicators of success that are linked to our targets for a just transition, climate resilience and 51% reduction in emissions are:

Weather patterns (rainfall, temperature) and events (frequency and intensity)
Air Quality
Water Quality
Soil Health
Biodiversity (Flora and Fauna)
Noise Levels
Population Health and Well-being
Social Cohesion
Economic indicators
Traffic volumes

Temperature comparisons across the city to better assess the urban heat island effect
Measuring ground level Ozone
Aero allergens
Monitoring of disease vectors – mosquitos, flies, ticks, and invasive species.

Critically, each of these vitals should not be considered in isolation. Their ‘health’ status should contribute to the monitoring, assessment and analysis of an action’s, a project’s, or a programmes’ contribution to climate objectives. Appendix 8 of Climate Neutral Dublin 2030, it is also included in section provides a framework – Climate Readiness Toolkit – developed from health impact assessment, to enable us to collect data to assess our performance on these vitals and their impacts on each other, and our targets. However, as mentioned, monitoring is a means for collaboration, as data to assess our climate vitals is often held by stakeholders external to Dublin City Council

## 3.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

Module B-2 “Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design” contains a project description for each action planned in the CCC Action Plan. These actions include interventions targeted at creating/enhancing carbon sinks to address residual emissions.

The actions described here should not repeat the actions resulted from existing policies, and plans, outlined in Section A-2.1. Those actions are, by definition, not part of the proposed action portfolio.

A table of planned interventions grouped per field of action, including interventions by local businesses and industry (B-2.1).
An outline of each action. The table contains all information for implementation (e.g., topic, kind of intervention, emission sector, scope, allocation, responsible actors, GHG reduction by gases and estimated costs), including interventions aimed at addressing residual emissions (incl. carbon sinks) (B-2.2).
A summary of the actions and impact planned to address residual emissions (B-2.3).

Our food strategy sets out how we are working to ensure all residents of Dublin City will have access to healthy and affordable food by addressing the impacts of climate change on our food system from production and distribution to consumption and disposal. The implementation of this strategy requires partnerships to deliver on the four pillars: 1. A Healthy Citizens, Healthy City; 2. Growing Food at Home; 3. Cooking and Creating; 4. Farm to Fork and Back. | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes  |
|  Resource-Full City | RF1 - A Nature Full City | Nature provides us with resources to live and thrive. Delivering on our parks and greening strategies will increase the green cover of the city and improve air quality, water quality, and health and well-being. Prioritising green infrastructure that connects existing parks will not only improve the look and atmosphere of our streets making your commute more enjoyable, but will also provide pollinators, birds, and other animals with food and places to live. Ensure connectivity projects priorities ecological connectivity through complex hedgerow development and maintenance, while ensuring barrier effects such as inappropriate lighting are avoided. Providing the public with the opportunity to learn about biodiversity is essential to insuring that the nature based solutions we implement thrive. The Dublin Bay UNESCO Biosphere Discovery Centre and the Liffey Vale Biodiversity Centre, will provide people with the opportunity to learn about our natural heritage and how we can all take steps to conserve our environment. Natural heritage education will focus on challenging environmental perceptions to foster environmental stewardship through appropriately managed engagement with nature. All infrastructure projects under this action will have due regard to environmental sensitivities such as Archaeology, European sites, biodiversity and amenity value etc. | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes  |

|  Action outline | Action name | R1.1 Flagship project: Dominick St. Lower  |
|   |  Action type |   |
|   |  Action description | Project to offer sustainable best practice model of social housing, using learnings from the digital twin model.The Dominick St Estate was designed and built between 1960 and 1970 following demolition of former tenement housing. It consisted of eight flat blocks on the west and east side of Dominick Street Lower in the heart of the city centre. The new blocks were 'state of the art' and provided significantly improved living conditions for 198 families at the time. In 2010 Dublin City Council began a project to regenerate this estate due to ongoing issues with poor environmental conditions within the homes. The project was guided by a masterplan which prioritised sustainable place making. It included a site for a school, shops, a community centre as well as new apartments designed and built to meet the needs of old and young. The first phase of the regeneration – the east side - was completed in 2022 with a new apartment block and townhouses built to near zero energy building (NZEB) standard providing low-energy, bright, healthy homes. The masterplan envisioned similar redevelopment of the three blocks on the west side. However, with the need to reduce carbon emissions whenever and wherever we can, and recognition that 'The most sustainable building is the one we already have', City Architects with colleagues in the Housing Department decided to re-think the approach. • Challenges: While redevelopment of the blocks would enable construction of new homes with a very low operational carbon footprint, the carbon cost of demolition and construction could off-set any savings made in the operation of the building over its lifetime. The core objective of the Dominick Street Lower project is to develop an exemplar Climate Resilient Housing Solution to renovating Council flat blocks, which addresses current questions about retrofit and informs other renovation programmes (public and private).  |

|   |  Action description | Adaptive Re-use Programme converting existing buildings to 'new' uses such as social housing. The Adaptive Reuse Unit in the Housing and Community Services Department is creating new social housing apartments by adapting and refurbishing vacant office and commercial buildings in Dublin city. The unit is delivering along two of the pathways to a sustainable housing system identified under Housing for All: to increase new housing supply, and to address vacancy and efficient use of existing stock. The delivery of Adaptive Reuse projects demonstrates a commitment by Dublin City Council to proactively engage in implementing the policies of the City Development Plan 2022-2028 in relation to the refurbishment of the historic built environment, achieving reductions in vacancy and underuse of buildings, and promoting refurbishment over demolition and reconstruction of buildings where possible. As is often quoted “The greenest building is the one that is already built”. Recent research by the Irish Green Building Council in relation to delivering housing highlights the importance of using existing buildings to deliver new housing if carbon reduction targets in the built environment sector are to be achieved. With commercial vacancy rates increasing and property prices falling, it is expected that Adaptive Reuse of commercial and non-residential buildings will become an increasingly desirable option for creating new homes in Dublin city in the coming years. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH) has granted funding approval for four Adaptive Reuse projects in the Dublin City Council area. The acquisition of one of these properties, 14-15 Fitzwilliam Quay, Dublin 4, completed in March 2024. This is a former office building that will be converted to 15 apartments for use as social housing or affordable sale. Funding applications for two additional projects are pending approval by the DHLGH, and feasibility studies for six additional projects are underway.  |

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

As stated in our CCC improving our data capacity is a strategic priority for Dublin City and provides an avenue for collaboration. Data is an opportunity for co- creation, collaboration. Partnerships are essential to developing a detailed baseline and monitoring system to understand the impacts our actions are having on emissions, climate, and people.

Urban Sense, a pilot project between Terrain AI at Maynooth University, Microsoft, Cellnex, Edgieliot and DCC has seen the deployment of 20 sensors across residential and commercial areas in Dublin. The sensors, which measure greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, as well as air quality parameters and weather variables, will provide a real-time visual pulse of the city, reflecting differences in land use, seasonal cycle in vegetation growth, weather events and even hourly patterns of traffic moving in and around the city streets. DCC is keen to see how this partnership will strengthen our capacity to communicate the impacts of our policies. The challenge here will be scaling and financing the project in a manner that ensures public good remains at the core.

Further, DCC is also actively supporting the continuation of Terrain AI, a multidisciplinary research collaboration to understand the impact of human activity on land use.

Recognising the compounding challenges of climate change and the demands that emerge with a growing global population. Terrain AI is exploring innovative AI and computational methodologies in how we collect, fuse and model multi-thematic data in order to develop a better understanding of GHG exchange across our farms, forests, peatlands and urban spaces. These improved GHG monitoring methodologies and standards will be adapted &amp; scaled for other regions and countries across the globe.

Funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and Microsoft Terrain AI develops new cloud-based, automated work-flows and machine learning data toolsets for profiling and characterising environment types for more effective and precise carbon mitigation policies and practices.

Terrain-AI is advancing the standards of measurement, monitoring, verification and reporting of carbon stocks and emissions across complex environments. Researchers are developing innovative AI solutions and technologies, integrated with computational models, to provide more accurate estimates of carbon fluxes across scales, and a deeper understanding of the effects of human activities, to enable decision makers to develop more effective climate mitigation strategies.

Ultimately, Terrain AI is developing a rolodex of data sets, alongside a standardized cookbook for processing data that can be accessed by researchers and policy makers, to gain a deeper understanding of policy impacts.

For Dublin City, this presents an opportunity for delivering evidence based policy enriched by data insights that can tell a rich picture of the impacts of projects, programmes and plan.

Further, at the National level there are several initiatives that will contribute to an in depth understanding of emissions. Ireland has recently joined International Carbon Observatory System (I-COS, and the Irish Centre for High-end Computing is involved in Destin-E.

Following from this we expect the data to support the delivering of strategies to identify opportunities, namely green and blue carbon opportunities to sequester carbon. Further the data will support collaboration and co-creation by identifying areas that should be targeted and where a bespoke suite of interventions should be introduced that take into account the needs of the place. For example, we have identified the NEIC as an area that needs green space, simultaneously there are challenges with social deprivation and energy poverty. Terrain AI can support identifying cost-effective policies that bring individuals by allowing us to demonstrate with a digital twin the possibility of changes that address climate action and maximises co-benefits.

# 3.3 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

Module B-3 "Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning" contains a selection of indicators to monitor and evaluate progress along the selected impacts pathways and fields of action described in Module B-1. as well as a monitoring and evaluation plan, i.e., metadata on each indicator selected, in addition to milestones and timeline. More specifically:

An overview table listing the indicators selected per outcome and impact including targets and evaluation points (B-3.1);
A metadata table for each indicator selected (B-3.2).

|  COMMENT  |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|  To support systems thinking, and to briefly explain why actions are associated with multiple indicators, building on the experience of our first climate action plan we moved monitoring away from one action and one KPI to groups of actions monitored by a headline indicator and cross cutting indicators. See Climate Neutral Dublin 2030. This is further supported by the Climate Readiness Toolkit.  |   |   |   |   |   |   |

# Climate Readiness Toolkit

DCC's Climate Readiness Toolkit was developed with assistance from the HSE's Dublin Public Health team. It is based on health impact assessment, this is intentional as climate change is the single biggest risk to public health.

It is also a tool for monitoring our progress, by bringing together the various climate vitals, indicators and targets into a format that permits an understanding of their interactions with and interconnectedness to each other.

The toolkit will assist us in considering to the potential social and environmental impacts that our project aimed at mitigating climate risk and adapting to climate impacts may or may not have on health and well-being.

Greenhouse gas emissions of project in CO2e:

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

Embodied CO2e is all the CO2e emitted in producing materials. It's estimated from the energy used to extract and transport raw materials as well as emissions from manufacturing processes. The embodied carbon of a building can include all the emissions from the construction materials, the building process, all the fixtures and fittings inside as well as from deconstructing and disposing of it at the end of it's lifetime.

Operational CO2e is all the CO2e emitted during the operational phase, i.e. energy use.

Sequestered CO2e is all the CO2e that is sequestered through natural processes.

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

Avoided CO2e is the CO2e that would have been produced (embodied and operational) had the status quo persisted for example kms travelled by car had pedestrianisation or cycling infrastructure not been put in place. For example,  $100\mathrm{km}$  travelled by bike instead of car avoids 0.054 tCO2e.

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part C "Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030" aims to outline any enabling interventions, i.e., regarding organizational setting or collaborative governance models or related to social innovations – designed to support the climate action portfolios (Module B-2) as well as aiming to achieve co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Module B-1). These interventions also address the identified opportunities, gaps and barriers identified Module A-2 and A-3.

# 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

This module details the city's governance innovations for achieving city climate neutrality by 2030, describing innovations in institutional design, in leadership, and in collaborative and outreach processes, whether they are inter-organisational or internal to the key organisations responsible for the city's climate neutrality target. It also describes expected outcomes, for example how these governance innovations enable climate actions and their co-benefits (outlined in Modules B-1 and B-2), and how they address the opportunities, gaps and barriers identified in Modules A-2 and A-3. This content aims to include:

Descriptions or/and visualisations of a participatory / collaborative governance model to facilitate the city's climate neutrality target, including institutional design (horizontal links among city institutions, vertical links to other levels of government, roles, responsibilities, ground rules, processes). Building on the systems and stakeholder mapping in module A-3, it highlights the relations and processes established or planned to facilitate joint climate action among stakeholders and systems at relevant levels (e.g., showcasing new organisations, partnerships, alliances, networks, or processes), as well as mechanisms of citizen involvement.
Descriptions of how the governance innovations introduced or planned to reach climate neutrality address some (or all) systemic barriers and opportunities (Module A-3) and contribute to NZC impact pathways (Module B-1), e.g., through improving organisational settings and interorganisational models – horizontally within municipal administration and across local stakeholders in the city ecosystem, as well as vertically at regional and national levels.

# C-1.1: Description or visualisation of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

We recognise that Dublin's success is Ireland's success, and success requires that everyone is working together. How we work together to collaborate and co-create needs to evolve for us to succeed. Figure 33 illustrates the governance and policy structure that under pinned our first local authority climate change action plan.

Figure 29 Governance and Policy Context for first Climate Change Action Plan 2019-2024

In recent years, it has become clear that "change-as-usual" is not enough to address whole society problems such as climate change. Implementing change that improves efficiency but continues to allow us to work in siloes, will not enable us to meet our targets and realise the co-benefits of climate action that will improve people's health and well-being. In this context we developed our climate readiness toolkit to shift our ways of working to a more coordinated and collaborative approach to action, that is a whole systems approach. Figure 33 demonstrate how a triage approach might work for the city, with Dublin City Council teams being represented by blue ovals and the external stakeholders in red ovals. It is evident from this that an adaptive governance approach is needed to respond to the climate crisis, that hierarchical governance is not sufficient.

We know that whole society behaviour change towards more sustainable lifestyles is needed. To spark (and to nurture) change, systems need to be designed so that the sustainable choice is the most convenient. So that we make Dublin into a resilient, resourceful, social and creative city for all. We have identified implementation actions that need to be undertaken for our city's transition to a low carbon and climate resilient future are as follows:

IM1. Oversight by Steering Group: Proactive collaboration across internal departments, and with external agencies and organisations to implement and monitor the impacts of this climate action plan requires strong leadership from senior management. A Steering Group chaired by the Chief Executive to oversee the overall direction of progress and ensure that Dublin City Council, as an organisation is a leading light in decarbonisation, embedding climate resilience, facilitating co-benefits for climate and other environmental factors, and principles of equity in our operations and service delivery has been established. The Steering Group will ensure that internal structures are in place to foster ownership, accountability, and delivery of actions and projects are resourced; and provide quarterly reports to elected members via Strategic Policy Committees, and annually to the full Council.
IM2. Challenge Led Approach: Recognising the limitations of "change-as-usual", our Plan is taking a challenge led approach to foster better coordination and increased engagement; and to unleash the collective intelligence of a variety of actors impacted

by, and responsible for the change to be realised by our plan.

IM3. Monitoring: Without monitoring we will not know how we are progressing, what is working or not, and who we need to engage to implement changes necessary for climate neutrality. The actions in our plan are linked to headline indicators and sub indicators as well as our targets. Together the data from these indicators and targets provide a picture and a story of the impacts of our actions on quality of life in the city. Monitoring is also an opportunity for collaboration. (the need for data is evident in the triage approached illustrated by Figure 33, and is vital to informing the actions taken and in monitoring success)

IM4. Ireland&amp; Dublin&amp; You: Your active participation in the implementation of this climate action plan, which is about safeguarding our collective future is essential. We will keep you informed, engaged and active in this plan through our Climate Newsletter, events and reports to council.

# Citizen Engagement

We will continue to engage with the Dublin Public Participation Network which is part of a wider Irish network connecting groups and citizens with local authorities. There are three different strands within the PPN; environment, community and social inclusion. This structure offers the potential for direct engagement with community groups on a wide variety of topics.

Dublin City Council also works with Tidy Towns groups, offering support and funding for climate initiatives.

Direct contact and engagement are primarily done through our Area Offices, which offer a wide range of community supports and facilities.

C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

Three of the interventions are highlighted here as they are interconnected and serve to drive systems innovation across the organisation: OECD Challenge Led Approach, Biodiversity Artists in Residence, and Build CAPACITIES. Beginning with the work that is being undertaken by the OECD with DCC to introduce a challenge led approach into our implementation toolkit.

OECD - First Challenge – Children’s Movement Through the City

In recent years, it has become clear that siloed work is unfit for purpose. Triggering systems change requires, instead, an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach. While DCC staff in charge of the Plan see climate action as an opportunity for more interdisciplinary and proactive ways of working, DCC staff identified several challenges to embracing such an approach. These include:

Climate action is recognized as a responsibility of the City Council, however, greater clarity is needed on how to weave in to day-to-day tasks and responsibilities.
Staff are pre-occupied with ‘firefighting’ and with the public acceptance of transformative policies, they feel time is poor, and feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of the changes that the net-zero transition entails.
Day-to-day work practices and organization may hinder the staff’s capacity to contribute to the Plan as needed, e.g. very specific key performance indicators leading to a narrow focus and trade-offs between teams’ efforts.

The OECD will contribute to enable and build the capacity of DCC to embrace a challenge-led and systemic approach to the CAP implementation, as part of the organisations’ efforts to support Governments across the OECD in their transition towards net-zero.

DCC is in the midst of transforming how people move through the city and is striving to ensure that it is sustainable and designed for all ages. With the ambition to pedestrianize the city centre and build 310 kms of cycle paths over the next 6 years, public support and multi-disciplinary collaboration are vital, but challenging to gain and maintain.

In this context Dublin City Council’s first challenge focuses on children’s movement through the city, specifically their ability to move safely whether by walking, cycling wheeling or scooting.

With less than half of school trips done by active travel, allowing children to walk and cycle throughout the city can significantly reduce emissions. The challenge can also bring together efforts from multiple actors and shed light on the impact of mobility on children’s health (e.g. via better air quality, reduced obesity thanks to opportunities for physical activity), which can contribute to increasing public support for the on-going transformation.

# Biodiversity Artists in Residence 2023-2025

These ambitious artists' residencies aim to transform Dublin City Council's staff ability to incorporate Biodiversity as an embedded value in their aims. Artist-led projects will originate from working within the council, exploring ideas and ways of thinking that will lead to innovative outcomes, from intimate encounters to building robust structures that support community engagement, empower and instil information sharing and project visibility by harnessing the transformative capacity of art for change. Outcomes and artistic values will feed into the council's Climate Action Plan 2024 and onwards.

This project will be carried out over 24 months, and will involve embedding artists in the organisation over three 'seasons', or distinct periods of six months, to support making biodiversity a key consideration in projects, and enabling DCC to reach their environmental and climate action goals.

The residencies will support the Artists in the development of their practices by allowing them to explore opportunities within the city council that align with their work. These opportunities will be points of connection internally and externally.

These wide opportunities will be explored along with others that may be suggested by the artists in residence. It is envisaged that by positioning artists within the culture of the Council that these areas of opportunity will be further expanded.

A new biodiversity hub and Artist's Workspaces on Bridgefoot Street providing a working collaboration space to showcase the community and Council's new creative approaches.

## Projected Project Outcomes

Connecting to Dublin City's desire for systems innovation it is envisioned that this project will see :

Changes in behaviour and policy within Dublin City Council, making biodiversity a key consideration in any project, helping the council reach their environmental goals.
Community involvement in adapting their places to Climate Change
Information sharing (seminars, publications), partnerships (academic and cultural institutes), acting as a model for how Biodiversity can be centred within councils and institutions through the art
Delivery of projects over seasons that directly support Dublin City Council's Climate Action Plan - Climate Neutral Dublin
A roadmap on how to embed artistic thinking and practice into new areas of Council culture and problem solving

## Pilot City Activity 3 in Build CAPACITIES

The Pilot City project will include citizen engagement through innovative city governance. It involves regional, national and EU involvement. Through three pilot activities Dublin City and Cork City Councils will share learnings with each other and the broader network of mission cities, through the twinning programme. Through the project Dublin City Council will deliver an innovation sandbox in the North East Inner City focused on improving the climate resilience of the area in a just manner. Through the Pilot Dublin City Council will deliver a communication strategy – The Living Room – aimed at fostering collaboration and co-creation.

This strategy binds together the work with the OECD and Biodiversity Artists in Residence and further builds on a pilot of storytelling events used to develop Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 and this Climate City Contract. Dublin City Council staff were invited during the plan development phase to share stories of change, a shift in thinking and metamorphosis. Positively received these events have built relationships and provided valuable learning opportunities that Dublin City Council is keen continue to build internal capacity and external capacity.

Additionally included is our reporting process to elected members and engagement with citizens to 2030.

## Community Climate Action Programme

During the life of the programme and as programmes complete, we will share best practice via our social media platforms and website. We will also work alongside participating communities to help identify additional funding opportunities so we can build on the successes achieved as we further transition to lower carbon communities.

Further, ensuring continuous support citizens we anticipate building on the challenge led approach and working across the city on area specific challenges and bringing these communities together quarterly to share experiences.

# 1 Introduction

This opening section explains the city's motivation to join the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" and highlights the city's present commitments to climate action. It aims to include:

Brief background information about the Climate City Contract process, and a short paragraph on why the city decided to apply to join the Mission.
A reference to the city's highlights on climate action so far, including main developments and achievements, engagement with global or European initiatives, key local programmes, strategies and partnerships, as well as relevant processes¹.
Opportunities created through the Mission.

# Introduction

This is an excerpt from the introduction our local authority climate action plan that captures our vision for a climate resilient Dublin, and our ambitions for climate neutrality.

Dublin City is our home, the place where we create memories of the past and dreams for the future by living, learning, working and playing today. In our present day we know that the dreams of our shared future are in our hands. Take a moment, imagine Dublin City in 2030. It is only 6 years away and a lot can happen...

We see a Dublin City in 2030 that is flourishing. People living in the city are happy and healthy. Walking, cycling or using public transport to and from their homes that are powered by 100% renewable sources of heat and electricity; moving through the city is easy, seamless and safe!

We have a vibrant economy that is globally recognised for the diversity of businesses that make up Dublin's social and circular economy. Social enterprises are emerging, growing and are continuously innovating and building wealth in communities across the city. Employment and investment opportunities are abundant and sustainable.

Dubliners and visitors to the city experience our built and natural history. Sitting in College Green under the shade of a native tree, enjoying a meal made with locally sourced and seasonal ingredients they strike up a conversation with a neighbouring table about the buzz and the craic in the city...

Climate change is the greatest risk to our future. Through our local authority climate action plan, Climate Neutral Dublin 2030, we will take action to prepare our city and people living here for the known impacts of climate change – flooding, sea level rise, extreme weather events, drought – and the known unknowns – the intensity and frequency of events, and slow burn impacts. Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 will set out how we will mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and do our part to limit warming to below 1.5 C.

¹ These are further detailed in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (Module A-2: Current Policies and Strategies).

We recognise that the implementation of Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 is key. This is the beginning of an ambitious journey, one we know will not be without challenges. We will need to work together with our citizens, businesses, academia and national government.

Dublin City's acceptance into the EU Mission and now participation in the Mission for 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities has been a catalyst for us to realise a systems approach to climate action that we have been striving for since the development of our first plan in 2019, and the journey since.

# Journey So Far...

The journey to date has been marked by both successes, and challenges that Dublin City Council (DCC) has turned into opportunities. Beginning with our first climate action plan, below is a summary of our successes, and learnings that have shaped the journey and our new local authority climate action plan – Climate Neutral Dublin 2030, adopted by our elected members on February 12th, 2024 and launched officially on March 6th, 2024 along with the announcement of our projected led by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s Climate, Biodiversity and Water Environment Directorate and Mission Lab – "Towards a Transformative Climate Action Plan in Dublin".

# 2019 – The First Climate Action Plan

Dublin City Council Climate Change Action Plan 2019-2024 - Together with our neighbouring local authorities that comprise County Dublin, DCC published our first climate action plan under the National Adaptation Framework 2018. Going beyond the requirements, the plan responded to both mitigation and adaptation needs. The plans became the template for the local authority guidance that was produced to support local authorities in developing their statutory plans. Our plan set out how we would reduce emissions as per the public sector targets established by National Government to align with National Climate Objectives – namely a 33% energy efficiency target and a 20% reduction in emissions from 2008 levels. While we were successful in achieving our targets, the implementation of the plan provided lessons. Staff specifically felt that the plan was not strategic enough and needed to be more interdisciplinary and collaborative and critically strategic.

# Dublin Bay Biosphere Partnership

North Bull Island is the original site of the UNESCO Biosphere and is the most designated site on the island of Ireland. It was formed after the River Liffey was narrowed by the building of the Bull wall in the early 19th century, which led to the dispersal of dangerous sand bars, by venturi action. The natural circulation of local tides led to this dispersed material forming what we now know as North Bull Island.

In 1981, UNESCO recognised the importance of Dublin Bay by designating North Bull Island as a Biosphere because of its rare and internationally important habitats and species of wildlife. To support sustainable development, UNESCO's concept of a Biosphere has evolved to include not just areas of ecological value but also the areas around them and the communities that live and work within these areas.

In 2015 the Biosphere was extended to cover the whole of Dublin Bay, an area of over 300km² and with a population of over 300,000 people, in recognition of its significant environmental, economic, cultural and tourism importance. It is one of only a few biospheres within a Capital City and is an invaluable asset to the people of Dublin.

The Dublin Bay UNESCO Biosphere is managed by 6 Partner Organisations, Dublin City Council, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council, Dublin Port Authority, The National Parks and Wildlife Service and Fáilte Ireland. The steering committee is formed by

representatives from each partner organisation, bringing together a wealth of expertise to help manage the biosphere effectively.

Although the biosphere has strong governance structures and in recognition of its international importance, it would benefit from receiving financial support from central government, to effectively deliver on its essential research and nature restoration programmes.

Biospheres are places where nature and culture connect. They are internationally recognised for their biological diversity yet also actively managed to promote a balanced relationship between people and nature. A biosphere is a special designation awarded by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) but managed in partnership by communities, NGOs and local and national governments. The biosphere designation brings no new regulations; its aims are achieved by people working together.

- 2022 : The COVID years and the longest lockdown

WHO Breathe Life Campaign - Recognising the need protect and improve our understanding of air quality in Dublin, DCC committed to the WHO Breathe Life Campaign in early 2020. The first action after agreeing to this commitment has to incorporate air quality and climate action into the next City Development Plan and to continue incorporating both into all policies. In launching the Breathe Life Campaign with the Comhairle na nOg, (DCC's youth council) DCC has made a commitment to future generations to ensure that Dublin is a city with clean air, clean water and a high quality of life. Signing the commitment created an opportunity for DCC to progress its work on monitoring air quality and noise through Dublin City Air and Noise, our real time platform for air and noise quality in the city, with a partnership with Google Airview to gain hyper local data insights into air quality on in specific areas in the city. This work is continuing and is vital to understanding the health benefits of policies such as decarbonisation zones, low emission zones, lower speed limits, greening, and quiet areas. We know Dublin has good air quality we need to protect it, and to continue to work with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Health Services Executive (HSE).

COVID Mobility Programme - COVID provided the city with an opportunity to trial measures that support walking and cycling, and gain support for measures proposed. Through the COVID Mobility Plan, DCC was able to trial pedestrianisation over a wider area, which was well received, and led to the permanent pedestrianisation of Capel St, which was acknowledged by CNN Travel as one of the top 30 streets in the world and that was before its public realm makeover in 2023 with planting and seating added.

DCC has also had the opportunity to introduce interim protected cycle lanes along radial links to the city centre shown to have the highest number of cyclists. This has contributed to DCC's ambition to increase cycling by 300% and walking by 200%.

Further COVID showed the importance of public spaces in supporting health and well-being and access to these spaces. DCC recognised opportunity and importance of co-creating and collaborating with citizens in developing high quality spaces that not only support health and well-being but adapt the city to climate change, which is now a key focus of the work of our Active Travel Programme Office.

We also started a programme of school zones that has now become national policy – Safe Routes to School. Interventions included painting red and yellow circles outside schools and adding pencil shaped bollards to discourage parents from parking cars. We also produced a booklet to encourage the use of the space – Pawfficer JoJo – A three legged Kerry Blue Terrier, who likes cycling and walking around Dublin, asked students to share their experiences what they like and didn't like. This work is being progressed through our OECD project and our first challenge will be looking at children's movement through the city.

Dublin City Development Plan 2022-2028 – In our first CCAP we stated that our development plan would include a chapter on climate action. We achieved this (chapter 3) and ensured that our 2022-2028 development took an integrated approach ensuring internal coherence such that the plan considers how the city will develop to meet the needs of all residents, workers and visitors. The aim of the plan is to improve the quality of life for its citizens, and make sure that Dublin City is an attractive place to live, work and visit. The plan's policies and objectives: guide growth and development; provide a strategy to achieve proper planning; and show how we will achieve sustainable development, that is development that meets our needs now and won't comprise future generations meeting their needs. Critically the city development plan is a key policy for elected representatives and the executive to shape the development of the city and ensure that it is sustainable – economically, environmentally and socially. The plan introduced a new requirement for developers to submit energy and climate statements as part of their planning applications. This will enable us to gain a better understanding of how development patterns should and are changing the city's emission's profile. We are at the beginning stages of this work and it is strategic priority for us to building our capacity.

Finalist European Green Capital 2023 – Dublin City was one of 16 cities competing for the EGCA 23. While our application was unsuccessful, the feedback received from evaluators drew attention to the importance of for example, addressing the governance challenges facing the city in relation to water, waste, and energy, areas that require greater collaboration with external stakeholders. A lesson learned from the process was need for data that is robust, accessible, and detailed, and enables us to tell the story of the plans, programmes and policies we implement and their impact. This need has informed the development of our climate readiness toolkit, that is part of Climate Neutral Dublin 2030.

Creative Climate Action – Dublin City has citizens that are keen to do their bit. Sometimes though it is not easy bringing everyone along. Fortunately, the arts provides a unique way to make climate action approachable. DCC received funding from Creative Ireland to undertake a project with a creative focus to explore climate action and support behaviour change through artists-in-residence working on the theme of biodiversity. The artists will engage with our internal community of staff to embed biodiversity into our practices. They will also support staff in engaging with external communities. The proposal for this project was done knowing that the Biodiversity Artists' practices would support the objectives of systems transformation and radical collaboration in the EU Mission

Eat the Streets - Recognising that we all need to eat, a seed was planted for a food and climate change project - Eat The Streets! Now in its fourth year Eat the Streets fosters a dialogue on food security through conversations with Chefs, Food producers and citizens.

Crumlin Taking Action Together - Crumlin Taking Action Together, was another project funded by Creative Ireland that saw the delivery of several projects that supported local climate action, such as the Kingfisher Project a community garden along the Poddle River that is focused on food education and food security; and Clothes Swap Crumlin, a clothes swapping initiative that has now scaled up across the city, that has now expanded across the city.

Circular Economy Hotspot 2023 - DCC has participated in the development of the Dublin Regional Enterprise Plan to 2024 where we led on an objective designed to place businesses as leaders in the low carbon transition. From these efforts DCC, together with the Rediscovery Centre (National Centre for the Circular Economy,) and the Eastern Midlands Waste Region submitted a successful application to be the host city of Circular Economy Hotspot 2023. Hosting an international conference of scale provided the opportunity to show case small and medium sized Irish companies active in the social and circular economy striving to protect the environment while innovating. Further the event allowed DCC to progress our work with Belfast City Council on a Shared Island Funded Project a feasibility study that investigated how "A Connected Circular Economy" could be realised on the Island of Ireland. We are currently trying to identify sources of funding to further investigate the three emerging options from the study: Regen Ports which looks at how our ports

may provide infrastructure for circular economy innovation, Home which looks at material re-use in the housing sector from appliances and furniture to the building fabric; and Plate, which explores opportunities for circularity in the food sector (farm to fork and back).

Global Green City Award 2023 - Dublin City was awarded the 'Global Green City Award 2023' by the Global Forum on Human Settlements during their 18th Annual Session of the Forum in Dubai, a COP28 associated event. The 'Global Green City Award' has in the past been awarded to Vienna, Vancouver, Oakland, Curtiba, Nantes, Mannheim and Yokohama and now brings Dublin City into a group of cities that must continue to lead on the global stage and be active in our commitment to sustainable urban development that is green, fair, smart, and transformative. DCC's submission to the award was reviewed by a technical jury. The application was evaluated based on 85 indicators in key areas that determined Dublin City's performance in areas such as Sustainable Urban Development, Climate Action, Transport, and Nature based solutions. The award is a recognition of not only the work of DCC staff, but the people who live in Dublin and make this city what it is – vibrant, innovative, and resilient. This award marks a moment and signals that we need to continue the momentum and be global leaders.

European Capital of Smart Tourism 2024 - Dublin was awarded the 2024 European Capital of Smart Tourism a recognition of our commitment to deliver a greener, more accessible, inclusive and innovative Dublin, for both our visitors and locals. Our Smart Tourism programme, which was established in 2019 has been sharing, collaborating, and learning from some of the best cities in Europe and embedding this best practice in our own work through our new Tourism Strategy 2023-2028. There were 30 candidates spanning 17 countries with six cities short-listed: Bremerhaven (Germany), Cork (Ireland), Dublin (Ireland), Genoa (Italy), Helsingborg (Sweden), and San Sebastián (Spain), all had their submissions evaluated by an expert judging panel. Following this competitive process, the judging panel recognised that Dublin has embedded best Smart Tourism practices from across Europe through its collaborations with other cities and the publication of its first five-year tourism strategy with a strong focus on innovation. New experiences such as 14 Henrietta Street, EPIC the Irish Emigration Museum as well as digital innovations such as the Dublin Discovery Trails App separated Dublin from the other applicants. Dublin has also committed to sustainability by being the first Irish city to sign the Glasgow Declaration on Sustainable Tourism. Dublin also impressed the judges through its vision to become the world's first autism friendly city by 2026.

# The Start of 2024

Urban Sense Project - Pilot project measuring CO2 to support Dublin City achieve its ambitions as part of the EU Cities Mission to make 112 European cities climate neutral by 2030. This project is being delivered in partnership with Maynooth University, University College Dublin, Microsoft, Edgeliot, Delmec and Dublin City Council. It is a demonstration of how private sector, academia, and local government can work together and address a challenge collaboratively. Innovation through collaboration is the spirit of the EU Mission for 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities, Urban Sense is the first of many projects that will make Dublin a leader in using technology and creativity to address the climate challenge and become a climate neutral city by 2030

Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 – Our elected members adopted our new local authority climate action plan, which responds to our National Climate Objectives and is the starting point for our climate city contract as part of the EU Mission. The plan goes beyond the National Requirement in that the plan states that we will strive for neutrality by 2030, ahead of the National target of 2050. This means achieving a reduction in emissions of  $80\%$  from 2018. Critically, recognising that this ambition is only achievable through collaboration with all people living, working, and studying in the city it serves as a call to action for people to join us in making our city, our home, prepared for the knowns and known unknowns of climate change.

Community Climate Action Programme - In 2021 the Government of Ireland launched 'Climate Conversations' a core component of the annual National Dialogue on Climate Action (NDCA)

programme, with participation from 3,800 members of the public and community groups across Ireland.

The Climate Conversations 2022 and 2023 built on those discussions through enhanced stakeholder engagement, reaching those not yet engaged in the climate dialogue and populations who are particularly vulnerable to the transition. In 2022 and 2023 over 8,000 people across Ireland were engaged through the online consultation.

Insights from the Climate Conversations have guided the Government's 'Climate Actions Work' campaign which will establish a new social contract on climate action to empower everyone in society to actively participate in our transition to our carbon neutral future in a manner that is fair, equitable, and accessible.

The climate conversations highlighted a desire by communities to deliver local actions which supported government objectives. Many communities felt they had sufficient knowledge and voluntary support to make significant contributions towards the governments climate targets, yet lacked the financial means to deliver on their proposals.

In response the Community Climate Action Programme was created to provide communities with the financial supports they lacked. Dublin City Council will receive approximately €4m over a 3 year period to help local communities develop and deliver approximately 100 bespoke Community Climate Action projects, taking action under the following thematic areas 'Community Energy', 'Travel', 'Food and Waste', 'Shopping and Recycling' (circular economy) and Local Climate and Environmental Actions (nature based solutions).

To create awareness and support community engagement in the programme, Dublin City Council organised four workshops throughout the administrative area to share details of the funds available and offer advice on project design and management. These were followed by 4 online surgeries through which community representatives could seek further clarification and advice.

In response to feedback received from our most disadvantaged communities, a grant writer was commissioned to provide assistance to ensure they had equal access to the available funds. These communities also expressed concern over their lack of climate knowledge and project management skills. In response we've commissioned two community leaders from neighbouring communities to provide project management advice and support, whilst enhancing climate knowledge to our most at need communities should their funding application be successful.

The first phase of the programme saw over 130 community groups express an interest in this fund, with 80 making applications for almost €3.7m in funding. With €1,938,000 available we anticipate supporting 50 community action projects through the first phase of the programme

Edible Dublin: Food Strategy –

Growing from Eat the Streets Festival, Edible Dublin is an initiative by Dublin City Council that will set out how we feed a City in a time of climate change. This strategy will follow the principles of a just transition; enabling us to work towards a city where all residents of the City have equitable access to nutritious food for their health and well-being, now and in the future.

Through this strategy we aim to: 1. Enable knowledge exchange between rural and urban areas, and between generations; 2. Work to improve food skills and knowledge, in addition to building a greater understanding amongst the public and businesses of food production, preparation, distribution and waste prevention; 3. Improve the health and wellbeing of the City's residents through better access. All of which will contribute to making the City and its residents resilient to climate change impacts on the food system.

# Our Commitment for Climate Neutral Dublin 2030

As the city council responsible for the city, Dublin City Council develops and implements various statutory and non-statutory plans that shape life in the city. Dublin City Council's Corporate Plan puts forward our vision and mission for both the City, and Dublin City Council, as an organisation and the principles by which we will be guided in all elements of our work on climate action. The vision and mission that guides our work are:

Our Vision: A dynamic, sustainable city, that is future-ready, built on thriving, inclusive neighbourhoods and communities, a strong economy, a vibrant cultural life, and compact, connected growth.

Our Mission: To drive the sustainable development of the City through strong civic leadership and delivery of effective services that promote the well-being and quality-of-life of citizens and communities.

Being part of a community of 112 Cities determined to lead in the journey to climate neutrality, to achieve neutrality in manner that does no harm compliments and strengthens our vision and mission. The Mission provides a unifying narrative to bring stakeholders out of their silos to create systems change. We achieved change with our first plan. We understood that we needed to build bridges between our silos; necessary and essential to achieving neutrality. Now we need to make sure that we use the bridges every day, and build new ones to create as many opportunities as possible for connections to be made that allow us to exchange knowledge, ideas and to build skills and capacity. The Mission will enable this.

# Foundations for Achieving Our Vision

Achieving climate neutrality requires collaboration. Our plan is structured our four foundations A Resilient City, A Resource-Full City, A Creative City and A Social City that are connected by actions that are interdependent. (These actions are further supported by our operations and service delivery actions, all can be found in Climate Neutral Dublin 2030). These foundations were identified through internal consultation with staff through surveys, and workshops asking staff - who are a community within the city and represent people of different ages, gender and race, who have a lived experience of the city - what their vision of Dublin would be in 2030. Overwhelming, people had future visions of a city that is greener, has a vibrant cultural scene, and is safe to move around by foot, by bike, or public transport, and has restaurants that serve in season and locally grown food. That we are all proud of our city and respect it.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

This section aims to summarise:

The city's 2030 climate neutrality target, referencing the city's Mission Expression of Interest and any further thinking since then.
The administrative territories included in the city's 2030 target.
Where applicable, any districts or emission sources, sectors or gases within these administrative boundaries that are excluded from the target of climate neutrality by 2030².
An overview of co-benefits³ that the city will experience from increasing climate action and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.

# Goal

As with our Expression of Interest (EOI) to join the Mission, OI, our targets are focused on the administrative boundary of Dublin City Council. In the EU NUTS system Dublin is considered to include our neighbouring local authorities of Fingal County Council, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and South Dublin County Council, it is anticipated that as the four Dublin Local Authorities work together through the Dublin Metropolitan Region Climate Action Regional Office (CARO), that the territory will expand. Notably our neighbour local authorities face the same challenges, yet are determined to lead and achieve neutrality, well in advance of our national targets.

Being part of a community of 112 Cities determined to lead in the journey to climate neutrality, to achieve neutrality in manner that does no harm compliments and strengthens our vision and mission. The Mission provides a unifying narrative to bring stakeholders out of their silos to create systems change. We achieved change with our first plan. We understood that we needed to build bridges between our silos; necessary and essential to achieving neutrality. Now we need to make sure that we use the bridges every day, and build new ones to create as many opportunities as possible for connections to be made that allow us to exchange knowledge, ideas and to build skills and capacity. The Mission will enable this through the Climate City Contract process which will be key to bringing harmonisation to the of statutory and non-statutory plans, programmes and projects that shape the City by providing a shared narrative for co-creation and collaboration with citizens, academia, business and national government to achieve climate neutrality, and more importantly improving life for people.

The EU Mission for Dublin City Council and the city's is an opportunity to accelerate our ambition and transition to neutrality; critically ensuring we achieve our vision for the city (Figure 2), which is definite the development of our forthcoming Corporate Plan 2024-2029.

# Targets to 2030 and beyond

Our first climate change action plan covered the years 2019 to 2024. In the lifetime of our first plan we met and exceeded our emissions and energy efficiency targets for 2020. In 2021, it is estimated that DCC consumed over 161 GWh of Total Primary Energy, emitted over 30,500 tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  at an estimated cost of €11.4 million. While this is positive, a large proportion of the reduction is attributable to the increasing percentage of renewables on the national grid. An ongoing challenge is the thermal element, which has only recorded a marginal reduction in the same period

We aim to build on our first plan's successes and learnings. As with the first, this plan is a living document that will respond to the science (IPCC) and to changes in National and EU policy.

This plan covers the period 2024 to 2029. In this time, we will reduce our emissions by over  $51\%$  from the 2018 baseline ahead of the 2030 target and make Dublin City resilient without causing harm as set by National Government. Going beyond National requirements. We will also strive for climate neutrality (80% reduction), an ambitious goal that together with Cork City and over 100 cities across Europe we will work towards, by engaging our citizens. As will be highlighted in the next section and in the action plan is at present we are building our capacity to link actions to net zero target (80% by 2030). Due to data access issues our knowledge of emission sources and sinks is limited. For us, a strategic priority is building our capacity for data collection, management and analysis, and using data as an opportunity for collaborative partnerships.

As we know we have to do our bit for all sectors – Built Environment, Transport, Electricity, Industry, and Agriculture, and Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry, (LULUCF sector is made up of six land use categories (Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland, Wetlands, Settlements, and Other Land) and Harvested Wood Products), We now have an Amended act that requires us to meet new targets -  $51\%$  by 2030 from 2018 and Neutrality by 2050. While there are sectoral ceilings there is not a public sector target as there was for 2020. It is as a whole. In other words, our plan must enable all sectors to reduce emissions. Emissions from one sector are inextricably linked to another - Farmers need roads to bring food to the businesses that occupy buildings, which use energy transmitted and distributed by utilities under the roads, to cook the food that feeds you.

The Mission is a means by which together with Cork City we can increase the pace of Ireland's progress and enable climate neutrality by 2030. We know that as climate science advances and the understanding of the impacts of human activity on the planet deepens, targets will shift. Already the IPCC (2023) has stated we need to accelerate action to limit warming to 1.5 degrees.

# GHG Baseline

The overall emissions for the Dublin City Council area have been calculated for the baseline year of 2018 and are estimated to be 2,183,270 tonnes of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (tCO $_2$ e). Of this  $32\%$  is commercial,  $27\%$  is residential, and  $25\%$  is transport.

Acknowledging the assumptions held in the current methodology applied for the baseline, DCC is moving towards projects using whole life carbon assessments (embodied and operational).

Additionally to overcome a longstanding issue related to project funding – value for money – projects will also be considering carbon avoided as part of their assessments.

Our emissions baseline is provided in the CAP. We acknowledge that it is a starting point and are taking actions to address its completeness. A critical public service is ensuring that citizens are provided with accurate information and evidence, this is essential to building trust and relationships that are the backbone of collaboration and co-creation, necessary for climate action.

# National Context

DCC recognises that we have key role to play in reducing emissions in the National context, as we are home to over  $10\%$  of the population of Ireland.

For context - to illustrate DCC's awareness of the challenge ahead, - presently Ireland is off target even though there was a decrease in emissions of  $1.9\%$  in 2022 (EPA, 2023). In 2022, Ireland's GHG emissions were estimated to be 60.76 Mt CO2eq million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2eq). While the reduction is welcome, the latest report indicates that Ireland will not meet the National Climate Objective of  $51\%$  by 2030 (EPA, 2023).

While 592,713 people live in the city, our daytime population is 1.5 times this (CSO, 2022). The emissions from their commute, the goods and services they consume and their activities cannot be spatially constrained. Like people, emissions do not stop at county borders.

# More than emissions – Need for resilience

DCC acknowledges that Dublin City's success is Ireland's success. Therefore, Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 focuses on functions that DCC has control over and can influence and creating opportunities work with people to deliver systems change, This was intentional and driven by our participation in the EU Mission for 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities, Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 will evolve as we work with citizens, businesses and academia to exchange knowledge and ideas to develop innovative solutions to increase our city, our home's resilience.

Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 has three targets that are interdependent:

A  $51\%$  reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in line with our National Climate Objective by 2030, and and neutrality by 2050. We will achieve and exceed this using our participation in the EU Mission for 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities (Net Zero Cities) to accelerate this transition through collaborative partnerships and use systems innovation to realise opportunities, efficiencies and critically, co-benefits. Dublin City will achieve neutrality by 2030. (This means reducing anthropogenic emissions by  $80\%$  by 2030 through reducing consumption of fossil fuels and increasing sinks of carbon via green and blue spaces.)
A Climate Resilient City prepared for the known and unknown impacts of climate change
A Just Transition meaning that the actions we take do not cause harm.

The plan was developed to meet both the National Climate Objective and the EU Mission targets. Beyond these targets recognising that climate change is the single biggest threat to health and wellbeing, we anticipate that our plan will realise co-benefits that we will monitor and capture namely we will see improvements in:

Air Quality (currently measured through Dublin City Air and Noise)
Water Quality (measured by various stakeholders)
Soil Health (not currently available)
Biodiversity (Flora and Fauna) (currently not consistently monitored)
Noise Levels (currently measured through Dublin City Air and Noise)
Population Health and Well-being (data is at the National level)
Social Cohesion (survey – Your Dublin, Your Voice)
Economic indicators (quarterly - Dublin Economic Monitor)
Traffic volumes (monitored daily via Traffic Asset Management System)
Temperature comparisons across the city to better assess the urban heat island effect
Measuring ground level Ozone
Aero allergens
Monitoring of disease vectors – mosquitos, flies, ticks, and invasive species.

We need to improve our data collection and capacity for analysis. This will require data harmonisation and collaboration

Ultimately, for DCC participation in the Mission is an opportunity to improve quality of life for all people who live, work, study and visit the city. We know that this is achieved by engaging deeply with citizens and understanding how this work can improve their life as parents, business owners...

# 3 Strategic priorities

This section of the Commitments document summarises at least 3 or 4 strategic systemic priorities⁴ that need to be implemented in the city to become climate-neutral by 2030. The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan aims to describe in detail the expected pathways and actions (Part B) and enabling interventions (Part C) needed to achieve these priorities and how the city plans to implement them. The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Investment Plan further details the funding and financing for the expected pathways and actions. The individual commitments between the city and signatories (see Appendix 1) strive to address these key priorities and contribute to reaching them.

# Strategic priorities

Reaching climate neutrality by 2030 will not be without challenges for Dublin City the following at present have been identified as key priorities and objectives that underpin our capacity to deliver in the next two years.

Developing a Monitoring System: Data is essential to monitor and understand our progress in addressing climate change, both mitigation and adaptation. Yet the availability, reliability and robustness of data is a common challenge for local government and central government departments. Our partnership with Seoul Metropolitan Government and learning about TOPIS and their extensive smart city data platform, has shown us what is possible, when stakeholders collaborate under a shared value of creating a safe city. DCC operates in a different context, and the challenges with data are long standing with a breadth of owners and formats. As such a priority is to engage with data owners specifically the following.: Met Eireann, Health Services Executive, National Transport Authority, Environmental Protection Agency, Uisce Eireann, ESB networks, and those with data analysis skills namely our third level institutions in the city – Dublin City University, Technical University Dublin, Trinity College Dublin, and University College Dublin. Data is a mechanism for collaboration with the objective of developing a comprehensive data set that can be used:

To establish an accurate and detailed baseline that determines emission from metered energy use in buildings rather than using a synthetic model to estimate demand.
To inform and identify opportunities to co-create actions, projects and programmes; and
To monitor and evaluate the impact and progress of interventions via a Climate Vitals Dashboard that monitors GHGs across emissions domains; as well as weather, land use and land use change (incl soils); air quality, water quality and use, biodiversity, noise levels, traffic volumes, waste, energy, and an Interactive map of the city that houses data and provides details on projects and programmes being implemented across the city similar to Climate Atlas
To build relationships with stakeholders to achieve neutrality. Assessing our progress is an ongoing challenge. Data to monitor and understand our progress is both abundant and inaccessible. It is essential that Dublin City Council collaborates with data owners, and relevant stakeholders to collect and to analyse data in a coherent way that insures we are responding to the climate emergency in a manner that causes no harm.

Strategic systemic priorities are meaningful changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in the city, such as decarbonising the heating system in the city or generating 100% energy from renewables.

Figure 1 Data Platforms

Implementation of a Challenge Led Approach: We recognised that developing a plan is not sufficient to achieve our targets. We know that whole society behaviour change towards more sustainable lifestyles is needed. To spark (and to nurture) change, systems need to be designed so that sustainable choices are the most convenient options. So that in the transition to net zero Dublin becomes a resilient, resourceful, social and creative city for all. In recent years, it has become clear that siloed work is unfit for purpose. Triggering systems change requires, instead, an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach. Several challenges to embracing such an approach within DCC were identified. These include:

While DCC staff in charge of operationalizing the Plan sees climate action as an opportunity for more interdisciplinary and proactive ways of working, they feel that day-to-day work practices and organization hinder the staff's capacity to contribute to the Plan as needed, e.g. the way budget resources are allocated leads to competition rather than collaboration.
Staff are pre-occupied with 'firefighting' and with the public acceptance of transformative policies, they feel time is poor, and feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of the changes that the net-zero transition entails.
Day-to-day work practices and organization may hinder the staff's capacity to contribute to the Plan as needed, e.g. very specific key performance indicators leading to a narrow focus and trade-offs between teams' efforts.

To overcome these challenges the OECD will contribute to enable and build the capacity of DCC to embrace a challenge-led and systemic approach to the Plan's implementation, as part of the organisations' efforts to support Governments in their transition towards net-zero.

The project will run from October 2023 to December 2024. It will apply steps 1 and 2 to the selected challenge.

Increasing Green Cover in the City: DCC has developed Greening Strategies for the Liberties, Stoneybatter, the North East Inner City (NEIC), and the Grafton Street Quarter (Heart of Dublin Public Realm). These are areas where there are significant deficits of green space, for example in the Liberties, there is 0.7m2 per person, in Stoneybatter, there is 1.6m2, and in the North East Inner City, there is 1.89m2. The recommended amount is 20 to 25 m2. As such, increasing the amount of green space in these areas is essential. Works are ongoing in these areas and have been well accepted by the public. Two strategies are in the process of being implemented in the last 5 years, namely the Liberties Greening Strategy which was published in 2015, and the NEIC Greening Strategy in 2018. On foot of these strategies in the last four years, four new parks have been introduced into the city centre: Bridgefoot Street Park, Wolfe Tone Square, Diamond Park, and James's walk linear park. During this time upgrades have been undertaken in existing parks in line with the city's play strategy. The continued financing and implementation of the existing strategies and development of new strategies is required for achieving neutrality, building resilience and a just

transition. These strategies are vital to carbon sequestration, improving air quality, water quality, soil quality, and biodiversity in the city. (Note at present our emissions baseline does not account emissions for land use, as such we do not have an understanding of the sequestration potential of our city's green infrastructure).

Eat the Streets! Festival to Year Long Programme: While we are city, we still need the farmer to grow the apple that keeps the doctor away. Eat the Streets! grew out a desire to explore how we feed a city in a time of climate change, and led to our elected members requesting the development our food strategy Edible Dublin which focuses on four pillars:

Health Citizens, Healthy City
Growing Food Around Us
Cooking, Creating, Discovering
Farm to Fork and Back - Stopping Food Waste

Eat the Streets! is a co-created and curated festival that is guided by a steering group that includes: chefs, food producers, graphic designers, artists, Spade Enterprise Centre, Failte Ireland, Dublin City Culture Company, design thinking specialists, food business owners, and event management specialists. In nurturing this young festival over the last four years, DCC and our partners struggle every year to limit the content that we want to explore (you can explore here: https://www.eatthestreets.ie/). Given that food is daily necessity and the one climate action you can take three times a day, there is agreement that the Eat the Streets Programme is necessary to the delivery of Edible Dublin and the achievement of climate neutrality. It is therefore a strategic priority to develop this programme, and nurture the spirit of the project which is co-creation and collaboration that allows for radical ideas to be suggested and tested. As well as to bring the individuals and businesses in the food sector into our CCC.

Implementation of Dublin City Centre Transport Plan 2023: DCC, in partnership with the National Transport Authority, published the draft Dublin City Centre Transport Plan 2023. The publication of this plan is an objective of the Dublin City Development Plan 2022 -2028 which was adopted by the elected members in November 2022, and of the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area, as approved by the Minister for Transport in December 2022. The Dublin City Development Plan 2022-2028 sets out an aspiring vision for the city, and in the area of transport sets out very challenging and ambitious targets to be achieved, including a  $40\%$  reduction in general traffic and significant increases in walking, cycling and public transport. The overall transport vision in this plan is for a low traffic city centre with public transport, walking and cycling being prioritised. It draws lessons from the response to the COVID pandemic whereby low traffic volumes allowed very ambitious changes to be undertaken in areas such as Capel Street, Nassau Street and along the North and South Quays. As well as our experience in EU projects such as BEGOOD and Handshake. The traffic management changes envisaged as part of this plan aim to significantly reduce volumes of car traffic in the city centre, opening up space for the sustainable modes, and significantly improving the public realm by allowing greening and the development of new public spaces for residents, workers and visitors to the city centre.

# Pilot City Programme – BUILD CAPACITIES

Dublin City Council and Cork City Council's BUILD CAPA-CITIES (Behavioural Urban Insights and Lessons Deployed for Climate Action Policy Application –Communicated to Influence Transformative &amp; Innovatively Embedded Sustainability) project has been funded under the NetZeroCities Pilot Cities Programme. As Ireland's two Mission cities, this project is focused on unlocking the key barriers to systems transformation needed to achieve neutrality. Three pilot activities will strive to: 1. Incentivise staff to upskill and learn, 2. Improve communication internally and externally, 3. Nurture a culture of knowledge exchange and interdisciplinary collaboration and co-creation, 4. Contribute to systems transformation that does not harm and improves quality of life.

# Community Climate Action Programme

Our Community Climate Action Programme offers local communities the chance to develop bespoke climate action projects which meet the needs of the community and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, building climate resilience and transition to a lower carbon economy. These programmes are created by the community with advice and support from the Community Climate Action Officer (CCAO). This programme provides 100% funding of up to €100k to active community groups. Projects are required to be fully costed and include expected environmental, health and community benefits which will be realised by undertaking these actions.

In response to feedback received from our most disadvantaged communities, who were concerned about their lack of experience in applying for such funds, DCC commissioned a grant writer to provide additional assistance and support. Feedback from the grant writer highlighted a lack of climate knowledge and project management skills which would likely prevent the most at need communities from applying. To meet our just transition objectives and obligations, we commissioned two community leaders from neighbouring communities to provide the necessary support, aimed at building project management skills whilst developing climate knowledge to community leaders in our most vulnerable communities. The Local Authority will continue to provide additional support and resources to ensure all successful applicants deliver on their project proposals. The CCAO will also offer workshops and mentoring to unsuccessful applicants with the aim of enhancing their proposals in readiness for the launch of the second phase of this programme.

# 4 Process and principles

This section aims to briefly describe:

The systemic process⁵ the city will undertake to achieve its 2030 climate neutrality target.
The provisions for monitoring and joint learning⁶, including the intentions for updating the Climate City Contract.
The key principles that will guide the implementation of its Climate City Contract, such as climate justice, co-creation, multi-level governance approaches, stakeholder and citizen engagement.

# Process and principles

We recognise that Dublin's success is Ireland's success, and success requires that everyone is working together. How we work together to collaborate and co-create needs to evolve for us to succeed.

In recent years, it has become clear that "change-as-usual" is not enough to address whole society problems such as climate change. Implementing change that improves efficiency but continues to allow us to work in siloes, will not enable us to meet our targets and realise the co-benefits of climate action that will improve people's health and well-being.

⁵ Concrete actions to implement these processes are described in the annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (section C).
⁶ Learnings from monitoring your progress towards climate neutrality should be processed and shared with your transition team and stakeholders, in order to build a common understanding of how your Climate City Contract can be improved in future iterations.

We know that whole society behaviour change towards more sustainable lifestyles is needed. To spark (and to nurture) change, systems need to be designed so that the sustainable choice is the most convenient. So that we make Dublin into a resilient, resourceful, social and creative city for all.

We have identified implementation actions that need to be undertaken for our city's transition to a low carbon and climate resilient future are as follows:

IM1. Oversight by Steering Group: Proactive collaboration across internal departments, and with external agencies and organisations to implement and monitor the impacts of this climate action plan requires strong leadership from senior management. A Steering Group chaired by the Chief Executive to oversee the overall direction of progress and ensure that Dublin City Council, as an organisation is a leading light in decarbonisation, embedding climate resilience, facilitating co-benefits for climate and other environmental factors, and principles of equity in our operations and service delivery has been established. The Steering Group will ensure that internal structures are in place to foster ownership, accountability, and delivery of actions and projects are resourced; and provide bi monthly reports to elected members via Strategic Policy Committees, and annually to the full Council at a special council meeting on climate action The Steering group will lead in inviting new stakeholders to join the CCC on a rolling basis. The key stakeholders identified for the first six months are:

Third Level institutions in the City – As public sector bodies and partners in multiple EU projects, and their own commitments to decarbonisation and sustainability, they are natural partners in this journey.
Health Services Executive (HSE) – The HSE has support the development of Climate Neutral Dublin 2030, and see alignment with their own climate action objectives.
Utilities – Electricity Supply Board (ESB) and Uisce Eireann, who supply electricity and water respectively are critical stakeholders to the achievement of neutrality.
Dublin Port Company – A port is within the city's administrative boundary and is undertaking several projects to decarbonise their operations in line with National Objectives.
Diageo
Neighbouring local authorities

As new stakeholders join we will seek to amend our CCC and at a minimum update the CCC fully every two years. Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 is a living document, and provides an opportunity for new collaborative actions/projects to be specified.

IM2. Challenge Led Approach: Recognising the limitations of "change-as-usual", our Plan is taking a challenge led approach to foster better coordination and increased engagement; and to unleash the collective intelligence of a variety of actors impacted by, and responsible for the change to be realised by our plan. (to ensure that the approach is normalised it is simultaneously a strategic priority) Co-creation is a key component of our challenge led approach with local citizen playing a key role in the design process to ensure we meet local needs and achieve maximum buy-in. SharePoint and MS Teams offers easy access to cross departmental working by supporting multiuser access to document sharing and group communication. DCC is fully committed to supporting co-creation so that we can meet local needs to ensure we achieve maximum buy-in and use of infrastructure changes.

IM3. Monitoring: Without monitoring we will not know how we are progressing, what is working or not, and who we need to engage to implement changes necessary for climate neutrality. The actions in our plan are linked to headline indicators and sub indicators as well as our targets. Together the data from these indicators and targets provide a picture and a story of the impacts of our actions on quality of life in the city. Monitoring is also an opportunity for collaboration.

IM4. Ireland&amp; Dublin&amp; You&amp;; People's active participation in the implementation of this climate action plan, which is about safe guarding our collective future is essential. We will keep citizens

informed, engaged and active in this plan through our Climate Newsletter, events and reports to council. (accessed via our website, with email contact address to facilitate direct public communication and live updates linked to public health data). Our Community Climate Action Programme provides funding and support to enable local communities to design and implement bespoke climate action projects with additional measures taken to ensure our most vulnerable communities can avail of this opportunity. Further through a range of events that bring communities together like Eat the Streets, SoCircular we ensure we connect people to each other and encourage knowledge exchange and new partnerships

In collaboration with the other Dublin Local Authorities, the Dublin CARO and Codema, Dublin's Energy Agency, DCC develops and delivers a full programme of events for the annual Dublin climate Action Week. These engaging events bring the public and stakeholders across the county together to celebrate climate actions that are already underway, as well as offering space for consideration of new opportunities and initiatives.

Our elected members having adopted Climate Neutral Dublin 2030, we are on our way. We report every two months to the strategic policy committee for Climate Action and Environment SPC on progress, and annually to the full council. We anticipate that amendments will be made to CCC/Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 as we progress and invite new stakeholders to join us.

Figure 5 Refinement of CCC to 2030 Figure 5 provides an indicative schedule of iterative development of the climate city contract. Aligning city budgeting process in the fall, we endeavour to bring new signatories on board following the annual report and in advance of budgeting. Additionally included is our reporting process to elected members and engagement with citizens to 2030.

# Community Climate Action Programme

During the life of the programme and as programmes complete, we will share best practice via our social media platforms and website. We will also work alongside participating communities to help identify additional funding opportunities so we can build on the successes achieved as we further transition to lower carbon communities.

Further, ensuring continuous support citizens we anticipate building on the challenge led approach and working across the city on area specific challenges and bringing these communities together quarterly to share experiences.

⁹ Individual signatory commitments are concrete actions that will contribute to the overall climate neutrality target in line with the strategic priorities. The commitments aim to be as specific and targeted as possible. However, a signatory’s commitment can start as a broader agreement that gets refined and sharpened in each Climate City Contract iteration.
