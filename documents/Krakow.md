# Summary

The Climate Contract Action Plan is a document that comprehensively describes the pathway for Kraków to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

It is therefore a document showing the approach to the gap between ongoing and planned projects and the further actions needed to achieve climate neutrality.

The contract is based on the Economic Model prepared for us by experts from the Technical University of Madrid (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid) and data from our own Emissions Inventory, as well as strategic management documents at various levels, the City Budget and the Multiannual Financial Forecast.

The target adopted in the Climate Contract for Krakow is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2030 compared to 2018. A large part of the emission reduction (approx. 4 473 thousand tCO₂e) will result from actions implemented after 2018 or planned in strategic documents of the city and the Polish government. The contract includes a detailed description of an additional 58 actions that should be taken to achieve additional emission reductions of approximately 1,614 thousand tCO₂e. The cost of these measures was estimated at PLN 28,769 million.

However, the calculations of the Economic Model indicate that the total financial, direct and indirect benefits (reduced energy expenditure, health care, additional jobs, etc.) outweigh the costs of the transition. Emission reductions will overwhelmingly result from the implementation of national strategies, implemented by private actors: energy companies, businesses and building owners and managers. Eight key types of action on the road to climate neutrality:

Decarbonisation of the district heating system;
The development of citizen energy communities;
Renovation of municipal public buildings;
Modernisation of road and square lighting;
The construction of the metro and the development of rail transport;
Renovation of residential buildings and development sites;
Increasing resilience to the effects of climate change;
Involving citizens, entrepreneurs in city management.

The document shows what needs to be done to achieve climate neutrality for the city, while recognising the scale and complexity of the challenge and the difficulties that implementation may encounter.

# 1 Introduction

## Global challenges

The climate crisis is the result of global warming, resulting from greenhouse gas emissions at a rate not previously known in the history of the world. It is anthropogenic in nature and its main cause is the burning of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, oil). The climate crisis is deeply linked to lifestyles (the way we consume and produce). It stems from structural flaws in our economic system (growth based on resource exploitation) and social system (inequitable distribution of wealth).

Global warming is accompanied by an environmental crisis resulting from the overexploitation of natural resources. The earth is limited in size and resources, and economic development is based on their exploitation. We are facing the sixth great extinction of species, the scale of extinction is 1000 times faster than the average for the biosphere. Every hour, 3 species are disappearing worldwide. The main causes are the degradation and disappearance of habitats suitable for species, the invasion of non-native species in a given environment that displace native species, the proliferation of barriers in the form of roads or dams and the overexploitation of economically exploited species.

Another challenge is the social crisis resulting from the unequal distribution of earned value. Profits are captured by a small group of people. Social inequalities are growing. The poorest half of the world owns only 2% of global wealth, while the richest 10% own 76%, with the richest 1% owning 38% of global wealth. The bottom 50% of the population receives only 8% of the value of global income, while 52% of income goes to the 10% richest, with the 1% richest receiving as much as 19%.

The actions planned by individual countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will not be sufficient to achieve the targets agreed under the 2015 Paris Agreement. According to World Energy Outlook 2021 (WEO 2021) report, published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the commitments currently made to global efforts to meet climate targets cover less than 20% of the existing emissions gap that needs to be closed by 2030 to maintain the 1.5°C target.

## Kraków as a city of green innovation

Often referred to as the heart of Poland, Krakow is a city with a rich history deeply rooted in culture, science and art. Located in southern Poland on the Vistula River, as the second largest city in Poland, Krakow is one of the oldest and most beautiful cities in Europe. Its history dates back thousands of years, making it one of the most important cultural centres in the region. It was the former capital of Poland and the seat of Polish kings for many centuries, which contributed to its rich architectural and cultural heritage.

Krakow is also a scientific and academic centre, with as many as 23 prestigious universities, such as the Jagiellonian University, one of the oldest universities in Central Europe, the AGH University of Science and Technology, the Cracow University of Technology and the Academy of Fine Arts. It is a place where art, science and culture have flourished for centuries, attracting intellectuals and artists. Today, Krakow is also a dynamically developing urban centre that strives to reconcile tradition with modernity. It is also a

O

city that is making efforts towards sustainable development, aiming to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants while preserving its unique cultural heritage.

Krakow is also a leader in innovative solutions related to environmental protection and climate protection. Through the consistent implementation of programmes, Krakow aims to preserve its identity and care for the future, as do many other European cities. The fight against low emissions in Krakow began many years ago, and the city was a pioneer in Poland by introducing a ban on solid fuels in 2019. However, there are still many challenges for Krakow, including reducing emissions from transport, saving energy and developing green spaces to combat climate change.

The City's ongoing transformation programmes towards zero-carbon and green public space, such as the Clean Transport Zone and energy efficiency improvements in buildings, pose a major financial challenge for the local government as well as for residents and businesses. Consequently, the search for appropriate sources of funding is now a priority. As Krakow strives to become a zero-emission city, it must also deal with social and structural challenges and structural challenges, such as fuel poverty and transport exclusion. The development of low-carbon buildings and public transport can contribute to solving not only climate problems, but also social problems.

As a dynamically developing city, Krakow demonstrates that it is possible to harmoniously combine intensive development with respect for historical heritage. The city's programmes aimed at combating smog, segregating rubbish or developing green spaces are a step towards more sustainable development.

Despite the many difficulties associated with the lack of systemic solutions at national level, Krakow has consistently made efforts to reduce air pollution and modernise public transport. As a result, the city is becoming an example to other cities on how to effectively act to protect the environment and climate while maintaining the unique character of the place.

In the face of the growing climate crisis, the need for urban transformation is inevitable. It is necessary to mobilise the efforts of many communities including: citizens, scientists, entrepreneurs, local government, urban planners and many others, in order to adapt the urban fabric to a dynamic changing reality. Changes in thinking, attitudes and behaviour are required.

# Krakow in figures

Krakow is the second largest city in Poland in terms of population, with an official population of 771,069 in 2018 (the base year of the Climate Contract). Women (411,204) outnumber men (359,865) in the city. The city's area, however, is 327 km², which translates into a fairly high population density of 2358 persons/km². Due to a positive natural increase and a positive migration balance, the number of inhabitants is increasing year on year.

Kraków is also a city of prospects. The unemployment rate in 2018 was just 2.4% (2.3% in 2022). In 2018, around 140,500 companies were registered (around 168,000 in 2022) and the city has more than 4,500 commercial companies with foreign capital. Important sectors that stand out economically are tourism, university activities and cultural activities.
Kraków

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

O

The largest sector generating emissions (around 93%) in the city is the provision of electricity and heat to buildings. It is worth noting at this point that less than 700 public buildings are at the disposal of the municipality (about 0.6% of all buildings in the city) and they are being successively thermo-modernised and equipped with RES installations. The remaining emissions are generated by transport (about 7%) and, to a small extent, waste management.

In order to achieve zero emissions for all buildings in the city, it is necessary to involve other actors: private property owners, entrepreneurs or housing associations that can significantly change the unfavourable balance of emissions.

# Krakow's impetus for action

In 2021, Krakow's first citizen assembly, the Krakow Climate Assembly, was held to discuss climate change and the city's climate neutrality. It was attended by a group of citizens, representative of the whole city in terms of socio-demographic and spatial characteristics: gender, age group, district of residence and education level. The aim of the Climate Assembly was:

increasing the focus of public awareness discussions around the climate crisis;
to build a climate transition supportive community of: residents, experts, community organisations and businesses;
gathering a pool of ideas on energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy;
to obtain recommendations for joint action by the city and residents;
gaining broad acceptance for the city's transformation efforts.

The Krakow Climate Assembly was a success. The result of its work was the development 32 high quality recommendations which, according to the adopted assumptions, are binding for the Mayor of the City of Krakow.

Recommendations concern many areas of city functioning. They are often interdisciplinary and cross-cutting in nature, which is why many municipal departments, teams and units are involved in their implementation. Their scope and subject matter vary, hence each requires an individual approach and planning as well as the provision of financial resources for their implementation.

The first and most important recommendation adopted by the Climate Assembly is to develop a Climate Strategy for Krakow. This objective underlines Krakow's ambition to achieve climate neutrality as soon as possible. The strategy is to be developed in a participatory manner and the work on its creation and implementation should be coordinated by a team or unit specially appointed by the Mayor. The progress of the work is to be reported annually, and the Strategy is to be regularly evaluated in order to adapt the objectives described in it and the adopted paths of action to current scientific knowledge and technological possibilities, provided that the adopted objectives are not lowered.

To this end, the City of Krakow has decided to join the Mission of 100 Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 and to develop a Climate Contract, which is the aforementioned Climate Strategy for Krakow.

In addition, Krakow always takes into account the voices of diverse groups of citizens when preparing key documents for the development of the city. Cooperation with stakeholders, including with residents, businesses and non-governmental organisations, is an institutionalised process, regulated
Krako

O

by law, carried out on a continuous basis, not ad hoc. In the city, a number of consultations are held with various social groups during the development of strategic documents, which are acts of local law. The result of these consultations are documents co-created with the inhabitants, taking into account their ideas and their vision of Krakow's future.

The procedure for the conduct of public consultations in the Municipality of Krakow is clear and based on a number of legal regulations aimed at ensuring the participation of residents and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the decision-making process concerning the life of the city. The entire procedure is defined by the Resolution of the Kraków City Council, of 26 September 2018, on the principles and procedure of conducting consultations with the residents of the Municipality of Kraków and with the Kraków Council for Public Benefit Activity or non-governmental organisations and entities referred to in Article 3(3) of the Act of 24 April 2003 on public benefit activity and volunteerism on drafts of local laws in areas concerning the statutory activity of these organisations.

An abbreviated description of this procedure is as follows:

Initiation of consultations: Consultations can be initiated by the Mayor of the City of Krakow, the City Council, and various institutions, groups of residents, and NGOs.
Requesting consultations: Persons or institutions interested in carrying out consultations shall submit an appropriate request to the Mayor, including a description of the subject of the consultation, a proposal for the form, a justification and possible annexes.
Publicity of the consultation: The consultation is publicly announced and the nature of its conduct in a transparent manner takes into account the various forms of dialogue with residents and NGOs.
Communicating the consultation: Information about the consultation is widely disseminated through various communication channels such as websites, notice boards and posters.
Provision of information material: The organisational cell responsible for the consultation shall provide access to documents and factual information relating to the consultation.
Duration of consultations: Consultations shall last at least 21 days and should be carried out at times convenient for residents and NGOs (e.g. the last five days of the consultation shall not take place on public holidays).
Evaluation of the consultation: At the end of the consultation, the Mayor prepares a report containing the opinions and comments collected, which is made public and forwarded to the City Council.
Introduction of changes: The resolution introduces procedures for bylaws for the introduction of amendments resulting from public consultations with both residents and NGOs.

This brief characterisation shows that the process of public consultation in the Municipality of Krakow is based on transparency, openness to dialogue and the active involvement of residents and NGOs.

# Krakow in cooperation with science and business

Kraków has been consistently working towards climate neutrality for years, implementing sectoral programmes in various areas, such as increasing the use of renewable energy, energy efficiency or transport accessibility. To participate in climate and environmental initiatives, the City of Krakow invites representatives from all walks of life, local government organisations, business, science and residents.
Kraków

Kraków is implementing a joint purpose agreement between the Municipality of Krakow and the Krakow Science and Academic Centre, signed by 21 entities (GMK, members of the College of Rectors of Higher Education in Krakow, PAU). The main objective of the document is to intensify cooperation with KONA and use its potential for the sustainable and intelligent development of Krakow, in line with the in line with the provisions of the Kraków Development Strategy "Here I want to live. Kraków 2030".

The draft Krakow Cooperation Programme with KONA for 2024-2029 was prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Krakow Development Strategy "Here I want to live. Krakow 2030" and the agreement for the implementation of the joint objective concluded in 2021 between the Municipality of Krakow and representatives of the Krakow Science and Academic Centre.

Businesses making efforts to achieve this ambitious goal play a special role in Kraków's climate transformation process. The City of Krakow values and supports them and encourages long-term cooperation in this area, to create a platform for the exchange of experience between companies involved in climate action, to promote pro-climate solutions and ultimately to reduce emissions resulting from their activities.

In order to realise these assumptions, an initiative called the Pact for the Climate was created and addressed, among others, to Kraków's entrepreneurs, solemnly inaugurated at a meeting with representatives of the Kraków City Hall. During the meeting, representatives of participating companies had the opportunity to present their good practices and pro-climate and pro-environmental initiatives. This part of the meeting showed that the companies that responded positively to the city's initiative understand the urgent need to intensify their efforts to improve the quality of the environment, which is key to building a safe and healthy place to work and rest for all residents. They represent a great potential and a promise that green Krakow, through the joint efforts of the local government, business and other key Krakow communities, will soon become a reality.

The initiative aimed at Krakow's business sector is in line with the city's strategy to achieve climate neutrality as soon as possible under conditions of equitable transformation, as well as with the expectations of residents expressed during the work of the first Krakow Climate Assembly, which were recorded in 32 recommendations. In the opinion of the representative group participating in the Assembly, one of the important activities in the near future should be the creation of a space for cooperation and dialogue on Krakow's climate transformation taking into account diverse stakeholders and maintaining transparency.

To date, the following have signed up to the Climate Pact:

# Krakow at regional level

Krakow also expresses its ambitions by cooperating with higher-level bodies to actively participate in shaping the situation at both regional and national level. This is why the city works closely with the Marshal's Office of the Małopolska Region. One of the key activities is the implementation of the Małopolskie Voivodeship Regional Climate and Energy Action Plan (RPDKiE) through various initiatives. An example of such action is the LIFE-IP EKOMAŁOPOLSKA project, which aims to comprehensively implement the RPDKiE, to support the implementation of the National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030 and the new EU strategy, the European Green Deal.

One of the aims of the project is to set up a network of climate and environmental advisors in 21 districts of Małopolska. The concept for the network was developed in cooperation with the districts during the technical assistance phase. The advisors are employed directly in the districts and cooperate with the Marshal's Office at regional level and with the municipalities (including the City of Kraków) at local level. The main task of the advisors is the effective implementation of the measures set out in the RPDKiE, including:

implementation of activities in line with the LAPD;
assisting municipalities in developing strategic energy and climate management documents and plans, and integrating these issues with other municipal plans and strategies;
Supporting municipalities in applying for financing for RES installations, thermal modernisation of buildings, low-carbon construction, sustainable transport, energy reduction and adaptation to climate change;
Apply for funding for climate change mitigation and adaptation measures at county level.

In addition, Kraków is implementing remedial measures indicated for implementation in the Air Protection Programme for the Małopolskie Voivodeship, adopted by the Małopolskie Voivodeship Assembly on 20 November 2023. This programme is a binding act of local law and introduces remedial measures aimed at a gradual improvement of air quality in Małopolska, which is one of the one of the key elements of climate protection.

The document provides a detailed analysis of air quality in the region and provides for long-term and short-term corrective measures. In addition, it sets out guidelines for the use of solid fuels. Corrective measures focus on three areas: reduction of low emissions, emissions from transport and industrial emissions. The Air Protection Programme imposes tasks on all levels of local government (including the City of Kraków) and selected sectors of the economy.

# Krakow at national level

As at the regional level, the City of Kraków is active at the national level. An important undertaking is to participate in the implementation of the National Urban Policy 2030.
Kraków

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

O

The National Urban Policy sets out directions for the development of cities to be citizen-friendly and attractive for business. Polish cities should develop in a sustainable manner, while at the same time being strong centres of development at the regional and local level. In order to achieve this, it is necessary, inter alia, to counteract spatial chaos, to involve inhabitants in the urban management process, promoting sustainable urban mobility and taking measures to reduce emissions and energy efficiency.

The National Urban Policy 2030 defines concrete actions of the government administration in the legal, financial and organisational areas to support urban development. As a result, local authorities and local communities should be equipped with the appropriate tools and opportunities for action.

The City of Krakow actively participated in the inaugural meeting of the working team of the National Urban Policy 2030, which was attended by representatives of ministries (e.g. MFiPR, MKiŚ), the Institute of Environmental Protection and local government organisations at various levels. In addition, the meeting was attended by representatives of other Polish cities participating in the European Mission of 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030.

Krakow's climate-smart cooperation with other actors is also implemented through the city's activities within its umbrella organisations, for example through the Union of Polish Metropolises. Topics concerning the prevention of climate change and the adaptation of cities to these changes are the subject of the Commission's work. Cooperation within the Union of Polish Metropolises allows important topics to be worked on among those dealing with them in individual cities, with the support of external experts, and the voice of the twelve cities that make up the Union is heard more clearly than that of each of the member cities individually. An example of an initiative taken by the UMP is the appeal to the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland to amend the "Warm Housing" programme so that its provisions respond to the needs of the inhabitants and are in line with their real situation, and to enable the largest group of beneficiaries to receive financial support. Currently, following the introduction of changes to the Ciepłe Mieszkanie programme, the Municipality of Krakow is implementing the programme in the area of housing communities of three to seven flats.

Another example of national cooperation is the Climate Commission of the Association of Polish Cities - which was set up on the initiative of Krakow's Mayor Jacek Majchrowski. The cities participating in the Commission's work want to learn from each other, undertake joint initiatives and work towards legal changes to build pro-climate urban policies and promote systemic solutions.

# Cooperation with Ministries

In the cooperation carried out at the national level, a special place is given to the activity undertaken with ministries, in particular the Ministry of Climate and Environment, the Ministry of Funds and Regional Policy, the Ministry of Development and Technology and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. This collaboration is sustained through specialised platforms, such as CapaCITIES, but also through face-to-face online and live meetings, in Warsaw, among representatives of ministries, Polish City Mission cities, with the support of NetZeroCities advisors and representatives of the European Commission. The aim of this collaboration is to trigger positive legal changes, much needed in terms of legislation for the implementation of pro-climate measures, but also to mobilise public capital to support action.

O

In 2024, such meetings with the government side were held on average one to two times per month. Taking pro-climate measures, reducing emissions and adapting cities to climate change are actions that stem from EU commitments made at government level. In view of this, the actions that cities wish to voluntarily implement are part of government policy, enable the achievement of the indicators to which the government has committed, and are an effective tool for achieving the targets. It is therefore not surprising that ministries are involved and working together to create a climate-friendly environment. The only concern is the relatively low rate at which the commitment of the government side is increasing.

## Future vision for Krakow

The vision of the city of the future - Krakow in 2050 - was developed by specialists in various fields and representatives of many stakeholder groups. Representatives of universities, district councils, local government and independent civic organisations took part in the process. Experience from the European projects EIT Climate-KIC Deep Demonstration Healthy Clean Cities, EU Mission 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 and Atelier were used. Concepts developed in European metropolises with ambitious sustainability plans were also taken into account.

In 2050, the majority of residents of Malopolska will live in large cities, primarily Krakow. As the amount of available space for new residents in Krakow is limited, many people choose to settle in the neighbouring municipalities. Although they are not formally recognised as residents of Krakow, their settlement in the area is closely linked to Krakow as they become daily users of the city. According to the "Demographic Forecast for the Kraków Urban Functional Area (MOF) for 2022-2050 by 25 municipalities, taking into account the forecast for Kraków" concerning the Kraków Metropolitan Area, approximately 1,030,000 people lived in the metropolitan area in 2018. In contrast, forecasts for 2050 indicate an increase to almost 1,200,000 inhabitants. It is therefore becoming necessary to adapt the urban structure accordingly and to meet many urban, environmental and technical challenges. Attractive spaces, streets suitable for walking and cycling and efficient public transport will ensure the free enjoyment of urban life. The city will become safe, efficient and comfortable thanks to the efforts of many communities and the consistent implementation of strategies, policies and plans for a clean environment, adaptation to climate change or the development of transport infrastructure. Defining what kind of city we want to live in in 2050 is meant to help stakeholders make strategic decisions now in order to achieve ambitious goals in the future.

## Ambitious goals

The objective of the Climate Contract is to present a pathway for action to reduce emissions by 80% compared to the base year. To achieve this, it is necessary to accurately identify the reduction potentials arising from policies and strategies and complement them with local actions.

There are currently a great many plans, strategies and resolutions influencing the environment and climate in Krakow. These documents can be divided into local, created for the needs of the Municipality of Krakow, regional, addressing the whole of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship, national and EU. They also address various emission sectors. In the context of the Climate Contract, most documents focus on sectors related to energy generation and construction, which fits perfectly with the needs of the city's transformation, as these sectors account for over 90% of the city's emissions. A detailed description of the
#

#

documents that were used for the Climate Contract analyses can be found in module 'A-2 Assessment of current strategies, policies and strategic management instruments'. The projected reduction in emissions relative to the base year (2018) based on current policies and taking into account the decrease in emissions from the industrial sector between 2018 and 2022 is  $59\%$ .

This means that  $21\%$  of emissions remain to be reduced through the measures proposed in the Climate Contract. A detailed list of measures with their description, responsible entity and financial data can be found in the module "B-2 Designing the Climate Neutrality Portfolio".

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
Fig. 1. Schematic of the linkage of policies and strategies from module 'A-2 Assessment of current strategic management strategies, policies and instruments' and activities from module 'B-2 Designing a climate neutrality portfolio'.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the energy transition brings many other benefits to residents. Job creation, lower energy bills and reduced air pollution are just some of the benefits that have a positive impact on the city. All identified non-financial benefits are described in more detail in the chapter 'Module B-1 Climate neutrality scenarios and impact pathways'.

# Status of current activities

The starting year for the analysis carried out under the Climate Contract is 2018. Since then, until the contract was developed and published, the City of Krakow has made a lot of efforts in the context of combating climate change and air protection. Data from the Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventory, which is carried out annually in Krakow, shows that greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 have decreased by as much as  $34\%$  compared to 2018. If this trend of change is maintained, achieving the mission goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  $80\%$  becomes realistically feasible.

However, it should be borne in mind that the base year for the Climate Contract is 2018 and the document goes on to show an 80% reduction by 2030. The above description is only intended to show the impact of the city's actions on climate protection in the last few years.

# Relation to other parts of the Contract

The Climate Neutrality Action Plan to 2030, is the second part of the Climate Contract, which focuses on the actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This part is closely linked to the Investment Plan, which describes the financing options for the actions listed in this chapter. To calculate the emission reductions, the tool of the Economic Model was used, which, for a target emission reduction of 80%, calculates the estimated costs of actions by sector and for specific investing entities. The Economic Model used in this chapter is a tool that strongly integrates the whole document with each other, linking GHG reductions to specific costs. The Climate Neutrality Mandate and the signatures of the assembled stakeholders in support of actions resulting from the Climate Contract, which are briefly described in this section, are further discussed in Part One - Provisions.

# Climate Contract process

The unit responsible for the creation of the Climate Contract is the Department of Municipal Economy and Climate of the City of Krakow, and the authors are Grzegorz Grzybczyk and Adam Stawiarski working in the Department of Municipal Infrastructure. As part of intra-departmental cooperation, many of the data on the city's baseline were consulted with other departmental papers, in particular the Department of Energy and the Department of Waste Management. During the development of the Climate Contract, the different versions were consulted with other municipal departments and units, such as Climate - Energy - Water Management, the Air Quality Department or the Strategy, Planning and Investment Monitoring Department.

As part of expert cooperation in the climate area, a special team called the Zero Emission Krakow Portfolio Advisory Team was established. These experts were presented with a preliminary version of the Climate Contract Action Plan for consultation, to which they introduced comments and suggestions and proposed some of the emission reduction measures in the Action Plan. The team consists of:

Prof. Tomasz Bergier - AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow;
Anita Cieślicka - Energy Forum;
Andrzej Guła - Krakow Smog Alarm;
Włodzimierz Jakubas - SIG;
Aleksandra Latocha - Trainer and facilitator;

The work on the Contract was also assisted by a number of other external experts. A very strong substantive contribution was made by experts employed by NetZeroCities, in particular:

Experts from the Technical University of Madrid, responsible for the preparation and development of the Economic Model, particularly Sean Murray and Julio Lumbreras.
City Advisors consulting on progress, discussing difficult issues and problems, and organising training workshops for those responsible for the development of the Contract - Justyna Wieczorkiewicz-Molendo and Anna Sokolowska.
Experts from the World Bank who provided numerous comments, amendments and advice affecting the readability of the Climate Contract, notably Marcel Ionescu-Heroiu, Ionut Tudor Maries, Codruta Nistor and Mariusz Krisztea.

In addition, the work on the Contract was consulted with teams (transition teams) of other Polish cities participating in the mission - Łódź, Rzeszów, Warsaw and Wrocław. As part of this interaction/knowledge sharing, it was possible to develop a number of solutions taking into account nationwide specificities. It has also resulted in cooperation with authorities at national level, including individual ministries.

## What about after the Contract?

Submitting the Climate Contract to NetZeroCities' experts and having it assessed by specialists from the European Commission, and - we hope - getting it approved (Mission Label) does not end the process of working with the document. The next stage is its implementation. The Climate Contract for Krakow is a kind of climate strategy for the city, complementing and detailing the Climate Strategy. and detailing the Krakow Development Strategy. All municipal departments, units and companies will be involved in its implementation, although to varying degrees, which is due to the specific nature of their activities and scope of work.

The commitments made in the Contract do not only concern the local government. Its implementation will also involve other entities, from the business sector, academia, government administration, NGOs and representatives of other communities. Moreover, it seems reasonable to expect that the group of entities and persons involved in pro-climate actions, as well as the number of actions, will be grow significantly in the coming years. This will entail the need to develop cooperation, as well as to introduce changes and additions to the contract document itself.

The first update of the Climate Contract is planned two years after its adoption. It can be expected to introduce many changes and improvements, especially in the funding mechanisms for the measures described in the Investment Plan section. It is planned that the second iteration will take place in 2028, and in 2030 it is envisaged to verify that the objectives of the contract have been met.

Information on the progress of the Climate Contract will also be provided by the Urban Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory, which is updated annually, enabling the annual monitoring of the decrease in emissions compared to the base year - a key objective of the Climate Contract and the Urban Mission.

An additional element requiring modification will be the review of policies and strategies. Most of these are also subject to a two-year iteration cycle. Partial updates to the Climate Contract will result from the re-examination of these policies.

# 2 Part A - Current status of climate action

# 2.1 Module A-1 Baseline greenhouse gas emissions inventory

# Baseline greenhouse gas inventory

# Timeframe

The base year used in the Urban Greenhouse Gas Inventory, the Economic Model, and throughout this document is 2018. Since 2018, the City of Krakow has been conducting an annual greenhouse gas emissions inventory and collecting municipal data on individual emission sectors. The year 2018 was chosen as the base year due to its high stability in terms of energy consumption and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions. In subsequent years, events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine significantly impacted the city's operations and urban fabric. Therefore, 2018 has been established as the base year in this document.

# Urban Emission Inventory

The inventory of greenhouse gas emissions for the Municipality of Krakow (hereinafter referred to as the Urban Inventory) was carried out to identify the main sources of emissions and to determine its volume. The results obtained provide the basis for planning mitigation measures and, at the same time, in a holistic manner, allow for verification of their effect. The Urban Inventory is carried out annually, allowing emissions to be monitored in a systematic way. From 2021 onwards, the results are reported on the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) platform, recognised by global climate organisations and agreements (e.g. Covenant of Mayors, Cities Race to Zero).

The urban inventory of greenhouse gas emissions in Krakow was carried out on the basis of the GHG Protocol documentation. A basic reporting level (BASIC) was selected, which takes into account emissions from fossil fuel exploitation and waste treatment processes. The area covered by the inventory was defined according to the administrative boundaries of the City of Krakow, and the inventory period is the same as the calendar year. The inventory covers three main sectors: stationary energy, transport and waste management, including municipal wastewater, household wastewater (within individual systems) and industrial wastewater (Fig. 4). The urban inventory is based on specific emissions reported to the KOBIZE, so all the emission factors and energy demand that could result from the from the inventory. Due to the lack of these data, the table "A-1.1: Final energy consumption by source sector" included in the base template (provided by NZC) has been removed. However, it is planned to complete this data in future iterations when a SECAP document is developed that calculates it. In addition to carbon dioxide, it also includes methane and nitrous oxides, whose emissions were also reported directly (Table A-1.2a).

In the Urban Inventory, each sector is analysed in three scopes, depending on where emissions are generated (Figure 5). Scope 1 covers emissions generated at the point of use of fossil fuels or waste treatment (direct emissions) throughout the Municipality of Krakow. Scope 2 covers emissions associated with the use of electricity and heat within the city (indirect emissions), which are sourced from grid systems where the emissions occur. Scope 3 covers emissions related to the loss of energy transferred through the grid systems (indirect emissions) and emissions resulting from the city's activities but occurring outside the city boundaries, such as some travel or waste processing (direct emissions). It should be noted that this latter scope is not mandatory at the BASIC reporting level.

In the future, it is planned to expand the Urban Greenhouse Gas Inventory from Basic to Basic +. It is planned to expand this inventory to include separately distinguished emission sectors: Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) and Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU). The IPPU sector would include greenhouse gas emissions associated with related to various industrial processes, such as cement production, chemical production, iron and steel production, insulation material production, etc., which are not directly related to the fuel combustion process. The AFOLU sector, on the other hand, would describe GHG emissions related to agricultural, forestry and other land uses, such as land use change, deforestation, conversion of forests to agriculture, land degradation, etc. The Urban Inventory at Basic + level would also take into account greenhouse gases not currently included (hydrofluorocarbons,  $\mathrm{SF}_6$ ,  $\mathrm{NF}_3$ ).

The AFOLU and IPPU sector is currently not directly included or isolated as it is not required in the protocol for cities in the basic formula. It is in the plans of the City of Krakow to supplement future inventories with these sectors, but obtaining the relevant data is a problem. Many entities do not carry out adequate monitoring, which makes it impossible to calculate emission values. Some companies are also reluctant to provide data, hiding behind corporate secrecy laws. The City of Krakow is currently analysing what materials and data sources would be needed for full monitoring under the Basic + formula and what data the office would be able to obtain. The reason for the absence of greenhouse gases not covered in the inventory, such as hydrofluorocarbons, SF6, and NF3, is the same.

# Economic model

In the Climate Contract, it is essential to link the emission reduction data from various activities with the economic data presented in Part Two - the Investment Plan. In order to link these data and to have economic indicators ready under the Climate Contract, it was decided to use the Economic Model tool, which is offered by NZC to support the work on the contract.

The Economic Model was developed by experts from the University of Madrid as a support tool for cities involved in the Mission of 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities. It is mainly used to generate economic data and costs for the city's transformation towards zero carbon. Based on a variety of data and indicators on a number of sectors of the city's operation and future projections, the model also calculates the current and future carbon emissions of the urban area. The assumptions made about the future shape and structure of the city's functioning allow estimating the projected emission reductions and the costs that different groups of actors within the city will have to bear by 2030. The economic model allocates GHG emissions according to the breakdown of sectors other than the Urban Inventory (Fig.6).

The 'Buildings and heating' sector includes heat consumption for residential, commercial and industrial purposes (excluding heat for heavy industry from „Kombinat" district). Energy in this sector is sourced from „PGE Energia Ciepła Oddział nr 1 in Kraków", „CEZ Skawina S.A", 53 ecological boiler plants belonging to MPEC located within the administrative boundaries of the city, as well as from network and local gas sources.

The "Electricity" sector includes energy generated and supplied for residential, commercial, industrial (including heavy industry in the „Kombinat" area), public lighting in the city and transport powered by electricity. „TAURON Polska Energia" is responsible for the distribution of electricity in Kraków. Within the city, electricity is generated by „PGE Energia Ciepła Oddział nr 1 in Kraków", „CEZ Skawina", „KHK S.A." Thermal Waste Processing Plant, „TAMEH" CHP plant (operating for industrial purposes) and local renewable energy sources. The demand for electricity is not entirely met by the energy sources located within the city, so part of the energy is imported from outside its borders.

Emissions in the 'Transport' sector have been calculated on the basis of emission factors and transport data shown in local and national documents, policies etc.

The 'Waste Management and CE' sector includes emissions from the operation of the „KHK S.A." Thermal Waste Treatment Plant and the heat generation resulting from this operation, as well as emissions from solid waste generated within the city that is subjected to biological treatment.

The 'Other' sector mainly describes emissions from the industrial activities of AcerolMittal and heat generation from the „TAMEH" CHP plant. Both entities carry out their activities on the site of the Krakow „Kombinat" district. A small proportion of emissions in this sector also come from wastewater management.

The emission scopes separated by the Economic Model rigidly assign specific emission sectors to particular scopes, which does not reflect the actual situation in Krakow. For example, the model assumes that all
Kraków

electricity consumed comes from sources outside the city boundaries. For this reason, the division into emission ranges resulting from the model should be treated in a subsidiary manner.

# How to use the Urban Inventory and the Economic Model

Both the Urban Inventory and the Economic Model are applicable to the Climate Contract. The Urban Inventory is a better tool for determining the city's emissions because it is developed using an appropriate methodology and is updated annually, allowing for monitoring of the decrease in the city's emissions. However, it only addresses emissions that have already taken place. The Economic Model, on the other hand, looks into the future and allows the emissions data to be assigned a projected decrease from specific measures and assigns financial values to this. For this reason, in chapter "B - Pathways to achieve climate neutrality by 2030" and the Investment Plan, data will refer to emissions and sectors from the Economic Model.

Discrepancies in greenhouse gas emissions between the Urban Greenhouse Gas Inventory, and the Economic Model are minor and are due to methodological differences. Emissions in the Economic Model are calculated based on averaged emission factors and energy demand. In contrast, the inventory collects emission data from individual companies and from entities reporting to the KOBiZE. As a result of the data processing at the various stages, the aforementioned differences emerged, which ultimately settle at around 4%.

The differences between the Urban Inventory and the Economic Model are due to the different emission sectors. For example, in the Urban Greenhouse Gas Inventory, the Stationary Energy sector accounts for approximately 93% of emissions within the city. In contrast, in the Economic Model, the Buildings and Heating and Electricity together account for around 67% of emissions. However, this difference is only due to the artificial allocation of sectors. In the Economic Model, the missing emissions are under the category Other, where emissions resulting from buildings classified as industrial and from heat generation for industry are attributed.

# Evaluation of urban inventories

When developing the Climate Contract, it is important to outline the city's previous strategy in the context of climate action and to assess the actual state of the city also in relation to this strategy. Such a practice enables a realistic presentation of the city's and the country's actions, takes into account the difficulties encountered in previous years, and shows the challenges of implementing actions in other necessary areas and sectors which, although necessary, may negatively affect the functioning of the city.

In 2015, the Municipality of Krakow adopted the Low Emission Management Plan for the Municipality of Krakow. It was a strategic document defining the directions of investment and non-investment activities of the Municipality of Krakow in areas related to construction, transport, energy, municipal economy and city management for the period 2014-2020 and in a longer perspective until 2040. The purpose of the plan was to present a concept of activities in the Municipality of Krakow aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂e), improving air quality, reducing low emissions by increasing the use of low-carbon energy sources, especially renewable energy sources, and reducing energy consumption and improving energy

O

efficiency in the city. The Low Emission Management Plan was also intended to contribute to the implementation of Kraków's smart growth strategy in line with the Smart City concept.

The document also included data on the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ emissions inventory and carbon dioxide emission projection scenarios up to 2040. The base year for these scenarios was 1995 emissions.

In the real scenario, the Plan assumed $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ emissions in 2040 of 4 438 396 tonnes, representing a $26\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ emissions compared to 1995. In contrast, the optimal scenario assumed emissions in 2040 of 2 984 023 tonnes, representing a $51\%$ reduction from the base year.

These scenarios show that Krakow had broad ambitions to reduce emissions long before it decided to join the Mission of 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030. This approach, driven by the willingness of many city stakeholder groups to act in the years to come, has been further intensified resulting in the Climate Contract, which seeks an innovative approach to achieving an $80\%$ reduction in emissions already by 2030.

In the further development of the Climate Contract, the emission sectors will be separated according to the sectors of the Economic Model, so that the data in the Action Plan will be comparable with the data calculated by the Model in the Investment Plan.

Development strategy for Krakow. This is where I want to live. Kraków 2030

Territorial scope: local.

Relevance: The Krakow Development Strategy is the basic and most important document in the process of comprehensive planning of the future of the city of Krakow until 2030. The strategy was created as a result of a participatory and expert process of interaction between many groups and circles involved in the project work from the beginning: urban planners, sociologists of the city, architects, urban activists, economists, inhabitants.

Description: The city of Krakow's development strategy for 2030 envisages its transformation into a dynamic and modern metropolis that will become a leader in many fields. The vision for Krakow's future is based on six areas of development in which the city is to excel.

wants to foster the creativity of its residents by providing equal access to cultural events and creative discussions.

The quality of life for residents is a priority, so the city plans to provide new public spaces, improve environmental quality standards and promote healthy lifestyles, while developing an efficient transport system. In terms of social capital, Krakow aims to strengthen the community of residents and their involvement in the life of the city through social activation programmes, especially for young people.

In the area of city management, the city plans professional management, high quality public services and rational spatial management, through the development of spatial information systems, opening up access to public information and public opinion surveys.

An update of the document is currently being developed.

# Assumptions to the Plan for Supplying the Municipality of Krakow with Heat, Electricity and Gas Fuels for the years 2023-2038

Territorial scope: local.

Significance: The document sets out changes to the operation of the energy system in Kraków, describing the assumptions and options for converting it to a less carbon-intensive system.

Description: The document is based on the provisions of the Energy Law. It is drawn up for at least 15 years and is subject to updates at least once every three years. Its purpose is to analyse and evaluate the projected changes in the demand for heat, electricity and gaseous fuel, as well as to assess the level of energy security of the municipality and to propose measures to improve it. All suppliers of heat, electricity and gaseous fuels operating in the Municipality of Krakow were included in the analysis process.

As part of the creation of this document, three different development scenarios and forecasts for heat, electricity and natural gas demand were analysed. After careful consideration, Scenario 1 was considered to be the most appropriate and realistic scenario for the development of the city.

This scenario takes many assumptions from other already existing plans and strategies at national and EU level. The following changes are assumed in the planned future for Krakow:

a slight decrease in population in the coming years, but a projected increase between 2040 and 2050;
A gradual increase in the area of buildings complying with the highest energy standards;
a decrease in the area of the building stock (excluding listed buildings) as a result of demolitions;
planned thermo-modernisation of buildings in line with the Long Term Renewal Strategy (DSRB);
Priority for thermomodernisation will be given to buildings with the highest thermal energy demand;
new buildings within the range of the district heating network will be connected to it and those outside the range will use renewable energy sources;
replacing light sources in street lighting with LED sources by 2048;

The development of electromobility will include the replacement of bus fleets and an increase in the proportion of electric vehicles;
The increase in the number of LED luminaires will depend on the rate of growth of the building stock area;
increasing the energy efficiency of equipment and technology in line with expertise;
by 2050, electricity for buildings will come from renewable sources;
European Energy Certificate Scheme (EECS-GoO) certificates are envisaged for electricity from 2050;
Consideration of the potential for electricity from photovoltaic panels requires additional elaboration.

All these assumptions translate into the following forecast of changes in demand for energy carriers in the city area:

|  Year | 2021 | 2023 | 2028 | 2033 | 2038 | 2040 | 2050  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Unit | MWh  |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|  Heat | 3 022 498 | 2 854 265 | 2 660 486 | 2 624 635 | 2 658 245 | 2 691 781 | 2 807 070  |
|  Electricity | 3 458 771 | 3 450 347 | 3 433 207 | 3 551 035 | 3 661 006 | 3 683 258 | 4 077 021  |
|  Gaseous fuels | 2 891 441 | 2 869 576 | 2 600 711 | 1 878 659 | 1 460 864 | 1 364 770 | 178 960  |

Until 2030, the plan assumes a rapid decline in energy consumption, which is linked to the thermal modernisation of the most energy-intensive buildings in the initial period. At the same time, increases in the share of RES in total energy production are projected.

## Low Emission Management Plan for the Municipality of Krakow

**Territorial scope:** local.

**Relevance:** The document presents concepts for measures within the city that will serve to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality and reduce low emissions emissions by 2040.

**Description:** The Low Emission Management Plan for the Municipality of Krakow sets out directions for the development of Krakow's economy for the period 2014-2020, in terms of investment and non-investment activities in areas related to energy use: public and private buildings, public and private transport, spatial management, heat and energy supply, water and sewage management, waste management.

Description: The Adaptation Plan provides a list of comprehensive actions to address climate change and adapt to its impacts. Its scope is not only limited to adaptation measures, but also focuses on the factors influencing climate change. An additional aim of the plan is to increase the knowledge and awareness of all actors involved, stakeholders and citizens of the city.

Adaptation measures are a key element of the plan, steering towards sustainable development. They aim to enable adaptation to climate change while not limiting development opportunities for future generations. As part of these measures, initiatives are planned to promote energy-saving behaviour, such as water conservation, efficient energy use, promotion of public transport and cycling, pedestrian zones and reduction of energy consumption through the introduction of thermal upgrading of buildings.

The plan also takes into account measures resulting from the effects of climate change already occurring. The promotion of energy-saving behaviour, the use of solar energy through the development of photovoltaics or the use of precipitation to retain clean water that can be efficiently used in various areas such as the maintenance of urban infrastructure or support for forms of small-scale retention are just some of the possibilities.

# Environmental Protection Programme for the City of Krakow for 2020-2030

Territorial scope: local.

Significance: The task of the programme is to identify the necessary measures to improve the environment and bring it to a state defined by legislation and accepted by society. The document sets out objectives for the protection and improvement of a number of elements of the environment, such as the protection of ambient air, waste management and greenery and forest resources, which are necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Description: The programme sets out overarching objectives and priorities for environmental protection measures specific to individual environmental elements. In the area of climate protection, the programme addresses the following strategic objectives:

the rational use and restoration of green and forest resources, ensuring their sustainability;
Increasing the proportion of green areas in developed areas and creating development plans that take environmental aspects into account;

# District Programme for Increasing the Forest Cover of the City of Krakow 2018-2040

Territorial scope: local.

Significance: The document describes plans to increase the forest cover of the city of Krakow, which is crucial in the context of absorbing some of the greenhouse gas emissions and diversifying the natural environment of the city. The programme describes the plan and pathway to achieve an 8% increase in forest cover within the municipal boundaries, which will reduce CO₂ emissions generated in Krakow.

Description: the District Programme for Increasing the Forest Cover of the City of Krakow for 2018-2040 has been prepared by the Forest Management and Geodesy Bureau in Krakow. The programme aims to increase forested areas in the Municipality of Krakow by at least 1430 ha, with an additional 200 ha as reserve areas.

The implementation of the programme is divided into four phases:

Period 2018-2022: In the first stage, land was selected to be included in the programme for the period 2018-2040, and from this, the land on which the implementation of the programme will take place first (2018-2022) was selected, covering more than 459 ha of land. For the land to be afforested during this period, a detailed afforestation plan has been created of approximately 117 ha.
Period 2023-2028: This phase is expected to lead to a significant increase in forest cover to around 6%. Afforestation work will continue on communal land and on those acquired by Krakow, including land that could not be included in the programme in period one.
Period 2029-2034: A further increase in afforestation areas is planned, especially on private land as well as land acquired by the Municipality of Krakow.
Period 2035-2040: the last phase assumes full implementation of the programme, achieving a forest cover of no less than 8%. Afforestation tasks will continue on land acquired by the Municipality of Krakow and may also include afforestation by private owners.

The programme aims to increase the woodland areas in Krakow, which will contribute to improving the city's environment.

# Directions for the Development and Management of Green Areas in Krakow 2019-2030

Territorial scope: local.

Significance: The purpose of this document is to define a coherent, planned and long-term policy for the development of green areas in Krakow, taking into account, inter alia, the integration of the dispersed green structure into a continuous system of areas linked by pedestrian and bicycle routes and green routes, the preservation, development and creation of new green areas that meet social needs, the protection of historic green areas important for the quality of the cultural landscape, the protection of areas of natural value, the raising of standards for the maintenance, establishment and care of green areas, the improvement of the management of green areas in Krakow.

Description: The concept of the system of green areas of Krakow, is based on two pillars: areas of public greenery (within which also semi-natural, unmown enclaves are envisaged, with a more "wild" character) and areas of ecological and landscape greenery, partly arranged with a semi-natural
Kra ków

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

O

character. The system is completed by linear systems of greenways - publicly accessible natural or landscaped areas.

The Directions also identify spaces where there is a need to conserve or restore green spaces, and spatial planning and land resource management activities should aim to conserve, develop, restore and undertake other activities to meet social needs in this regard.

In addition, the purpose of the Directions is to enable the planning, preparation and implementation of investments (including the priority investments identified in this document) in green areas, with their appropriate functional and spatial allocation, according to social needs and natural and landscape values.

The document also takes into account the accessibility, to the existing, arranged public green areas with a recreational function, as well as municipal and state forests, and identifies areas where deficits in publicly accessible green space should be addressed.

The above issues are also written down as indicators to monitor progress in the development of publicly accessible green spaces, increasing accessibility for residents (the idea of the 15-minute city), information on increasing woodland areas and areas of natural value.

# Circular strategy of the city of Krakow

Scope: local.

Significance: The main objective of the document is to create long-term, systemic changes that will ensure a sustainable future for the city. It focuses not only on recycling, but also on changing the economic system towards the idea of a circular economy.

Description: The Circular Strategy for Krakow sets out a vision of a fully circular local economy by 2050, based on four thematic areas and taking into account the characteristics of the city's various neighbourhoods. These are:

A city with a circular metabolism.
A well-connected city promoting a culture of creativity and innovation.
Sustainable, diverse and inclusive construction.
A city with a system that is friendly to humans and other species.

Within these areas, a set of 24 actions have been adopted to revitalise the circular economy in Kraków. These actions, selected on the basis of research, stakeholder engagement and identification of starting points, are the starting point for realising the vision and systemic change. The action toolkit will support the collaboration needed to shape a closed loop culture in Krakow.

The document also includes long-term goals, such as moving away from burning coal as a fossil fuel and away from landfills and waste incinerators, which require bold policies, legislation and major infrastructure projects.

# Regional

## Strategy of Kraków Metropolis 2030

**Scope:** regional.

**Significance:** The Kraków Metropolis 2030 Strategy is a strategy for cooperation between municipalities for sustainable supra-local development.

**Description:** The mission of the Kraków Metropolis is to undertake joint and concerted actions of strategic importance, responding to the challenges it faces. The consensus developed and implemented among the area's municipalities is aimed at increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of public interventions. Raising the living standards and well-being of the inhabitants is considered to be the overriding objective of all activities, and all interventions are undertaken with respect for the diversity and local specificity of the municipalities which make up the Kraków Metropolis.

**Main objectives:**

Kraków Metropolis intelligently managed, based on partnership and committed staff.
An environmentally friendly, climate-neutral Kraków Metropolis with a high quality of life.
Kraków Metropolis for active, ecological and efficient mobility.
Kraków Metropolis innovative and competitive, creating lasting relations in the network of Europe's leading economic centres.
A Kraków Metropolis that is inspiring, draws on diversity and local potentials, and builds on networks.
Kraków Metropolis fostering effective, inclusive education based on creative relationships.
A Kraków Metropolis providing modern and accessible social services to its inhabitants, valuing equality and social solidarity.

A detailed list of projects and undertakings for the 2030 horizon is set out in implementation documents called action plans, within each of the seven areas of cooperation: smart governance, environment and space, mobility, economy, leisure culture, education and social services.

One of the key elements of the Kraków Metropolis 2030 Strategy is a model of the functional and spatial structure together with recommendations for spatial policy, in accordance with the provisions of the Act on the Principles of Development Policy. The model proposes directing the development of the area towards ensuring a high standard of quality of life and availability of public services, standing out against the European background, providing a sense of security and offering opportunities for comprehensive development. The primary objective of all changes to the functional and spatial structure of the Kraków Metropolis is to achieve development in the seven areas of metropolitan cooperation. This will allow the social, economic, natural, ecological and functional-spatial aspects of the development of the 15 communes comprising the Kraków Metropolis to be dealt with in an integral manner.

## Climate Strategy of the Kraków Metropolis 2024-2030

**Territorial scope:** regional.

**Significance:** SCM's roadmap for moving towards climate neutrality.
Kra ków

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

O

Description: The Climate Strategy for the Krakow Metropolis 2024-2030 responds to the growing challenges of climate change, emphasising the pursuit of climate neutrality, mitigation and adaptation to ongoing change, and increasing the metropolitan area's resilience to extreme meteorological conditions. Key areas of action are focused around land reclamation and retention, water and wastewater management, blue-green infrastructure, greenhouse gas reduction and energy transition. Implementation activities are divided into two categories:

A. Information - Knowledge - Collaboration: activities that meet the objectives of collecting and monitoring reliable data and stakeholder engagement.

B. Sustainable Development: activities to develop recommendations for different sectors and to analyse the possibility of implementing pro-climate principles in processes and procedures at the level of the municipalities of Krakow Metropolis and in supra-local cooperation.

# Sustainable mobility plan for Krakow Metropolis

Territorial scope: regional.

Significance: The plan presents forecasts for future changes in the city of Krakow and the neighbouring municipalities that make up the Krakow Metropolis in the context of transport, while also setting out actions and targets for the transformation of the transport system.

Description: The Kraków Metropolis Sustainable Mobility Plan is a document developed to meet the growing mobility needs of urban areas and their surroundings, aiming to improve the quality of life of the inhabitants and the development of the economy. The plan builds on existing urban planning concepts and incorporates the key principles of social inclusion, active public participation and systematic evaluation.

In addition to describing and assessing the current state of the transport sector, it also presents the main problems and barriers perceived by city residents. With this knowledge, the city is able to target its activities at the most sensitive sub-sectors of the transport system. The Krakow Metropolitan Area Mobility Plan also presents scenarios for mobility development up to 2045.

Baseline scenario (BAU) - the mobility vision in this scenario is exposed to unfavourable circumstances such as rising public transport costs, reduced frequency and number of journeys, decommissioning of links, expansion of areas beyond the reach of sustainable modes of transport and lack of measures to support mobility activity or the use of public transport.

Active scenario - in this scenario, the accessibility of transport in the functional area remains stable, while mobility management measures are introduced, such as incentives to use cleaner modes of transport, improved conditions for pedestrians and cyclists, information campaigns and promotions related to public transport and personal transport modes. However, a significant effort is required to achieve this scenario, as the results of the stakeholder assessment indicate that without a significant improvement in the accessibility of public transport for residents, it will not be possible to significantly reduce the share of cars in daily travel.

Sustainable mobility scenario - this scenario is based on the fulfilment of objectives set out in the strategies of local authorities, which will improve the quality of life of the inhabitants and the attractiveness of the Krakow Metropolis. Achieving this goal will foster a reduction in the role of private

cars in the daily journeys of the inhabitants, through the introduction of measures reducing car traffic and increasing the space for sustainable mobility measures. At the same time initiatives will be undertaken related to the development of cycling infrastructure, increasing the accessibility of public transport (in particular rail transport) and the creation of interchanges to enable the integration of different transport systems.

The plan also outlines implementation actions by individual transport system groups that aim to achieve a positive scenario by 2045.

# Regional Climate and Energy Action Plan for the Małopolska Region

Territorial scope: regional.

Relevance: The document constitutes the action plan on climate issues of the Board of the Małopolska Region and covers the tasks carried out by the Marshal's Office and its organisational units.

Description: The Regional Climate and Energy Action Plan for the Małopolska Region is a document developed by the Marshal's Office of the Małopolska Region in February 2020. Its aim is to set out actions that will contribute to: reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement of air quality and low-carbon transformation of Małopolska.

The plan identifies the current level of greenhouse gas emissions and sets out priority courses of action. These are:

reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing efficiency in the use of available resources;
diversifying activities towards the promotion of low-carbon sources of energy generation;
Increasing the share of RES installations in energy production between 2020 and 2030;
low-carbon transformation of the region;
exploiting synergies with other retrofit programmes to reduce energy consumption and emissions in the municipal sector and public buildings;
improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings and developing a modern building sector that integrates technology with RES installations;
the development of clean transport modes, including walking and cycling, electric scooters and electromobility;
transforming the transport sector by building a modern transport system;
reducing the production of waste and its deposition in the environment, using waste for energy purposes;
Reducing demand for resources and energy by strengthening the circular economy;
water efficiency, increased water retention and measures to prevent floods and droughts;
Technological transformation in agriculture with adaptation to climate change;
Adaptation of forests to climate change through afforestation of land and increased uptake of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  by forests and protection of green spaces.

The plan is a regional response to the quantitative mitigation targets set by the European Union. It assumes:

a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least  $40\%$  (compared to 1990 levels), including for the non-ETS sectors (mainly transport, utilities and agriculture), as  $30\%$  compared to 2005 levels;
Kraków

Increasing the share of energy from renewable sources to at least 32% of gross final energy consumption;
achieving at least a 32.5% improvement in energy efficiency.

## Air protection programme for the Małopolskie Voivodeship

**Territorial scope:** regional.

**Significance:** The Air Protection Programme for the Małopolskie Voivodeship aims to achieve the permissible levels of pollutants in the air, set by Polish and EU legislation, as soon as possible. The programme sets out the most effective measures to achieve the permissible levels of PM10, PM2.5, NO₂ and benzo(a)pyrene in the air no later than by 2026.

**Description:** Małopolska is moving towards a low-carbon energy transition, which means reducing the use of fossil fuels and increasing the use of renewable energy sources. The Programme has analysed the possible corrective measures that will have the greatest effect in improving air quality.

The document includes an analysis of the existing air protection measures in the province, including their scope, the effects achieved and the barriers encountered. Between 2017 and 2022, 82.7 thousand boilers and furnaces using solid fuels were eliminated, of which almost one-fifth were located in Kraków. These measures have contributed to improving air quality and the health of the region's inhabitants.

This programme imposes specific corrective actions at each administrative level - province, county and municipality. The document lists corrective actions and a Short-Term Action Plan, which are implemented in situations where there is a risk of exceeding the alert, information or limit level of pollutants in the air.

In accordance with the indications of the Air Protection Programme for the Małopolska Voivodeship, an anti-smog resolution has been adopted for Kraków. As of 1 September 2019, the use of solid fuels is banned in the City of Kraków.

Achievement of today's air quality status was achieved as a result of the City's consistent policy pursued in accordance with remedial programmes such as the Air Protection Programmes developed under the Air Quality Management System. An important role was played by large-scale subsidy and resident support programmes, including, inter alia, through the implementation of the Low Emission Reduction Programme for the City of Kraków, under which the City participated in the costs of liquidating solid fuel furnaces and installing environmentally-friendly heating systems. Success would not have been possible without the participation of social organisations and the huge involvement of the city's residents in the process of replacing furnaces. Today, almost all buildings in Kraków are heated in an environmentally friendly manner.

As part of the subsidies provided by the Municipality of Kraków, more than 45,000 solid fuel fireplaces were eliminated, almost 2,000 renewable energy source installations were installed, and the total funds disbursed for this purpose amounted to almost PLN 338 million.

The resolution was preceded by several years of information and education programmes to prepare residents to change and make informed decisions about their home heating systems. Furthermore, the
Kraków

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

O

regulation covers different types of heating systems, from boilers and cookers to catering installations, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to the problem.

It is also the first regulation of its kind in Poland, setting an example for other cities in the country that face similar smog problems. The anti-smog resolution for Krakow is an inspiration for other local governments, indicating the possibility of effectively combating air pollution through the introduction of appropriate regulations.

These regulations have helped to significantly reduce air pollution, which has been one of the one of the main problems of the City of Krakow. The differences in measurements over the last few years at the station in Bujaka Street (Bujaka Street is an urban background station and is representative of the whole of Krakow) for annual average concentrations are as follows:

|  Type of contamination | 2018 | 2023  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  PM10 | 43 μg/m³ | 23 μg/m³  |
|  PM2.5 | 31 μg/m³ | 15 μg/m³  |
|  NO₂ | 32 μg/m³ | 24 μg/m³  |

# National

## Poland's Energy Policy until 2040

Territorial scope: national.

Significance: Poland's Energy Policy 2040 sets the framework for the country's energy transition and includes strategic decisions on the choice of technologies to support the construction of a low-carbon energy system. It is closely linked to the EU's climate policy, which sets long-term goals such as climate neutrality by 2050 and targets for 2020 and 2030.

Description: The document describes key investment decisions to realise the country's potential in the areas of energy, raw materials, technology and human resources. The plan is directed at creating conditions conducive to the development of the economy through the energy sector, while maintaining the principles of a fair transition.

Poland's energy policy until 2040 directs its efforts towards the development of smart grids. The aim of these innovative solutions is to enable more informed energy use, efficient energy management and reduced losses, while maintaining a high quality of supply. Central to this concept are information and telecommunications technologies, such as intelligent telemetry systems and systems for automatic grid monitoring, control, regulation and security. Data exchange between devices also plays an important role, which requires the spread of Internet of Things technologies. These measures also aim to empower electricity consumers, especially in the context of the planned installation of smart meters, which work closely with the construction of smart grids.

PEP2040 also identifies tools for energy planning, an example being a system for collecting data for a nationwide heat map. The provision of such databases will enable regions and entrepreneurs to estimate the potential for the development of district heating and cogeneration networks, while new investors will be provided with information on existing infrastructure. In the context of horizontal

issues, the draft PEP2040 also emphasises the importance of cyber security in the energy sector, which includes ensuring an adequate level of protection for IT systems used to provide key services.

## National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030

**Territorial scope:** national.

**Relevance:** The document presents national assumptions and targets as well as policies and actions relating to five dimensions - decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy security, internal energy market and research, innovation and competitiveness. The plan describes opportunities for energy transition, taking into account EU plans, targets and objectives. The National Energy and Climate Plan presents key tools and measures in the energy sector, while responding to existing EU legislation.

**Description:** This is a strategic document setting out the objectives and policies related to the energy union. This plan was created after taking into account expert opinion, public consultation and recommendations from the European Commission.

The main objectives of the NAPE for 2030 are:

GHG emission reductions of 7% in non-ETS sectors compared to 2005.
Achieve a share of renewable energy of 21-23% in gross final energy consumption, including a 14% share of RES in transport and an increase in the share of RES in heating and cooling.
A 23% increase in energy efficiency compared to PRIMES2007 projections.
Reduce the share of coal in electricity generation to 56-60%.

The document is currently being updated to accelerate the energy transition. Only a preliminary version is available (draft of 29.02.2024) containing only the WEM scenario, which is understood as the baseline scenario for the transformation under market-technical conditions, whose projections are realistic. In contrast, the WAM optimistic scenario remains in development. The most important changes in the context of achieving the mission objectives concern the energy system. The update of the plan assumes the use of 50.1 per cent of RES in electricity in gross final energy consumption and 32.1 per cent in heating and cooling. In addition, the update also forecasts an increase in the share of RES in the transport sector to 17.7% by 2030.

Linked to this document is the 'Development Plan for Meeting Current and Future Electricity Demand 2023-2032', which is National Grid's plan for meeting these obligations.

The plan sets out forecasts for the development of power grids across the country and forecasts for changes in the diversification of electricity generation. It analyses different scenarios for the development of the electricity system to identify investments that improve the reliability of energy supply. The plan includes:

meeting targets for the share of energy from RES in final energy consumption;
the construction of offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea;
building nuclear capacity;
connection of new generation units;
improving supply conditions, including minimising network congestion across the system.

The most important innovation is the construction of an HVDC line connecting the north and south of Poland, enabling the efficient transmission of energy. The aim of this investment is to enable the
Kraków

O

transmission required by the industry located in the south of Poland of energy generated from onshore and offshore wind sources gathered in the north of the country. In turn, the proposal for the construction of generation resources by the transmission system operator is intended to increase grid stability in emergency situations.

Analyses of RES production potential reach over 100 TWh per year of renewable energy by 2030, which will significantly exceed 50% of net electricity demand in Poland. This is significantly more than the levels assumed in national strategic documents (PEP2040).

# Long-term building renovation strategy to 2050

Territorial scope: national.

Significance: The long-term building renovation strategy defines the actions that are necessary to ensure that private and public buildings in Poland are highly energy efficient and low-carbon by 2050.

Description: This strategy aims to make buildings in Poland more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. The strategy proposes a renovation scenario and guidance on how to support the in the process of modernising buildings.

Building renovation is a significant challenge until 2050 and is in line with the European Union's climate neutrality targets. At the same time, the strategy takes into account the urgent need to replace the most emitting heat sources in order to improve air quality and preserve the cost-effectiveness of retrofitting.

The key objective of renovation is to reduce energy consumption and CO₂ emissions, while taking care of the health and safety of building occupants. The strategy carries out a comprehensive diagnosis of the building renovation challenge and proposes a scenario for the modernisation of buildings in Poland by 2050. The document also provides public policy guidelines and indicators to monitor the implementation of the strategy.

The implementation of a building renovation plan may be facilitated by a review of energy efficiency legislation, which may require the introduction of tools to facilitate investment decisions, such as an energy class system and the implementation of solutions based on the building energy passport concept. Such a passport would contain information on thermal modernisation projects carried out and planned over several years, thus making it possible to achieve a high standard of energy efficiency already at the planning stage. The widespread use of such tools in Polish conditions could make it possible to control the thermomodernisation process, which could be carried out in stages at intervals of even several years.

In addition, the strategy is supported by other initiatives with different scopes of action, such as the "Clean Air Programme", the "Programme for the thermal modernisation of single-family buildings for the City of Kraków", "My Heat", "My Electricity", "Thermal modernisation allowance" and EU directives on the energy efficiency of new buildings.

# Clean Air Programme

**Territorial scope:** national.

**Significance:** This programme focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by upgrading heat sources and increasing energy efficiency in single-family buildings. By replacing outdated solid fuel cookers and boilers and thermo-modernising homes, the programme not only contributes to environmental protection, but also generates financial savings by encouraging efficient energy management.

**Description:** The Clean Air Programme is a comprehensive government initiative to improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by modernising heat sources and increasing energy efficiency in single-family buildings. It focuses mainly on the replacement of outdated solid fuel-fired cookers and boilers and thermo-modernisation of homes, which contributes to environmental protection, generates financial savings through efficient energy management and increases property values. The scheme is aimed at homeowners and includes grants for replacing the heat source with a lower-emission one, thermal modernisation works and the installation of a photovoltaic micro-installation. It also increases the availability of funding for those interested in thermal upgrading or replacing heat sources with greener solutions through subsequent editions of the programme. In addition, the programme introduces changes to the funding, taking into account the different income levels of applicants and broadening the catalogue of works covered by the subsidy.

In October 2019, the Municipality of Krakow signed an agreement with the Voivodship Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management in Krakow on cooperation in the implementation of the Priority Programme "Clean Air", thanks to which Krakow residents can also submit applications for funding and applications for payment for properties located in Krakow at the offices of the Air Quality Department of the Municipality of Krakow (the municipal consultation and information point of the Clean Air Programme run by eco-advisers from the Krakow Energy Advisory Centre). The programme meets increasing interest, and residents are increasingly taking advantage of the eco-counsellors' assistance in submitting applications. At the end of 2023, a total of almost 1,000 applications for funding and applications for payment had been submitted through the Municipality of Krakow.

# A strategy for district heating up to 2030 with an outlook to 2040.

**Territorial scope:** national.

**Relevance:** The strategy describes the capabilities of the national district heating sector and the projected modernisation pathways for the sector. The document forecasts heat demand by sector and presents possible innovations and solutions for modernisation. It is also an important complement to the local heat supply plans of the city.

**Description:** the district heating strategy, valid until 2030, with an outlook to 2040, is a key planning document that aims to bring the energy sector in line with both national and EU requirements, particularly in the context of the New Green Deal. The document is currently in draft form, but an advanced version is now available.

As part of the development of the Strategy, a forecast was carried out as an appendix to the document and is based on a cost optimisation model for end users. The results of this analysis highlight the need

## Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on establishing a framework to facilitate sustainable investment

## Territorial scope: EU.

**Significance:** This document imposes information and reporting obligations on financial institutions and companies, seeking to increase transparency and accountability in the context of environmental and social issues. The regulation also sets $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ limits related to energy generation, which significantly affects the mission objectives. These rules force the modernisation of carbon-intensive thermal power plants, leading to a reduction in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions during energy production.

**Description:** Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council was adopted to establish a single European policy for environmentally sustainable investments. Its main objective is to create a coherent system of environmental and social classifications that will facilitate the identification of investments in line with sustainable development objectives.

Within this regulation, sustainable investment categories have been identified, covering areas such as climate change, environmental protection, energy efficiency, circular economy, sustainable use of natural resources, biodiversity conservation, health and education.
Kraków

O

The regulation also introduces disclosure obligations related to sustainable financial activities for investment firms, financial advisers and listed companies. Through this legislation, financial institutions will be required to report on the extent to which their investments comply with sustainability criteria.

The regulation is key to accelerating the transition towards a more sustainable economy and is part of the European Union's broader plan for financing sustainable development. It is an instrument to support the long-term goals of climate change, environmental protection and social responsibility.

Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (RED II Renewable Energy Directive).

Territorial scope: EU.

Significance: The directive at European Union level sets a binding target of 32% share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption by 2030. This document directly affects the district heating sector, forcing an annual increase in the share of heat from RES and waste heat supplied to consumers by at least 1.1 percentage points (y/y) by 2030 or 1.3 percentage points including waste heat.

Description: The Directive is a key piece of European Union legislation aimed at promoting and intensifying the use of energy from renewable sources. The document sets out specific targets, obligations and support mechanisms to accelerate the transformation of energy sectors.

The main elements of the directive include setting an overall target that at least 32% of the European Union's total energy consumption should come from renewable sources by 2030. In addition, the directive imposes specific targets for the share of renewable energy in the transport and heating sectors, aiming for sustainable growth and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy efficiency and amending Regulation (EU) 2023/955

Territorial scope: EU.

Relevance: The directive is an implementing act in the aspect of energy and climate transformation of the and climate transformation of EU Member States resulting from the European Green Deal and the Fit for 55 package.

Description: The directive aims to reduce final energy consumption by 11.7% by 2030. Member States can make use of flexibilities in meeting this target.

The targets include a reduction in final energy consumption of at least 11.7% by 2030 compared to 2020 projections. National contributions will be set out in the integrated energy and climate plans (IEPs) and can be adjusted by the Commission if the target is not met.

Energy saving targets will gradually increase until 2030, with the public sector having specific commitments, such as an annual reduction in energy consumption of 1.9% and the renovation of at least 3% of public buildings per year.

Article 26 of the Directive also gives a very important definition of an energy-efficient system. Such a system is understood as:

until 31 December 2027, a system using at least 50% renewable energy, or at least 50% waste heat, or at least 75% heat from from cogeneration, or at least 50% a combination of such energy and heat;
from 1 January 2028, a system using at least 50% renewable energy or at least 50% waste heat, at least 50% renewable energy and waste heat, at least 80% heat from high-efficiency cogeneration, or at least a combination of such heat injected into the grid, in which the share of renewable energy is at least 5% and the total share of renewable energy, waste heat or heat from high-efficiency cogeneration is at least 50%.

Further changes to the definition are planned after the completion of the Mission 100 Climate Neutral and smart cities, from 1 January 2035.

Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the energy performance of buildings EPBD (recast) (COM(2021)0802 - C9-0469/2021 - 2021/0426(COD))

Territorial scope: EU.

Significance: The directive stipulates that from 2030 all new buildings will have to be zero-emission, and by 2050 the entire building stock in the European Union should be zero-emission.

Description: The directive is one of the key pieces of legislation in the European Green Deal and the Fit for 55 package and aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and eradicate energy poverty.

How Poland will achieve the goals of the directive will be decided primarily by the Polish government, on the basis of an analysis of the building renovation process contained in the National Renovation Plan.

The long-term goal of the regulation adopted by the Member States is the climate neutrality of the entire building sector in 2050. Zero carbon is to cover residential, non-residential and public buildings. Within a few years, mandatory zero-carbon standards will first cover new public buildings (from 1 January 2028) and all new buildings from 1 January 2030. The energy performance of buildings will be defined by so-called Minimum Energy Performance Standards, phased in as a mandatory requirement for non-residential buildings and optional for residential buildings. A similar function will be fulfilled by a certification system with a scale from A to G, where A stands for zero-emission buildings and G for those with the worst energy performance.

In parallel to the new EU regulations, Poland is receiving funding to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, e.g. from the National Reconstruction Plan and the European Funds for Infrastructure, Climate, Environment (over PLN 23 billion). To this must also be added the proceeds from the Social Climate Fund as well as repayable instruments from the private sector and so-called repayable financing, e.g. ESCO (Energy Saving Company) or local government green bonds. Financial support for meeting the EPBD targets is also found in the Modernisation Fund.

# Evaluation of plans, policies and strategies

In the context of the fight against global warming, an analysis of the above policies, strategies and plans for Krakow shows the city's strong commitment to environmental protection and combating climate change. Kraków stands out for its advanced, integrated approach to the fight to protect the climate. The strategic approach covers the areas of green infrastructure, mobility, energy efficiency and regional cooperation. The introduction of a comprehensive sustainable development strategy has the potential to transform the city, bringing together the different areas into a unified vision.

The integration of activities enables synergistic effects, where progress in one area supports goals in others. For example, investment in green infrastructure not only improves air quality, but also affects the living comfort and health of residents. Such an approach is crucial in the complex context of climate change.

Local strategies and plans represent a clear commitment to actively involve the local community in decision-making on the fight against climate change. A participatory approach allows diverse perspectives to be taken into account, which in turn promotes effective and sustainable results. It is not only an information tool, but also a platform for social dialogue, strengthening the bond between citizens and decision-makers. In order to highlight Krakow's climate ambitions, it will also be necessary to include them in the update of the Krakow Development Strategy. This is a key strategic document of the city that integrates other relevant documents, plans and strategies. The current work on the update focuses on clearly distinguishing climate objectives, with climate, air and environmental protection as a separate strategic priority for the city.

The aforementioned plans have an important focus on cross-sectoral and regional cooperation. Krakow is not isolating itself in its climate efforts, but is engaging in partnerships with other actors in different sectors of the city's operation. Such collaboration is a key element of the global fight against climate change. It acts as a catalyst for the exchange of best practices, increasing the potential for multilateral benefits for the region.

There are also some challenges in the context of the strategies under consideration on the path of climate transformation.

The dynamics of climate change and technological advances impose on Krakow the need to continuously adapt its strategies. Sustainable mobility planning, energy infrastructure adaptation and other long-term strategies need to be flexible and open to new challenges. This requires systematic monitoring and updating to ensure that strategies remain effective in the long term.
Improving data availability. Limited access to comprehensive data on GHG emissions, energy consumption and other key environmental indicators makes it difficult to effectively assess progress and take appropriate action. There is a need to improve data availability and standardisation, enabling better monitoring and management of transformation processes.
Implementation of European legislation into national law. Harmonisation of national law with European climate directives is a key element of the transition. However, this process can be complex and time-consuming, requiring the adaptation of legal systems and the introduction of relevant legislation and procedures at national level.

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

O

Lack of implementing acts. Often, once climate legislation is adopted, there remains a lack of detailed implementing acts that clarify specific actions and targets. This lack of precise guidance can hinder the implementation of measures and the effective monitoring of progress.
Lack of or insufficient support programmes. Successful transformation requires support from government and public institutions. However, support programmes for businesses, economic sectors and local communities to adapt to climate change, innovate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions are often missing or insufficient.
The need for financial support to the Mission directly from the EU level. Achieving ambitious climate goals requires significant financial resources. However, national resources may not be sufficient, so it is important to provide financial support to the Mission directly from the European Union level, including through structural funds, investment programmes and other financial instruments.

The effectiveness of strategies also depends not only on their ambitious goals, but also on their effective implementation. Achieving the intended results can be hampered by limited financial resources, public resistance or technical difficulties in implementing projects. Managing projects, monitoring progress and adjusting activities accordingly are key elements of successful implementation.

Despite the financial commitment, there is also a risk of financial gaps in the implementation of ambitious plans. Finding sustainable and effective funding mechanisms is a key element of success. An appropriate balance between investment and efficient use of resources is essential to avoid interruptions to projects. It is therefore valuable not only to plan, but also to adapt flexibly to changing conditions, thus ensuring not only the sustainability of strategies, but also their effectiveness in the long term.

# Impact of policies and strategic management documents on Krakow's climate ambitions

The above-mentioned documents have a significant impact on the climate ambitions of the City of Krakow. At the local level, strategies such as 'Development Strategy for Krakow. Here I want to live. Kraków 2030" or plans such as the "Low Emission Management Plan for the Municipality of Krakow" set specific targets for reducing emissions and promoting sustainable practices. In turn, the "Kraków Green Deal" and the "Adaptation Plan of the City of Kraków to Climate Change by 2030" focus on increasing green areas and preparing the city for climate change, which reinforces Kraków's commitment to environmental sustainability. In addition, the "Environmental Protection Programme" and the "District Forestry Enhancement Programme" aim to improve air quality and increase forestation, which is key to mitigating the urban heat island effect and improving the wellbeing of residents.

At the regional level, documents such as the 'Metropolia Krakowska 2030 Strategy' and the 'Sustainable Mobility Plan' support wider metropolitan cooperation in achieving common climate goals. They emphasise sustainable mobility, cleaner energy and joint climate action, which is key to increasing the impact of local initiatives. "The Regional Climate and Energy Action Plan for the Małopolska Voivodeship" fits into these activities by offering a framework for comprehensive climate and energy strategies at the provincial level.
Kraków

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

O

At the national level, documents such as the "Energy Policy of Poland until 2040" and the "Clean Air Programme" provide general guidance and financial support for the transition to renewable energy sources and improved air quality. National directives help local governments align their initiatives with broader goals, ensuring consistency and strengthening efforts at the municipal level.

At the European level, the 'European Green Deal' and directives such as RED II and EPBD set ambitious targets for the use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. These documents create a supportive regulatory environment, encouraging local and regional authorities to take more ambitious climate action. The alignment of Krakow's local strategies with higher level policies underlines the city's commitment to achieving both national and EU climate targets, fostering a comprehensive approach to sustainable development.

The integration of local, regional, national and EU policies, strategies and strategic management instruments creates a robust framework to support Krakow's climate ambitions, leading the city to make significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and increase its resilience to climate change.

Selected indicator data from the documents described above were used to estimate the extent to which the commitment to achieve climate neutrality for the city by 2030 was covered. For this purpose, the Economic Model was used, which, after collecting the ambitious commitments until 2030, estimated the reduction potential at 59%. When several scenarios were included in a given document, the one that was more optimistic in terms of climate was selected.

The table above shows the estimated emissions effects of the above plans, assumptions and strategies and the changes that have occurred in Kraków's industry in the Nowa Huta area between 2018 and 2022 (blast furnace shutdown, large emission decreases) based on the Economic Model's calculation scheme. Baseline emissions are derived from the BAU 2030 scenario calculated using the Economic Model, based on the assumptions described in chapter 'Module A-1 Baseline GHG emissions inventory'. The differences between the results of the BAU 2030 scenario and the 2018 baseline inventory are small and amount to approximately 4%.

Based on the adopted plans and strategies and strategic management instruments, greenhouse gas emissions are projected to decrease by  $59\%$  by 2030 compared to the base year, which has been taken into account in the existing strategies. The main area of emission reduction is the energy sector, including both buildings, heating and electricity generation and industry. Planned changes in this sector are addressed both in national plans, such as the Energy Policy of Poland until 2040 (PEP2040) and the National Energy and Climate Plan until 2030, as well as local plans, e.g. "Assumptions to the Plan for Supplying the Municipality of Krakow with Heat, Electricity and Gas Fuels for the years 2023-2038". In spite of the current actions already included in the existing documents, there is still a  $21\%$  emissions gap to be addressed by focusing on new projects and actions in order to achieve the mission objectives.

The actions described further in Part B, will address precisely the  $21\%$  emissions gap. Closing this gap is essential to meet the goal of the Mission of 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030, which aims for an  $80\%$  reduction in emissions over the period in question. The  $21\%$  reduction in question translates into a direct emissions reduction target of 1,614,000 tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ . This reduction is also not evenly distributed. The greatest potential for emission reductions is in the energy, buildings and industry sectors.

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

O

The Municipality of Krakow faces the challenge of limited opportunities to influence the most emitting sector - energy generation. This is a major constraint as Krakow's transformation depends mainly on domestic investment in the energy sector. The city's current level of indebtedness prevents significant direct infrastructure investments in the energy sector within the city, which could significantly burden the budget.

Therefore, Krakow should focus on measures promoting distributed energy and thermo-modernisation of buildings, which can have a significant impact on the city's energy balance. These activities will contribute to reducing emissions and improving the quality of life of the inhabitants and will reduce the costs they have to pay for energy bills. In addition, encouraging private investors to undertake similar activities by providing appropriate financial incentives and tax breaks can accelerate the process of ecological upgrading of infrastructure.

Promoting renewable energy sources is a key aspect that Krakow should undertake in order to accelerate the transition to green energy. The development of appropriate local policies and strategies to support the development of photovoltaic installations, wind power plants and district heating based on renewable energy sources can contribute to a significant reduction in emissions and increase the city's energy independence. Climate and environmental education is an equally important area for Krakow to address. Through educational initiatives, information campaigns and environmental awareness programmes, the city can raise the level of citizens' awareness of the need to take action to protect the environment and support long-term changes for sustainable community development. In this way, despite the limitations on its direct impact on the energy sector, Krakow can actively contribute to reducing emissions and promoting sustainable development, which will benefit both the environment and the city's residents.

It is worth noting that the Economic Model forecasts an increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the waste sector. This is as a result of the fact that the model assumes an increase in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$  emissions, with the same levels of recycling of certain types of waste as in the base year, and takes into account the generation of heat from the waste incineration plant, the continued operation of which, unchanged, is necessary to reduce the share of heat generation from carbon sources by 2030. For this reason, a significant proportion of emissions from the waste sector have been attributed to residual emissions.

## 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic barriers and opportunities for achieving climate neutrality in 2030

### A-3.1: Description of urban systems, system barriers and development opportunities

Systemic and sectoral barriers stand in the way of Kraków's climate transformation. Identifying them, analysing them and taking action to reduce or abolish their negative impact will, together with levers for change, provide a powerful impetus for accelerating pro-climate action. The following barriers also apply to the vast majority of other Polish cities.

### SYSTEMIC BARRIERS:

No pattern of urban climate transformation.
Organisational weakness.
Too little involvement of residents/neighbourhoods and stakeholders.
Difficulties in building programmes with complex organisational structure, dependence on grants.
Insufficient cooperation between government and local authorities.
Lack of long-term financial investment support schemes (stability and predictability)

### 1. Lack of a pattern of urban climate transformation.

There is no one ready-made universal template for the climate transformation of cities. This is because each city has different systems and requires solutions tailored to local needs. Despite the existence of pioneering cities such as Copenhagen, their experiences cannot be transferred 1:1 to Polish systemic and legislative realities.

Meanwhile, expectations of a potential role model are too high and misplaced. They often focus on finding a ready-to-implement model to guarantee success. This is not the right approach because of the diverse problems and needs of individual cities and the need to be flexible in solving them.

Those patterns of action that are already in place are inadequate in relation to the scale and urgency of the challenges. For example, there is currently a dominant tendency to focus on electricity or waste recycling, which is not right in every context.

**Possible response to the barrier:** The answer to the lack of a universal template for urban climate transformation is to develop flexible and contextualised strategies (e.g. City Climate Contract). Kraków should engage in local public consultations to identify specific needs and opportunities. It is also important to create platforms for the exchange of experiences between cities so that best practices can be adapted to local conditions. Investing in research and pilot projects will allow different solutions to be tested and scaled up as needed. It is also crucial to work with the private sector and NGOs to jointly develop innovative and sustainable technologies and practices.
Kraków

## 2. Organisational weakness.

The organisational weakness of local authorities is mainly due to the siloed nature of municipal structures Horizontal knowledge sharing and cooperation between organisational units of the authority is insufficient.

The position of climate units in the structure of the offices is not strong enough. Decision makers underestimate the importance of the climate crisis, so that the transition units in the offices are often not taken fully seriously. Their tasks and decisions are not prioritised in city management and the teams built are too small. This is due, among other reasons, to the lack of tangible benefits of engaging in pro-climate activities for decision-makers.

An additional barrier related to organisational weakness is the lack of qualified clerical staff, which is mainly due to underfunded offices and low salaries. The subject of transformation itself is also new and challenging, which does not facilitate the building of strong clerical teams.

**Possible response to the barrier:** In order to strengthen the organisation of local authorities, it is necessary to promote horizontal cooperation between municipal organisational units through the creation of interdepartmental project teams (e.g. the Advisory Team of the Zero Emission Krakow Portfolio Council, used in the consultation of the Action Plan). The importance of climate units in the structure of offices should be increased, giving them more autonomy and influence over decisions. It is also worth investing in training and qualification of officials to increase their competence in the field of climate transformation.

## 3. Too little involvement of residents/neighbourhoods and stakeholders.

A pressing problem is low stakeholder engagement, which is largely due to the failure of authorities at various levels to use language based on financial and non-financial benefits. There is a lack of a message based on the reliable benefits of transformation, both material and those related to, for example, health. Currently, the message about the need for it is mainly focused on coercion.

Residents and officials also have a sense of lack of agency, ineffective action and aimlessness in pursuing transformation. This is partly related to the distant time horizon of the transformation - it is mostly mentioned in the context of 2040/2050 and there is a lack of demonstration of successes already achieved.

The enthusiasm of residents is often not properly channelled, there is also the phenomenon of 'greenwashing', which portrays measures that in reality have little impact on the climate as pro-climate.

Underlying the low level of stakeholder engagement is also an insufficient understanding of the severity of the climate crisis, which affects residents as well as officials and decision-makers. This dovetails with the lack of educational activities and information campaigns conducted on a broad scale.

In the context of our city, the lack of resources for financial incentives or promotional and information campaigns is also a problem.

**Possible response to a barrier:** To increase the involvement of residents and stakeholders, the local government should use the language of benefits, highlighting both the material and health benefits of the climate transition. It is important to run information campaigns that showcase the successes already

Krako

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

achieved and present the concrete, local benefits that the transition will bring in the shorter term. It is also important to involve the community in the decision-making process to increase the sense of agency and influence over change. Organising educational initiatives and promoting transparency of activities can help build greater understanding and involvement among residents.

## 4. Difficulties in building programmes with complex organisational structure, dependence on grants.

Energy transformation is a huge challenge, large-scale tasks involving stakeholders belonging to many groups: local government, business, private owners, academia are needed. Implementing multi-scale projects that most cities have not yet implemented and are not prepared for.

Meanwhile, the frequent lack of internal cooperation and adequate governance makes it difficult to build comprehensive and effective programmes to foster transformation. In addition, the lack of appropriate legal instruments, legislative inconsistencies and shortcomings, and the thematic complexity of transformation itself further inhibit the construction of good support programmes.

A low sense of responsibility among stakeholders is also a barrier. When building programmes and looking for financial instruments, the lack of ownership among stakeholders, especially business, is also a problem. They often 'shift' this responsibility to local authorities, government and consumers, whose competences are often limited.

**A possible answer to the barrier:** To overcome the difficulties in building complex energy transition programmes, it is necessary to strengthen internal cooperation and effective project management, involving all stakeholders, including business, local governments and academic institutions. Legislation also needs to be simplified and clarified (Module C-1 - Organisation and Management Innovation) and clear legislative instruments need to be put in place to support the transition. It is also crucial to increase ownership among all stakeholders, promoting public-private partnerships and collective action to build effective support programmes and find appropriate sources of funding.

## 5. Insufficient cooperation between government and local authorities.

The lack of a government climate neutrality strategy and the low ambition of existing policy documents is one of the most important barriers, which translates into the lack of a coherent and shared vision for transformation. Programmes also often have ill-defined targets and indicators, which do not translate into tangible environmental benefits.

Progress is blocked by conflicts of competence and regulatory contradictions. Lack of sufficient cooperation with the government stems, among other things, from the unclear division of competences between different ministries, as well as between central government and local authorities. The problem is compounded by a lack of consistency and legislative uncertainty, which translates into a lack of trust and strategic decisions. Regulations for support programmes at national, local and intra-governmental levels are complex. They are characterised by complex language and a "thicket" of rules and criteria, which makes them difficult to implement and difficult for stakeholders to understand.

There is a lack of an effective platform for cooperation between government and local governments, which is not conducive to urban climate transformation. Central authorities often underestimate the potential of local governments to shape change and fail to share knowledge and decision-making with them. Climate policy is also often lost to the current political agenda, the primacy of current issues over climate action is evident.
Kraków

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

O

Possible response to the barrier: In order to improve cooperation between the government and local governments on climate transformation, it is necessary to create a clear and ambitious government climate neutrality strategy that addresses and coordinates actions at all levels of government. It is also crucial to simplify regulations and set clear targets and indicators to monitor progress and achieve measurable environmental benefits. Introducing an effective collaborative platform that enables knowledge sharing and decision-making between government and local governments, will help build trust and a shared vision for transformation. These topics are being addressed in meetings set up as part of the collaboration with ministries in agreeing the vision of the Mission Cities Climate Contracts.

Lack of long-term financial investment support schemes (stability and predictability).

A very important barrier in the context of energy transition and RES investments is the lack of long-term financing and investment support schemes. In the context of RES investments, stability and predictability are crucial for investors, as these projects require significant financial resources and are long-term in nature. Lack of certainty about the continuation of support or its changes in the short term may discourage investors from engaging in such projects.

Achieving climate neutrality for energy companies requires huge investments. Most such investments are capital-intensive projects, with significant capital expenditure needs and a lead time of several years. In the long term, however, they bring significant benefits that outweigh the investment costs over time. However, such activities and projects need stability and predictability, especially in the context of national laws and strategies at the national level. Consistency in regulation, funding mechanisms and adequate legislative support is necessary for investor security.

Long-term financial support schemes, such as the feed-in tariff scheme, allow investors to plan their investments for the long term, as they offer stability and certainty about prices, income levels and returns. However, if such long-term support is lacking, investors may be concerned about the risk of changes in policy or the legal environment, which may affect the viability of their projects.

As a result, the lack of stable and predictable financial support schemes is a significant barrier to the development of RES investments, as it can lead to reduced investments and delays in project implementation, which in turn can have a negative impact on the development of the sector and the achievement of climate neutrality targets.

Possible response to the barrier: Introducing stable and predictable regulatory and financial frameworks, which are essential to increase investor confidence and accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. Such support schemes allow investors to effectively manage risks and minimise uncertainties associated with investments in the renewable energy sector.

Key findings from the identification of system barriers:

Systemic barriers to climate transformation fall into several key categories - organisational, financial, legislative-political and social.
Governance at the local government level is an extremely important action. They need to undergo significant systemic change, including breaking down siloed internal structures and giving greater prominence to the units responsible for climate transformation.
The widest possible awareness of the transformation needs to be built among decision-makers, residents

and business, which will require changes in communication and more investment in education and information campaigns.

A key role in breaking down barriers must be played by central government, which should work effectively with local authorities, define a coherent vision of transformation and be characterised by high ambition in action. In the current situation, however, the initiative must come mainly from the cities.

# SECTORAL BARRIERS:

Buildings and construction.
Renewable energy sources.
Transport.
Finance.

# 1. Buildings and construction.

The energy transformation of the city, especially in the context of the buildings sector, faces a number of challenges that require a comprehensive approach and sustainable solutions.

One of the most significant constraints is that only a small percentage of buildings are owned by the city, while the rest are owned by private entities. The complexity of building ownership raises administrative and organisational challenges. The introduction of uniform energy efficiency standards becomes more difficult when the diversity of private owners with varying financial resources has to be taken into account. Private owners may be less willing to invest in modern technologies given the rising cost of living, which in turn makes a coordinated approach to improving energy efficiency on a wider scale more difficult.

Another major challenge is the high cost of construction and building materials, which has a direct impact on the feasibility of carrying out thermal modernisation of buildings. Rising material prices are influencing resistance to carrying out retrofitting work, especially for older buildings that require complex repair work. The inability to meet the financial challenges of thermomodernisation translates into low energy efficiency, which in the long term is the cause of the generation of additional costs associated with high energy bills.

An additional complication for the city's energy transition is the fact that much of the energy is produced in plants that are not under the control of the municipal authorities. This limits the city's influence on the energy source structure, making it difficult to implement a sustainable energy policy. By not being able to decide on the type of fuel or technology used to produce energy, the city can become dependent on traditional sources, such as coal, instead of using greener solutions.

In the case of dynamically developing cities such as Krakow, the increase in the number of buildings and inhabitants introduces additional challenges. This requires adapting infrastructure to new needs, which in turn generates logistical and financial costs. Demand for energy grows as the city expands, raising the question of whether the city can provide enough energy resources while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Kraków

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

#

In the context of the buildings sector, additional challenges encountered by the City of Kraków include the lack of focus of national programmes to support the decarbonisation of buildings. Current initiatives are mainly focused on improving air quality, often neglecting aspects related to energy efficiency or the use of renewable energy sources in the building sector. The lack of a clear national strategy targeting the decarbonisation of buildings can make it difficult for municipal authorities to access the necessary funding and support required to implement ambitious retrofit projects.

Another major challenge is the lack of consistent building data, measurements and analyses carried out on a large scale. Insufficient data hinders an accurate understanding of the current energy situation of buildings in the city. The lack of precise information prevents fully effective planning and decision-making regarding energy efficiency investments and building retrofits. Expanding the level of available knowledge, as well as carrying out comprehensive analyses and measurements, is key to effectively assessing the effects and costs of energy transformation measures for buildings.

In the buildings sector, the fragmentation of decisions on thermal modernisation also poses a considerable challenge. The lack of large-scale integrated planning for building energy efficiency prevents the full potential of the land around buildings and economies of scale from being realised. This acts as a constraint on the ability to develop coherent strategies and effectively manage urban resources, making it difficult to plan multiple thermal upgrading projects simultaneously.

Last, but not least, are historic buildings. Due to their unique character and cultural value, thermomodernisation often faces legal obstacles and resistance from the public. In spite of the benefits that energy efficiency improvements would bring, there is a concern that the changes may damage the original character of these historic buildings.

In summary, energy transformation of the city's building sector requires a holistic approach, taking into account the diversity of owners, financial, cultural and infrastructural aspects. Successful action requires collaboration between the public and private sectors, innovative financing models, and sustainable long-term plans. It is also worth remaining flexible and open to new technologies in order to effectively address today's urban energy transition challenges.

**Possible response to the barrier:** The energy transformation of Kraków's building sector can be strengthened by expanding existing and introducing new financial incentives for private building owners to invest in energy efficiency, which could offset differences in financial resources, and promoting thermo-modernisation through the ESCO formula. An educational campaign that speaks the language of benefits and facilitates access to technical solutions that have been developed and are ready to be implemented is also key. In addition, cooperation with the private sector should be developed to increase the share of renewable energy sources and the integration of data and analysis should be promoted to enable better planning and efficient management of thermo-modernisation projects.

**2. Renewable energy sources.**

Renewable energy sources (RES) are one of several sectors where the city's energy transition faces numerous barriers. In Kraków, the key aspects that hinder the successful implementation of RES are likely to be the same as in other large cities in the region.

A major constraint is the lack of available land for the location of photovoltaic farms. In cities such as Kraków, where space is limited, finding suitable areas to install solar panels becomes a challenge. Urban
Krako

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

building structures limit the availability of land, and the prices of vacant land available on the market far outweigh the financial benefits investors can achieve from PV farms.

An additional problem is the location restrictions for some forms of RES, such as windmills. Windmills require specific atmospheric conditions. The Małopolska region is a place with one of the worst conditions for the location of such investments in Poland. The area is not distinguished by high wind speeds compared to other provinces. Furthermore, the presence of numerous protected areas and the varied morphology of the terrain are not conducive to the development of wind energy on an industrial scale. This is a major obstacle to the efficient use of wind energy, which in turn limits the city's potential for green energy.

The location in the basin also contributes to poor weather conditions, especially in winter. During periods of heavy fog or smog, the efficiency of photovoltaic installations can drop significantly, negatively affecting the overall performance of renewable energy sources. Atmospheric conditions are a key factor in determining the efficiency of different RES technologies, and their instability poses a challenge for a city aiming to use green energy sources.

Significant investment costs are another barrier to the development of RES in the city. The introduction of new technologies, especially on a large scale, involves high costs that can be a burden on the budget of residents and private investors. Despite the potential savings in the long term, the initial investment can be a barrier to rapid and massive RES development.

In the context of RES, the lack of a developed energy storage structure is also a significant challenge. RES, such as solar and wind power, generate energy in an unstable manner, dependent on weather conditions. Without effective energy storage systems, it is difficult to store surplus energy generated during periods of good weather, to be used at times when weather conditions are less favourable. The lack of adequate storage infrastructure therefore poses a challenge to the stability of energy supply in cities that want to augment their energy mix with renewable energy sources.

However, it should be emphasised that some barriers can be overcome by the benefits of RES especially for individual consumers. A current problem is the rising price of energy, which is largely generated from fossil fuels. As civilisation progresses, our need for electricity to power a variety of devices is increasing. In addition, the transformation of the passenger car sector from internal combustion engines to electric cars is also leading to an increased demand for energy. Renewable energy sources could be the solution to this problem. Thanks to renewable energy sources, we are able to become partially independent of suppliers and can cover our energy needs with our own installation. These types of installations do not additionally require the supply of raw materials, so that the large investment contribution is offset over time by lower bills.

In conclusion, despite the potential benefits of renewable energy sources, cities such as Krakow face a number of difficulties related to location, weather conditions, investment costs and the lack of a developed storage infrastructure.

**Possible answer to the barrier:** The energy transformation of the city of Krakow in the context of renewable energy sources (RES) can be supported by investing in modern energy storage technologies, enabling the efficient use of energy generated during periods of good weather. In addition, promoting legislative and financial initiatives to reduce the costs of RES investments can increase the attractiveness of such solutions for private investors and city residents.

about the financial and environmental benefits of RES technologies should contribute to a significant increase in the dynamics of the energy transition.

# 3. Transport.

The transport sector is emerging as a key barrier and a significant challenge in the context of the city's climate neutrality. By analysing various aspects, we can identify factors that hinder a successful transition.

The first major problem is the lack of access to precise data in Krakow's inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector. The lack of precise information on actual  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions makes it difficult to take action. Real emissions are undoubtedly higher than assumed, highlighting the urgent need to provide more precise data and to correct strategies related to reducing the environmental impact of transport. This is particularly evident when comparing  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  with other Polish cities, where emissions from the transport sector are significantly higher, despite a smaller population.

In the Urban Inventory, emissions from the transport sector are calculated in an indirect way and compared to other emission calculation methods, as well as other cities with similar characteristics to Krakow, this sector appears to be underestimated. For example, the "Google Environmental Insights Explorer" tool, which also uses the GPC methodology, estimates emissions from the transport sector in 2018 at 1,230,000 thousand tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  e, when according to the Urban Inventory emissions are estimated at around 500,000 thousand tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  e. Another reference could be the city of Wroclaw, which is similar to Krakow in many respects. According to the data, 1,245,368 tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  e were emitted from road transport in the Wroclaw area in 2021. Therefore, real emissions in Kraków from the transport sector may be higher and may require more measures aimed at reducing them.

In the winter season (mainly) the lack of alternatives to the car becomes a clear limitation. In spite of reasonably well-functioning public transport in the city centre, there are transport barriers to commuting to Krakow from neighbouring municipalities without access to the fast agglomeration railway. Public transport to such locations is often insufficiently well developed, forcing commuters to travel to the city centre by car. In addition, an insufficient number of Park&amp;Ride sites contributes to infrequent transfers from car to public transport during a single trip. These barriers make giving up individual means of transport an unattractive option for those living outside the city centre.

An additional challenge is the reluctance of the public to give up combustion vehicles. The introduction of restrictions on the use of traditional cars is being met with resistance from parts of society, which is hindering the effective implementation of measures to improve air quality and reduce emissions. One reason for this is certainly the price. New electric cars from the showroom are more expensive on average by PLN 100 000 compared to their conventionally driven counterparts. In addition, the price of electric cars is increasing faster than that of combustion cars. According to the Research and Automotive Institute Samar, the weighted average price of a new passenger car in 2022 (as of August) was PLN 151 541 (13.6% more than in 2021), while that of an electric car was PLN 245 034 (23.8% more than in 2021). In addition to this, the aftermarket for electric cars is only just developing and is incomparably smaller than for combustion cars, a situation that will take time to improve.

There is also the problem of a lack of infrastructure to meet the demand for chargers for electric vehicles. The insufficient number of charging stations, as well as the difficulty in connecting new chargers to existing infrastructure, means that the growing demand for electric vehicles is not sufficiently supported.
#

Kraków

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

#

In summary, the transport sector appears as an area where the transformation of the city faces a number of difficulties. Lack of access to accurate data, lack of alternatives in the winter period, public resistance and insufficient infrastructure for electric vehicles are significant barriers requiring comprehensive strategies and actions to successfully re-model the way transport operates in Krakow. In the context of implementing the most crucial measures towards achieving a zero-carbon city, a priority for Krakow should be to focus on the development of rail infrastructure, increasing the share of efficient travel by public transport and developing a network of chargers for electric cars.

**Possible response to the barrier:** The transformation of Kraków's transport sector can be supported by improving the data collection system for  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ , allowing a more precise strategy to be developed to reduce the environmental impact of transport. The development of alternative forms of urban transport, such as agglomeration high-speed rail and the expansion of the Park&amp;Ride network, can reduce reliance on individual cars, particularly from neighbouring municipalities. Educational and financial campaigns to encourage a switch to electric vehicles can reduce  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ , despite high initial costs and public resistance to new technologies. It is also crucial to invest in the expansion of electric vehicle charging infrastructure to meet the growing demand for green solutions in urban transport.

# 4. Finance.

Kraków's finances represent a significant barrier and challenge to the energy transition process. By analysing key financial aspects, we can identify factors that hinder the effective implementation of climate investments.

The first important element is the indebtedness of cities, including Krakow. Debt limits the flexibility to decide on new investments, including in the area of energy transition activities. Debt forces the need to control spending and reduce investment activity in many sectors of activity.

In view of future financial commitments including loans, the city may face with limited financial resources available for new investments. In the context of the energy transition, where innovative projects and infrastructure are needed, limited resources can be a significant brake on ambitious climate action.

According to the Economic Model, an important part of the city's climate transformation should be financed indirectly by residents and private investors. The city has limited influence over these processes, which makes it even more difficult to implement sustainability plans. Without the right tools and financial support for residents and private investors, the city may face difficulties in encouraging capital investment in pro-climate measures.

In the face of these challenges, Krakow needs to develop innovative financing strategies, seeking new sources of capital and partnerships to accelerate the energy transition. Increased awareness among residents and collaboration with the private sector could be the key to overcoming financial barriers while enabling the city's sustainable development.

**Possible response to the barrier:** Krakow's energy transition in the face of financial barriers can be supported by restructuring the city's debt and controlling spending to free up resources for climate investments. It is also crucial to seek new sources of funding, such as public-private partnerships and investment from residents, to increase the availability of capital for sustainable development projects.

# Levers of Change

Levers of Change are those places in a complex system where a small adjustment leads to a big change in the whole system. These can be technology, regulation and governance, financial and business models, social innovation, organisational capacity. In terms of barriers, both systemic and sectoral, the following levers of change were identified from NetZeroCities' 'Theory Of Change':

Technology/Infrastructure:
In the area of technology and infrastructure, levers for change include the introduction of modern environmentally friendly technologies such as renewable energy sources, efficient energy technologies and innovative transport solutions. The city's infrastructure must be brought up to sustainable standards, which includes a wide range of solutions from buildings to transport systems.

Governance and Policy:
Levers for change in the area of governance and policy refer to effective strategies and regulations that support the goals of sustainable development and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This includes the implementation of urban plans, transport policies, and energy efficiency regulations.

Social Innovation:
Social innovation as a lever for change encompasses innovative approaches by local communities and NGOs in addressing climate-related issues. These can be community engagement projects, local government initiatives or educational programmes that promote environmental awareness and pro-climate behaviour.

Democracy and Social Participation:
In the context of the levers of democratic change and public participation, it is crucial to involve residents in the decision-making processes of the city's climate transformation. This includes public consultations, public debates and participation in the urban planning process.

# A-3.3: Description or visualisation of the participatory model of climate neutrality of the city

Achieving climate neutrality for Krakow requires the involvement of all groups of residents and stakeholders. This means real cooperation, i.e. moving up the ladder of participation (Sherry Arnstein, 1969). In the case of Krakow, this means moving from what was considered apparent cooperation (informing residents, consulting on solutions and easing tensions only when they arise) to realising cooperation properly (partnership, delegation and citizen control).

Krakow engages with residents and stakeholders on the subject of pro-climate action through:

direct meetings with representatives of Krakow's NGOs;
implementation of citizens' assemblies;
activities involving Kraków's businesses and universities;
advisory and co-decision-making activities at the strategic level.

# 1. Cooperation with Kraków's NGOs:

Direct cooperation was established during the Climate-KIC project 'Kraków: Deep Demonstration of Healthy, Clean Cities'. Krakow's NGOs were crucial in helping to co-create the 'Krakow Position Paper Towards a Healthy Clean Krakow' in 2020, which provided the foundation for the City's further carbon reduction efforts. They also set out their expectations for collaboration during a series of pro-climate meetings with officials in 2021. In 2021 and 2022, they participated in both of Krakow's citizens' assembly, taking on important roles: providing expertise during educational meetings, as well as a monitoring function during the deliberation process and forging the assembly's recommendations.

# 2. Krakow Citizen Assembly of Climate

A citizen assembly is a way of making important decisions by a randomly selected group of male and female citizens, whose role is to decide on an issue, taking into account the common good. This group is intended to represent the general population of the city.

Kraków's first citizen assembly took place in 2021 and was dedicated to climate change and the city's climate neutrality. Its participants worked on recommendations on the topic: "How can the City of Krakow and citizens reduce energy consumption and increase the use of renewable energy?"

A total of 589 Krakow residents applied to take part in the Assembly, to whom one of 20,000 invitations was sent. The youngest candidate was 16 years old, the oldest - 87. A group of 60 panellists was selected from among them, representative for the entire Kraków community, who started their participation in the Assembly with three educational meetings. The educational meetings included 39 speeches by representatives of the magistrate's office, municipal units, experts, scientists and representatives of non-governmental organisations. They were open to all willing listeners (online).

This was followed by deliberative meetings, in small groups under the guidance of a facilitation team. These were not televised. As a result, more than 100 proposals for recommendations were developed in areas such as: Krakow's climate strategy, renewable energy sources, education and participation,

energy saving, municipal lighting, thermo-modernisation or spatial planning. The partial proposals were then refined, combined into larger ones and put to a vote. The Mayor of Krakow was presented with 32 final recommendations, which received at least 80% support among the panellists during the vote. All voted recommendations were considered binding by the Mayor.

# 3. Kraków Transport Assembly

Following the success of the climate assembly, Krakow 2022 organised a citizens' assembly on transport, the Krakow Transport Citizen Assembly (KTCA). It sought answers to the question "How can the City of Kraków and residents influence the further development of sustainable transport measures?". Participants tackled the development of recommendations on this topic based on the areas of: optimising transport in the city, how to provide parking spaces, reducing emissions from transport, managing vehicle traffic within the city.

In a two-stage draw, a group of 80 people was selected to attend Assembly meetings.

The three educational meetings were followed by two deliberative meetings, the second of which was also a wrap-up meeting where voting took place. As many as 43 recommendations received a minimum of 80 per cent support from the voters and were also positively endorsed by the monitoring panel. In accordance with the panel, proposals with such support were considered binding by the president and are being successively implemented.

# 4. Climate Pact

The Pact was established in 2022 to increase the involvement of businesses, public institutions, community organisations and academia operating in Kraków in the pursuit of climate neutrality and climate change mitigation. The Pact included eleven entities, nine from the business sector - large Krakow businesses and business organisations - and two Krakow universities. The result was a platform for cooperation between the individual signatories and the City and other participants.

The partners agree to take action to reduce global warming, to create climate strategies and to regularly inform the city of actions taken in line with the principles of the Pact. Assumptions of the Pact:

Limiting global warming: A joint declaration of action to limit temperature increase below 2°C and preferably to 1.5°C;
company climate strategies: Adhering companies commit to developing climate strategies within two years of joining the Pact;
Annual reporting: the entities undertake to report annually on the status of implementation of their strategies to the Department of Municipal Affairs and Climate of the City of Krakow.

The Climate Pact is an expression of support for the City's efforts and active involvement in activities leading to climate neutrality. The initiative is also a platform for the exchange of experience between partners involved in pro-climate activities, the promotion of climate-friendly solutions and, ultimately, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The inclusion of more partners shows that Krakow's climate transformation can and should be discussed and acted upon together.

system, implementing them in project methodologies, more recently also as project portfolios. The portfolio is intended to aggregate pro-climate initiatives (tasks, projects, programmes) implemented by the City of Krakow and to manage them efficiently in order to achieve the climate-related strategic goals indicated in the "Development Strategy of Krakow. This is where I want to live. Kraków 2030." The implementation of the Portfolio will make Krakow a city developing in a sustainable way, striving for economic prosperity and the health of its inhabitants in harmony with the environment and taking into account the needs of future generations, resilient to extreme climate phenomena, coping with the effects of these phenomena, economical and friendly to inhabitants and visitors.

The Portfolio Advisory Panel is an opinion-giving body, influential in shaping the City's policy, advisory to the Portfolio Council, composed of prominent representatives from the world of science, politics, business, local government, NGOs. It provides opinions and advice on projects and programmes. Submits projects and programmes whose objectives and scope may fit into the Portfolio Strategy. It is composed of permanent and appointed members to discuss specific projects, topics for Council meetings. The work of the Advisory Team does not have a rigid timetable, as the individual members of the Team have different amounts of time and different levels of ability or even willingness to get involved. Nonetheless, the Team is a strong group of people representing business, academia, local government and non-governmental organisations that have a significant influence on the City's climate policy.

# B-1.2: Description of the impact pathways

In order to ensure comparability of the emission sectors with the data contained in the Investment Plan, the impact pathways are described by the sectors resulting from the Economic Model described in chapter "Module A-1 Baseline Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventory".

The impact pathways indicated above, focusing on five key sectors, simultaneously cover six main system levers. It is noteworthy how a large number of actions are assigned to the Building and Heating and Electricity sectors. These sectors are the main source of emissions in Krakow and also the main factor responsible for the emissions gap. In this context, the levers for change focus primarily on technological investments to increase energy efficiency and a sustainable transformation of the energy system.

Even with state-of-the-art energy efficiency technologies for buildings in the municipal area, achieving climate neutrality on the scale of a large city like Krakow will require significant investment in upgrading the region's energy system, which operates independently of Krakow. Intergovernmental and local government cooperation therefore appears to be a key aspect.

Defining a common pathway for climate and energy transformation at different territorial levels becomes an extremely key element in achieving the mission's goals. With the co-creation of a common pathway of change between the City of Krakow and government authorities, a much stronger message can be developed. By working together, each party can then focus on implementing the actions over which it has real influence, making the effectiveness of such cooperation invaluable.

With this approach, Krakow can focus on taking action within its territorial scope, such as educational initiatives within the city, promoting and supporting the use of renewable energy sources, engaging in work related to the modernisation and energy efficiency of buildings, developing the public transport system and actively supporting technological innovation in the field of energy within the city. Governmental and local government becomes a key factor for the successful implementation of such a complex transformation process.

Contemporary cities are increasingly making efforts to achieve climate neutrality, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. However, these efforts do not only benefit the environment, but also local communities. The climate neutrality action pathways identified above also demonstrate the range of indirect benefits that result from climate transformation. The list of co-benefits that result from these efforts and describe the wide range of positive effects they can have on the city's residents and its socio-economic and environmental development is as follows:

Job creation: job creation in renewable energy, high-tech construction or high-tech industries means increased employment opportunities for local residents, which can lead to reduced unemployment and economic growth.
Lower energy bills for residents: by investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency, residents will be able to enjoy lower energy bills, which brings real savings to their household budgets.
Reducing the urban heat island: measures to reduce the urban heat island, such as green roofs, urban parks and tree canopies, can help reduce the effects of hot weather by improving the thermal comfort of residents and reducing the need for home air conditioning, reducing energy demand.
Increase in capital invested in climate projects and activities: investment in climate neutrality projects attracts external capital to the city, which can support economic development and new initiatives for environmental development or new technologies.
Reducing fuel poverty: improving energy efficiency and access to cheap energy can help to reduce fuel poverty by providing residents with stable and affordable energy prices.
Involving citizens in the co-creation of climate neutrality measures: active involvement of citizens in the creation and implementation of climate neutrality measures can lead to greater public awareness and support for such initiatives.
Development of public participation processes: climate neutrality initiatives can foster the development of public participation processes, enabling residents to actively participate in decisions affecting their environment.
Reduced air pollution: the reduction of pollutant emissions associated with traditional energy production and transport can contribute to improved air quality, which benefits residents' health and the environment.
Less noise pollution: the development of public transport, including electric means of transport and the reduction of car traffic, can lead to a reduction in noise levels in the city, with benefits for the mental health of residents.
Increased road safety: investment in infrastructure for public transport, cycling and pedestrians, as well as a reduction in car traffic, can improve road safety, reducing accidents.
Improving residents fitness and health: clean air, a safe environment and an active lifestyle, e.g. through cycling or walking, can contribute to improving the physical and mental health of residents.

#

Increase in improved wellbeing: including improved health, cleaner air and more green spaces can contribute to an overall increase in residents' satisfaction and sense of happiness.
Development of green spaces: investment in city parks, community gardens and green spaces not only improves the aesthetics of the city, but also offers places for recreation, relaxation and social gatherings for residents.
Developing a circular economy: working towards a circular economy promotes the sustainable use of resources and the minimisation of waste, which can create new jobs and accelerate the development of the local economy.
Increase recycling rates: promoting recycling and waste separation can lead to a reduction in landfill waste, which benefits the environment and reduces negative impacts on public health.
New structural linkages of green spaces: the development of green spaces can foster the creation of new urban ecosystems, increasing biodiversity and creating new ecological links between urban areas.
Increased qualifications and skills of citizens: training and education programmes related to climate neutrality can increase the qualifications and skills of citizens, which in turn can lead to greater competitiveness in the labour market and increased personal development.

These co-benefits not only contribute to the quality of life of residents, but also support the sustainability of the city and its communities. The above-mentioned co-benefits have a well-defined calculation method presented in the document provided by NetZeroCities for cities "Comprehensive Indicator Framework". The City of Krakow plans to use the described methodology to calculate the co-benefits in future iterations of the document.

Due to Krakow's geographical conditions, these measures focus on photovoltaic activities. Other energy sources, such as wind, hydro and geothermal energy, have a weak potential in Krakow and such infrastructure should be better exploited in other regions. In Krakow, however, there is significant potential for the location of photovoltaic devices on rooftops. Google's Environmental Insights Explorer estimates that the potential of these devices is capable of offsetting more than 800,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. In addition, major energy companies are planning significant investments to put photovoltaic farms beyond the rooftop, which could further increase the potential of this sector. The storage of energy generated by RES is also important, so there is a need to analyse the feasibility of different ways of storing it, e.g. with hydrogen.

E-11, TR-1: The City of Krakow is committed to finding measures and projects that can have a noticeable impact on the city's energy balance. To this end, measures are being implemented to modernise the city's lighting system. In addition to the mere replacement of the infrastructure with newer ones, intelligent and automated urban lighting management systems are also being designed to save energy consumption while maintaining the comfort of the inhabitants.

BIC-8, E-12, E-13: In addition, the ATELIER, NEEST and COMANAGE projects aim to create smart, environmentally friendly cities through innovative urban planning and urban resource management approaches. They focus on activities related to large-scale thermal retrofit projects in urban quarters and the creation of local energy communities.  |

In order to achieve the objectives of the measure, thermomodernisation should be taking into account different investment financing schemes.
Krakow plans to develop existing subsidy programmes for the thermal modernisation of buildings and create new ones. A key milestone for the development of the entire strategy and plan for thermomodernisation will be the results of the NEEST - NetZero Emission and Environmentally Sustainable Territories project. This project will bring ready-made technological solutions, prepared for immediate scaling and implementation in other urban quarters. It will also be necessary to attract new  |

|   | non-municipal funding to support thermo-modernisation programmes - for which it will be necessary to use funds allocated from the National Reconstruction Plan for thermomodernisation.

In order to expand the various forms of support for thermal modernisation, the Municipality of Krakow is implementing two government programmes: Stop Smog Programme and Warm Housing Programme. Obtaining subsidies under these programmes requires the participation of the Municipality, which applies for funding and implements the programmes.

On 14.06.2024, the Municipality of Krakow concluded an agreement with the WFOŚiGW for co-financing within the framework of the Priority Programme "Warm Housing". The subject of this Agreement is the granting to the Municipality by the WFOŚiGW of a subsidy in the amount of PLN 3 million from the funds made available to the WFOŚiGW by the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for the implementation of undertakings under the above-mentioned programme. At present, the Municipality of Krakow is implementing the Warm Housing Programme for housing communities of three to seven flats.

The Stop Smog programme, adopted by a resolution of the Krakow City Council, supports the replacement of heat sources that do not meet low-emission standards and thermo-modernisation in single-family buildings of the least affluent. The programme aims to reduce emissions and improve air quality.

In addition, based on the recommendation of the Krakow Climate Assembly, a draft Programme for the thermomodernisation of multi-family buildings has been developed and is awaiting funding for further implementation.

On the other hand, the measure assumes a significant increase in the share of thermal modernisation with private funds through the ESCO (Energy Service Company) formula. The company interested in ESCO-type financing commits its financial resources to carrying out the modernisation project at the customer's site, and recovers its investment (including remuneration) through staggered payments obtained through the savings generated by the  |

| --- | --- | --- |
|   |   |  Another method of encouraging building thermo-modernisation will be to promote comprehensive One Stop Shop (OSS) building retrofit services to speed up and facilitate the retrofit process. The One Stop Shop formula involves a service that provides the most comprehensive possible service to the owner (investor) of the building that is to undergo energy retrofitting. The aim of this formula is to facilitate, encourage, simplify and accelerate the process and, as a result, to increase the rate of building refurbishment.  |
|   |   |  Historic buildings have an important role in the large-scale process of thermal modernisation in Krakow. The FuturHist project, implemented by European cities of great historical value (including Krakow), will provide technical solutions for their modernisation. The aim of the project is to develop efficient and cost-effective solutions which will allow historic buildings to reduce their energy demand by at least 60% while maintaining their historical and cultural values.  |

|   |  Type of action | Financial and technical action.  |
|   |  Description of operation | The measure aims to develop individual electricity generation using private photovoltaic panels on the roofs of buildings and thermal energy through heat pumps. The assumed result is the use of more than 32% of the roof area of buildings in the city for the installation of PV systems and the exploitation of opportunities for RES installations on industrial buildings and brownfield sites.

The Urban Planning Department of the City of Krakow is currently working on changes to the current local plan for the 'Nowa Huta Przyszłości - Igołomska Południe' area. The new version of the plan will facilitate the installation of PV on buildings by private entrepreneurs and will allow the establishment of photovoltaic farms on post-industrial agricultural land.

For the smooth implementation of PV installations, cooperation at local and regional level will be necessary with conservationists. Under this measure, the City of Krakow plans to launch a support programme for the preparation of comprehensive project documentation for the installation of RES on historic buildings. Currently such a project is already being implemented by the municipal unit KEGW in the area of the Cultural Park - Nowa Huta.

The Municipality of Krakow is actively involved in in the dissemination of distributed energy generation by  |
|   |   | the project.  |

|   |  | supporting prosumer initiatives, providing subsidies and advisory support. As a result, the growth rate of new PV installations is accelerating year on year. Between 2020 and 2021, more than 19% of newly connected installations were with municipal PROZE programme financial support. A significant opportunity for the intensification of existing programmes and the creation of new ones is provided by the acquisition of significant municipal funding from the National Reconstruction Plan. The first funds from the plan have already been granted to the municipality for the implementation of pilot and innovative RES projects in the city.  |

|   |  | city is densely built-up, which makes it a problem to find a suitable area for the construction of farms. Within the administrative borders of the city, post-industrial areas - ash and slag dumps - have great potential. The Municipality of Krakow is looking for new sites with the possibility to develop PV farms in neighbouring municipalities. This provides new business opportunities in the metropolitan area of the municipality. In the neighbouring municipalities, companies are developing to lease land specifically for PV installations and to resell green energy. Such investments are also profitable due to the fact that there are very good and favourable conditions for obtaining solar energy in the foothills above the city.  |

| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Type of action | Financial and organisational action.  |
|   |  Description of operation | This programme consists of supporting alternative modes of transport and developing dedicated infrastructure for them. In order to achieve climate neutrality, it is necessary to make modes of transport other than the car - more comfortable for residents, so that they choose, for example, to travel by bicycle or public transport not out of compulsion, but out of economic viability, time efficiency and travel comfort.

| --- | --- | --- |
|  Type of action | Description of operation | Technical action.  |
|   |   |  As part of the measure, a CCS plant is planned to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Due to the lack of widespread uptake of CCS technology, Krakow Municipal Holding has entered into a strategic partnership with the Norwegian companies Vinco Innovation and CO₂ Management to gain knowledge on how to implement this technology. As part of the cooperation, a partnership project was created project entitled "Acquisition of knowledge and know-how from Norway concerning CCS and CCU technologies for the needs of the Thermal Waste Conversion Plant in Kraków". These companies specialise in implementing innovative technologies and already have experience with the CCS and SCU method.

As part of the project two reports were prepared for Krakow Municipal Holding. Vinco prepared a business report describing the economic, organisational, legal and environmental issues for CSS solutions for an eco-combustion plant. The report also describes potential challenges and difficulties that may occur in the implementation of the new technology. The second report, produced by CO₂ Management, in turn describes a technical analysis of the CCSU technology, taking into account carbon capture capabilities, transboundary transport and geological sequestration. Possible storage sites were also analysed. The report notes that in the Krakow area there are prospects for storing CO₂ locally, but in terms of the short to medium term goal of implementing the technology, transport and storage of CO₂ in the North Sea is more likely.

The report highlights that the comprehensive operation of such technology could start as early as 2030.  |

Incentives for new businesses include offering subsidies and tax breaks from new technology industries that choose to operate in Nowa Huta. In addition, the establishment of special economic zones with preferential conditions for companies investing in low-carbon technologies.

Consult with residents to obtain their views and ideas on the development of the brownfield space

Public consultation will involve holding regular workshops and meetings with residents to give their views and ideas on greenfield development. Surveys and questionnaires will also be carried out among residents to gather their suggestions on brownfield redevelopment.

Cooperation with the local community will be implemented through the creation of working groups involving local residents, representatives of local organisations and experts, who will collaborate on the planning and implementation of rehabilitation projects. In addition, education and information programmes will be conducted on the benefits of reclaiming brownfield sites and developing green spaces.

Development of green spaces

Creation of recreational areas will include the establishment of new parks, gardens and squares on brownfield sites that will be accessible to residents. The construction of cycle routes and walking paths will connect the new green spaces to the rest of the city.

Green infrastructure will be promoted through the installation of green roofs and walls on buildings, both new and existing. In addition, the creation of protected areas and nature reserves on brownfield sites will aim to protect local flora and fauna.  |

# B-2.3: Summary of residual emissions strategy

# Residual emissions strategy

Residual emissions refer to the remaining GHG emissions that cannot be reduced through existing plans, strategies and policies. These emissions come from various sources such as buildings, heating, electricity, industry, transport, waste management and other areas of urban life. The residual emissions strategy addresses a  $20\%$  reduction in the city's overall emissions.

In order to develop an effective residual emissions strategy, it is crucial to first identify where these emissions are coming from and assess the feasibility of implementing emission reduction measures. Once options for further emission reductions have been ruled out for technical, economic or practical reasons, the focus is on offsetting residual emissions.
#

Kraków

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

#

The strategy prioritises options that permanently capture and absorb carbon captured from the atmosphere, providing long-term emission reduction benefits. This includes measures such as increasing natural sinks such as forests and wetlands, implementing permanent sequestration methods such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, and using offsets by investing in projects that remove or reduce emissions elsewhere.

The main objective of the City of Kraków is to focus on increasing the forested area within its borders as part of a residual emissions strategy. "The district programme for increasing the forest cover of the City of Kraków 2018-2040" aims to significantly increase the city's forested area from 4% in 2018 to 8% by 2040. This emphasis on developing the city's forests dovetails with the goal of increasing natural carbon sinks and contributes to the overall reduction of residual emissions.

The vision for afforestation in the City of Krakow is based on a detailed field analysis and land classification. Much of the land already has existing tree and shrub cover, which will be assessed for its suitability for further afforestation. The land has been divided into different categories, depending on the existing vegetation cover and natural value. The plan envisages both afforestation of land without prerequisites and artificial restoration with an appropriate selection of tree species. Particular attention is paid to the preservation of valuable plant communities and to the exclusion of afforestation on areas of high nature value.

By prioritising the development of urban forests, the city aims to harness the carbon sequestration potential of trees and vegetation. Urban forestry initiatives will involve planting more trees in parks, green spaces and along streets, as well as preserving existing woodlands within the city limits. Implementing the plan to increase greenery will not only help offset residual emissions, but will also bring additional benefits such as improved air quality, increased biodiversity and improved urban aesthetics.

In addition, the Environmental Management Department of the Municipality of Krakow has prepared a document entitled "Directions of development and management of green areas in Krakow for 2017-2030." Annex II "Nature protection" proposes the creation of new 32 ecological uses. The possibility of creating new nature and landscape complexes (e.g. Zakrzówek and Góra Ksieża or Bodzów and Góra Św. Anny) was also given. As part of the work on the document, a comprehensive valorisation of existing and potential green areas was also developed to meet the needs of increasing the proportion of urban greenery.

In addition, any initiative to create new green spaces or increase the city's forest cover underlines Krakow's commitment to sustainable urban development and increasing resilience to climate change. Proactive measures to develop green spaces demonstrate the city's recognition of the important role that natural ecosystems play in mitigating climate change and creating a healthier environment for its residents.

In addition to nature-based measures, Krakow is also committed to implementing technical solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from municipal installations, including municipal waste incineration plants in particular. In 2024, Krakow Municipal Holding plans to participate in the third call of the Interreg Central Europe Project. One of the three planned projects is aimed at implementing technical solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from municipal installations, including municipal waste incinerators in particular. Particular emphasis will be placed on projects in the field of carbon capture, utilisation and storage - CCU and CCS.

In summary, the residual emissions strategy aims to achieve further reductions in the city's emissions, while taking into account the importance of long-term carbon storage and the need for sustainable solutions to tackle climate change.

|  Definition | Pocket parks, also known as mini-parks (tut. Gardens
of the Krakowians) are urban open spaces of relatively
small size. They are usually located on a single or
several small plots of land
in the city, where they are dispersed throughout the
city enabling different groups of people to enjoy them
when there are no other attractive green spaces
nearby. Pocket parks not infrequently aim to fulfil the
functions of standard sized parks in an attempt to
meet the different types of demands made by their
users. The requirements for larger green spaces can be
met by creating multi-functional and/or themed
pocket parks. The creation of pocket parks not only
promotes the identification of residents with smaller
green spaces located in the immediate vicinity, but
also the building of local identity and the integration of
its users.  |

# C-1.2: Description of innovative management interventions to achieve climate neutrality

New tasks for the City, resulting from the ambition to achieve climate neutrality, have resulted in a change in the management system. The changes concern:

the introduction of a new project management instrument, the project portfolio;
a mechanism to increase stakeholder collaboration and influence on the city's activities - the portfolio advisory team,
the creation of functioning public participation mechanisms - two successful citizens' assemblys;
the development of a budget for municipal tasks that citizens decide on directly - the civic budget;
creating urban structures better equipped to implement measures - eliminating silos.

# Project portfolios

Krakow implements a task-based budget: the city's individual activities are divided into specific, detailed tasks. Some of the tasks are implemented as projects, in accordance with the Prince 2 methodology, which makes it easier to achieve the objectives. However, in the case of pro-climate measures, practice has shown that the project methodology is not sufficient. Measures to reduce emissions

and adaptation of the city to climate change are large, cross-cutting and implemented by many units. They are not a separate area of city management, but rather another way of implementing existing activities. They relate to education, municipal management, transport, housing, culture, sports, office functioning, ICT, tourism, business, civil society. In view of this, it is not enough to implement many separate projects, each on its own. They must be made to work together to achieve even better results through synergy.

To better respond to the challenge, Krakow has introduced a new element into the project management system: project portfolios. Project portfolios are an innovation in the management system, both in the managerial/organisational aspect - due to the streamlining of decision-making and implementation processes - and in the social aspect - due to the inclusion in the work of the portfolio of representatives from various backgrounds: science, business, NGOs.

There are currently two project portfolios in operation: "Zero Emission Krakow" and "Smart City". The "Zero Emission Krakow" portfolio aggregates pro-climate initiatives (tasks, projects, programmes) implemented by the City of Krakow and allows for their efficient management. The implementation of the Portfolio will make Krakow a city developing in a sustainable way, striving for economic prosperity and the health of its inhabitants in harmony with the environment and taking into account the needs of
Krako

Roadmap for climate neutrality by 2030

future generations, resilient to extreme climate phenomena, coping with their effects, economical and friendly to inhabitants and visitors.

# Zero Emission Krakow Project Portfolio Advisory Team

The Portfolio Advisory Panel is an opinion-giving body, influential in shaping the City's policy, advisory to the Portfolio Council, composed of prominent representatives from the world of science, politics, business, local government, NGOs. It provides opinions and advice on projects and programmes. Submits projects and programmes whose objectives and scope may fit into the Portfolio Strategy. It is composed

of

made up of permanent members and members appointed to discuss specific projects, topics for Council meetings. The work of the Advisory Team does not have a rigid timetable, as the individual members of the Team have different amounts of time and different levels of ability or even willingness to get involved. Nonetheless, the Team is a strong group of people representing the business community, universities, local government and NGOs who have a significant influence on the shaping of the City's climate policy. The introduction of the institution of the Advisory Team has programmatically implemented the use of external specialists' knowledge and output into the project management system.

# Citizens' assemblys

Krakow has so far conducted two citizen assemblies. These assemblies do not produce solutions that are implemented in legislation, but rather identify the city's voluntary willingness to implement solutions. Nevertheless, the city mayor pledged to accept the recommendations with at least 80% support from the panellists for implementation - and he has kept his word. The Krakow assembly consisted of an educational part, where participants listened to experts: employees of Krakow's universities, representatives of ngo's, business, officials, and a deliberative part, where they discussed their ideas on how to improve the functioning of the city. The assembly's recommendations have a strong social mandate, as they come from a very representative, randomly selected group of residents - and not just from those who usually participate in the city's activities anyway, due to their membership of an NGO or a group with particular interests. A assembly is therefore similar to a referendum, while being less costly and - because of the educational sessions for the panellists - producing better, more substantive solutions.

These assemblies took a structured approach to the methodology of selecting an appropriate group of participants, also including marginalised groups in the process. As part of the work on the Krakow Climate Assembly, an appropriate methodology for selecting panellists was developed so that the composition of the Assembly reflected the general population of Krakow in terms of specific socio-demographic and spatial characteristics, which included:

gender (k, m);
age group:

The Krakow Climate Assembly included 70 panellists: 60 persons constituting the core line-up and 10 persons in the reserve line-up. The participants were a reflection of the general population of Krakow.

The first stage of recruiting panellists consisted in reaching out with information, encouraging and inviting the widest possible group of Krakow residents to participate in the Assembly and, consequently, registering potential participants in the process, which was carried out by printing and distributing invitations to male and female residents of Krakow in order to achieve an appropriate sample of panellists. 20,000 unique invitations were sent to randomly selected addresses in all districts of Krakow and extensive communication activities were carried out, whose reach exceeded 1.5 million people (media, local media, posters, city lights, illuminated buildings, radio programmes and podcasts, involvement of dozens of local opinion leaders, others).

There was also extensive public consultation in which all residents of Krakow could participate. The consultation was carried out over 26 days, five expert stands, eight consultation meetings, an art competition for children and two consultation forms were created. 168 organisational comments and 252 factual comments were received.

As part of the second stage, an appropriate electronic tool for registering candidates for panellists was prepared and a random draw was made using the database of registered persons and a 60-person group of panellists was selected, together with a 10-person reserve group, in a manner ensuring transparency of the process, randomness of the selection and representativeness of the Assembly, i.e. taking into account socio-demographic and spatial characteristics in relation to the entire population of Krakow.

Residents of Krakow were also able to watch three of the Assembly's educational meetings live and access educational materials in the online Knowledge Zone.

Opportunities were also provided for stakeholders to participate in the Panel: representatives of NGOs, informal movements, businesses, or housing cooperatives. Information about the call for sites was published, among others, on the Operator's website, in social media and in professional services, including through paid advertisements.

The parties were given the opportunity to:
presenting your position and proposed recommendations at an educational assembly meeting (live or recorded speech) or submitting your position in writing;
to review the proposed recommendations and provide the panellists with their comments on them;
participation in one deliberative meeting on an observer basis, on the same basis as officials and civil servants of the City of Krakow (participation in group work, with no possibility of participation in sub-groups);
participation in the last meeting of the Assembly, during which final discussions were held and voting on recommendations.

The involvement of the parties was therefore considerable and, it seems, above standard. Particularly as more than a dozen parties qualified for the Assembly.

Despite the challenges of COVID-19, the Krakow Climate Assembly managed to run smoothly, including maintaining the correct structure of the Assembly. During the final vote on the recommendations, a group of not only 60 people from the core membership was present, but also several people from the from the reserve group.

# Citizens' budget

Part of the city's budget is earmarked for projects submitted by residents, and it is the residents who decide which projects will be implemented by the municipality. The opportunity to take part is open to a wide range of people (children, young people, adults, seniors), as is the use of the results of completed projects. The civic budget thus perfectly demonstrates the level of knowledge, involvement and sympathy of the residents. A positive trend can be seen over the last few years - the number of project applications submitted by young people is increasing, as is the number of applications for projects related to the environment, including the climate. This gives confidence in the effectiveness of the climate education provided by the City, as well as unlocking creativity and increasing the involvement of residents.

The Civic Budget has been in place in Krakow since 2014, and the creation of a civic budget is mandatory in municipalities that are cities with county rights from 2019. These cities have to allocate at least 0.5 per cent of the municipality's expenditure included in the last budget execution report. The civic budget operates on a city-wide basis as well as in individual neighbourhoods. The projects that receive the most support from residents in the vote are included in Krakow's budget and are implemented in the next financial year.

# Improving internal management processes (silos)

The organisational weakness of local government is mainly due to siloed departments in municipal offices. There is insufficient horizontal knowledge sharing and cooperation between office units. The position of climate units in the structure of offices is not strong enough. Decision makers underestimate the importance of the climate crisis, so that the transition units in the offices are often not taken fully seriously. Their tasks and decisions are not prioritised in city management, and the teams built are too small.

Proper hierarchy, collaboration, implementation of horizontal processes - such project processes, going across the siloed structure, have been implemented by the project management system adopted at Krakow City Hall.

Krakow's climate-neutrality activities are implemented in a coordinated manner by municipal departments, units and companies, in particular: Department of Municipal Economy and Climate, Climate-Energy-Water Management unit, Department of Air Quality, Department of Strategy and Investment Monitoring, Department of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Board of Urban Greenery, Board of Public Transport, Board of Municipal Buildings, Municipal Thermal Power Company SA, Municipal Transport Company SA.

Currently, in accordance with the project management system, each project included in the Zero Emission Krakow portfolio has a project manager and a project team, most often appointed by an official order from the Magistrate Director, and project documentation is maintained in accordance with procedures in an internal system and is accessible to other project managers. The portfolio is managed by a Portfolio Board, consisting of the directors of the departments and units most involved in pro-climate measures. An advisory body is the Portfolio Advisory Panel, formed from prominent representatives of science, politics, business, local government, NGOs.

# Recommendations for legislative changes

The Office of the City of Krakow, in cooperation with stakeholders, has developed proposals for 23 legislative changes to facilitate the implementation of tasks in the energy, climate, water management, transport and waste management sectors. These amendments were presented by the Mayor of the City of Krakow during a meeting with new members of the Sejm coming from Krakow with a request to implement them in the 10th term of the Sejm. Representatives of the City of Krakow will strive for these changes to be introduced, which will facilitate the implementation of activities and assumptions included in the Action Plan. An important chance for the introduction of these changes is also provided by the cooperation established during the work on the Climate Contract at the national level.

This provision would facilitate investments aimed at providing residents with the fastest possible connections between different areas of the city. On the other hand, the extension of the scope of the Act to include the possibility of building car parks will contribute to facilitating the implementation of parking policies in cities, particularly with regard to the construction of Park&Ride car parks.

# C-2.2: Description of innovative social measures

Krakow realises how important broad public participation is for pro-climate measures. In order for it to develop, it is necessary, on the one hand, to increase the awareness and knowledge of residents and, on the other, to create mechanisms through which they have a real, rather than theoretical, influence on decisions made in the city. Krakow is taking measures that are innovative from the point of view of the previous approach, typical of Polish cities:

residents decide and recommend actions - citizen assemblys;
residents gain knowledge - Climate Education Centre opened in 2023;
the city reaches out to residents with climate themes - numerous outdoor events;
stakeholders collaborate and co-create the city's policy - the Portfolio Advisory Team.

## Citizens' Assembly

Krakow is one of the few cities in Poland to have held two citizens' assembly. They allow all selected citizens, representing a cross-section of society, to have their say - and not just those who usually participate in the city's activities anyway because they belong to an NGO or a group with particular interests. Their vote matters - the recommendations with the highest support are accepted by the mayor for implementation.

Very important in the context of the city's zero-carbon agenda was the Krakow Climate Citizen Assembly. This assembly involved many community groups in the city of Krakow to develop common goals for the city of Krakow to achieve. It took place in 2021 and was dedicated to climate change and the city's climate neutrality. Its participants analysed how authorities and citizens can reduce energy consumption and increase the use of renewable energy.

As a result of its work, 32 high-quality recommendations were developed and submitted to the city authorities, which, according to the adopted assumptions, are binding for the Mayor of Krakow.

The recommendations cover many areas of city functioning. They are often interdisciplinary and cross-cutting in nature, which is why many municipal departments, teams and units are involved in their implementation. Their scope and subject matter are diverse, hence each requires an individual approach and planning, as well as the provision of financial resources for their implementation.

One of the main recommendations is that the city should move towards climate neutrality as soon as possible. Given the challenges of a just transition and tackling energy exclusion, participants concluded that the city should have a plan to achieve climate neutrality, with at least a 30 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 relative to 2018, and at least an 80 per cent reduction by 2040, and achieve climate neutrality by no later than 2050.

## Other points mainly focus on:

educational activities aimed at citizens on topics related to climate change and energy efficiency;
opportunities to implement RES in various sectors of the city's operation;
thermo-modernisation of buildings and how to financially support it;
implementation of urban green development programmes and investments in green infrastructure;
organisational and legislative changes.

## Climate Education Centre

Currently, the message of the need for climate transformation is mainly focused on coercion or fear. Local governments do not use language based on financial or non-financial benefits and non-financial benefits. There is a lack of a message based on the reliable benefits of the transition, both material and those related to, for example, health. Well-planned, regular climate education activities targeting different groups of citizens (children, adults, seniors) strengthen stakeholder engagement.

## Pro-climate events

Underlying the low level of stakeholder engagement is also an insufficient understanding of the severity of the climate crisis, which affects residents as well as officials and decision-makers. This dovetails with the lack of educational activities and information campaigns by cities. The widest possible awareness about the transition needs to be built among decision-makers, residents and business, which requires communication changes and more investment in education and information campaigns.

## Zero Emission Krakow Portfolio Advisory Team

The enthusiasm of residents is often not properly channelled, there is a phenomenon of 'greenwashing', which portrays as pro-climate actions that in reality have little impact on the climate. Participation in the Portfolio Advisory Panel gives you a real say in the decisions taken by the most important body working in the city for climate transformation. People who have proven themselves to be committed and competent have been invited to join the Panel. In addition, they represent different communities (business, NGOs, universities) and are ambassadors for climate action in their communities.

## Pact for Climate

In order to achieve climate neutrality, it is necessary to involve other stakeholders. Climate pacts mobilise Kraków's businesses and institutions for climate action and cooperation, while supporting the City. As part of these pacts, members commit to implementing climate-neutral actions and to reporting progress annually to the city government.

The Pact was established in 2022 to increase the involvement of businesses, public institutions, social organisations and academia operating in Kraków in the pursuit of climate neutrality and the fight against climate change. The partners undertake to take action to reduce global warming, create climate strategies and regularly inform the city of actions taken in line with the principles of the pact.

This initiative supports the city's efforts to achieve climate neutrality. In order to meet this challenge, Krakow is opening its doors to external partners, encouraging them to work together. The Pact for the Climate is also a platform for the exchange of experience between partners involved in climate action, the promotion of climate-friendly solutions and, ultimately, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

The partners undertake to take action to limit global warming, to develop climate strategies and to regularly inform the city about actions taken in line with the principles of the Pact. The Pact increases the involvement of businesses, public institutions, social organisations and the scientific community operating in Kraków in the pursuit of climate neutrality and combating climate change. It removes the barrier of low involvement of actors other than the City.

# Growing climate awareness

Krakow has undertaken a huge challenge and effort to write down its climate ambitions, current and planned commitment to climate transformation in the form of a Municipal Climate Contract, trying to present the most up-to-date data and the most advanced plans. On the one hand, therefore, it can be said that at the moment it is difficult to pinpoint the actions planned to be developed during the iteration. However, experience teaches us that progress in the field of climate change is extremely rapid. Solutions that were introduced only one to two years ago as innovative experiments now function as a normal part of the city's reality and do not cause surprise or concern. These rapid changes in action and, above all, in thinking about the climate transition affect the entire frame of reference - at local, regional and governmental levels. They can be seen in the changing narrative in the media, in the growing knowledge and awareness of the Polish and awareness of Poles, particularly the people of Krakow.

# Future iterations of the Climate Contract

The first iteration of the Climate Contract is planned for two years after its adoption. It can be expected to introduce many changes and improvements, especially in the funding mechanisms for the measures described in the Investment Plan section. It is planned that the second iteration will take place in 2028, and it is foreseen to check in 2030 whether the objectives of the contract have been met.

During the next iterations, cooperation will be established with the entities that participated in the creation of the Zero Emission Krakow Portfolio Advisory Team - representatives of business, universities and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The document will also be consulted within the framework of the Climate Pact, which regularly expands to include new participants. A decision on the adoption of the document through a resolution of the Krakow City Council will be taken at a later stage. In case of a positive decision, the document will be widely consulted and will go through a formal public consultation procedure. It will be presented to various stakeholder groups and their comments will be collected as required by the Act. The conclusions resulting from this process will be reflected and reflected in subsequent versions of the document.

Verifiability of progress towards the Climate Contract targets will be ensured by the City's Greenhouse Gas Inventory, which monitors emissions in Krakow on an annual basis. On its basis it will be possible to assess at which stage of transition the city is currently at and how much remains to be done. In addition, there are plans to expand the Municipal Greenhouse Gas Inventory from the Basic to the Basic + level in the future. It is planned to expand this inventory to include the separately identified emission sectors Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU for short) and Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU for short) as well as additional greenhouse gases.

Essential information on relevant monitoring data will be provided by the city's STRADOM system. This system contains the key projects implemented in the city. Each of these projects, in turn, is assigned evaluation indicators to assess the degree of implementation of the key projects.

During the iteration, the 'Module A-2 Assessment of current strategic management strategies, policies and instruments' will be updated. Most of the documents described in this chapter are also subject to a two-year iteration cycle. Updates to the Climate Contract and progress within the implementation of the documents themselves will emerge from the review of the documents again.

Along with the two-year update period, the activities resulting from the module "B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design" will also be updated. The status of the tasks, whether they have been completed or to what extent, and any adjustments arising during the project will be determined.

Another important element in terms of the plan for future iterations is the information contained in the in reporting to the CDP (named after the Climate Disclosure Project). CDP is a not-for-profit organisation that runs a global system for collecting and publishing data on the environmental impact of investors, companies, cities and regions. CDP is recognised as one of the world's most credible ranking organisations on this topic. As a result of its participation in the Cities Race to Zero campaign and the Covenant of Mayors on Climate and Energy, Krakow has been reporting on its climate change adaptation and mitigation activities through the CDP since 2022. The monitoring of the score awarded each year will provide external confirmation of the ongoing tasks towards climate neutrality.

# 1 Introduction

## Vision for Krakow's future

Kraków of the future is an intelligent, environmentally friendly and sustainable city. By 2050, the city aims to develop as a dynamic metropolis that successfully combines modern technology with its historical and cultural heritage. Krakow will be a city that responds effectively to climate, social and economic challenges through active civic participation and widespread public awareness. Kraków's residents will co-create the city, nurturing its sustainability and social well-being while adapting to rapidly changing global realities. The city will benefit from the spread of artificial intelligence, allowing the development of innovative solutions in the field of computerisation and robotisation, while maintaining a high quality of life and respecting cultural heritage.

## Mission of Krakow

The current "Kraków Development Strategy. This is where I want to live. Kraków 2030" defines Kraków's mission as one of the two most important cities in Poland. As the "locomotive" of Małopolska's development, Kraków makes important contributions in areas such as science, research, modern technology and regional innovation. As a strong European metropolis, Kraków focuses on building cooperation with other cities, which strengthens its international position.

Krakow also aspires to be a smart city in a wide range of aspects of city functioning, including:

**Environment**: Krakow optimises energy consumption, protects the climate, reduces emissions and manages resources sustainably using modern technologies.
**Governance**: smart governance is about competence, public participation, transparency and high quality public services. It also includes integrated governance with the participation of all residents and cooperation between the public and private sectors.
**Quality of life**: The city provides residents with a welcoming living environment, access to public services (including online), education, health care, care for seniors, modern infrastructure, safety, a rich cultural offer and urban greenery.
**Mobility**: the city has an integrated and safe transport system, using information and communication technologies to create an efficient network of connections.
**Economy**: The smart economy is based on modern services, industry and R&amp;D sectors, supports creative industries, demonstrates innovation, labour market flexibility and effective cooperation between science and business.

Kraków's vision and mission are focused on creating a sustainable, innovative and resident-friendly city, ready for the challenges of the future and able to adapt to change.

## Climate crisis

The climate crisis is the greatest contemporary challenge, the negative effects of which affect millions of people around the world every year. In recent years, we have increasingly witnessed the effects of progressive climate change, often compounded by the consequences of the inevitable development of
Kraków

vulnerable urban areas, such as an increase in development, population density and vehicle numbers, and, on the other hand, a decrease in the proportion of biologically active areas and disposable water resources. Both sudden, violent weather phenomena such as storms, flooding and waterlogging, as well as prolonged periods with high temperatures and droughts, will cause increasing material and economic losses and, above all, increasing risks to human life and health.

The results of scientific research and analysis indicate that these phenomena will worsen, posing a threat not only to the quality of life, but also to the social and economic development opportunities of many cities, regions and countries around the world. This research is reflected in the positions of governments and international organisations. In order to prevent the effects of climate change, each country should take long-term action to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions as early as 2030.

The main climate threats facing Krakow are related to extreme temperatures (high maximum temperatures, heat waves amplified by urban heat islands), uneven distribution of precipitation (long periods without rain causing drought, torrential rain and floods), and poor air quality. Krakow, like other Polish cities, is consistently implementing a long-term strategy to adapt the city to climate change. By identifying the greatest threats and adopting long-term goals and commitments, Krakow is pursuing a systemic approach to climate transformation.

However, the city's action must not only focus on adaptation. It is also necessary to join in the fight against global warming. To this end, the Municipality of Krakow has expressed the ambition to achieve climate neutrality as soon as possible. It was therefore in the vital interest of the City of Krakow to join the European "Mission of 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" in order to make the most of the opportunities it brings. Participation in the Mission is both a challenge and an opportunity for the city to maximise our efforts to achieve climate neutrality. The City of Krakow has the ambition to create a more sustainable urban environment and attractive, friendly urban areas to live, work and relax in harmony and harmony with the environment.

# Strategic objectives

The current "Kraków Development Strategy. I want to live here. Kraków 2030" sets an important course of action in the context of environmental and climate protection - "Kraków 2030 is a liveable city". Specific goals include:

Universally accessible, high quality public space: Create universally accessible spaces combining tradition and modernity, where squares, streets and parks will be attractive places for residents to meet and be active. Provision of high quality green spaces evenly distributed throughout the city.
Revitalised urban areas: With the active participation of residents, reducing inequalities in living conditions, improving quality of life, revitalising local spaces, increasing economic activity and stimulating social and civic participation.
Environmental sustainability: Care for a high quality environment, with a particular focus on improving air quality, reducing noise levels and reducing electromagnetic field emissions.
A citizen-friendly, efficient and environmentally friendly transport system: Improve public transport, increase the share of environmentally friendly forms of mobility such as public
Kraków

transport, walking and cycling. Reducing car traffic, especially transit traffic in the centre, and improving street safety.

A high level of security in Krakow: Increasing the level and feeling of security through cooperation between services and institutions, involvement of citizens in prevention activities and securing the city against natural disasters, technical catastrophes and the effects of adverse climate change.
Universal implementation of healthy and active living: Creating conditions for a healthy and active lifestyle, education on preventive health care and motivating residents to participate in sports and recreational activities. Promoting healthy ageing as a valuable development resource.

In the Municipality of Krakow an Integrated Management System STRADOM is in place and under development, covering the activities of the City Hall and large Municipal Organisational Units at the strategic and operational level. The aforementioned Krakow Development Strategy is the document superior to other Strategic Management Instruments (SMI) such as projects, project portfolios, programmes and policies. The Climate Contract for Krakow is prepared as one of the SMIs, at the policy level.

# European Mission of 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030

In February 2022, Krakow prepared an application to join a new EU initiative called Mission 100 of Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030. Its aim is to support and promote 100 European cities in a systemic transformation towards climate neutrality and transform them into centres of experimentation and innovation.

On 28 April 2022, the European Commission announced the list of cities selected to participate in the mission. These are 100 cities from all 27 EU Member States, plus 12 cities from countries associated or potentially associated with Horizon Europe (2021-2027) for research and innovation. Krakow was among such metropolises as Paris, Lisbon, Munich, Dublin and Milan. 377 cities from across Europe applied to participate in the programme.

The selected cities are home to 12% of Europe's population. This included both larger and smaller centres - currently at different stages on the road to climate neutrality.

The aim of the 'Mission of 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities' is to implement transformational and innovative plans that will lead to climate neutrality by 2030. Mission Cities will act as hubs of experimentation and innovation to enable all European cities to follow suit by 2050. Mission Cities will involve local authorities, citizens, entrepreneurs, investors as well as regional and national authorities. For Mission Cities that want to become climate-neutral by 2030, a key point is the preparation of Climate Contracts, i.e. documents showing the pathway to achieving climate neutrality for the city.

The whole process will require several iterations of the Climate Contract between now and 2030, as outlined in the Mission (Figure 1). The document includes a number of actions, including establishing cities as EU leaders in large-scale research and innovation, establishing innovative urban governance models, involving citizens in the process and creating an investment plan. Such an approach, however, requires a great deal of flexibility, as much progress is currently taking place in the fields of climate and energy and more and more new solutions are available. It is therefore important for Krakow to be an

active participant in this process and to modify the actions included in the Contract on the basis of the based on the best available technical and organisational solutions.

The Climate Transformation Map is a diagram that shows the seven most relevant stages of the Just Transition process. These are:

gaining strong support (city authorities, local ecosystem, other levels of government),
mapping and understanding of the system (data, dependencies and connections, future scenarios),
portfolio building (synergy of activities, analysis of possible climate neutrality pathways),
implementation of actions (tracking progress, implementation, common portfolio of actions),
learning and reflection (taking the right direction, adapting, building a shared consciousness),
new normality (replication, scaling, consolidation, formalisation),
building an inclusive environment conducive to change.
Kraków

Commitments to climate neutrality by 2030

The first six elements follow one another, stemming from one another, as it were. The seventh element brings them together and embeds them in a new reality. The climate contract describes an iterative process; it is not enough to go down this path once. Each of the elements described above must be repeated in successive cycles, bringing the city closer to climate neutrality.

The road to climate neutrality is yet to be pioneered by the cities involved in the Mission for 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030. In this context, learning is crucial to accelerate progress towards achieving climate neutrality in every city. Co-creation and testing to incrementally improve strategies and plans is the only way to discover the way forward when it is not clear. Achieving climate neutrality will require both rapid successes (readily available technologies and rapid implementation) and experimentation (in new areas) to refine and evolve strategies leading to full decarbonisation.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

## Goals of the Climate Contract

The ongoing climate crisis is manifested in the increasingly frequent observation of extreme weather events, which have a negative impact on the wellbeing of residents and can have long-term health effects. Krakow's ambitious goal of achieving climate neutrality is to make the city a cleaner and friendlier place to live in every aspect: living, working and relaxing. The city wants to offer everyone: residents and visitors alike more greenery, clean air and water and more efficient transport. Krakow is continuously working to accelerate a systemic transformation aimed at achieving climate neutrality, which will manifest itself in reducing greenhouse gas emissions to a minimum and implementing solutions for a clean and liveable environment. and resident-friendly environment.

As part of the First Krakow Climate Panel, organised in 2021, 32 recommendations were developed and submitted to the City authorities to tackle climate change in the coming decades. Climate neutrality is fully supported by the Krakow authorities and numerous social, scientific and business communities. The city authorities have announced that they will take all measures leading to the implementation of the recommendations and the achievement of climate neutrality.

The objective of the Climate Contract is to present a pathway for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% relative to the base year (2018) by 2030. To achieve this the following parts of the Climate Contract take into account emission reduction options resulting from policies and strategies already in place at local, regional, national and EU level, and the remaining emissions gap was filled with local actions. All this is under the assumption that the barriers and risks described in the later parts of the document (Action Plan and Investment Plan) can be overcome.

The plan is prepared for emissions within the boundaries of the Municipality of Krakow and does not contain any territorial exclusions. Data for the base year comes from the Urban Greenhouse Gas Inventory developed in accordance with the GHG Protocol for Cities methodology at the BASIC level. The action pathways described in the following sections, on the other hand, refer to the sectors described in the Economic Model developed by the experts. A detailed description of the use of the individual data can be found in Part Two of the document - Action Plan, in the chapter 'Module A-1 GHG Baseline Inventory'.

## Climate Contract for Krakow

The Krakow Contract is a document that demonstrates an approach to the gap between the projects already underway and planned for implementation, as well as the actions that result from national trends and developments, and the actions needed to achieve climate neutrality. It consists of three parts:

Commitments.
Action Plan.
Kraków

Commitments to climate neutrality by 2030

Investment Plan.

The Contract comprehensively describes the city's pathway to climate neutrality. It is a document that shows what needs to be done to achieve the city's climate neutrality, while recognising the scale and complexity of the challenge and the difficulties that implementation may encounter. The Contract is a declaration of cooperation and action. The commitment is political and image. Contrary to its name, the contract is not a legally binding agreement.

The target adopted in the Climate Contract for Krakow is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2030 compared to 2018. A large part of the emission reduction (4,473 thousand tCO₂ e) (carbon dioxide equivalent) will result from actions implemented after 2018 or planned in strategic documents of the City and the Polish government. The contract contains a detailed description of 58 actions that should be taken to achieve additional emission reductions of 1,614 thousand tCO₂ e. The cost of these actions was estimated at 28,769 million PLN. However, the calculations of the Economic Model indicate that the total financial benefits, direct and indirect (reduced energy expenditure, health care, additional jobs, etc.) outweigh the costs of the transformation. Emission reductions will overwhelmingly result from the implementation of national strategies, carried out by private actors: energy companies, businesses and building owners and managers.

# Non-financial benefits of climate transformation

Contemporary cities are increasingly making efforts to achieve climate neutrality, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. However, these efforts do not only benefit the environment, but also local communities. The actions listed in the Action Plan to realise the provisions of the 100 Cities Mission have a range of non-financial benefits, which are as follows:

The creation of new, well-paid jobs in the renewable energy, high-tech construction and high-tech industry sectors contributes to increasing employment opportunities for local communities. Such dynamics can result in a reduction in unemployment and stimulate the city's economic development, leading to an improved quality of life for residents in the long term. New jobs in innovative sectors offer not only better employment conditions, but also career opportunities in areas of the future that are key to the global economy. This makes the city more attractive to young people and professionals, which further fuels the local economy and innovation. Investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency directly benefits residents in the form of lower energy bills. This relieves household budgets, resulting in greater financial stability for people. In the long term, lower energy costs can also increase residents' savings, which can be allocated to other needs, improving the overall quality of life.

Adaptation actions to reduce the urban heat island, such as the introduction of green roofs, the creation of urban parks and the planting of trees, contribute to reducing the effects of the heat. This not only improves the thermal comfort of residents, but also reduces the need for air conditioning, resulting in lower energy consumption. In addition, green roofs and urban parks contribute to the aesthetics of the city, creating a more pleasant and welcoming environment.

Climate projects trigger an influx of external funding, which further supports the city's economic development. Investments stimulate new environmental initiatives

and the development of new technologies, strengthening the city's position as a leader in sustainable development. Attracting external capital not only supports local projects, but also creates the conditions for long-term cooperation with other cities and institutions around the world, which can lead to the exchange of knowledge and technology.

Improved energy efficiency and access to cheaper energy contribute to the reduction of energy poverty, meaning that more residents have stable access to affordable energy. The lower cost of energy allows the poorest residents to improve their living conditions by eliminating situations where they have to choose between paying their energy bills and other basic needs. This increases the overall sense of social security in the city.
Involving citizens in the co-creation of climate neutrality actions increases environmental awareness and builds public support for such initiatives. The development of public participation processes allows residents to actively participate in decisions concerning their environment, which strengthens the sense of community and responsibility for the environment. These initiatives can also lead to an increase in residents' trust in local authorities, which is crucial for the effective implementation of pro-environmental policies.
Reducing emissions from traditional energy production and transport translates into improved air quality, which has a direct impact on residents' health. Cleaner air means a lower risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, which contributes to an overall improvement in public health. In cities with high levels of pollution, emission reductions can lead to significant savings in the healthcare system through reduced hospitalisations and medical visits related to air pollution-related illnesses.
Noise reduction through developed public transport and electric means of transport benefits the mental health of residents, creating a calmer and more comfortable urban environment. Less noise also promotes better sleep quality, which is crucial for health and well-being.
Investments in infrastructure for public transport, bicycles and pedestrians result in reduced car traffic improving road safety. Fewer road accidents translate into the safety of residents, as well as reduced social and economic costs associated with treating victims and repairing infrastructure.
An active lifestyle promoted by cycling and walking improves the physical and mental condition of residents, leading to an overall improvement in health. Regular physical activity is one of the key factors in the prevention of many chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Improving the health of residents can lead to a reduced burden on the healthcare system, benefiting the city as a whole.
The development of green spaces, such as city parks and community gardens, not only improves the aesthetics of the city, but also offers places for recreation, relaxation and community gatherings. This increases residents' satisfaction and happiness. Green spaces also provide important places for physical activities such as jogging, walking or team games, which promotes a healthy lifestyle. In addition, such places foster social integration, strengthening interpersonal bonds and building a stronger local community.

Green space development promotes the creation of new urban ecosystems, increasing biodiversity and creating new ecological links between areas. New structural linkages of green spaces can support the development of ecological corridors that allow the migration and survival of different species, contributing to the protection of biodiversity.
The circular economy promotes the sustainable reuse of resources and the minimisation of waste, leading to the creation of new jobs and accelerating the development of the local economy. These transformations can increase the innovation of local businesses, which will have to adapt to new standards and requirements. These actions also promote environmental protection by reducing waste and increasing the efficiency of resource use.
Promoting recycling and waste separation reduces the amount of waste sent to landfill, benefiting the environment and public health. An increase in recycling levels can also lead to the development of a local recycling industry, creating additional jobs and supporting the local economy. Education and awareness of the importance of recycling can also increase social responsibility and green attitudes among residents.
Training and education programmes related to climate neutrality contribute to an increase in the skills and qualifications of residents, which in turn leads to greater competitiveness in the labour market and increased personal development. Through these programmes, residents not only gain new professional skills, but also a better understanding of environmental problems and how to solve them. This in turn can inspire their own initiatives and projects that contribute to the further development of the city.

These changes make the city more friendly, healthy and sustainable, resulting in better lives for its residents. Climate transformation not only contributes to environmental protection, but also builds stronger, more integrated and happier communities. Each of these co-benefits forms part of a larger jigsaw puzzle aimed at creating the city of the future - a place where innovation, ecology and quality of life go hand in hand, creating a harmonious and sustainable space for all inhabitants.

Key strategic priorities and interventions

## Priority 1 - Buildings

One of the priority goals of the City of Krakow in terms of achieving climate neutrality is to introduce thermal modernisation of buildings on a massive scale. This action aims to reduce emissions and improve the energy efficiency of buildings, which are one of the main sources of emissions in the city. In this context, the city is betting on the implementation of the Green Neighbourhood Model, a strategic experiment to implement a business model for deep thermo-modernisation of buildings.

To date, programmes offering grants and loans for home renovation have met with limited interest from both individual and institutional building owners, yielding only partial improvements in energy efficiency. To change this, Krakow intends to create a comprehensive thermo-modernisation programme that not only improves energy efficiency, but also unlocks additional benefits such as supply chain innovation, rapid data-driven learning, business development, job creation, health benefits and fuel poverty reduction.

The programme envisages a significant increase in the share of privately financed thermal modernisation, including through the ESCO (Energy Service Company) formula. In this formula, the ESCO finances the modernisation project and then recovers its outlay through staggered payments generated by the energy savings resulting from the project. Krakow is also promoting a comprehensive One Stop Shop (OSS) building retrofit service to speed up and facilitate the retrofit process by offering building owners a full service investment. The process is to be carried out at no cost to property owners, regardless of the type of ownership and use of the buildings. Large-scale actions also enable additional projects such as building climate resilience, creating co-working spaces and developing green and blue-green infrastructure in shared spaces. In this way, it will be possible to develop entire local communities, ensuring greater impact and citizen involvement, transforming the retrofit programme into a neighbourhood greening programme.

Large-scale thermal modernisation of buildings in Krakow, however, requires a complex approach and a variety of investment financing schemes. The city also plans to develop existing subsidy schemes and create new ones, including schemes using funds from the National Recovery Plan. A key element of the strategy is the NEEST - NetZero Emission and Environmentally Sustainable Territories project, which will bring ready-made technological solutions ready for immediate scaling and implementation in other urban quarters.

Historic buildings, which require special technical solutions, are of particular importance in the process of thermal modernisation. To this end, projects are being prepared to develop efficient and cost-effective methods of modernising these buildings.

Through such a comprehensive approach, Krakow can not only significantly reduce emissions, but also improve the quality of life of its residents by supporting the local economy, public health and social cohesion. Massive thermo-modernisation, as a key element of the zero carbon strategy, is a fundamental step towards creating a sustainable, friendly and modern city of the future.
Kraków

# Priority 2 - Renewable energy

The second priority objective for the City of Krakow in terms of achieving climate neutrality is to significantly increase the share of renewable energy sources (RES) in the city's energy mix. To achieve this, Krakow plans to develop individual electricity generation using private photovoltaic (PV) panels on the roofs of buildings and heat pumps for heat production.

Krakow should use more than 32% of the roof area of buildings in the city for the installation of PV installations, which includes industrial buildings and brownfield sites. For efficient implementation of PV installations, cooperation with conservationists will be necessary. The city plans to launch a support programme that will enable the preparation of comprehensive project documentation for the installation of RES on historic buildings. Currently, such a project is already being implemented by the municipal unit KEGW in the Nowa Huta Cultural Park.

The Municipality of Krakow actively promotes distributed energy generation by supporting prosumer initiatives, providing subsidies and advisory support. As a result, the growth rate of new PV installations is accelerating year on year. Between 2020 and 2021, more than 19% of newly connected installations had financial support from the Programme for the Development of Renewable Energy Sources in the Municipality of Krakow (PROZE). Significant funding for the intensification of existing programmes and the creation of new ones will come from the National Reconstruction Plan, allowing pilot and innovative RES projects to be implemented in the city. In 2020, only one in sixteen residential buildings in Kraków had PV installed, while in 2021 it will be one in eight. More than 90% of the current PV micro-installations in Kraków (as of 2023) were connected between 2020 and 2023.

Actions to increase the share of RES also include the use of heat pumps for heat production in buildings, with air source heat pumps predominating and some ground source heat pumps.

Many energy companies and enterprises, such as Krakow Municipal Holding, PGE EC S.A., MPEC, Tauron and PSE, are implementing their PV farm projects. However, due to the dense urban development of the city, it is necessary to intensify activities and to search for suitable areas for PV farms. Post-industrial areas such as ash and slag dumps have great potential. The Municipality of Krakow is also looking for new sites for PV farms in neighbouring municipalities, which creates new business opportunities in the metropolitan area. Companies will be established in the surrounding municipalities to lease land for PV installations and resell green energy. These investments are profitable thanks to the favourable conditions for solar energy in the foothills around Krakow.

Krakow is also participating in the ATELIER project, which aims to create Energy Positive Districts. This project aims to reduce CO₂ emissions by implementing local smart urban solutions, supporting sustainable, safe and accessible energy systems and promoting cooperation between partner cities. As part of the ATELIER project, Krakow aims to increase knowledge and skills in the development of integrated energy districts, organise a local "Innovation Atelier" and integrate renewable energy into the city's heating and cooling system.

The city will develop a plan to replicate the concept of Energy Positive Districts in selected areas, increasing resident and stakeholder involvement as a pathway to climate neutrality. Increasing the

share of RES in the city's energy mix is a key element of this strategy, contributing to the sustainable development of Krakow and improving the quality of life of its residents.

# Priority 3 - Rail transport

The third priority objective for the city of Krakow in terms of achieving climate neutrality is the development of rail transport. A key element of this strategy is the development of a network of collision-free trams that allow rapid and reliable travel around the city without disruption from traffic. The construction of a metro is also planned, which could provide an alternative to the busiest routes and significantly relieve the burden on surface traffic. The increased accessibility of the tram network aims to reduce the need for car transport, which will contribute to reducing emissions and improving air quality. The new tram lines are to be fully integrated into the existing public transport infrastructure, providing convenient transfers and shorter journey times. By investing in modern tram rolling stock, Kraków is betting on ecological and energy-efficient solutions. Collision-free tram routes will allow increased speed and punctuality of journeys, encouraging residents to give up their cars in favour of public transport. The expansion of the tram infrastructure also provides for the development of green tracks, which will further reduce noise and improve urban aesthetics. In addition, the increased availability of trams and the planned metro will contribute to the sustainable development of the city by supporting emission-free mobility. As a result, Kraków is aiming to create a modern transport system that is friendly to both the environment and residents.

# Priority 4 - The need for cooperation

The above priorities require cooperation and commitment, but they are also an opportunity to keep Krakow attractive to investors and make it a comfortable place to live. To attract highly skilled professionals, we need to offer development opportunities, a high standard of living and participation in the management and planning of the city's development. One of the biggest challenges of the transformation is to mobilise private capital and develop business models that combine public and private capital. The second key challenge is to ensure broad support and activity of different social groups: residents, entrepreneurs and researchers. That is why we are improving the tools of participation and dialogue: citizen panel, civic budget, financing of social initiatives, workshops with residents, consultation of solutions, education and consultancy.

The most numerous group needed to bring about accelerated change are citizens. Developing solutions with civil society to the challenges of achieving climate neutrality for the city is key. The Climate Contract between the City of Krakow and the European Commission requires the involvement of key stakeholders in the city, such as business and industry, the science and technology community, NGOs. Including their perspective on the city's achievement of climate neutrality early in the policy and decision-making processes will provide the city with valuable guidance and identify their role as partners in developing long-term, broad-based support for the Mission of 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030. In order to implement the Mission, it is also very important to develop a collaborative dialogue with the Polish government so that the actions taken are stronger and can gain wider public recognition and support.

# 4 Principles and process

## Values and Principles

The implementation of the Climate Contract for Krakow will be transparent, accountable, open to new approaches, innovative and carried out with the involvement of many actors and citizens, in the form of participation and co-partnership.

The above approach results from the principles set out in the Krakow Development Strategy "Here I want to live. Kraków 2030", the principles of implementation of the Strategy and the strategic management documents subordinate to it.

The Contract shall be implemented in accordance with the standards of governance and public co-management specified in the Strategy, which in the context of achieving the city's development goals represent a set of overriding values shaping the way in which not only the Local Government of the City of Krakow, but also its social, economic and public partners act. The standards in question relate to: the responsibility of the city government to provide high quality services; the responsiveness of public officials to residents' problems; multi-lateral partnerships; adaptive management.

As a local government community, we are united in the need to refer to a set of norms to guide us in the management of the city, the implementation of public policies or in our daily dealings with citizens. By appealing to civic attitudes, the values and principles reinforce our sense of community.

**Responsibility.** Responsibility for actions, words. Respect for commitments and reliability. Responsibility also includes solidarity with others. It is also the efficiency of local government structures, understood as efficiency of action, responsibility for a high quality of life and public space.

**Openness.** Willingness to accept the new or the different - a person, an idea, an idea. Willingness to compromise on the vision and priorities for Krakow's development. Openness to new proposals for solving social issues. Openness towards visitors to Krakow; also openness towards the surrounding municipalities.

**Social dialogue.** Understood as encouragement and inspiration directed at residents to engage in and co-determine the development of the City. It takes into account the interests of different groups and builds effective communication mechanisms.

**Building competitiveness.** The entire development policy of the City should be directed towards the sustainable strengthening of its competitiveness, based on its own development resources. In the conditions of global competitiveness and mobility of capital, this means first and foremost investing in human and social capital, also the active involvement of entrepreneurs and investors, as it is on them that economic growth and investment depend the greatest extent of economic growth and investment.

**Flexible response.** A way of acting by the local government that makes it open and inviting to residents to undertake new activities and find solutions together. It is a guarantee of surviving crises and responding appropriately to emerging challenges and problems and problems.

Equal opportunities. This means equal access for residents, social groups and communities to the opportunities and opportunities provided by the City's development resources and potential.

# Krakow Climate Citizen Assembly

Krakow is one of the few cities in Poland to have held two citizens' assemblies. These assemblies allow all selected citizens, representing a cross-section of society, to have their say - and not just those who usually participate in the city's activities anyway, due to their membership of an NGO or a group with particular interests. Their vote matters - the recommendations with the highest support are accepted by the mayor for implementation.

Very important in the context of the city's zero-carbon agenda was the Krakow Climate Citizen Assembly. This assembly involved many of Krakow's community groups to develop common goals for the city to achieve. It took place in 2021 and was dedicated to climate change and the city's climate neutrality. Its participants explored how authorities and residents could reduce energy consumption and increase the use of renewable energy.

As a result of its work, 32 high-quality recommendations were developed and submitted to the city authorities, which, according to the adopted assumptions, are binding for the Mayor of Krakow.

Recommendations concern many areas of city functioning. They are often interdisciplinary and cross-cutting in nature, which is why many municipal departments, teams and units are involved in their implementation. Their scope and subject matter vary, so each requires an individual approach and planning as well as the provision of financial resources for their implementation. One of the main recommendations is to develop a climate strategy for the city, which is this Climate Contract for the City of Krakow.

# Krakow in cooperation with science and business

For years, Krakow has been consistently implementing actions to achieve climate neutrality by implementing sectoral programmes in various areas, such as increasing the use of renewable energy, energy efficiency or transport accessibility. The City of Kraków invites representatives from all walks of life, local government organisations, business, science and residents to participate in climate and environmental initiatives.

Krakow is implementing the Joint Purpose Agreement between the City of Krakow and the Krakow Science and Academic Centre signed by 21 entities (the Municipality of Krakow, members of the College of Rectors of Higher Education in Krakow, the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences). The main objective of the document is to intensify cooperation with the Krakow Scientific and Academic Centre (KONA) and use its potential for the sustainable and smart development of Krakow, in line with the in line with the provisions of the Kraków Development Strategy "Here I want to live. Kraków 2030".

A draft Krakow Cooperation Programme with KONA for 2024-2029 has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Krakow Development Strategy "Here I want to live. Krakow 2030" and the
Kraków

Commitments to climate neutrality by 2030

agreement for the implementation of a common goal concluded in 2021 between the Municipality of Krakow and representatives of the Krakow Science and Academic Centre.

Entrepreneurs, making efforts to achieve this ambitious goal, play a special role in Krakow's climate transformation process. The City of Krakow values and supports them, and encourages long-term cooperation in this area in the form of creating a platform for the exchange of experience between companies involved in climate action, the promotion of pro-climate solutions, promoting pro-climate solutions and ultimately reducing emissions from their operations.

In order to realise these assumptions, an initiative called the Pact for the Climate was created and addressed, among others, to Kraków's entrepreneurs, solemnly inaugurated at a meeting with representatives of the Kraków City Hall. During the meeting, representatives of participating companies had the opportunity to present good practices and the pro-climate and pro-environmental initiatives they undertake. This part of the meeting showed that the companies that responded positively to the city's initiative understand the urgent need to intensify their efforts to improve the quality of the environment, which is key to building a safe and healthy place to work and rest for all residents. They represent a great potential and a promise that green Krakow, through the joint efforts of the local government, business and other key Krakow communities, will soon become a reality.

# Climate Contract process

The unit responsible for the creation of the Climate Contract is the Department of Municipal Economy and Climate of the City of Cracow, Municipal Infrastructure Department. Within the framework of intra-departmental cooperation, many of the data on the city's baseline were consulted with other departments of the Division, in particular the Department of Energy and the Department of Waste Management. During the development of the Climate Contract, the different versions were consulted with other municipal departments and units, such as Climate - Energy - Water Management, the Air Quality Department or the Strategy, Planning and Investment Monitoring Department.

As part of expert collaboration on climate change, a special team called the Zero Emission Krakow Portfolio Advisory Team has been established. This team consists of 18 experts from various sectors, including universities, NGOs, technology companies, energy institutions and the health and innovation sectors. The team also includes professors from technical and economic universities and representatives from energy organisations. A preliminary version of the Climate Contract Action Plan was presented to these experts for consultation, to which they introduced comments and suggestions and proposed some of the emission reduction actions in the Action Plan.

The work on the Contract was also assisted by a number of other external experts. A very strong substantive contribution was made by experts employed by NetZeroCities, in particular:

Experts from the University of Madrid, responsible for the preparation and development of the Economic Model, particularly Sean Murray and Julio Lumbreras.
NetZeroCities advisors, consulting on progress, discussing difficult issues and problems and organising training workshops for those responsible for the creation of the Contract - Justyna Wieczorkiewicz-Molendo and Anna Sokolowska.

Experts from the World Bank who provided numerous comments, amendments and advice affecting the readability of the Climate Contract, notably Marcel Ionescu-Heroiu, Ionut Tudor Maries, Codruta Nistor and Mariusz Krisztea.

In addition, work on the Contract was consulted with teams (transition teams) from other Polish cities participating in the 100 Cities Mission - Łódź, Rzeszów, Warsaw and Wrocław. As part of this cooperation, it was possible to work out a number of solutions taking into account national specificities. It has also resulted in cooperation with authorities at national level, including individual Polish ministries.

In the cooperation implemented at national level, a special place is given to the cooperation undertaken with ministries, in particular the Ministry of Climate and Environment, the Ministry of Funds and Regional Policy, the Ministry of Development and Technology and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. This collaboration is sustained through specialised platforms, such as CapaCITIES, but also through face-to-face online and live meetings, in Warsaw, among representatives of ministries, Polish City Mission cities, with the support of NetZeroCities advisors and representatives of the European Commission. The aim of this collaboration is to trigger positive legal changes, much needed in terms of legislation for the implementation of pro-climate actions, but also to mobilise public capital to support action.

# Future iterations of the Climate Contract

The first iteration of the Climate Contract is planned for two years after its adoption. It can be expected to introduce many changes and improvements, especially in the financing mechanisms for the actions described in the Investment Plan section. It is planned that the second iteration will take place in 2028, and in 2030 it is foreseen to check how far the objectives of the contract have been met.

Verifiability of progress towards the Climate Contract targets will be ensured by the City's Greenhouse Gas Inventory, which monitors the decrease in emissions in Krakow on an annual basis. On its basis it will be possible to assess at which stage of the transformation the city is currently at and how much remains to be done. In addition, there are plans to expand the Municipal Greenhouse Gas Inventory from the Basic to the Basic + level in the future. It is planned to expand this inventory to include separately distinguished emission sectors: Industrial Processes and Product Use (abbreviated IPPU) and Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (abbreviated AFOLU), as well as additional greenhouse gases.

Essential information on relevant monitoring data will be provided by the city's STRADOM system. This system contains the key projects implemented in the city. Each of these projects, in turn, is assigned evaluation indicators to assess the degree of project implementation.

During the iteration, the 'Module A-2 Assessment of current strategic management strategies, policies and instruments' will be updated. Most of the documents described in this chapter are also subject to a two-year iteration cycle. Updates to the Climate Contract and progress within the implementation of the documents themselves will emerge from the re-review of policies and strategies.

Along with the two-year update period, the activities resulting from the module "B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design". The status of the tasks, whether they have been completed or to what extent, and any adjustments arising during project implementation will be determined.

Another important element in terms of the plan for future iterations is the information contained in the in reporting to the CDP (Climate Disclosure Project). CDP is a not-for-profit organisation that runs a global system for collecting and publishing data on the environmental impact of investors, companies, cities and regions. CDP is recognised as one of the world's most credible ranking organisations on this topic. In connection with our city's participation in the Cities Race to Zero campaign and the Covenant of Mayors on Climate and Energy, Krakow has been reporting on climate change adaptation and mitigation activities through the CDP since 2022. The monitoring of the score awarded to the city of Krakow each year will allow for external confirmation of the tasks implemented towards climate neutrality.
