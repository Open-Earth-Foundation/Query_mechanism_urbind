Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# 1 Introduction

The quality of life of citizens and the conservation of the territory have always been at the centre of the policies of the Administration which pursues the EU objectives with sustainable and smart policies.

Florence is a very complex territory but also historically an extremely dynamic city, open to innovation.

The urgency of climate change and the new needs/sensitivity of citizens on the issues of sustainable and innovative territorial and social development have convinced the municipality to accept the challenge of the zero-impact smart city mission, capitalizing on what has already been activated in terms of structure, systemic approach, collaborations and participation, programs and initiatives, ...

The Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) and the subsequent plan also extended to the climate issue (SECAP) elaborated on the basis of a Total Quality Management System and with the support of European partners lead us to 60% savings on emissions climate-altering with the projects already planned and financed.

With the present document we intend to start a process in rapid and continuous evolution which, thanks to new funding opportunities, a wider audience of adhesions, including extra-territorial ones, the support of research and technological innovation aims to realize an extremely ambitious already strategically budgeted for the long term, but which technologically or financially had not yet been defined. We start from the effective panorama, outlined by the SECAP and by all the current plans correlated with the various measures and collaborations activated, expanding the lines of action already in place thanks to the new programming (NRP, NP Metro plus, ...) and new or increased commitments by the stakeholders. Given the objective limits of a territory like that of Florence, it will be essential to continue with a large set of differentiated interventions that can be adapted to the different needs and limits and that can add up to every possible contribution. It will be necessary to intervene on efficiency and energy saving together with the sustainability of energy vectors, accelerating wide-ranging electrification in various sectors, with massive use of self-produced or purchased green energy and new generation biofuels. To cover the inevitable "last mile", the green plan for the maintenance and increase of the arboreal heritage will certainly be of support, with broad effects of absorption, mitigation and adaptation. In addition, Florence as the leading city of the metro city, together with its subsidiaries, will be able to extend good sustainability practices to neighbouring municipalities by offsetting the remaining emissions that its particular condition as an UNESCO city, capital and destination for significant tourist flows does not allow to zero.

Currently the only area of exclusion, in line with the Covenant of Mayors, is air traffic for reasons of competence and availability of specific data history. However, the city airport is an integral part of logistics and mobility as well as urban services and will be able, thanks to the usual collaboration, in the following phases to provide insights into the evolution of the impacts that technological improvement and above all the use of new fuels (SAF) have had and they will be able to contribute.

In the drafting of the SECAP, with a view to linking this strategy and the complete decarbonisation of the activities under the municipal jurisdiction, the water and waste management services referring to the share of municipal use/contribution have already been added compared to the previous plan.

The participatory processes with stakeholders (starting from those already involved in the smart city plan and in the SECAP and from the existing working groups like the one of mobility managers, logistics companies, large companies, etc) and citizens (starting from the pilot climate assembly and the dedicated campaigns - www.firenzeperilclima.it) will be strengthened, as a necessary precondition for achieving the goal.

Thanks to the numerous European cooperation projects, a SWOT analysis has been in progress and continues to evolve with respect to the objective of climate neutrality schematized as follows.

Figure 1 - SWOT Analysis "climate neutrality in Florence"

As city are complex and living organism, also the action plan, as the other chapters/sections of the Climate City Contract, are «living documents» to be continuously improved, adapting to evolving framework, to monitoring results and to a wider involvement of stakeholders; the documents have been developed following the Net Zero Cities templates and guidelines (https://netzerocities.eu).

## 2 Work Process

Florence is a cultural heritage city, its historic centre was named a UNESCO site in 1982 and it is known worldwide as a tourist destination; it is a unique social and urban achievement which includes the greatest concentration in the world of museums, churches, buildings and artworks. The development of the city is strongly constrained by the need of preserving the rich historical and monumental heritage that very often represents a concrete obstacle to the most ambitious projects, avoiding any impact on the landscape. The interventions for energy efficiency and emissions saving must be

done in compliance with the landscape constraints and boundaries thus adapting the technology and set of opportunities to the urban context.

Nevertheless, the city is fully engaged in urban transformations in the name of sustainability and innovation in a path that started in 1998 with the Alborg Charter commitment and saw the active participation in almost all EU initiatives concerning sustainable, green and smart cities.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 2 – Florence path towards sustainability

The Smart City Plan (2015) offered a systemic and coordinated vision of urban life from an integrated planning perspective in terms of infrastructures and mobility, energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, focusing on social dimensions and citizens' well-being. A powerful tool for achieving concrete goals for the city and the community, thanks to solutions for improving everyone's life quality.

The city aims at facing the major challenges related to climate change, which are amplified by the intense number of city users and activity while preserving its priceless heritage. The UNESCO Management Plan is another valuable example of how the city is approaching and implementing a holistic management system combining cross-sectoral competences for the protection and enhancement of the social and biocultural assets of the city as smart destination.

Since 2010, the urban planning has focused on refurbishment and reuse of dismissed buildings to prevent soil consumption (Zero Volume) and the new Plan highlights the link with the SEAP/SECAP and the related actions and targets.

The present strategy will be fully integrated with the existing framework, based on existing facilities (internal structure, systemic approach, participatory processes and cooperation with relevant stakeholders...) boosting the transition targets foreseen for 2040-2050 enabling new synergies, focussing next investment programs on climate issue, engaging more and more stakeholders and testing innovative solutions in terms of technology and management/financing.

Referring to the NCZ climate transition Map, the city of Florence has already set up a similar iterative process for the energy &amp; climate strategies thanks to the involvement in different initiatives which have modified the city's approach and procedures:

the European Energy Award (Comune Clima in Italy www.european-energy-award.org and https://www.agenziacasaclima.it/it/comuneclima-1559.html) a Total Quality Management System for municipalities focussed on the energy &amp; climate as transversal theme throughout all municipal competences;

the system thinking approach which has been acquired during FP7STEEP and has been tested in the development of the co-created Smart City Plan (2015) where Florence has committed for the first time to the zero-emission target set for 2040-2050 decade.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 4 – The NZC Climate Transition Map

Build a strong mandate: the political commitment has been set long ago and continuously confirmed and improved; a « Climate task force » has been created within the local government since 2010 in the framework of the CoM.

The structure is interdepartmental and flexible to cover any possible upcoming need or issue: it is structured into several « habitat teams » that are interacting with relevant stakeholders. The local city ecosystem has thus adopted a collaborative governance model that is already implementing the previous plans and testing innovative collaboration schemes for example with the creation of the Smart City Control Room for an advanced urban management and monitoring. The concept will

be extended to other government levels, strengthen buy-in and mutual commitments starting from the metropolitan and regional area. The city is also very active in networking at national as well as at international level to be in touch with innovative ideas and to find solutions to common needs as in case of the 9 Italian mission cities. Together with them Florence intends to engage the national stakeholders who could facilitate the regulatory and technical framework for the transition.

Understand the system: Florence has been monitoring its impacts regularly through qualitative and quantitative methods since the adhesion to the Covenant of Mayors, to the EEA program and to the CDP initiative for steering and controlling the achievements (it's an EEA Gold city and rated A for 3 consecutive years in CDP).

Figure 7 - CDP feedback report and score 2022

In the recent development of the SECAP, the inventories have been improved including other GHG emissions and extra territorial (scope 3) sectors, keeping the 2005 baseline (suggested by CoM in the Guidelines) as reference to underline the continuity and coherence of its path. Stakeholders mapping is a continuous activity started in 2010, in parallel with the first participatory processes (Town meeting for the structural plan). The analysis of the gaps that stand in the way of the 2030 ambition is, as the previous activities, part of a circular «living process» which follows the classic Deming cycle. The municipality intends to continue its management approach, improving data sources also through the ICT innovation and its Smart City Control Room and possible data exchange agreements at regional and national level promoted together with the other mission cities.

Co-creating an action portfolio: the co-creation through participatory paths has become a common practice embedded in the municipal working approach since 2010, improving the methodology with system thinking test practices in 2015: in the FP7 STEEP project, the city received the support of international experienced partners for stakeholders mapping, value creation eco-system analysis and the creation of a suitable actions portfolio cocreated with the stakeholders targeting carbon neutrality. Recently Florence has also taken part to the H2020 CoME EAsy project, supporting the development of stakeholders' engagement guidelines for cities $^{1}$  and the definition of a KPI dashboard for EEA municipalities to monitor their advancements in compliance with main ISO regulations like 50.001, 14.001, 37.120, etc. and EU initiatives $^{2}$ . Moreover, in the SECAP each action has been equipped with specific indicators to allow the quantified evaluation of achievements.

As already mentioned, the planning process has been approached as a continuous optimisation activity based on quantified evidence that could adapt to evolving framework: Florence intends to use all the know-how gathered so far and set up a co-design program to optimise the first proposed portfolio.

The milestones have been set as follows:

## 3.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

The city of Florence started to assess its consumption and emissions with the Covenant of Mayors baseline for the year 2005 to be aligned with the Provincial Energy Plan. Several monitoring inventories have been calculated regularly to assess trends and steer climate sustainable policies. The last monitoring consumption inventory 2019 developed for the recently adopted SECAP is reported in the following table.

## A-1.2: Emission factors applied

Florence is using standard emission factors for GHG gasses, that are calculated following the IPCC 2007 Fourth Assessment report methodology³ (GWPCH4 = 25; GWPN2O = 298), which include the three CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O gases, as these are the ones currently recommended for the national inventory reporting, in the frame of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

It is worth noting that they are characteristic of stationary sources. The CO₂-eq emission factors are up to 3% higher than the CO₂ values for the transport sector (e.g., for gasoline), because of higher non-CO₂ emissions compared to stationary sources.

In the context of EU and Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, the JRC provides the emission factors for calculating GHG emissions attributed to the electricity consumption. The National Electricity Emission Factor is taken by JRC NEEFE 2010-2020.

The National and European Emission Factors for Electricity consumption (NEEFE) are calculated by dividing the total national  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions from electricity production from all input energy carriers by the total final electricity consumption $^{4}$ . According to the methodological approach followed by the local authorities $^{5}$ , the NEEFE have been calculated by applying the IPCC "standard" approach to the energy carriers consumed to produce electricity. Eurostat's energy balances have been used for the European countries. The NEEFE factors in use are including  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ,  $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$  and  $\mathrm{N}_{2}\mathrm{O}$  emissions expressed in  $\mathrm{tCO}_{2}$  eq/MWh taken from the FAR (IPCC Fourth Assessment Report). In the CoM framework, the MEIs have been calculated following the initiative specific requirements with the 2005 baseline NEEFE, improved with local actions: the 2019 inventory provided here ("CCC 2019 inventory") has been calculated with the 2019 NEEFE (source JRC) not taking into account any green electricity purchase by the local authority or local production to avoid double-counting.

A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

The year 2019 has been chosen as the last year fully operational before the pandemic; the inventory developed, with the same data sources of the CoM baseline at 2005 (mainly DSOs for local fuel/electricity data, bottom up info for urban services⁶ and PA consumption and regional/national institutional databases) have been used, with different calculation methodologies compliant with the requirements of the initiatives⁷, in the CoM to assess the achievement at 2020 and in the Mission to identify the gap to be filled by 2030.

Compared to the reference year 2005, the targets have been largely achieved and the energy profile demonstrates a significant evolution as shown in the previous graphs: from 2005 to 2019 CO₂eq emissions in the municipal area decreased overall by 44,8% in per capita value, 43,3% in absolute value.

The comparison by consumption sector shows a clear improvement between 2005 and 2019 in the impact of mobility, services and the residential sector, while the tertiary sector and industry record less significant reductions.

Compared to the sources and energy vectors in use, there has been a substantial reduction in less sustainable fossil sources to the advantage of RES and the electrification of consumption.

The NCZ economic model confirm the overall results at 2019 as well as the sectors and fuels dependency; it provides also a business-as-usual inventory at 2030 which foresees a small decrease in buildings and transport due to the natural technological development and the trend of the population.

In synthesis, the 2019 inventory taken as reference baseline to measure the CCC improvements shows the following emission composition:

The Scope 1 emissions are due to heating and transport and refer to fossil fuels (methane gas, diesel and gasoline) except for the biofuels quote in the transport sector and a small amount of biomass and solar thermal for heating.
The scope 2 is the electricity distributed by the grid (which shows an increasing trend from 2005 in term of consumption but not in the emissions due to the improvement of the energy mix)
The scope 3 is related to waste and water management belonging to the urban area but consumed/emitted elsewhere.

The inventory includes the geographical administrative boundaries with the only area of exclusion, in line with the Covenant of Mayors, is air traffic for reasons of competence and availability of specific data history. However, the city airport is an integral part of logistics and mobility as well as urban services and will be able, thanks to the usual collaboration, in the following phases to provide insights into the evolution of the impacts that technological improvement and above all the use of new fuels (SAF) have had and they will be able to contribute. AFOLU are not evaluated since not relevant in terms of quantities (no significant changes in the use of soil, no farming) while energy consumption for agricultural vehicles or buildings are included in transport and buildings sector.

Municipal waste collection, managed by Alia Servizi Ambientali spa (a public utility of which the Municipality of Florence is the major shareholder) is considered with impact on scope 1 and 2 (vehicles and buildings in use within the city boundaries) included in the buildings and transport sector, while emissions for waste treatments outside city boundaries is included in scope 3. The following table shows the composition of urban waste (more than  $625\mathrm{kg / inh}$ . per year):

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 16 - urban waste fraction

The  $53\%$  of the waste is collected separately, the  $78\%$  recycled, the amount sent to incineration is the  $9.5\%$  and to landfill  $24.8\%$ .

Water distribution and wastewater treatment is also included in the inventory with the same approach. The integrated water cycle management (aqueduct and sewage) is entrusted to Publiacqua Spa, with a public capital holding (60% of which 21.67%, owned by the City of Florence). The aqueduct system of Florence presents a remarkable complexity, deriving from the presence of a quite large historical core, which makes it difficult to adapt structures to the technological innovations and to the growth in demand due to the strong tourist presence. As for many Italian cities, the origin of the aqueduct system dates back to Roman times when, in the case of Florence, water descended from Monte Morello through the gentle slopes of the hills. Over the centuries, the growing demand for water resources has prompted the construction of other underground supply sources (wells) as well as other sources; it was also necessary to access the area's most important water resource, the river Arno.

All the drinkable water consumers (domestic, public and non-domestic) are provided with a meter for the measurement of water consumption. These currently operate on a mechanical system, with some interesting trials of smart metering (automatic and in proximity).

The water losses registered in Florence in 2019 are equal to  $37\%$ , intended as the ratio between the overall volume entering the network and the sales volume.

The total drinking water consumption is 193 litres per capita per day.

Since 2014 Florence is entirely connected to the San Colombano water treatment plant. Therefore, all the city's liquid waste is sanitised. The facility collects the sewage deriving from both shores of the river, to respond to a necessity for treatment evaluated at 600,000 PE (The steady-state situation foresees an annual wastewater flow of approximately 42,600,000 m³, or the equivalent of about 1.36 m³/s for a total of 583,275 PE and the City of Florence contributes to about 70% of the total).

For several years Publiacqua has prepared a yearly Energy Efficiency Plan, identifying

the programme of interventions aimed at recovering the efficiency of the systems (for both the installations and management standpoints). In a four-year period (from 2018 to 2021), the energetic consumptions went from 116,0 GWh to 106,3 GWh, with a reduction of over  $8.5\%$ . The evolution of the energetic consumptions is illustrated in the following graph:

# A-2.2: Description &amp; assessment of policies

Florence set a first target for 2030 (-40%) and 2050 (-70%) in its SEAP (2011) and updated its ambitions, following monitoring results and action plan, in the Smart City Plan (2015). Targets are regularly monitored and further improved in the European Energy Award activity program (Gold audit 2021) and officially included in the SECAP (-60% at 2030 and net zero before 2050, planned at 2040).

Under the umbrella of its Smart City Plan which has been acting as the Master Plan on sustainable policies since 2015 when it was adopted after a long participatory co-design process following the system thinking methodology, every following urban strategy/plan is linked as "puzzle piece" to the others to reach the overall targets regarding citizens' wellbeing and environmental sustainability including carbon neutrality.
CERAMICI FIRANZE

In the SCP all sectors have been included and local stakeholders involved to coordinate and facilitate the transition, using ICT as enabler. The action plan transferring the SCP into action is the SECAP actually under adoption which follows the SEAP for the 2020-30 decade.

Several sectorial plans have been developed recently to detail specific targets:

&gt; the city's air quality plan (PAC), to be updated every 3 years, setting goals for the reduction of air pollutants including stationary and non-stationary sources. The actions included in the City Action Plan (PAC) for the rehabilitation and maintenance of air quality are compliant with the guidelines of the Regional Air Quality Plan (PRQA) whose objective is protecting public health, and the measures established in the sectorial plans are consistent and concurrent to reduce the emissions from the main sources.

&gt; the sustainable mobility plan (SUMP), regarding the public transport system and the sustainable mobility policies for the whole metropolitan area, to coordinate efforts, share infrastructures and facilitate common approaches. It was approved in 2021 after a participatory process with the active involvement of citizens and stakeholders from the very beginning. The SUMP approved in 2021 draws up a solid strategy based on four pillars:

① a high-capacity and efficient public transport system, through the extension of the tramway network, the enhancement of rail services, the construction of new BRT systems and the reorganisation of road services
② mobility hubs, to maximise the use of the tramway and public transport fleet, avoiding the use of private vehicles
③ the Green Shield, an environmental LTZ covering most of the city and controlled by a telematic control system
④ promotion of soft mobility, through a continuous and widespread system of bicycle connections, integrated with sharing, micro-mobility.

Autolinee Toscane manages the local public road transport, with 730 km of lines, 85 bus lines, 2.319 stops, and a fleet of 350 urban buses equipped with an AVM System, allowing to know their position in real time; since 2014, an e-ticketing service is active. The city is committed to decarbonise the bus fleet in urban LPT road service: the funds of the NRRP and PN Metro plus will be used to renew the vehicle fleet, providing over EUR 48 million for the purchase of new electric buses for LPT (objective of purchasing at least 30 buses by 2024 and 80 buses in total by 2026). Once this investment has been completed, the urban service will be carried out by the latest generation of Euro 5 buses (20%), Euro 6 buses (around 55%) and electric vehicles (around 25%).

A significant contribution to zero emission shifting is represented by the tramway lines (line 1, operating since 2010, lines 2 and 3 operating since 2018-19, line 4 expected by march 2024 and further extensions already planned), capable of attracting substantial mobility flows directed to the city centre. As capital city region and well-known all over the world, Florence reveals to be a city-users city: besides its 365,000 official residents, the city counts 15Mil tourist/year (pre COVID19) plus 150,000/200,000/day users (workers, students...).

&gt; the green plan (GP), to protect the existing green heritage and improve the number of trees and green areas in the city, following the post-pandemic approaches and the upcoming adaptation requirements, mainly contributing to counteract the "Heat Island" effect (hot points mapped and studied by CNR &amp; DUVRI). The municipal territory

includes a widespread green system consisting of parks, some with high historic-cultural value, and green areas, allowing almost all the resident population to be in reach of a green space from their home at just a 300-metre distance (following the 10 minutes principle). During the pandemic, it clearly emerged how green areas are fundamental asset for well-being as strongly expressed by citizens also during the participatory process started in 2020 for the new City Operational Plan (POC) and the Green Plan (GP). As first answer to the need, a special Urban Forestry project has been planned with short and medium impact: by 2030 Florence along with the Metropolitan City will provide for the planting of one million trees. Moreover, the Municipality of Florence is planning to go from the current $24\mathrm{m}^2$ of usable green areas per capita to $30\mathrm{m}^2$, thanks to the construction of new parks and the regeneration of green areas.

These measures are mainly funded by NextGenerationEU (NRP and REACT-EU) and 2021-2027 programming period and have already enabled a first package of interventions in green areas for € 18 million which will end in 2023, thus allowing the continuation of what has been implemented also regarding the use of green roofs or walls that the characteristics of built heritage encourage mainly out the historical centre or in specific pilots (as schools).

&gt; the waste and water management plans which analyse the specific service and set ambitious performance KPIs for the next years.

Water: the integrated water cycle management (aqueduct and sewage) is entrusted to Publiacqua Spa with a public capital holding (60% of which 21.67%, owned by the City of Florence. The aqueduct system of Florence presents a remarkable complexity, deriving from the presence of a quite large historical core. The management vision aims at overcoming the segmented territorial logic to establish an interconnected aqueduct network of the 2 areas Florence-Chianti and Prato-Pistoia. For several years Publiacqua has prepared a yearly Energy Efficiency Plan, identifying the programme of interventions aimed at recovering the efficiency of the systems (for both the installations and management standpoints). Publiacqua Spa has planned significant replacement investments to renew the pipes infrastructures aimed at achieving two main environmental objectives related to water losses reduction and to water quality improvement.

Waste collection: it is managed by Alia Servizi Ambientali spa, a public utility (of which the Municipality of Florence is the major shareholder). The waste collected in the city of Florence in road and door-to-door mode in 2019 amounted to $235\mathrm{kg}$ per capita. The 2019 data is the baseline for the five-year plan «Firenze Città Circolare», the Waste Plan approved in 2020 aimed at improving the quality and quantity of differentiated waste through innovations in the collection system and stimulating greater awareness and responsibility of people. The project includes the industrial strategy of Alia in relation to the availability and strengthening of the plants for the most important recycling chains: Paper; Glass; biomethane; plastic granule; biofuels; bulky waste. The objectives of the project were analysed in terms of the environmental impacts and benefits generated by the management of urban waste collected in the city of Florence, comparing the starting state (year 2019) with the future scenario (2024 fully operational), through the application of the LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) method.

buildings/surfaces for the city's development. Its leading principle is to rehabilitate, thus preventing the land consumption (so-called "Zero Volumes"). Thanks to the empty spaces and brownfields mapped by the Urban Plan, in a co-created process, the areas needing attention and accomplishment of public and private actions-infrastructure services were identified. Through the Urban Planning Rules 2015-2020 (updated together with the operative plan) over  $40\%$  of the transformational urban area provisions have been implemented (thus having 900.000 sqm gross usable area redeveloped and relocated with 0,7 BLN of investment and 7.500 jobs).

&gt; the City Operational Plan (COP) that, following the “zero volumes” vision, rules the urban development facilitating retrofitting and RES.

All these tools will be constantly monitored and updated to enhance coordination and synergies or detailed to cover specific issues, as it is programmed for the SULP integrating the SUMP for the logistic sector.

The alignment with regional and national strategies is always under analysis also to exploit synergies with existing supporting investment possibilities, like those foreseen in the PON-Metro + or PNRR programs, infrastructural programs, like PNIEC for e-mobility or incentives and regulatory evolutions like the ones enabling energy communities.

To be consistent with its transition path, Florence has evaluated as first step the gap existing in the actual strategies to reach net-zero emission target keeping as reference the 2005 baseline in use since the first sustainable energy plan.

The following table summarises the results of the analysis: the recent SECAP together with the integrated local planning framework (SUMP, SULP, Green Plan, Operative plan...) is already targeting the  $66\%$  of reduction at  $2030^8$  with a remaining gap of about the  $14\%$  to be addressed. This scenario, not too far from the SECAP impact and investment plan, hasn't been considered in the following analysis which are referred to a more ambitious target calculated on the basis of the business-as-usual at 2030.

The path towards climate neutrality and sustainability in general is a big challenge for any city because energy and climate are complex problems that have to be tackled in complex urban systems.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 19 – UNESCO area (core and buffer zones)

Florence urban context is even more problematic because of the widespread presence of cultural heritage and UNESCO boundaries ("core" and "buffer" zone for about 11.000 ha) that are making authorization processes more complex and longer, are slowing down the installation of RES (solar potential can't be fully exploited because of landscape restrictions) and the retrofitting of the building stock.

The historical heritage and the leadership of the metropolitan city are attracting a relevant number of tourists (more than 14 million per year) and commuters. All those city users are improving the local consumption and emission profile compared to other cities of the same size. Moreover, tourists as temporary guests of the city are difficult to involve in awareness rising activities and long-term policies.

Communication activities are also affected by the differences in requirements of the various initiatives and programs which could make it difficult to apparently keep the coherence in the information and data for non-technical public.

Regarding data, another systemic barrier is the frequency of their collection and detail level in the different databases: yearly availability and sectorial detail would be very useful for monitoring and steering purposes, but, in some case, it is not possible to obtain regular updates for national agreements and energy companies' policies or GDP requirements.

A closer coordination at different level of governance is desirable for data exchange and management policies but in general for the alignment of legal framework; regional and national regulations and plans ought to support climate neutral policies with favourable policies and aligned targets.

The electrification of consumption for example is a local measure transversal to crucial sectors as buildings and mobility which could benefit from the optimisation of the national mix and the availability of green electricity. Another example could be the specific regulation and dedicated incentives for the promotion of energy communities or the access rules for the retrofitting incentives. The extension of the internal model (interdepartmental task force) to multi-governance is the main issue targeted in the pilot project Let's Gov together with the other Italian mission cities. A first step has been taken with the sign of a memorandum of understanding with the Infrastructures Ministry and the collaboration on-going with the Ministry for the environment and the energy security – MASE which consulted the 9 Italian mission cities to collect feedbacks about the draft of the National Plan for Energy and Climate PNIEC.

Additional issues related to finance and investment could be:

the stability of the supporting framework: national incentives schemes are regularly subjected to articulated changes which involves maximum subsidies thresholds, non-accumulative, and changes in the supported technologies. National programs like "Conto termico" or "EcoBonus 110%" providing support for energy efficiency are unstable and very complicated to access. Forecasts on fuel prices are often difficult and could affect significantly the business models, especially those with longer paybacks.
Externalities and co-benefits are not considered reliable business model inputs by financial Players.
A long administrative process is necessary due to the new national rules on public tendering (published in 2016 and modified in 2017) which are affecting all the phases of the tendering procedure (validation of the design with the public selection of the validator, most cost-efficient bid evaluation with a technical judging board, cash flow for the tendering procedure, lower possibility of "testing" solutions outside the market, ...).
Unforeseen issues, like pandemic period, have impacted on timing and final costs of works.
Extraordinary incentives for green actions led to an over-demand which resulted in the unavailability of materials, an unexpected increase in costs, thus involving more than a benefit, a damage to the execution with delay effecting the realization of the interventions and therefore the possible return of the incentives going beyond the foreseen times of use, affecting cost/effectiveness of the project plan.
Local infrastructures could not be ready for an accelerated transition: the distribution grids and the charging networks, as already started in Florence, should be continuously improved to enable innovation spread on the whole territory.

The main internal risk is that the municipal structure could result undersized to follow the additional work needed for the implementations. "Silos" are prevented by the internal inter-departmental working group organization and the total quality management system in place which must go on over time. Manage huge amount of funds, responsibilities and performance target within few years needs an internal review of the organizations investing in building capacity and reinforcing the administrative and technical staff of the departments involved, include the management staff, thus guaranteeing the correct use of the funds on time, capitalising experience.

# A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality

After several years of experience and exchange with other fellow cities, it resulted clear the "Smart and Sustainable City" needs to be a "liquid" concept with no rigid and static definition linked to the use of technologies: it is more related to a continuous process or an approach embedded into the municipal organization which must respond to new challenges for its citizens' wellbeing and its own resilience.

The model developed by the city thanks to different EU innovation projects, is based on the following elements: behind innovative technologies that are evolving faster and faster and, in few years, can also become cheaper changing completely their actual business models, the supporting factors for the diffusion of the Smart and Sustainable approach in use in Florence to pursue climate neutrality resulted in a supporting local

legal framework, a renewed internal organisation, the creation of portfolio of actions with the evaluation of all the external impacts and a structured co-productive approach.

The stakeholders' group is quite wide, and it is based on previous experiences and ongoing cooperation activities on climate issues.

The engagement strategy for the net-zero at 2030, in accordance with the first communication campaign started in 2023, foresees the active participation of stakeholders with progressive steps of involvement, from institutional bodies to civil society, organizations and businesses with also a pilot "Climate Assembly of citizens".

Figure 24 - Stakeholders' engagement steps in Florence CCC development

Beside the internal involvement, three consequent engagement steps are foreseen:

this first version of the contract, as well as the "model 0" of the pathways, is developed in close cooperation with local public framework and active collaborations including regional and metropolitan authorities, urban services operators, university and research centres and other collaborations activated in the last years on innovation and climate projects.
The second step includes main infrastructures owners/managers (DSOs, transport...), financial institutions, energy &amp; mobility managers of big consumers from industrial and tertiary sector and feedbacks on "model 0" from a pilot "Climate Assembly".
In following stages, the engagement activity will become more and more capillary and from main stakeholders' associations will proceed targeting all citizens and city users to collate all possible feedbacks for the first update of the CCC in one year, starting an iterative optimisation process, intended as <living document="">

Among all the players listed in the model figure and involved in the process, the "facilitator" role has resulted very useful for the successful transition: supporting agencies, third parties and technical external expertise are crucial for the target realisation.

To ensure that all the recipients of the implemented and planned interventions are involved, the construction of a detailed local mapping of the stakeholders and a reference database has been envisaged. The mapping includes in particular: stakeholders already active on the issue of ecological and digital transition, civic and third sector organizations, professional and trade associations, unions and cooperative federations, service centres and intermediate bodies of an informal nature (e.g.</living>

business networks, hybrid spaces), incubation, acceleration and co-working spaces and other organizations such as banking foundations.

The elaborated database also includes all subjects of civil society, such as purchasing groups, neighbourhood associations and committees, etc. capable of involving and representing citizens in various forms. In drawing up the list of local actors, particular attention was paid to those subjects already active on the issues of environmental and social sustainability.

The mapping of the stakeholders allows to effectively achieve the involvement of limited targets for particular actions, using ad hoc communications and invitations, starting from a preliminary subdivision of the subjects mapped into categories. These categories are identified in the executive project as follows:

doer, actors willing to implement small concrete actions to reduce emissions that contribute to the achievement of climate neutrality
tellers, actors willing to propose events and/or dissemination contents on the topics of climate change and carbon neutrality
funders, actors willing to finance activities in support of the implementation of the Municipality's projects aimed at mitigating climate change and resilient urban development
advisors, natural persons who will form a support group able to provide expertise in various thematic areas and who will enter into relations with the Assembly both in the moments of information and in the moments of debate to provide technical-scientific support
testimonials, people known to the citizens called to act as testimonials for the participation process.

The database produced and the related subdivision into stakeholder categories will in any case remain an open and evolving document, undergoing modifications, additions and integrations as a result of the co-creation process.

The experience showed a big gap between the business as usual (technologies, stakeholders and management/financing models involved) and the implementation of the Smart &amp; Sustainable City concept: the pilot action in Replicate H2020 project developed in the last years tried to overcome this mismatch adopting project management mechanisms that allow to realign the interests of the various subjects in the field; the successful realization models are resulting from a different approach, which could enable the replication and the large-scale dissemination.

Meeting cities' smart and sustainable commitments requires investment in a portfolio of projects of different sizes, involving many stakeholders: interdepartmental work and co-creating planning are part to establish the dynamic network of stakeholders which characterises smart cities.

Smart &amp; Sustainable city structure resulted to be a network of links and relations not as rigid as a crystal lattice but highly adaptable like a liquid and always evolving: in a smart city the stakeholders' group has no fixed boundaries and membership is related to the degree of interest about a specific topic in a specific moment.

Systemic vision and networking are the pillars of Florence experience: a wide and well-connected smart structure at every level, as liquids do, naturally tends to adapt and extend itself.

# 4 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

## 4.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Hereafter, the pathways developed for the city of Florence to reach the climate neutrality at 2030 are illustrated: the NZC Theory of Change methodology has been matched with the one adopted for the SECAP (STEEP approach – Annex 1) integrating and adapting the strategy to align pathways and portfolio of actions in a unique model which could be easily compared with the NZC economic model for monitoring and control and used in the next steps of the co-creation process.

The starting point for mapping the TOC were the key emission domains, here “field of action”, critical for climate-neutrality: those identified by NZC in cooperation with the EU Joint Research Centre comprise – energy generation, stationary energy (including built environment), mobility &amp; transport, circular economy, nature-based solutions, green industry. Florence is addressing all the six domains with a specific pathway for energy systems, buildings, mobility &amp; transport, waste &amp; circular economy, green &amp; nature-based solutions. Industry has been considered transversal and embedded in all the other domains while two additional sub-fields have been highlighted (water management as relevant part of the green domain and communication as transversal strategy of all domains).

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 25 - NZC TOC's overall structure and its essential elements

Consistent with other NZC support and service design, there are six levers identified for the NZC TOC, namely:

) Technological innovation and infrastructure,
) finance and funding,
) Social innovation,
CENTRE FOR INTELLIGENT FIRMNZE

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

9

) Democracy and participation,
) Governance innovation, and
) Learning, capacity and capability building.

Within NCZ TOC, these systemic levers link the emission domains as a coherent portfolio, act as entry points into larger systems-wide transformations and support the design and implementation of a city's actions. The levers amplify and enable early and later-stage outcomes and long-term impacts, as well as lend structure to the city's impact pathways. These transition pathways progress across short-term, medium term and long-term timelines towards 2030 net-zero targets, including direct impacts (like sectoral GHG reduction), as well as a wide range of co-benefits and risks.

The impacts reported are those resulted from the CCC scenario based on 2030 BAU inventory (projection of 2019) which is more ambitious than the SECAP scenario with the baseline at 2005 (not analysed in this context but included in the SECAP-CCC monitoring activity in the next years).

The co-benefits due to the indirect impacts (other pollutants avoided, road accidents, hot spots avoided but also jobs created, energy poverty mitigation...) on several fields like human health, biodiversity, cultural heritage preservation, economy, etc. are part of the financial analysis included in the investment plan (see part 3 of the CCC, closely linked with this action plan).

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

The Climate Neutrality target has been assumed as the transformation of a complex system owned by all stakeholders and driven/facilitated by the municipality. Implementing the STEEP methodology described in Annex 1 in co-design iterative sessions, the municipality has drafted the very first model showing the pathways and portfolio of actions towards the NZC vision starting from what has been done for the SECAP and enhancing its targets.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 26 - FP7 STEEP model for smart &amp; climate neutral city in use

The 2030 strategy of the Municipality of Florence is aligned with the main European strategic objectives/challenges, also adopted by the Metropolitan City of Florence, namely:

A smarter city through innovation and digitization, which promotes and implements actions in the sustainable management of waste, regeneration and research in support of the circular economy and which makes innovation and digitization available to the various sectors.
A greener and lower-carbon city thanks to investments in the energy transition, renewable energies and the fight against climate change. A city that enhances biodiversity and the network of its protected areas, with particular attention to the protection of natural resources (such as water) and landscape, aware that policies for environmental protection and adaptation to climate change make the territory safer and more resilient even in the face of hydrogeological risks.
A connected city through investments in mobility and strategic transport and digital networks. A city that aims at the development of sustainable mobility and information and communication technologies, as tools for territorial inclusion and cohesion and as strategic infrastructures for an environmentally friendly, integrated, internationally connected territorial development supported by research and innovation.
A city with a strong focus on the social aspect, which implements interventions against poverty and in favour of social inclusion and close to citizens through the sustainable and integrated development of urban, rural and mountain areas.

The fields of action analysed are:

Energy systems with the decarbonisation of heating and electricity, promotion of RES and the smart grids.
Mobility with improvements in public transport, soft mobility, electrification of fleets and charging infrastructure, efficient logistics, accessibility and inclusion.
Buildings with higher performances in new and retrofitted buildings both public (municipal or belonging to other public authorities) and private.
Waste management with the increase in differentiated collection and recycling.
Water management with higher performances of the distribution network and the awareness rising for water saving.
Green infrastructures to increase public spaces liveability, buildings comfort and pollutants absorption.
Communication and education to support and multiply the effect of the other measures.

Impacts have been quantified based on the actual KPIs values, SECAP forecasts, the economic model outcomes and the target values from existing plans. National forecasts and objectives have been combined with influencing local framework and policies to calculate specific target values.

The overall impacts of the designed pathways are the following:

# 4.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

The numerous mitigation activities included in the plan can be divided by competence, including measures on directly managed municipal properties, the efficiency of urban public services under concession or the properties of other public administrations present in the area, the mobility sector, the urban development and territorial planning, governance and cooperation at different levels to finish with the communication and animation activities that will accompany the entire implementation of the plan.

The transitional model 0 aimed at "Pursuing climate neutrality and future citizens' wellbeing" consists in more than 80 actions and sub-measures belonging hierarchically to the six competence portfolios as shown in the following figure.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 28 - First level of model 0 "pursuing climate neutrality and future citizens' wellbeing"

A portfolio is not merely a list of actions connected to each-other, it is a collective effort unified by common direction. Portfolio actions are targeted at the same vision, building the pathways towards it by aligning to defined learning intents or goals. These goals act as frames to keep generating new actions, supporting the iteration process.

wastewater treatment plants. The partnership generated the best practice related to the drinking water fountains to reduce the use of plastic and transport of drinking water (455,000 l/y).

In 2019, the Water Safety Plan was drawn up and detailed analyses were carried out to introduce energy efficiency into the distribution systems and measures were activated to influence the company's consumption trends (-4,5% per year), as it can be seen from the following table:

|  Water Treatment Plant | 2019 |   |   | 2020 |   |   | 2021  |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

The table shows the water volume production and the energy consumption of the two main water treatment plants (Anconella e Mantignano) in the period 2019-2021. The optimization of energy consumption led to a reduction of the specific energy consumption of (from  $0,3\mathrm{kWh / mc}$  in 2019 to  $0,293\mathrm{kWh / mc}$  in 2021) with a significant decrease of water production (from 80,9  $\mathrm{Mm}^3/\mathrm{year}$  to  $72,7\mathrm{Mm}^3/\mathrm{year}$ ).

A 2.4 MW hydroelectric plant was installed on the Bilancino dam (3,5 GWh/y).

Publiacqua Spa has planned significant replacement investments to renew the pipes infrastructures aimed at achieving two main environmental objectives related to water losses reduction and to water quality improvement.

The water loss management is based on:

pressure management

active leakage control

speed and quality of repairs

maintenance plan.

A series of strategic objectives have been defined, the main ones are listed below:

improvement of technical quality in service management in order to align to the requirements of the future Eu-directive

Improved commercial quality through increased response performance to the user

security for its employees and for the company's information and real estate assets;

environmental sustainability;

increased efficiency and productivity;

added value through innovative services and processes.

One of the main means of achieving these objectives is represented by the continuous technological and organizational evolution thanks

In this way, the City aims at achieving the targets set by the EU in the Circular Economy Package (Directive 2018/851). Based on urban characteristics, population density and attendance (tourists, city users, etc.), the territory of the city of Florence has thus been divided into zones, each of which has been associated with the most appropriate type of collection. The main objectives of the project are the spread of the 5R (Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Rot, Recycle) through the value chain, offering advanced services, the reduction of management costs while saving energy.  |

Figure 36 - Reduction of urban waste and improvement of separated collection

The project includes the industrial strategy of Alia in relation to the availability and strengthening of the plants for the most important recycling chains: Paper; Glass; biomethane; plastic granule; biofuels; bulky waste. The discard will decrease to  $5\%$  for paper and  $2\%$  for glass.

Further measures are:

Implementation of electronics installed on waste containers, with the extension of volumetric sensors.
Digitization of production processes, implementation of on demand services and optimization of resources, routes, consumption, and emissions.
Enhancement of the virtuous behaviour of users, as an incentive system for recycling and a substantial contribution to the reduction of emissions and climate mitigation.

Florence is deeply committed in the path towards circularity, it signed the City Declaration on Plastic Free (2019), the Circular City Declaration (2020) and the Green City Accord (2021).

In addition, the City approved the Florence Plastic Free Plan (2020) aimed at reducing plastic in public offices, in school canteens, during happenings and events, also stimulating private companies to follow this way.

Florence promoted also the Circular Economy Pact (2021) with local stakeholder with the aim of networking the actors of the territory, enhancing and exchange experiences in the field of circular economy, to create the conditions for common projects (public / private partnership).

The objective of the new green plan is to further increase green spaces through a five-year program of recovery and unused areas (+6% of urban green compared to 2018). In 2019-2024, an "urban forestation" program is underway, planting at least 15000 new trees, thanks also to crowd-funding initiatives. At the same time, management activities continue for the control, maintenance and progressive replacement of the tree population. The city is promoting also urban vegetable gardens to both improve green and food culture. Furthermore, for mitigation Florence is taking steps to green the walls/roofs of buildings and use greenery to reduce heat island (mapped with the technical support of the National Research Centre CNR).  |

|   |  Action description | Local public transport will continue its optimization to be able to meet the needs of citizens in a sustainable way and to contribute to the decrease in private transport. Pursuing the goal of sustainable and intermodal mobility, focusing on electric mobility, Florence has designed a large network of tram-lines nearing completion to increase the offer of local public transport (+20%). The road share can count on a fleet of 350 city buses in continuous modernization towards the decarbonization and electrification. The fleet of e-taxis has been supported by the city and is expanding rapidly. Subsidized taxi services for vulnerable citizens have been activated through an agreement with the municipality. Much has already been done on cycle paths, park and ride parking, sharing and pedestrian mobility and the planning of sustainable mobility provides for the continuation of soft mobility policies with various improvement actions for the completion of connections (internal and also towards neighbouring municipalities), safety and the promotion of intermodality. The “Bicipolitana” is a planned network of 8 cycle paths crossing the city. Bike sharing was activated with over 3,500 traditional and pedal assisted vehicles. A Florence bike app with route map is available. For pedestrian mobility, numerous safety measures have been carried out and a pedibus has been introduced for schools.  |

The principle of planning is to rehabilitate, limiting as far as possible the consumption of new ground (so-called “zero volume”) and improving the amount of the existing ecological network. For the first time, the Structural Plan granted equal importance to the system of ecological allocations as to that of mobility and collective facility systems, for the planning and management of the territory. Hence the definition and identification of ecological allocations, consisting of nodes and corridors making up the main network, formed by green elements of the urban fabric and connected to the metropolitan one.  |

|   |  | The operational plan, together with the green plan, contains the guidelines aligned with the new climate sustainability objectives.
In recent years, the availability of subsidies has favoured interventions aimed at promoting the improvement of the energy performance of buildings. Energy consultancy is carried out through the renewed desk in cooperation with Legambiente and the one-stop shop for construction, in particular on state incentives available for homes.
The intention is to proceed with an ERP housing redevelopment program by adopting high energy standards (NZEB).
The evolution of the building stock in the tertiary and productive sector is also regulated by the structural plan with precise guidelines regarding the redevelopment and limitation of new buildings. The implementation of the new Municipal Operational Plan foresees specific exchange tables and programmatic agreements for the development of a green tourism/productive system.
The municipality has encouraged the replacement of the boilers and also promoted the renovation of the facades with energy efficiency, increasing the national incentive (+10%).
In addition, advanced management and control systems, intelligent lighting and efficient appliances, the use of RES and the purchase of green energy is promoted (the last two measures are part of the action about decarbonisation of electricity).  |

The landscape constraints have considerably limited the development potential of solar plants, while the air quality requirements have not allowed the promotion of biomass power plants and cogeneration. Significant growth is expected following the launch of local energy communities that can facilitate, also thanks to the support of the municipality, the constraint and investment obstacle in the future by allowing access to many citizens. Two hydro plants are being installed in the Arno river within the Florentine area by the Region, as part of the eight plants programmed for a total cost of 80 M€ and a production of 55GWhe/y. Among the measures dependent on Other Entities there is also the improvement of the national electricity mix (NEEFE) strictly connected to local policies for the electrification of consumption, mainly in the mobility sector but also in the building sector, in synergy with the purchase and local production of renewable energy. The national emission factor target at 2030 has been set at 65% in the last update of the PNIECC.

## B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

The offset of the remaining emissions will be pursued through a compensation strategy based on the following options:

green absorption management within the city boundaries
improved green absorption outside Florence administrative boundaries (green projects from the metro city up to other nations)
support to the implementation of efficiency projects in the metro city or at regional level by third parties.

The actions not yet quantified or not included (like the increased use of biofuels, hydrogen, etc.- see section B1.1 Impact pathways) may contribute to decrease the offset needs, boosting the savings in mobility and buildings sector.

## 4.3 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

As part of its Total Quality Management System EEA and the monitoring program of the local planning framework (SUMP, SULP, SECAP...), Florence has adopted a comprehensive dashboard of indicators which is embedded in the Smart City Control Room concept.

In the CoME EAsy project Florence, as ambassador city, shared its experience to create a common KPIs list to be implemented by municipalities participating in different initiatives (ISO 50.001, 14.001, 37.120, Green capital/leaf, CoM, EEA, CDP...)¹⁰.

The Smart City Control Room and the Open data portal with about 2000 data sets (https://opendata.comune.fi.it), are collecting a huge quantity of data about mobility (traffic supervisor system), urban and infrastructural info, environmental data, etc.

Thanks to the involvement of urban service providers like Publiacqua, Silfi and ALIA, all data about public lighting and electric vehicles charging stations, water and waste management are available.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

In the SECAP as in this action plan, for each measure a set of KPI has been defined to monitor the achievements. It must be underlined that single project KPIs are often only measuring the advancement of the specific action and can't be added to evaluate the overall results because of the interactions and influences among actions.

Only a more complex model and the complete emission inventories can regularly monitor the real situation.

Hereafter a list of some KPIs included in the SECAP and SUMP actually included in the monitoring strategy.

C-1.2: Description of organisation and governance interventions

In the Smart and Sustainable city model Florence has adopted, the main enables consist in (see

Figure 22 – Florence Smart &amp; Sustainable City model (REPLICATE project)):

Municipal internal organization: the "Climate Task Force" - the usual structure has been adapted to new challenges, able to manage an integrated vision and open to innovative schemes: Florence has formally established in 2010 a permanent « Climate task force » adapting the structure to cross-cutting topics related to climate, flexible and active to support the upcoming needs of the city. It holds regular meetings to monitor activities, tune other plans under development, benchmark and exchange with other cities and initiatives. The Climate Task Force interacts with the other "habitat teams" composed by specific stakeholders and citizens, managing an interactive and iterative exchanges. Each member of the internal steering group is responsible for one topic: the internal responsible coordinates the sub-groups and then reports the results to the steering group, following the "sense checking" method.

Figure 37 – the climate task force and the "habitat teams" (source EEA)

the coordination of the legal framework at multiple level: this target will be pursued by extending the local task force and the coordination model at multiple-level as tested with the Digital Manifesto for the data exchange and the urban management and with the recent Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Region and Prato at regional level and by the participation in the pilot project Let's Gov together with the other eight Italian cities selected in the mission.

a strong vision with clear targets: the vision must be strongly supported and continuously steered following the evolution of the boundary conditions as it happened during the Covid pandemic or the Ukrainian crisis. The municipality intends to include in its statute the concept of the Climate and environmental

emergency and protection of rights of next generations; these adds to the fundamental chart of the city will ensure the future care and commitment.

a smart prioritisation of interventions: as explained in the next paragraph, the decision-making process ought to take into account multiple aspects and both direct and indirect impacts as the analysis included in the present document and in the investment plan.
a co-productive approach: this governance and social innovation is the most powerful tool to create and implement effective strategies that will result more coordinated, realistic, inclusive and impactful. For this purpose, involvement of stakeholders is one of the focuses of the present strategy (see Paragraph 3.3 and sheet 3.3) with a wide participation strategy including different tools and methodologies to reach all possible city user interested.

Stakeholder engagement methods are in continuous evolution and they can vary from a mono-directional information level to a participatory process. Their selection ought to be made taking into account the public involvement level targeted; the following table provides an example of the most appropriate options.

|  Methodology | Information (communication) | Consultation (long term processes) | Cooperation (specific projects) | Engagement (planning)  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

|  Co-benefits highlight (Smart prioritisation) | In the decision-making processes, indirect impacts will be highlighted | Administration | Stakeholders involved in different actions | Advanced business models and integration of funds | promotion of benefits  |

## C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

The system thinking approach as well as the participatory strategy have been illustrated in the previous paragraphs and in Annex 1.

Another social innovation regards the introduction of “externalities” or “co-benefits” in the assessment of the strategies and in their prioritisation during co-productive sessions. All the different impacts (direct and indirect) and co-benefits should be clearly pointed out in the decision-making process (health, social inclusion, poverty...): since its definition in Replicate project and in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals concept, the city is following the “Smart and Sustainable priority” concept as the sum of different aspects, at least economy-social-environment, in the evaluation of impacts and benefits.

The social and environmental impacts as well as the possible indirect externalities play a role also in the business model of the actions exploiting synergies from different funding opportunities and represent important added values for communication and engagement campaigns.

This approach is perfectly in line with the ISO (adopted also by EIP) definition of Smart City: “a city that increases the pace at which it provides social, economic and environmental sustainability outcomes and responds to challenges such as climate change, rapid population growth, and political and economic instability by fundamentally improving how it engages society, applies collaborative leadership methods, works across disciplines and city systems, and uses data information and modern technologies to deliver better services and quality of life to those in the city (residents, businesses, visitors), now and for the foreseeable future, without unfair disadvantage of others or degradation of the natural environment.”

# 6 Outlook and next steps

## Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration

The climate city contract is going to be constantly monitored and reviewed following an iterative process in use also for the CoM and the TQMS: in this way the action plan will become a living document, flexible and adaptable to the evolving frameworks and needs, resilient to deviations and inclusive with new contributions/stakeholders.

The frequency of the quantitative monitoring will follow the data availability from DSOs and relevant sources but will not exceed the two years period.

As already reported, for the first period a timeline is foreseen targeting an update of the portfolio in 2024 (see Figure 8 – The transition iterative timeline for the city of Florence). Next steps will consist in taking action implementing measures and involving more and more stakeholders, analyse the impacts and make the process “the new normal”.

Annexes

# 7.1 ANNEX 1: STEEP "System thinking" approach and methodology

By taking an integrated approach to strategic city planning where all systems and their interlinkages are considered would result in greater efficiency in terms of both carbon and cost and also provide other benefits such as greater stakeholder engagement and ownership of actions. The instrument for this endeavour should be a comprehensive plan which includes the whole set of necessary actions following a holistic approach.

Energy planning ought to be viewed as a wicked problem, because it has to deal with situations that are not well defined, because of many uncertainties and lack of reliable data, involving many interested parties with different perspectives. There is a general difficulty in agreeing objectives of interventions which requires creating consensus amongst parties involved to be successful (Yearworth, 2016).

The FP7 STEEP project identified the following key factors for its definition:

It is necessary to have the collaboration of all the stakeholders across the value chain: public administrations, technology experts, companies, end users, etc.
It is necessary to consider the city as a complex system of processes, where the different elements of the city are connected and one intervention in one process of the city influences the rest of the processes.

Figure 41 - Snapshots from STEEP modelling sessions

The STEEP Methodology is a systemic Problem Structuring Method (PSM) (Yearworth &amp; White, 2014) designed for use by organisations such as municipalities for planning transformations in complex problem contexts such as energy and smart city planning. These are examples of what is known as messy or wicked problems $^{11}$ .

The methodology is based on ideas from Soft Systems Methodology where a system model is considered as a conceptual device to describe the target transformation through the use of a root definition. For example:

"A city council owned system to transition the organisation to new forms of financing projects, by designing new smart city governance and project selection processes, in order to meet the capital investment required for the municipality's smart city portfolio addressing citizen needs".

The main benefit is that the methodology brings a system-thinking perspective to the transformation and manages the process of reconciling different stakeholder

worldviews, providing a common operational picture and addressing issues of transparency. It can be used with participants in multi-organisation groups.

The methodology can be applied at any time and at any scale of transformation. This is entirely determined by the root definition, which defines both the scope of the transformation and the stakeholder group. These are therefore co-dependent and co-created.

## 7.1.1 The model and the co-production methodology

The STEEP Methodology uses a form of systems modelling known as a Hierarchical Process Model (HPM) to develop a shared understanding by the problem owners about how to achieve the transformation.

The vision and the transformation:

Cities face the challenge of sustainable urban development: a city is something dynamic and mutating as quick as the needs of its society. To manage the inevitable changing process in a proper way there must be a long-term driving concept to be translated into policies which should overcome short term political cycles and technological development. Whilst the tools (i.e. technologies and methodologies) will evolve, with a clear vision, the city should be able to implement any innovative solution which helps to achieve the target. However, care should be taken that there is not a mis-match between transformational scope and stakeholder inclusion, disregarding their co-creational/co-dependent nature can lead to difficulties (Freeman &amp; Yearworth, 2017).

The first step in the process is to define purpose. Consensus amongst stakeholders regarding a high-level objective for the planning has to be achieved: this is essential in the process for prioritising interventions, as it allows a specific focus on what can be plausibly achieved and who will own this process. The following points are crucial for the successful implementation of the STEEP methodology:

There must be clear ownership of the process
Deciding the transformational goal and defining the stakeholder group are co-dependent activities. It is not possible to define transformational goals independently from identifying who would be the Actors (A) responsible for achieving them, and the Owners (O) accountable for the actions¹². Likewise, a stakeholder group with no transformational goal in mind is a nonsensical construct, in what does this group have a stakeholding? The ‘who’ and ‘what’ of a transformational goal must be defined simultaneously at the outset, before any thought about the how, when and why can be discussed. The STEEP methodology as implemented by Yearworth, Schien, and Burger (2014) focuses particularly on the latter, and particularly the method of system modelling, but the learning from evaluation has shown that this preliminary step is absolutely critical to success.

Experience from STEEP project suggests the “purposeful transformation” should be

sufficiently ambitious to catch the interest of stakeholders and to start the change
realistic in scope not to waste time in fruitless discussions

¹² The Actors (A) and Owners (O) are two of the three stakeholder groups identified in the CATWOE formulation of Soft Systems Methodology (SSM), the third is Customers (C). The meaning of these roles is discussed in the STEEP methodology training course (http://www.smartsteep.eu/resources/ )

wide enough to touch every sector of influence but focussed on the topic
dynamic and flexible in approach to be able to fit future evolution and recalibration due to the monitoring feedbacks.

The last consideration implies logically an ongoing planning process. The transformation is unlikely to be met simply with an agreed solution but will require continuous effort to bring about alignment of stakeholders' views on the problem and possible interventions: the actions, which will be documented as plans, are not the end goal, but it is the transformational system that is important.

# - The model building and performances monitoring:

The model can be developed by the owners of the transformation in a facilitated group model building workshop, or by a systems expert interviewing the owners, or a mixture of both. An example is shown in figure below.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 42 - System model and example of a performance evaluation produced in the REPLICATE project.

The one illustrated in the picture is a system designed to achieve the transformation described in the text. Each sub-process below the top-level process provides more detail about how to achieve the process. Two immediate actions are apparent from the Italian Flag scoring of processes i) the <managing &="" financing="" &="" mechanisms="" financing=""> process needs to be improved, and ii) the <managing credit="" rating=""> process is completely uncertain and needs some work to research how to implement this process.

answers about **how** the high-level processes can be achieved. The model can also be read **up the page** as answers to **why** processes exist. Inferior processes are ‘part-of’ or contained within superior ones.

The system model is designed to help with decision making and therefore **the processes can be evaluated for performance** using evidence from stakeholders. A colour scheme is used; green for a process performing well, red for processes performing badly, and white where there is little or no information about performance. The arrangement of green, white and red leads to its colloquial label of an **Italian Flag**. For each process that is labelled mostly red there is a clear need to act to improve its performance. For processes that are labelled mostly white then there is a need to find out more about what is happening or what needs to be done. For these ‘issue’ processes options must be developed to address them in order to improve the overall performance of the system. The stakeholders can be debate arguments for and against each option, or vote on them, until a decision is made about which options to implement. Thus, a group is able to work through the process of deciding a transformation and how it might be achieved leading to an ‘action plan’.

The approach can be implemented using the conventional props of flipcharts and post-it notes in face-to-face workshops. An experimental online system is available for working groups to continue developing system models and action plans (so-called same-time/different-places workshops (Yearworth &amp; White, 2019)). Expert systems’ modellers have access to modelling software that can produce systems models such as shown in the figure above. The latter can be used to calculate overall system performance metrics for monitoring.

Where there is some commonality of purpose across different municipalities and where there is a common facilitator (or facilitation team) that is operating across them, as is the case with CoME Easy, then there is an opportunity for exploiting some preliminary systems modelling prior to face-to-face workshops taking place. Experience from the expert facilitators themselves, as ‘qualified advisors’ in using the COM/SECAP and EEA processes, means that there is already an understanding of the transformational purpose that is *shared* or common by all municipalities. At the moment, this understanding is not shared between the qualified advisors, but is brought individually by them to each engagement. However, systems modelling of the sort used in the STEEP methodology could also be used to *capture* the knowledge of the qualified advisors to build a shared understanding of common elements (processes) of transformation that occur across all municipalities. It can be seen immediately that if these common elements (processes) of transformation need to (re-)discovered every time in a face-to-face workshop then a considerable amount of valuable time could be saved by initiating or seeding the workshop with this preliminary model¹³. Such techniques have been used successfully in the problem structuring field for many years (Rouwette &amp; Vennix, 2006; Vennix, 1996). The precise details of operationalising this preliminary model building stage in CoME EAsy will be published in the forthcoming training materials for qualified advisors and municipalities.

¹³ Face-to-face workshops require a considerable investment of time and commitment from stakeholders to attend. This is good for engendering a sense of buy-in to the process, but also places considerable stress on the facilitator to ensure that the maximum benefit is gained from this investment in time. By removing from this process, the elicitation of a model that is generally known implicitly, but to date hasn’t been made explicit, then the benefits from the workshop can be enhanced – primarily from participants being focussed on the processes of transformation that are *specific* to the municipality.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

It is expected that the STEEP methodology, enhanced with the preliminary modelling stage, is adopted as a continuous and ongoing process whilst the transformation is underway, rather than just used once at the start; the action plan being updated to reflect tasks completed, learning – which would lead to changes to the structure of the system model, and revised evidence about performance e.g. tasks completed should lead to processes becoming ‘green’. The key message from the STEEP project is that it is the planning process that is important; plans are inherently transitory and merely specific artefacts of the process.

The co-productive approach with stakeholders’ engagement is not going to end with the adoption of the action plan, but it should follow its monitoring and re-calibration over time.

# 1 Introduction

The city of Florence is driven by a strong commitment to address the challenge of climate change, recognizing the urgency of acting to mitigate the effects and to become more and more resilient to its impacts in order to preserve territory and improve wellbeing of citizens.

# EU FRAMEWORK

The EU framework has been evolving, setting more and more ambitious targets for urban context that have been identified as crucial for the mitigation of climate change since the "EU 2020 package", which was a set of laws passed to ensure the EU meets its climate and energy targets for the year 2020 cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to 1990, energy consumption by 20% compared to the trend scenario, and raising the share of renewable energy up to 20%.

To support of the Climate and Energy package, the EU has produced several policy papers with direct implications for national, regional and local legislation as the renewable energy directive and the energy performance of buildings directive.

In March 2011 the EU took one step further presenting to the EU Commission "a roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050" looking beyond these 2020 objectives and setting out a plan to meet the long-term target of reducing domestic emissions by 80 to 95% by mid-century as agreed by European Heads of State and governments.

The Paris Agreement, adopted by 197 Parties at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) on 12 December 2015, entered into force on 4 November 2016: its overarching goal is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. To limit global warming to 1.5°C, greenhouse gas emissions must peak before 2025 at the latest and decline 43% by 2030.

Conclusions on 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework, the European Council endorsed four main targets: 40% less greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990, at least 27% renewable energy consumption, a 27% energy efficiency increase, the completion of the internal energy market. On energy security, the European Council endorsed further measures to reduce the EU's energy dependence and increase the security of its electricity and gas supplies.

On 30 November 2016, the European Commission presented a package of measures to keep the European Union competitive as the clean energy transition changes global energy markets.

The proposals have three main goals: putting energy efficiency first; achieving global leadership in renewable energies and providing a fair deal for consumers.

Among the legislative acts that make up the package, we note the EU Regulation No. 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council, on the 11 December 2018, on the governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action ensuring that the Energy Union achieves its objectives, in particular the targets of the 2030 policy framework for climate and energy and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The binding target is the reduction of the GHG by at least 40% compared to 1990 levels by 2030.

Concerning RES, the share of energy from renewable sources in the gross final consumption of energy in Italy should not be less than 17%, already reached and exceeded (in 2017 was 18.3% already).

As regards energy efficiency, EU has set binding targets of reducing our energy consumption through improvements in energy efficiency by 2030 by at least 32.5%.

The European Commission published on 11 December 2019 a Communication setting out its so-called 'European Green Deal' (EGD), a roadmap aimed at resetting the Commission's commitment to tackling climate and environmental-related challenges. It aims to boost the efficient use of resources by moving to a clean, circular economy and stop climate change, revert biodiversity loss and cut pollution. The Green Deal is also an integral part of the European Commission's strategy to implement the United Nations' 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the other priorities announced in the political guidelines put forward by the President of the European Commission.

On 4 March 2020, the European Commission adopted a legislative proposal for a climate law, setting the objective for the EU to become climate-neutral by 2050. On 17 September 2020, the Commission amended the proposal to introduce the updated 2030 climate target of a net reduction of at least 55 % of the EU's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to 1990 levels, and it was approved by the Council on the 20 December 2020.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 1 - The EU Green Deal

On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted "Fit for 55", a set of policy proposals preparing the implementation of the EGD. In particular, Fit for 55 package aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by at least 55 percent by 2030.

|  GHG reduction by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels: European Climate Law | GHG reduction by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels: European Climate Law  |
|  The share of energy from renewable sources in the Union's gross final consumption of energy is at least 32 %: Directive EU 2018/2001 | The share of energy from renewable sources in the Union's gross final consumption of energy is at least 40 %  |
|  Reduction of primary energy consumption of at least 32.5: Directive EU 2018/2002 | Reduction of primary energy consumption of at least 36-39%  |

# EU INITIATIVES FOR CITIES

Following the EU legislative framework, the Covenant of Mayors (CoM) was launched in 2008 in Europe with the ambition to gather local governments voluntarily committed to achieving and exceeding the EU climate and energy targets. In 2014, Mayors Adapt – the Covenant of Mayors Initiative on Climate Change Adaptation – was set up by the European Commission as one of the actions of the EU Adaptation Strategy to engage cities in taking action to adapt to climate change as

cities consume the vast majority of global energy and are therefore major contributors of greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2021, the EU launched the “Missions”, new ways to bring concrete solutions to some of the greatest challenges it’s facing to deliver concrete results on ambitious goals by 2030. Cities play a key role in achieving climate neutrality by 2050: they take up only 4% of the EU’s land area but host the 75% of the EU citizens. They also consume over 65% of the world’s energy and account more than 70% of global CO₂ emissions.

The so-called Cities Mission will involve local authorities, citizens, businesses, investors as well as regional and national authorities to deliver 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030. Paving the way to climate neutrality by 2030, ensure that these cities act as experimentation and innovation hubs to enable all European cities to follow suit by 2050.

As foreseen in its implementation plan, the Cities Mission takes a cross-sectoral and demand-led approach, creating synergies between existing initiatives and basing its activities on the actual needs of cities.

The main tool of the Cities Mission is the «Climate City Contract » (CCC), which will help to define, through a participatory process with local stakeholder and the NZC support platform, the way to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 through actions and investments. Although it is not legally binding, the contract will set a clear strategy and a strong political commitment not only at EU level but also at local level engaging the citizens.

In April 2022 the 100 climate neutral forerunner cities have been selected: among them there are nine Italian municipalities including Florence (Bergamo, Bologna, Milano, Padova, Parma, Prato, Roma, Torino).

# FLORENCE PATH AND STRATEGY

Florence’s path, aligned with EU evolving targets about climate and energy, can be summarised as follows:

→ with the resolution of the City Council n. 2010/C/00008, the municipality of Florence joined the Covenant of Mayor initiative, which involves European cities in order to implement significant mitigation activities to climate change by reducing the CO₂ emissions through energy efficiency and by increasing renewable energy sources at least 20% by 2020

→ with the resolution of the City Council n. 2011/C/00048, the municipality of Florence consequently approved the Action Plan for Sustainable Energy (SEAP), the key document in which the signatories’ cities outlines how they intend to reach their commitment by 2020

→ with the resolution of the City Council n. 57/2015, the municipality of Florence joined the Mayors Adapt and the Compact of Mayors initiatives: the resulting “Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy” is the world’s largest movement for local climate and energy actions

→ with the resolution of the City Council n. 2017/C/00016, the municipality of Florence joined the Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy which aims to increase support for local activities, provide a platform for greater engagement and networking by cities, and raise public awareness about adaptation and mitigation and the measures needed

→ the municipality of Florence joined the H2020 CoME EASY project as city ambassador, in order to harmonize different existing initiatives such as the Covenant

Figure 2 - Florence' path

The long history of Florence towards sustainability shows a path which is not merely continuous, but it has also grown up together with the relation with its citizens which made it successful: Florence has always had the ambition of playing an exemplar role for its territory, making, as forerunner, sustainable and innovative choices (about mobility, energy efficiency, social innovation and technology) and hoping to motivate the whole community and the neighbourhood. This synergic process together with the holistic and participated approach adopted in any strategic plan of the city, represented the motivation to candidate Florence experience in Europe as testbed with other fellow cities that are on the path to climate neutrality to bench-learn and grow together without reinventing the wheel. That's why Florence confirms its convinced participation to new EU targets, aware of the boundaries of a cultural heritage city.

Florence is then ethically committed to climate neutrality to save the planet, taking this issue as an opportunity to reshape its economy in a sort of New Green Renaissance.

Its targets are already in line with the Green Deal and based on the societal transformation started with the Smart City policies (prosperity, energy poverty, resilience, security and wellbeing) and extended to further topics (as adaptation, circular economy)

Integration of policies and actions has been relevant since the beginning to exploit synergies and resources. Florence strategy is based on cross-fertilization of actions and funds carrying out projects in different sectors with particular care to sustainability. The NextGenerationEU funding for example, recently boosted the green (and digital) transition: within 2023, the city has planned to invest more

than 100M€ within this “recovery plan” in a multi-fund approach (local, national and EU public and private funds).

The continuous pursuit of the city's ambitious targets (through its SECAP deployment and improvement) is also linked to the EU programming period 2021-2027 and following, which will benefit from the present city contract fruitful implementation.

By joining the EU Mission, Florence aims to accelerate, anticipate and multiply its efforts towards becoming a climate-neutral and smart city by 2030. The city intends to achieve this ambitious goal, overcoming barriers and objective obstacles, through the implementation of a wide range of policies and initiatives in every relevant sector in close cooperation with stakeholders and always targeting citizens' wellbeing putting people and its territory at the center with a holistic approach and vision in which no one (and no place) will be left behind.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Following its anthropocentric vision, Florence has adopted long ago an interdisciplinary, coproductive and integrated approach to strategic planning, convinced that only by capitalizing synergies between sectors, empowering stakeholders and engaging citizens, the city could really tackle the challenges.

Florence, as part of the 100 Mission Cities, is supporting and strengthening its strong climate commitment: the city approved the motion to update its Statute in 2021 by including climate neutrality and the rights of new generations as leading principle of its policies and by establishing a permanent climate assembly.

The systemic vision, the integrated planning as well as the social innovation have been crucial concepts since the elaboration of the Smart City Plan ("system thinking methodology" acquired during the FP7 STEEP project). This Master Plan acts as an "umbrella" and together with the SECAP are the guidelines for every planning tool.

Florence's target vision is not merely related to innovation and technology, which are perceived as amazing "tools", but to a wider scope, in line with UN sustainable Goals, always focused on sustainability and wellbeing of citizens; this have been reflected in the decision making process, which is more and more co-created, and in the "smart prioritization" concept developed in H2020 – SCC1 REPLICATE project based on the assessment of all different direct impacts and indirect externalities (air quality and health, social inclusion, poverty, ...). The possible co-benefits play a role also in the business model of the actions exploiting synergies from different funding opportunities and represent important added values for communication and engagement campaigns.

This approach is perfectly in line with the ISO (adopted also by European Innovation Partnership) definition of Smart &amp; Sustainable City: "a city that increases the pace at which it provides social, economic and environmental sustainability outcomes and responds to challenges such as climate change, rapid population growth, and political and economic instability by fundamentally improving how it engages society, applies collaborative leadership methods, works across disciplines and city systems, and uses data information and modern technologies to deliver better services and quality of life to those in the city (residents, businesses, visitors), now and for the foreseeable future, without unfair disadvantage of others or degradation of the natural environment."

The geographic boundaries considered for the Mission are the same in use for the CoM commitment: Florence intends to develop its strategy over its whole administrative area, spreading sustainability and innovation without distinction among the districts, but considering each specific context needs with the aim of scaling up best practices and models at metropolitan level.

To be consistent with the other plans, the CCC has been developed following CoM rules with some exclusions depending on municipal competences also established by national law.

With the SECAP development, both the BEI at 2005 and the MEIs have been updated to take into account the main Green House Gasses (CO₂ and also CH₄ and N₂O) through CO₂ equivalent calculations, more detailed and comprehensive; the emissions of water and waste management also outside the city's boundaries have been added, including some scope 3 calculations. Industrial processes are considered, while product use is not foreseen.

The city's policies have been regularly monitored and steered thanks to the Total Quality Management System in use, the European Energy Award, that has been adopted after the first SEAP and reached the Gold level in 2021.

Recently, through the evaluation of results at 2020 and the approval of the SECAP with the resolution n.2023/00014-00022DPC by the Council on the 8th of May 2023, Florence has paved the way towards sustainability: based on consistent data, considering all aspects impacting on its emission profile (Scope1 direct emission, 2 indirect emission and 3 emission outside boundaries for waste and water management), the city has adopted a path that empowered by the active participation of the whole city system can extended the actions already designed to maximise their impacts.

The optimisation of the emission factor for electricity together with the green energy purchase and local increased carbon sinks will further contribute to the net-zero ambition.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

Florence is committed to reach climate neutrality by 2030, exceeding the target set by the European Commission (which means the reduction of 40-55% CO₂ compared to the 2005 baseline of the city), as well as to ensure the resilience of the territory to cope with climate changes.

During the last decade, and more in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, Florence has increased its engagement in the green transition, setting the framework for urban transformation in conjunction with national and regional institutions as well as all relevant stakeholders, inviting everyone on board in this ambitious and important journey. Thank to multilevel governance the digital and green transition is accelerating combining all the fund opportunities.

Florence 2030 strategy is aligned with the main European objectives, in particular:

a smarter city through innovation and digitalisation
a greener &amp; low carbon city through investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency and circular economy to fight climate change.
a connected city through investments in mobility and digital networks as instrument to increase social inclusion, territorial cohesion, liveability, and sustainability.
a city that cares about its inhabitants, implementing measures against poverty and social exclusion. Energy transition can only be successful if all social implications are considered.

Since 2011, Florence has been deploying actions to boost and accelerate its path towards decarbonisation, collating all different available resources on sustainable projects.

The city is now managing the recovery funds, with more than 37% reserved for green actions. Moreover, thanks to the additional of the React-EU resources, the Italian government increased the NOP Metropolitan Cities 2014/2020 by over €1B and Florence has additional 80M€ of which 55% is located for the digital and green transformation, giving the city the opportunity to accelerate the path towards climate neutrality, focusing on efficiency of buildings, e-mobility, efficiency of the drinking &amp; waste water distribution networks, strengthening digital infrastructure, improving green areas and urban forestry or even study innovative technological process.

Starting from the transport sector, which had the largest impact in the baseline and required substantial and integrated action to achieve a significant reduction of emissions and noise, the city is going to complete the actions started: in case of the tramline network, for example, three new lines are planned, thus covering the extra metropolitan area in order to reduce the use of the private vehicle for commuters. The investment for the completion of the whole tram network amounts over €1 billion. The promotion of sustainable mobility considers e-mobility in all its forms, from public infrastructure improving the number of public sockets and fast recharge stations, to sharing services (e-bike, e-car, e-scooter), as well as public transport with an improved service, a renewed e-bus fleet and incentives for purchasing the travelcard for public transport. Interconnected bike lanes (Bicipolitana) are another measure which is improving more and more and extending its plans also outside city boundaries.

The challenge concerning existing buildings is quite crucial in Florence, due to its unique historical heritage. Since 2010, the urban planning focused on refurbishment and reuse of dismissed buildings to prevent soil consumption (Zero Volume Plan). The new Plan highlights the link with the SECAP and the related actions/targets. Hence Florence intends to attract virtuous real estate investors (Invest in Florence) by leading urban regeneration towards sustainability to fulfil the commitment. Thanks to REPLICATE project the city also collaborated with energy providers to deploy energy efficiency (Retrofitting of 300 social housing flats and innovative district heating with a seasonal solar thermal storage) and ICT solutions for energy management and users' awareness.

The Volume Zero Plan is helping to transform abandoned and unused structures, improving energy efficiency, creating new job opportunities, and developing innovative restoration techniques merging tradition with innovation. In the next three years, the city will boost the electrification of public buildings to play an exemplary role and in parallel it intends to facilitate the creation of renewable energy communities through available areas mapping and agreements with key stakeholders providing technical and legal support. Florence will foster the installation of PV panels also unblocking the regulations that binds most of the city areas.

If energy efficiency is the second pillar for a cultural heritage city such as Florence, the third is green and blue infrastructures both for its mitigation and adaptation potential. Water management is becoming more and more important to save resources (water and energy), provide renewable energy (mini-hydro), keep affordable tariffs and the city safe from floods. Together with the Region, the Metrocity and the water system operator Publiacqua, Florence is improving blue infrastructures and promoting sustainable behaviours through specific communication campaigns. The city has recently launched and near to adopt the first city Green Plan to maintain and improve, in close cooperation with private sector, its already impressive and various green stock (historical parks, green parks and urban forests, pocket gardens, green streets, green walls &amp; roofs), enhancing wellbeing of citizens and decreasing soil temperatures.

Innovation is our way to reach targets in a difficult urban and historical environment: after the first Italian solar seasonal storage project, the ICT supporting implementations (Smart City Control Room, IoT, smart grid advanced control, ...) other new technologies are under analysis. For example, the consumption of fossil fuel in both transport and building sectors will benefit also from the promotion of more sustainable choices as advanced biofuels, SAF for aviation, e-fuels and hydrogen. The Smart City Control Room is the flag project for the unique co-existence of innovative technologies and approaches putting together all services and data providers (water, lighting, waste, transport, green, energy ...) for an efficient management and an enhanced resilience/adaptation of the city.

The city has decided since the beginning to focus on vulnerable people, energy poverty and social inclusion prioritising intervention in low income districts and social housing (advanced Xlam wood structure and high RES integration, smart metering with home devices and dedicated APPs, measures to mitigate discomfort during works like temporary housing, helpdesk, ...), providing advanced mobility services for vulnerable people, affordable public mobility, dedicated trainings on digital competences for elderly people and info-points for one-click access. Security and emergency issues, that have been especially targeted in the last pandemic years, can benefit from the support of intelligent infrastructures (data platforms supporting territorial management and APP development, smart lighting with surveillance systems, IoT, smart grid, ...), services (Energy demand management, sharing systems, e-mobility, ...) and information/engagement channels to prevent isolation.

Information and capacity building is another pillar of the strategy, to keep the engagement active, empower stakeholders and citizens, collect new ideas and provide feedbacks and updates about the achievements.

To put the strategy into practise, Florence intends to follow the Smart City Plan approach which has closely linked and interconnected all topics together in a unique vision towards sustainability and citizens' well-being.

# 4 Principles and process

The co-creation and co-design pathway of Florence has been implementing has been pivotal for the approval of major plans and strategic programs. Direct participation to decision making started with the town meetings in 2010 and constantly grew thanks to initiative as "one hundred places" (2011 and 2012) followed by the "listening marathons" (from 2015), until the three recent campaigns "Rinasce Firenze" for the post-pandemic recovery, "Firenze prossima" for the operational plan and "Firenze respira" for the green plan.

Both the SECAP and the Smart City Plan, already adopted, have been widely participated, engaging the main territorial stakeholders with system thinking techniques, citizens and city users in a public consultation process.

The holistic and participatory vision, together with the need of a wide set of skills, were the reasons for the formal set up since 2010 of the internal Working Group, which was at first dedicated to the CoM initiative and the monitoring of energy related actions (named "eea Energy Team"), then extended to all the activities related to sustainability, innovation/smart city and climate neutrality (actual "Climate Task Force") with an intersectoral and interdepartmental nature as specific feature.

The team is highly dynamic, adapting its configuration to different upcoming challenges (Smart City, SUMP, pandemic management and local recovery plan, ...). From time to time, in accordance with the specific agendas of different sessions, other divisions and stakeholders that are not official members but that are nevertheless directly affected by the issues and competent in matters of relevance are invited to participate in the sessions.

Facing new challenging and joining further initiatives, the group has already included new members to cover and integrate all relevant aspects. The team, in other words, has become a permanent "task force", flexible and active to support the upcoming needs of the city, ready to face any challenge, inviting when needed internal/external components contributing to the achievement of the objectives. It holds regular meetings to monitor activities, tune other plans under development, benchmark and exchange with other cities and initiatives.

The Climate Task Force interacts with the other "habitat teams" composed by specific stakeholders and citizens, managing an interactive and iterative exchanges. Each member of the internal steering group is responsible for one topic: the internal responsible coordinates the sub-groups and then reports the results to the steering group, following the "sense checking" method.

The city, in accordance with the on-going activities of the Climate Task Force and thanks to the active support of the Mayor and the Deputy-mayors, intends to adopt a multi-level approach consisting in three steps aimed at reaching the wider possible participation.

Figure 6 - The Stakeholders' engagement map

At the beginning, the main public bodies (as the regional authority and metro city), the utilities managing public services (water, waste, public lighting and data, social housing, museums...) and the companies/research bodies already cooperating in working tables or innovation projects have been asked to represent the first group of stakeholders to start the present contract with.

Soon after all the stakeholders providing infrastructures (grid and transport), technology and financial support are asked to join the CCC together with the main consumers, from industrial and tertiary sector, not yet involved in the first stage. Then, Florence will widen its action field involving all stakeholders through relevant associations to co-create for each one a specific strategy and, thanks to the communication campaign under definition, citizens and city users, whose massive initiatives and behavioural changes could make the difference in terms of boosting the response to climate change.

The impacts of the extended set of measures will be continuously monitored in order to adapt the strategies, if and when needed.

Thus, the CCC will be updated yearly in an iterative process able to steer the alignment to climate neutral target including any additional or modified action and updated KPIs/inventories in line with the eea TQMS methodology in use.

The strong attraction that the Metropolitan City of Florence exerts internationally is determined not only by factors related to artistic and cultural heritage, but also from a vital economy, in which companies strongly rooted in the territory operate and where the production is characterized by quality, excellence and – with increasingly widespread – from the ethics of processes and products: all winning added values, which these companies have been able to assume as a terrain to compete on global markets.

The sector of small and medium enterprises and crafts is also active, synthesis between the continuity of the local tradition, the search for innovation and maximum specialisation.

The Florentine Fashion Pole, home to important international brands, and the textile district of Prato, constitute an important resource for the local economy.

# Strategy and policy at 2030

In terms of sustainability, the Metropolitan City has already taken the lead a series of activities to raise awareness of environmental issues and for the reduction of consumption, respect for animal life e energy efficiency.

In particular the Strategic Plan at 2030 and the Agenda 2030 about SDGs are the reference document for the transition towards sustainability. Among the competences of the Metropolitan city is the mobility planning of the area which has been developed in the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (2021) and Sustainable Urban Logistic Plan (SULP) with ambitious targets at 2030.

With the 2030 strategic plan, the Metropolitan City of Florence proposes a mid-term change to improve the quality of the life of all the inhabitants of the metropolitan territory, which can't prescind from the improvement of the environment and the climate mitigation and adaptation aspects.

The metropolitan city of Florence has committed itself to defining its 2030 metropolitan agenda for sustainable development, to be able to guide strategies towards an increasingly sustainable development, based on the characteristics and priorities of the Florentine metropolitan area and "not leaving anyone behind", thus promoting a development process that involves the whole population, including the most vulnerable bands.

The pandemic emergency and the consequent social and economic crisis have made it possible to underline once again the importance of creating dynamic territories and have also highlighted aspects and critical issues of cities underestimated so far, such as the need for proximity services and the importance of greenery in urban contexts. The main targets connected with climate issue are:

$\Rightarrow$ Contrast housing poverty and encourage the quality of living
$\Rightarrow$ Enhance and safeguard the agricultural and natural territory
$\Rightarrow$ Promote circular economy practices and optimise water management
$\Rightarrow$ Improve climate mitigation and adaptation
$\Rightarrow$ Make mobility more sustainable, integrated and accessible

**Mobility**: the area is characterised by a high number of vehicles per inhabitant. The strategy (included in the strategic plan, Agenda 2030 Objective 9, SUMP and SULP) foresees an improved synergy among transportation modes, the promotion of car sharing and pooling, the creation of hubs and integration of infrastructures (train, tram, sharing, soft mobility...) and ticketing services. The info-mobility and sentient city control room will facilitate the integration and the promotion of the services.

**Sentient City Control Room**: The Sentient City Control Room project consists in the creation of a Metropolitan Big Data aggregator, with the ability to provide Sentient City services for analysis, to collect data integrated, to provide assistance to public and private metropolitan users (both citizens and companies) and decision-making support to operators. The aim is to monitor the state of the city and its services in the various domains, share information between the various operators, optimize the services themselves by reducing their costs and improve the reaction capacity of the city with respect to critical issues, to obtain better services and provide ready answers.

The Sentient City Control Room project goes beyond pure reconnaissance and aggregation of data, as its potential allow you to implement actions capable of: integrating data from the various sources; keep under control the state of the city and its services in real time, to improve the services themselves, reduce costs, in accordance with the concepts of smart cities; Understanding the behaviour of its users and companies in order to learn typical trends, identify dysfunctions, define and stimulate adjustments; Assisting the users of the city in the use of services and stimulating them towards "virtuous" behaviours that can benefit the quality of life according to the strategic lines of the city, provide prescriptions and suggestions and decision-making support.

**Fiber network**: The Metropolitan City has started a series of pilot interventions and projects aimed at reducing the digital gap and guaranteeing a fast connection throughout the territory through the implementation of the fiber optical network, the use of wireless technologies and the distribution of free wifi networks on a metropolitan scale.

**Buildings**: In the territory of the Metropolitan City of Florence, the surplus of the existing building stock, generated by sustained urbanization processes and fuelled by the economic crisis, represents a malleable material on which to trigger small and large-scale urban regeneration processes.

In particular, the brownfields, abandoned areas that housed industrial complexes and present problems of soil pollution, become strategic for any urban regeneration process. The Metro city of Florence, in order to outline and quantify the phenomenon of abandonment in the area subway, draws up a mapping project for brownfields and abandoned areas in general and underused. Mapping is a constantly updated cognitive and analytical tool which allows, on the one hand, to present a composite picture of the phenomenon, on the other to offer detailed information for individual areas so that these can be evaluated with respect to the strategic vision aimed at urban and territorial regeneration.

Buildings retrofitting will be promoted, starting from public buildings stocks and social housing, as well as renewable energy production (Agenda 2030, objective 3 and 6)

**Industrial sector**: The Metropolitan City of Florence promotes investments that have a positive impact in terms of social and environmental sustainability.

The World Bank has experimented with the tool of "Green Bonds" to encourage investors to focus on sustainable projects and technologies. In fact, green bonds are bonds intended for projects that respect the environment. In line with these international initiatives, the Metropolitan City promotes initiatives for the issue
FRANCE

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

C

of "Green bonds" to encourage the use of renewable energy in the industrial sector. Precisely in this sector, in fact, high energy consumption limits the use of renewable sources and require large initial investments. Through investments derived from "green bonds" it is possible to finance the conversion and construction of industrial plants that they use renewable energies, pursuing the goal of Industry with low or zero emissions.

The strategic objective is to operate to reduce polluting emissions by promoting this way a more innovative and safer metropolitan area. The integration of marketing actions territorial and reduction of local pollution can lead to the development of a specific territorial brand (e.g. green lily).

**Governance**: Finally, the metropolitan city guides the creation of a network of relationships both in a "horizontal" sense, or between the municipalities, in the perspective to make the different territories more interdependent and encourage the homogeneous development of all areas, both in the sense "Vertical", especially towards the neighbouring provinces and of the Region, creating channels of cooperating dialogue on an administrative level otherwise absent. The Metropolitan City of Florence established the "Easy Metrocity" table, a metropolitan Authority on the simplicity and efficiency of the administration that operates as a control room for the integrated management of the functions of the metropolitan municipalities.

**Urban green and food**: as set in the objective 4 of the Agenda 2030, the metro city will promote sustainable forestry and green management and the local supply chains for food and agricultural productions. 48 Markets of farmers and sales points of agricultural cooperatives were activated, also called "short supply chain" or zero km, distributed over 22 municipalities in the metropolitan area, and over 90 solidarity purchasing groups.

**Waste and water management** (Agenda 2030 objective 5): the aim is to promote circular economy, with an integration of policies, replication of best practices and research &amp; development activities. In parallel, high percentages of differentiated waste collection and decreased amount of urban waste per capita are pursued. Measures to decrease water losses in the pipes network will be implemented and sustainable use of drinking water promoted, also through free public distribution points (so called "fontanelli"). The waste water treatment system will target higher and higher performances and food waste discouraged.

**Education, communication and research**: Promoting a "civic sense" about sustainable development is the first tool identified in the Agenda 2030, which means educate, increase responsibility and care about public and common assets. Research and innovation activities are the second tool prioritised to identify and test innovative technologies and social approaches to overcome actual barriers.

The national recovery and resilience plan has assigned to the metropolitan city of Florence resources for soft mobility (National Cycle Plan), integrated urban regeneration plans focussed on sport and culture more than 150M€.

# SILFI Spa – FIRENZE SMART

## Short description of the stakeholder

SILFI Spa is an "in house" company with entirely public capital which provides for the provision of plant engineering, IT and information services and is owned by almost all of the Municipalities that are part of the Metropolitan City of Florence.

SILFI Spa was born on 24 December 1984 as a mixed public/private company between the Municipality of Florence (30%) and the Piero Branzanti company of Ravenna (70%) and since 1 June 1986 it has been in charge of managing public lighting in the city, a task which - over the years - has also been joined by that of managing traffic lights, the Urban Traffic Controller, variable message panels, charging stations for electric vehicles, traffic lights at ZTL gates, the fiber network optics and video surveillance cameras.

From March 2016 SILFI Spa becomes an "in house" company wholly owned by the Municipality of Florence.

From May 2019 SILFI Spa incorporates, following a merger operation, LINEA COMUNE Spa, the "in house" company that deals with IT services, 055055 and Firenze Card, expanding its company to 9 new public shareholders in addition to the Municipality of Florence.

From September 2021 SILFI Spa acquires the entire activity carried out by FLORENCE MULTIMEDIA Srl, the "in house" company of the Metropolitan City of Florence that deals with infomobility, communication and institutional information.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

"Firenze Smart" is the logo under which SILFI Spa provides services to citizens.

## Strategy and policy at 2030

The integrated management of innovative public services today entrusted to SILFI Spa will allow - thanks to the savings given by centralized management and economies of scale - to make greater investments in technological innovation and communication to and from citizens as well as to participate as a protagonist in the process for smart urban management at municipal and metropolitan level.

Best practices will be promoted in the metropolitan area for replication.

**Public lighting**: city lighting is increasingly an element of safety, improves the use of urban spaces at night, allows you to combine work and leisure.

Firenze Smart deals with the management of the public lighting service in the city of Florence, guaranteeing a continuous evolution of the lighting systems to maintain a high standard of quality and performance.

In the framework of PON METRO program, SILFI managed the “Firenze cambia luce” project to update most of the infrastructure in the city, making it more efficient and allowing advanced services (pilot action in Replicate project with WIFI, sensors and videocameras). The management system is in charge of the society who is leading the energy efficiency system in public lighting.

Specific intervention features refer to street lighting systems, characterized by careful assessments ranging from respect for the characteristics of the building, to road needs, to environmental constraints, up to the specific needs of the individual citizen affected by the installation.

In this context, the objectives we want to pursue are ambitious and go beyond the simple replacement of existing systems, placing furnishing needs at the center of the lighting solutions without neglecting efficiency and management effectiveness. The solutions adopted in recent years have been the result of a research process and technical evaluation of a constantly evolving technology, with great potential for the future of the public lighting service and for integration with other value-added services.

SILFI also deals with monumental lighting, intending to enhance the artistic heritage with high standards of sustainability, and with lighting during events, which will be increasingly green.

**Mobility services**: urban mobility, with the growth of city traffic, could no longer be conceived without the technological and functional aid that traffic light regulation systems and other management and information installations offer.

Firenze Smart takes care of the maintenance of the entire traffic light network, the variable messaging systems and the charging stations for electric vehicles in the Municipality of Florence every day.

The aim is to make the traffic more fluent, thanks also to the information services, the traffic lighting system more and more efficient and the electric public charging infrastructure capillary in all districts and always updated (SILFI is actually managing more than 200 charging stations).
The info mobility and videosourveillance control system to the LTZ will play an important role in the sustainable mobility policy of Florence in the next years, considering the "green shield" eco-roadprincing action just started by the municipality.

**Optic fiber and video-surveillance**: the coverage of the network will be more and more improved and guaranteed.

**Smart City Control Room and Territorial information system**: SILFI is supporting the municipality of Florence in the upgrade of its Smart City Control Room, an advanced urban management tool where several stakeholders are exchanging real time information and plans following the "Digital Manifesto" agreement.

The Territorial Information System (GIS) is a tool for organizing spatial data, which allows you to associate various types of data (e.g. socio-economic, statistical, cadastral, environmental) to the geographical reference bases (e.g. maps, aerial photos, satellite images) different kind of data (socio-economic, statistics, environmental, built urban stock...). The service has wide extension potential to various applications connected with sustainable development and urban planning.

X Mobility &amp; transport

description

The University of Florence promotes sustainable mobility to make the city more liveable and reduce the negative impacts of urban mobility on the environment and climate.

Although this is an area in which the University can only act indirectly, the organization of urban transport has a strong impact on university activities; nevertheless, the organization of university activities significantly affects the demand for mobility in the Florence area, given the high number of people overall involved in the various fields - education, research and "third mission"- and related services and the spread of its locations in the city and metropolitan area.

Based on 2022 figures, in addition to the personnel already described in the premises, the university community includes 54,364 enrolled students, as well as adjunct and visiting professors, and the external staff of its 54 university spin-offs, and service workers (janitorial, cleaning, etc.). Altogether, this is more than 60,000 people, a number that is equivalent to about 16 percent of the resident population of the City of Florence.

The University can affect the mobility demand of staff and students (e.g., internal travel between its campus) and guide their modal choices by means of mobility management measures.

Moreover, it interacts as a stakeholder with institutions and providers to ensure that urban, metropolitan, and regional transportation meets the needs of the university community.

Finally, with its research units, the University of Florence is also involved in projects and initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable mobility (models, plans and programs, innovative technologies and services, etc.), in partnership with public authorities and other scientific institutions4.

The role of Mobility manager is carried out by the Rector's Delegate for Sustainable Mobility Initiatives, who reports to the Pro-Rector for Technology Transfer, Cultural Activities and Social Impact, and acts in collaboration with the General Management and the Green Office.

timing:

X On going: 2023/2026

impact

Significant direct impacts in terms of reduced CO2 emissions can be achieved, in particular, by measures related to smart working, the split towards alternative modes to individual motor vehicles (incl. public transport, carpooling, sharing mobility, and active mobility), and the spread of electric motors. An assessment of these impacts will be made during the implementation and monitoring of the planned measures, taking into account the climate neutrality goals pursued by the Net-Zero Cities program.

Indirect contributions may be achieved through the awareness actions also carried out in the field of sustainable mobility by the Green Office of the University of Florence.

The Group's risk of generating negative climate impacts is mainly related to its ability to take effective measures to reduce emissions, which in part also depend on the energy purchased by the company to run its operations. A reputation risk related to the difficulty in attracting and retaining customers, employees, business partners and investors could be added to this should Sesa fail to achieve its climate protection targets.

The measures taken to prevent and mitigate environmental risks are the ISO14001 - certified environmental management system and all initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to the Group's activities (mainly offices and business travel), which may lead to increased capital expenditure in the short term before financial benefits are realised in the long term, and the use of renewable energy.

To this end, a new business line was developed with over Euro 300 million in revenues in the financial year and about 150 specialised resources, with the aim of developing new technologies, products, and services for the production of energy from renewable sources and the efficient consumption of natural resources. Investments also continued in the Group's main owned buildings: in particular, during FY 2023, internal production of energy from renewable sources increased significantly (1.3 million Kwh +25% Y/Y), and the main indicators relating to emissions and consumption improved.

Sesa's ESG Team, with the direct cooperation of the Sustainability Committee, collects and analyses environmental data, periodically monitors indicators and helps create awareness and educate employees on these issues through internal communication events and initiatives.

The Group continues with determination on the path of integrating ESG criteria into its business, implementing an environmental sustainability strategy focused on achieving carbon neutrality, in line with the UN 2030 Agenda. There are several areas of intervention that will lead the Group to neutralise its carbon footprint by

, through a plan that envisages three lines of action: monitoring and quantification of emissions; continuous processes of efficiency and impact reduction; and offsetting residual and non-reducible emissions.

To this end, an articulated and far-reaching project is related to the implementation of environmental impact reduction programmes for the Empoli technology pole. The project, in addition to allowing the expansion of the activities present in support of the business, will allow the area to be reorganised in terms of road functionality, public parking, public green spaces, and services for employees and citizens. The project will also reduce pollutant emissions caused by traffic, through sustainable mobility measures: free public parking spaces in connection with a bike-sharing station, public transport connections and the creation of cycle paths.

The project is divided into three distinct stages of progress and involves the construction of infrastructures and buildings using eco-sustainable and energy-saving materials, techniques and technologies (green building and related certifications). The aim of the project is to enhance the Technological Pole, through the regeneration of community relations, the protection of the wellbeing and health of citizens, the improvement of the quality of the environment and mobility, and the enhancement of social and cultural activities.

The purpose of this document is to collaborate with the city of Florence on a collective and shared project to reduce CO₂eq emissions, to contribute to the improvement of the city's liveable conditions with the final aim of achieving climate neutrality.

## Short description of the stakeholder

The tools managed by the company Alia Servizi Ambientali, the integrated waste cycle management concessionaire for the vast area of central Tuscany (ATO Toscana Centro), where Florence is the main attractor of traffic flows and waste production, are clearly those pertaining to the environmental services area, with reference to the collection, transport, treatment, recovery, and final disposal of waste. In this context, the company, which sees the Municipality of Florence as the majority shareholder, shares the shared objectives of climate improvement with the city government, through a progressive optimization of production and service processes that can substantially affect the reduction of emissions of CO₂eq.

## Strategy and policy at 2030

The ambitions underlying the industrial strategies for the optimization of productions, services and the reduction of emissions for climate mitigation are approved by the Company's Board of Directors and by the shareholders' meeting.

The objective of reducing CO₂eq by 23,500¹ tonnes by 2024 through the implementation of the Florence Circular City project, may be implemented by a further 3,500 tonnes, as an estimate of the benefits obtained from the implementation of the following collateral projects:

Volumetric sensors: Technological implementation of the electronics installed on underground and above-ground waste road containers, with volumetric sensors for measuring the waste introduced into the container by each user. The punctual and progressive measurement of the degree of filling of the containers will make it possible to plan and execute optimized collection routes and the emptying of fully loaded road containers, with a significant reduction in the km travelled by collection vehicles, consumption and CO2 emissions, estimated at at least 10% compared to current emissions (2,350-t of CO₂eq).

Enhancement of the virtuous behaviour of users: the tracing of waste deliveries by users and the analysis of the virtuous behaviour of the latter, in terms of effective

contribution to good separate collection and the increase in recycling, can be exploited through two alternative or complementary systems:

the certification and remuneration of carbon credits, WCC (Waste Carbon Credits), on the voluntary market (VCM), with the redistribution of revenues as a reduction in the waste tariff in relation to the virtuous behaviour of users.
Application of the Blockchain to waste recycling with models and initiatives that, through the tracking of the recycled, reward the participants, thus giving a tangible value to the recovered materials and recycling activities.

With these activities it is estimated to be able to further increase the qualitative yields of waste recycling, both in the separate collection chain and in the recovery plants, with a reduction of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  in 2030, which can be estimated at a further  $5\%$  compared to the objectives set for 2024 (11.750 t of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{eq}}$ ).

The goal set for 2030 covers the entire administrative territory of the city of Florence.

The  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  reduction target set for 2030 inherent to the specific activities carried out by the manager of the integrated waste cycle, Alia Servizi Ambientali, is part of a coherent contribution and in line with the definition of climate neutrality pursued by the Mission of the city of Florence.

description:

Among the strategic and systemic priorities to be implemented by 2030, the company Alia Servizi Ambientali undertakes to carry out the following projects:

Completion of the Florence Circular City project by 2024: «Firenze Città Circolare» is the Waste Plan approved in 2020 aimed at improving the quality and quantity of differentiated waste through innovations in the collection system and stimulating greater awareness and responsibility of people. In this way, the City aims at achieving the targets set by the EU in the Circular Economy Package (Directive 2018/851). Based on urban characteristics, population density and attendance (tourists, city users, etc.), the territory of the city of Florence has thus been divided into zones, each of which has been associated with the most appropriate type of collection. The main objectives of the project are the spread of the 5R (Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Rot, Recycle) through the value chain, offering advanced services, the reduction of management costs while saving energy.

The project includes the industrial strategy of Alia in relation to the availability and strengthening of the plants for the most important recycling chains: Paper; Glass;

# Publiacqua

## Short description of the stakeholder

The integrated water cycle management (aqueduct and sewage) is entrusted to Publiacqua Spa with a public capital holding (60% of which 21.67%, owned by the City of Florence. The aqueduct system of Florence presents a remarkable complexity, deriving from the presence of a quite large historical core, which makes it difficult to adapt structures to the technological innovations and to the growth in demand due to the strong tourist presence. As for many Italian cities, the origin of the aqueduct system dates back to Roman times when, in the case of Florence, water descended from Monte Morello through the gentle slopes of the hills. Over the centuries, the growing demand for water resources has prompted the construction of other underground supply sources (wells) as well as other sources; it was also necessary to access the area’s most important water resource, the river Arno.

All the drinkable water consumers (domestic, public and non-domestic) are provided with a meter for the measurement of water consumption. These currently operate on a mechanical system, with some interesting trials of smart metering (automatic and in proximity).

For several years Publiacqua has prepared a yearly Energy Efficiency Plan, identifying the programme of interventions aimed at recovering the efficiency of the systems (for both the installations and management standpoints). In a four-year period (from 2018 to 2021), the energetic consumptions went from 116,0 GWh to 106,3 GWh, with a reduction of over 8,5%.

## Strategy and policy at 2030

The collaboration with Publiacqua, whose *sustainability report* is drawn up annually, is working on the issues of water saving, use of RES and the efficiency of distribution net and wastewater treatment plants. The partnership generated the best practice related to the drinking water fountains to reduce the use of plastic and transport of drinking water (455,000 l/y).

The *Water Management Plans* analyse the specific service and set ambitious performance KPIs for the next years.

The management vision aims at overcoming the segmented territorial logic to establish

an interconnected aqueduct network of the 2 areas Florence-Chianti and Prato-Pistoia.

Publiacqua Spa has planned significant replacement investments to renew the pipes infrastructures aimed at achieving two main environmental objectives related to water losses reduction (related to the *Energy Efficiency Plan*) and to water quality improvement. In 2019, the *Water Safety Plan* was drawn up and detailed analyses were carried out to introduce energy efficiency into the distribution systems and measures were activated to influence the company's consumption trends (-4,5% per year).

The water loss management is based on:
pressure management;
active leakage control;
speed and quality of repairs;
maintenance plan.

A series of strategic objectives have been defined, the main ones are listed below:
improvement of technical quality in service management in order to align to the requirements of the future Eu-directive;
Improved commercial quality through increased response performance to the user;
security for its employees and for the company's information and real estate assets;
environmental sustainability;
increased efficiency and productivity;
added value through innovative services and processes.

One of the main means of achieving these objectives is represented by the continuous technological and organizational evolution thanks to the introduction of ICT services and solutions to support the Line of Business.

Energy systems
e-distribuzione' Smart Grids projects and resilience projects in Florence allows the implementation of measures and functionalities, on existing electricity distribution networks, to upgrade the digitalization of the grid, and to increase the grid resiliency to cope with extreme weather events.

Moreover, this will also give the possibility to increase network efficiency, fostering the development of new Renewable Energy Sources plants (RES), allowing the electrification of final users and increasing the resilience of the grid.

In particular, e-distribuzione, within the city area of Florence, planned a series of investments in "Progetto Rafforzamento Smart Grid Toscana e Umbria" and "Progetto Incremento Resilienza Toscana e Umbria" for approximately 15 M€.

The projects feasibility, the effectiveness of interventions and the amount of the investments depend on the right timing of the permitting process for all authorizations, permits, clearances, necessary and/or other approvals and authorizations required. Any time delay in authorization and permission would affect the project scheduling. In the worst case it could determine the project failure. Meeting the timing of the permitting process will foster the Project success.
