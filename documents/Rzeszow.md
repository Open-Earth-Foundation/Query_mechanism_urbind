# Summary

## Vision for the City in 2030

The development of Rzeszów will proceed in accordance with the vision outlined in the "Development Strategy of the City of Rzeszów until 2025": Rzeszów – the growth hub of the Podkarpac region – is a city that is friendly to people, offering and expanding numerous metropolitan functions. It is a place where it's worth living, with a high quality of life and environment, as well as comprehensive economic, social, and cultural development.

The sectoral strategic goals for the development of the City of Rzeszów, which are based on the Vision and Mission for the Development of the City, include:

Smart City – creating favorable conditions for the development of Rzeszów as an attractive location for business activities, as well as for the advancement of education, higher education, science, and culture.

The development of economic activity will lead to the creation of new jobs, which in turn will increase employment levels and contribute to income growth. This, in turn, will improve the standard of living by providing better access to services, housing, and other goods. Investments in higher education, science, and education contribute to raise the overall level of knowledge and skills among residents. The development of the cultural sector enriches the social life of residents. An increased number of cultural events, festivals, art galleries, and theaters will offer more opportunities for recreation and personal development. Culture fosters community cohesion, strengthens local identity, and encourages active engagement in public life. Access to green spaces, bicycle paths, sports events, and cultural centers fosters an active and healthy lifestyle, which in turn contributes to improved health and well-being.

A socially cohesive and integrated city – improving both the living conditions of residents and public safety.

A socially cohesive and integrated city fosters an environment where residents can experience an improved quality of life through strong social bonds, a sense of security, equal opportunities, and active participation in community life. In integrated communities, individuals are more inclined to offer help and support to one another. Social cohesion promotes balanced development across different neighborhoods in the city, helping to prevent the marginalization of specific social groups. Social cohesion contributes to increased trust in public institutions such as local administration, healthcare, and education. Residents who feel heard and represented are more likely to cooperate with city authorities, leading to improved public services and more efficient city management.

Urban mobility and infrastructure – development and improvement of the functioning of the transportation and technical infrastructure system.

Systematic and well-planned development of technical infrastructure, including transportation, is essential for the city's growth and the quality of life for its residents.

Utilization of resources – protecting clean energy and rich heritage, while managing the values and resources of the natural and cultural environment.

The above has a multifaceted, positive impact on the quality of life for residents. It contributes to improving health, increase the city's attractiveness, preserving cultural identity, and promoting long-term sustainable development.

Achieving climate neutrality is one of the key and most ambitious goals, the realization of which will contribute to the city's development in line with the established vision.

City Goals: An Smart City and Socially Cohesive and Integrated Cities are fully coherent with the goals of the Mission, particularly in addressing social challenges and actively involving residents in this effort. Actions developed in collaboration with residents carry a strong social mandate, which can ensure their effective implementation.

# Urban environment of Rzeszów in the context of global warming

Climate scenarios for Poland indicate that the frequency of heatwaves currently experienced in Rzeszów is expected to increase in the coming decades. Forecasts indicate a tendency for their for duration to increase, leading to the emergence of drought. Just as severe in Rzeszów are the short but very intense rainfalls that cause flooding, which may lead to more significant floods in the future.

The climate changes occurring before our eyes are impacting urban ecosystems, placing plants under increased stress, particularly due to their urban environment, which makes them more vulnerable to pests and diseases. Furthermore, warmer winters extend the growing season of plants, altering their growth cycles and thereby reducing their resistance. Climate warming is associated with an increase in insect populations and the number of fungi that can survive the winter, leading to a higher number of infection foci in the following season. The impact of climate change on the species composition and condition of urban forests is significant and will become increasingly evident. Climate change causes the displacement of native species and the migration of non-native species, including invasive ones. This leads to the decline of species that are not adapted to high temperatures and summer droughts but are resistant to winter frosts. Further actions are necessary to ensure sustainable forest management, as climate change alters species distribution, impact soil fertility and threatens biodiversity.

Analyses clearly indicate a growing issue with the impact of climate change on urban areas. Due to factors such as high population density and its enclosed, built-up nature, Rzeszów is particularly vulnerable to the increasing intensity of the urban heat island effect, heavy rainfall causing flooding, and potential future water shortages. Observed threats particularly impact the most vulnerable social groups, including the elderly, individuals with health conditions, children, pregnant women, and those affected by poverty.

The rising temperature impacts the economy through several factors, including physical performance, cognitive functioning of employees, energy demand, the quality and quantity of agricultural produce, and increased healthcare burdens due to worsened well-being, strokes, heat exhaustion, and other health issues caused by high air temperatures. Extreme phenomena impact urban infrastructure, including transportation, water and wastewater systems, and energy networks, leading to economic losses, disruptions in service delivery, and threats to well-being.

# United effort of the international community – conventions and agreements

To mitigate the consequences of climate change, a united effort from many countries is necessary, as they recognize the urgent need for action. The international community, recognizing the seriousness of the situation, has made a series of commitments based on the "United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change" and the "Paris Agreement". Both preventing climate change and adapting to a warming world are key priorities for the European Union. In 2021, the 'European Climate Law' was adopted, which enshrines the EU's commitment to achieving climate neutrality by 2050. The law aims to limit global temperature rise to well below  $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and to continue efforts to restrict it to  $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .

# Key role of cities

Achieving those goals requires far-reaching transformations in the functioning of all countries. A key role in those processes is played by cities, which are, on the one hand, significant emitters of greenhouse gases, and on the other hand, the primary recipients of the negative effects of climate change. The urgent necessity thus becomes the need for coordinated actions that, complementing and intersecting with each other, will guarantee a horizontal approach towards achieving neutrality and resilience in urban areas. For this reason, the activities undertaken should be implemented across various areas, including air quality, energy transformation, zero-emission transportation, waste and wastewater management, as well as green spaces and urban water retention.

# Rzeszów takes on the challenge

Recognizing the need for urgent and immediate action towards achieving climate neutrality, the city of Rzeszów has joined the "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities" Mission and expressed its ambition to attain climate neutrality through a just, effective, and socially acceptable transformation.

At the same time, it acknowledges the necessity of accelerating efforts to achieve climate neutrality and making it a priority in the city's policy in the City Municipality of Rzeszów.
Achieving climate neutrality will require a range of diverse actions that must be harmoniously combined and complementary to each other in order to maximize synergy in addressing the challenges posed by climate change. A joint effort and the engagement of stakeholders at various levels are crucial for achieving lasting and positive changes in both preventing the causes and adapting to the impacts of climate change. Effective management of air quality, energy transformation, transportation, as well as urban greenery and water retention, is a crucial element in creating a more sustainable and environmentally friendly city. However, it is important for the local community to also make responsible, eco-friendly choices. Responsible actions by residents, entrepreneurs, and local authorities are necessary to achieve positive outcomes for the environment and future generations. Regardless of the need for systemic changes, each of us can contribute to improving the quality of life in cities through informed decisions and changes in habits.

### Position of Rzeszów locally and regionally

Rzeszów is the largest city in southeastern Poland and the capital of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship, which marks the eastern border of the European Union. It also serves as the central hub of the Rzeszów Metropolitan Area. Rzeszów is the seat of local and regional authorities, as well as government and judicial institutions. Rzeszów is a center for economic, academic, cultural, and recreational activities in southeastern Poland.

As the capital of the region, Rzeszów plays a key role in administration, higher education, education, science, culture, sports, recreation, economic activities, and healthcare. It brings together various institutions that provide high-level services. It also serves as an important center for aviation, IT, chemical, trade, construction, and services industries.

### Rzeszów is the headquarters of numerous strategic centers

The city is the seat of the local government of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship and the Podkarpackie Voivode, along with a range of subordinate institutions and other administrative units.

Joint festivals and other cultural events, study visits, and business events and forums are organized, among other things.

## Rzeszów as a leader in efforts towards climate neutrality

Rzeszów is an active city with the potential to influence other decision-makers in the region, country, and worldwide. Rzeszów, as the capital of the voivodeship, can become a model for other cities in the region. Through active participation in national and international associations and unions, successes in the field of climate transformation it can inspire neighboring municipalities to implement similar actions. Regional cooperation in climate initiatives can lead to greater collaboration between municipalities and districts, resulting in more effective and integrated environmental protection solutions. Successes and challenges of Rzeszów in climate transformation can influence regional policies, encouraging decision-makers at the voivodeship level to support sustainable development and ecological initiatives in other parts of the voivodeship, as well as introducing financial incentives for municipalities and districts that undertake pro-ecological actions, following the example of Rzeszów. It should be noted that in order to fully utilize the potential of Rzeszów's climate transformation, effective continuation of regional-level actions will be necessary. In summary, the climate transformation of Rzeszów can have far-reaching positive effects both for the city itself and for the entire Podkarpacie region. However, to fully leverage those opportunities, close cooperation between different levels of government, as well as adequate financial and educational support, will be essential.

## Vision for the development of Rzeszów

The main governing document outlining the vision for the development of the city of Rzeszów is the "Development Strategy of the City of Rzeszów until 2025," which outlines the vision for Rzeszów's development strategy. Rzeszów – the growth hub of the Podkarpacie region – is a city that is friendly to people, offering and expanding numerous metropolitan functions. It is a place where it's worth living, with a high quality of life and environment, as well as comprehensive economic, social, and cultural development.

The sectoral strategic goals for the development of the City of Rzeszów, which are based on the Vision and Mission for the Development of the City, include:

Smart City – creating favorable conditions for the development of Rzeszów as an attractive location for business activities, as well as for the advancement of education, higher education, science, and culture.
A socially cohesive and integrated city – improving both the living conditions of residents and public safety.
Urban mobility and infrastructure – development and improvement of the functioning of the transportation and technical infrastructure system.
Utilization of resources – protecting clean energy and rich heritage, while managing the values and resources of the natural and cultural environment.

## Rzeszów in the "100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities" Mission

One of the opportunities for Rzeszów to develop into a modern, sustainable, and resident-friendly city, while securing support and cooperation at the European level, is its participation in the "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities" Mission.

The city's participation in such an ambitious Mission is seen as an opportunity to gain the following benefits:

sustainable development — by achieving an ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across all areas of the city's activities,
financing and support — through access to expert/technical and advisory support from the European Union level, as well as dedicated financing, which can accelerate the implementation of pro-ecological and innovative projects,

international cooperation: enabling the establishment of contacts and collaboration with other European cities, fostering the exchange of experiences, knowledge, and best practices in city management.

## Reorganization of urban structure

The city of Rzeszów is at the beginning of its journey towards achieving climate neutrality, as evidenced in the survey for cities - "Mission of Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities, Invitation to Express Interest". Recognizing the urgent need to prioritize actions aimed at climate protection and make it one of the key issues in the City's development policy, the Mayor of the City of Rzeszów decided to reorganize the structure of the Rzeszów City Office as follows:

by the Order of November 3, 2022, the Department of Environmental Protection and Agriculture of the Rzeszów City Office was replaced by the Department of Climate and Environment of the Rzeszów City Office, which includes: the Division of Climate and Environment, the Division of Nature Conservation and Water Management, and the Division of Energy. In the newly established Department, climate protection and energy transformation issues are of paramount importance.
establishment of the Climate Neutrality and Smart City Team. Currently, the Team comprises representatives from various Departments of the City Office and is supported by representatives from Municipal Companies. In the future, it will be progressively improved with external expertise (universities, businesses, NGOs) The team developed all elements of the City Climate Contract in collaboration with business representatives and universities (meetings within the framework of the Economic Council's activities under the Mayor, to establish development directions and financing opportunities), as well as with city residents (recommendations from the citizens' panel implemented as tasks in the Action Plan—expected by the residents and enjoying their strong support).
the newly established instrument is the Economic Council under the City Mayor's Office. This is an advisory body that can significantly support the development of the local economy. Table C-1.2 contains a detailed description of the role, functions, potential benefits, and opportunities provided by collaboration with the Economic Council. By providing valuable analysis, recommendations, and supporting investment and innovation initiatives, the Council can contribute to the dynamic and sustainable economic development of Rzeszów, improve the quality of life for its residents, and increase the city's attractiveness on both national and international levels.
The position of Coordinator for Social Participation has also been created at the City Office of Rzeszów, whose aim is to engage the local community in decision-making processes and the actions of the authorities, organize social consultations, public debates, and other forms of dialogue with residents, and conduct information campaigns to increase residents' awareness of participation opportunities.

The position of the Coordinator for Social Participation is crucial for building dialogue and cooperation between the authorities and residents, which leads to more effective and democratic management of local affairs.

## Actors in the change process

The success of implementing the actions outlined in the Action Plan, as well as any other activities necessary to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, requires an integrated approach and is closely dependent on the stakeholders of this process. Stakeholder engagement requires close collaboration, communication, and coordination at various levels.

The main groups that need to be included in the process are:

government and regulatory bodies (central and regional government levels, local government),
rzeszów
capital of innovation
Climate Neutrality Action
Plan
O

private sector (energy and heating companies, industry and manufacturing sector, small and medium-sized enterprises)
civil society and local government organizations (local communities, NGOs)
scientific and research sector (research institutes and universities, experts)
financial sector (banks and financial institutions, investment funds)
residents.

The detailed matrix of process actors is indicated in table A-3.2. Systems &amp; stakeholder mapping. The key point is that it is not a closed list. As work towards achieving climate neutrality progresses, the matrix will be supplemented with additional stakeholders, often associated with specific types of actions or activities. The process of iteration will also serve this purpose. The Action Plan, as a "living" document, will continuously respond to changes that impact the types of actions taken and the stakeholders involved. Each iteration of the Action Plan will be built based on experiences and results, allowing for gradual but effective achievement of climate neutrality.

# Vulnerable groups in the transformation process

Climate transformation of a city is a process that requires the involvement of all residents, including vulnerable groups that may be particularly exposed to the effects of climate change. The participation of those groups is crucial for ensuring social justice and the effectiveness of climate actions. In Rzeszów, during the process of mapping key stakeholders, several social groups were identified as most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including older people, people with disabilities, low-income families, children and youth, and homeless people. It is important to involve them in the transformation process. The voices of vulnerable groups are heard and taken into account in the processes of planning and making decisions regarding climate change transformation. It is necessary to organize consultation meetings, workshops, and forums that are accessible and tailored to the needs of those groups, as well as to conduct educational campaigns that raise awareness among vulnerable groups about climate change and its effects. Providing information consistently in an accessible, understandable, and tailored manner to different target groups, for example through materials in various languages or formats adapted for people with disabilities. It is important to consider creating support programs for vulnerable groups, which may include grants for improving the energy efficiency of homes, access to renewable energy sources, or support in crisis situations. During hot days, it is important to facilitate access to resources such as cool shelters during heatwaves or adapted means of transportation. Regular monitoring of the impact of climate actions on vulnerable groups and assessing their effectiveness. A just transition requires the implementation of joint projects and initiatives that integrate the perspectives and needs of different groups.

Including vulnerable groups in the city's climate transition is not only just but also increases the effectiveness of actions by incorporating diverse perspectives and needs. This way, climate actions can be more comprehensive, sustainable, and accepted by the entire community.

# 2. Part A – Current State of Climate Action

## 2.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

### GHG Emissions Baseline inventory

The city of Rzeszów is at the beginning of its journey towards achieving climate neutrality. The first, but not very accurate (yet clearly indicating the main sources of CO2 emissions) baseline CO2 inventory was carried out for the purposes of the "Low-Emission Economy Plan for the Rzeszów Functional Area", adopted by the City Council of Rzeszów in 2015, and then updated for the purposes of the "Low-Emission Economy Plan for the City of Rzeszów" (adopted by the City Council of Rzeszów in 2017). The inventory was conducted with a division into the following sectors: public administration, housing (including single-family and multi-family buildings as well as municipal buildings), industry, trade and services, transportation (individual transportation and municipal transportation), street lighting. The base year adopted is 2010.

In the city of Rzeszów, the carbon dioxide emissions in the aforementioned base year amounted to 1,454,822.47 tCO2e. On average, each resident of Rzeszów accounted for approximately 8.12 tCO2e per year (compared to the national average in 2010, which was around tCO2e per year). The residential sector had the largest share in carbon dioxide emissions in the city - 34.31% of the total balance, followed by the transportation sector - 28.38% of the total carbon dioxide emissions balance. The industrial sector accounted for 16.03%, the trade and services sector - 15.87%, the public administration sector - 4.86%, while the street lighting sector - 0.55%. Analyzing those results, the highest share in total emissions was held by Stationary Energy—about 72%—and Transport—about 28%.

In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution in the city of Rzeszów, the "Low-Emission Economy Plan for the City of Rzeszów" proposed the implementation of 21 corrective actions, divided into projects and tasks, which were expected to contribute to a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 83,045.58 tons, a decrease in final energy consumption by 274,787.66 MWh, and an increase in the share of energy from renewable sources by 178,403.41 MWh by the year 2020. Some of the actions planned for implementation were also scheduled beyond 2020, with a perspective extending to 2024. Based on the results obtained at that time, strategic goals for the city of Rzeszów were formulated for the year 2020:

reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in the city of Rzeszów by 5.69% compared to the base year of 2010.
reduction of final energy consumption in the city of Rzeszów by 6.55% compared to the base year of 2010,
increase in the share of renewable energy sources in the city of Rzeszów by 4.56% compared to the base year of 2010,
reduction of PM10 emissions in the city of Rzeszów by 6.52% compared to the base year of 2010,
reduction of PM2.5 emissions in the city of Rzeszów by 2.81% compared to the base year of 2010,
reduction of benzo(a)pyrene emissions in the city of Rzeszów by 2.93% compared to the base year of 2010,

The goals for 2020 have been achieved.

Today, it is very clear that the goals set at that time were completely inadequate for the needs, and all actions, both investment and non-investment ones, require significant acceleration and intensification.

There is also a recognized need for accurate inventory, which will be the starting point for planning actions to achieve climate neutrality, hence the GHG inventory for 2022 was conducted, covering the entire administrative area of the City Municipality of Rzeszów. The inventory was conducted in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the "Global Protocol for Community Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories" and taking into account the guidelines contained in the document "Info Kit for Cities interested in participating in the call for expression of interest". The inventory was conducted according to the basic level of reporting (BASIC), with the inventory also expanded to include additional scopes that are part of extended reporting (BASIC+).

The sectors covered by the inventory are:

stationary energy – scopes 1, 2, 3 (scope 3 from BASIC+ reporting),
transportation – scopes 1, 2, 3 (scope three from BASIC+ reporting),
waste (scopes 1, 3),
industrial processes and product use (Scope 1 of BASIC+ reporting).

The agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector has been excluded from the inventory for 2022 because Rzeszów is not an agricultural city, the areas used in this way are small, and there is also no mass animal breeding, which according to available reports is the second largest GHG emitter in the agriculture sector. Additionally, in the near future, there are plans to expand greenhouse gas inventory from the Basic level to the Basic+ level. Planned inventory expansion will include the following sectors: Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) and Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) and additional greenhouse gases. As will be shown later in the text, the largest sources of GHG emissions for the city of Rzeszów will be Stationary Energy and Transport. Even the waste sector accounts for only 1% of the total GHG emissions from the city area.

In connection with the sectors adopted for the greenhouse gas inventory, the following greenhouse gases were included:

CO₂ - carbon dioxide,
CH₄ - methane,
N₂O - nitrous oxide.

The specified values for the above greenhouse gases have been converted to CO₂e, which stands for carbon dioxide equivalent.

## Main sources of emissions

The conducted inventory clearly identifies the main sources of emissions. The total amount of inventoried greenhouse gas emissions in carbon dioxide equivalent from the area of the City Municipality of Rzeszów in 2022 amounted to 1,395,839 tCO₂e. On average, each resident of the city of Rzeszów accounted for approximately 7.06 tCO₂/year. The sector with the largest share of carbon dioxide emissions in the city was the Stationary Energy sector - 74% of the total balance, followed by the Transport sector - 25% of the total carbon dioxide emissions balance. The Waste sector was responsible for approximately 1% of total emissions. The impact of the remaining sectors was negligibly small.

In terms of quantity, the emissions from individual areas are as follows:

Stationary energy - 1,035,904 tCO₂e,
Transport - 344,403 tCO₂e,
Waste - 14,755 tCO₂e,
IPPU - 777 tCO₂e.

Diagram 1. Main sources of emissions

By comparing the data from 2010 with the current data, it is clear that the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions have remained unchanged. However, it should be noted that from 2010 to 2022, the city has increased its area by  $12.65\mathrm{km}^2$ , and the number of residents has increased by 17,982.

At present, Rzeszów is not a member of the Covenant of Mayors, and greenhouse gas emissions are also not reported to CDP/ICLEI. In the near future, it is planned to submit to the Covenant of Mayors and report in accordance with the principles adopted there.

Accurate inventory of greenhouse gas emissions is a key step in designing climate action pathways and initiatives in Rzeszów. The carefully conducted process of gathering data necessary for the inventory allowed the trained employees of the Rzeszów City Office (with competences retained within the Office) to:

better understand the problem through analysis of detailed data on current greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, air pollution levels in the city, and many other interconnected factors.
identify areas requiring intervention and determination of priorities,
design reduction actions,
in the future - monitor progress and identify problem areas.

# Planned level of greenhouse gas reduction

The planned tasks are very ambitious and costly. They currently allow for a reduction of emissions by 1,117,525 tCO2e, which means a reduction of  $80.06\%$ . It should be noted that at this stage, due to lack of accurate data, the reduction that may result from the task of developing and modernizing the power infrastructure in the city has not been estimated. However, considering the development plans of companies responsible for electricity and gas networks, which are very ambitious and include actions corresponding to the goal of climate neutrality, such as integration with renewable energy sources, modernizations (towards smart grids, automation, monitoring), or actions for energy efficiency (reducing

transmission losses, demand management), it can be inferred that by 2030 the task will contribute to the reduction of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{e}}$  emissions.

Divided by areas, the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{e}}$  reduction is as follows:

Stationary energy - 81.06% of the reduction in this area (839,717 tCO2e),
Transport - 80.05% of the reduction in this area (275,694 tCO2e),
Waste - 14.33% of the reduction in this area (2114 tCO2e).

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)
Diagram 2. Proportion of reduction of main sources of emissions

Considering the above, the residual emissions will come from the following areas: stationary energy, transportation, waste, and IPPU. It should be noted that tasks in the above-mentioned areas will be accelerated and intensified in order to achieve the greatest possible reduction of GHG emissions. Investments in green infrastructure &amp; nature-based solutions will also be developed intensively and systematically, which, in addition to absorbing  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ , have significant adaptive importance in a changing climate.

At the same time, existing greenery is continuously maintained due to its value.

The City also recognizes the potential for technological capture and long-term storage of carbon dioxide.

# Development Strategy of the City of Rzeszów until 2025

The document, taking into account in particular the strategic diagnosis presented in the City Report and the Catalog of key phenomena constituting opportunities and threats, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of Rzeszów's development in 2015, and the opinions expressed by residents in the survey conducted for the purpose of updating the Strategy, adopts the following vision of the Development Strategy of Rzeszów. Rzeszów – the growth hub of the Podkarpacie region – is a city that is friendly to people, offering and expanding numerous metropolitan functions. It is a place where it's worth living, with a high quality of life and environment, as well as comprehensive economic, social, and cultural development. Four sectoral strategic goals have been adopted, relating to the city's environment and subsystems:

Smart City – creating favorable conditions for the development of Rzeszów as an attractive location for business activities, as well as for the advancement of education, higher education, science, and culture.
A socially cohesive and integrated city – improving both the living conditions of residents and public safety.
Urban mobility and infrastructure – development and improvement of the functioning of the transportation and technical infrastructure system.
Utilization of resources – protecting clean energy and rich heritage, while managing the values and resources of the natural and cultural environment.

Four horizontal strategic goals related to the city management subsystem have also been adopted:

Territorial coherence – rational spatial and architectural development of the city's territory. Conducting pro-development, sustainable spatial management, which is one of the main tasks of the municipality.
Rich (Affluent) City – ensuring the ability to finance the development of the City using public and private funds. Utilizing support instruments for development included in the cohesion policy of the European Union and the Partnership Agreement, as well as other public and public-private instruments available within state policies.
City of cooperation – ensuring efficient social communication and cooperation between the City and public, economic, social entities and residents. Creating an institutional management system for the City in accordance with the EU cohesion policy, taking into account multi-level and multi-entity governance.
The "Rzeszów" Brand – developing a nationally and internationally recognizable image of Rzeszów as a center for economic and social innovation, a hospitable city, and friendly to visitors. Utilizing territorial marketing to stimulate development processes and improve the quality of life for residents.

# Importance

The Development Strategy of the City of Rzeszów until 2025 is a document that defines the directions of the city's development. Sustainable development, prioritization of environmental protection issues, including mitigation and adaptation to climate change, promotion of low- and zero-emission economy, investment in research and innovation, and raising awareness of residents and ecological education can significantly contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and help achieve climate neutrality.

# Study of Conditions and Directions for Spatial Development of the City of Rzeszów.

The Study of Conditions and Directions for Spatial Development of the City of Rzeszów is the most important urban planning document, which was adopted on September 26, 2023 by the City Council of Rzeszów. The Study is the basic document shaping the spatial policy of the city. The current Study assumes a revaluation of the city's spatial policy. The current level of economic development and the expectations of the residents cause the spatial policy defined in it to focus on the current and future residents of the city, with the overriding goal of ensuring them a high quality of life, without neglecting the aspects of economic development, which are to be carried out in a sustainable and responsible manner. However, the Study continues the main assumptions of spatial development defined in the previous document, ensuring the continuity of the city's planning policy. A significant revaluation has been made in the approach to the development of transportation infrastructure and the role of urban public transportation. The creation of a multifunctional city with high accessibility to social infrastructure and public spaces has been assumed. Unfavorable demographic trends have led to a particular focus on senior policy and the needs of young people. The need for development

of the former rural areas incorporated into Rzeszów, as well as the role of the city in the structure of the Rzeszów Functional Area, assuming closer cooperation and further development of spatial connections with neighboring municipalities, has also been assigned significant importance.

The nature of the Study means that it does not have strictly defined time frames. Nevertheless, the demographic forecast and the land use balance for development have been formulated with a perspective up to the year 2045. In connection with this, the needs and development possibilities of the city have been determined for such a time horizon. Taking into account a number of strategic and implementation documents developed by the city, the provisions of the Study have been formulated. The Development Strategy of the City of Rzeszów until 2025 plays a particularly important role here.

Taking into account the need to link the spatial policy of the Study with the one included in the Strategy and other socio-economic policy documents of the city, the directional part of the Study was given some characteristics of a strategic document, presenting key issues in the form of sectoral policies, as well as formulating a vision of development and defining the main goal. This approach allows for an attempt to comprehensively formulate the spatial policy of the city. It also meets the long-planned reform of integrating spatial planning and socio-economic systems, including close links between strategic documents and spatial planning acts. Given the nature and objectives of the Study, the sectoral policies have been focused solely on their spatial dimension.

One of the most important goals of Rzeszów's spatial policy is to shape the natural environment in such a way that residents can live healthier and more comfortably, that it promotes the development of the city and the settlement of new residents, while at the same time limiting their migration from the city to suburban areas. In the Study, spatial policy directions were adopted, in line with general principles of environmental protection, which allow for the protection of its resources. This approach aims to promote sustainable urban development, defined as socio-economic development in which there is a process of integrating not only political, economic, and social actions, but also maintaining a balance of nature in order to guarantee the ability to meet the basic needs of the current community and future generations.

The adopted directions of spatial policy actions take into account the need to prevent the negative effects of climate change and facilitate the city's adaptation to ongoing climate changes. As part of the spatial policy "environment and climate resilience", the following main objectives and resulting directions of action are outlined. Main goals of the policy:

sustainable development of the city, including maintaining ecological balance to ensure the ability to meet the needs of current residents as well as future generations,
protection of environmental resources and valuable natural areas,
shaping and protecting elements of the city's natural and climate system,
reducing the risk of natural and anthropogenic hazards,
minimizing and mitigating the effects of climate change by creating and strengthening tools and capabilities for adapting the city to such changes; reducing the city's negative impact on the climate.

Directions of activities:

nature conservation,
development of green areas,
shaping ecological areas,
shaping green areas as a key element of the natural-climatic system,
protection, use and development of agricultural and forest areas,
shaping allotment garden areas as a part of the city's natural system,
protection of natural resource deposits,
protection of the quality of surface and groundwater,
air protection,
protection of the acoustic climate,
protection against the effects of geodynamic processes,
protection against industrial threats,
flood protection,
increasing the city's resilience to ongoing climate change.

# Importance

The Study of Conditions and Directions for Spatial Development of the City of Rzeszów is a key planning tool determining the character of the city. Spatial planning plays a crucial role in achieving climate neutrality by influencing various aspects of spatial management, infrastructure, and resources. Optimizing space utilization, sustainable transportation development, energy efficiency, support for renewable energy sources, preservation and development of green areas, water resource management and waste management as priorities for the sustainable development of Rzeszów and setting the direction of the city's development in accordance with the above assumptions will contribute to achieving the climate neutrality of the City.

# Assumptions for the plan of supplying heat, electricity, and gas fuel for the City of Rzeszów. Update for the years 2023 – 2026

The document is a strategic act based on the provisions of the Energy Law. This is a document prepared for at least 15 years and subject to updates every three years. Its aim is to analyze and evaluate the projected changes in heat demand, electricity demand, and gas fuel demand, as well as to assess the level of energy security of the municipality and provide suggestions for actions aimed at its improvement. The energy demand has been calculated based on assumptions resulting from the directions of development specified in the "Study of Conditions and Directions for Spatial Development". The development assumptions resulting from the aforementioned document were taken into account and the demand was balanced, taking into account the planned development areas. When conducting the energy balance of the City of Rzeszów, the focus was on the consumption of final energy in the form of three types of energy used by the residential sector, public sector, trade and services sector, and companies: heat, electricity, and energy from gas fuel. The analysis is based on the current energy demand in the City developed for the year 2022. An estimated forecast of the demand for final energy carriers was developed for the perspective of 2037. The forecast has been prepared for three forecast scenarios. The most appropriate option was considered to be the balanced variant, which includes, among others:

stable development and moderate growth in demand for thermal and electrical energy,
stable development and relatively high growth in demand for natural gas,
slight increase in the number of residents according to GUS forecasts,
modernization of heat sources with optimal use of energy carriers, where district heating will play a greater role, followed by natural gas, as well as gradual introduction (according to existing conditions) of renewable energy sources,
new buildings put into use in the city will be constructed in accordance with the currently applicable energy-saving requirements, with about 20% of them being built in the highest energy class,
a slowdown in the demand for gas until 2025, followed by an increase in demand, which will be partially supplemented by biomethane (starting from 2025),

The analysis results for the sustainable variant (with energy type breakdown) are presented in the table below.

Some actions are scheduled to be implemented after 2020, with a timeline extending to 2024.

# Importance

The Low-Emission Economy Plan for the City of Rzeszów is a key tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by promoting renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, developing sustainable mobility, and educating and engaging the local community. It is a document focused on actions, the implementation of which directly translates into the goal of achieving climate neutrality.

# Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the City of Rzeszów until 2030

The Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the City of Rzeszów until 2030 was developed in response to one of the most important environmental issues: climate change and the need to adapt to its effects. The plan outlines a vision, overarching goal, and specific objectives for adapting the city to climate change, which should be achieved through the implementation of selected adaptation actions in four of the city's most vulnerable sectors: public health/vulnerable groups, water management, transportation, and tourism, specifically in recreational areas.

The adaptation plan is aligned with climate change adaptation documents at the international, community, national, and regional levels. Adaptation actions are consistent with the EU and national climate change adaptation policies. Here is a refined version of your sentence: They also align with the development policy of Rzeszów, as outlined in the strategic and planning documents applicable in the city. The adaptation plan aims to prepare the city for climate change, reduce its vulnerability to extreme events, and increase its capacity to manage the impacts of those events and their consequences.

The adaptation plan includes a diagnostic section that describes the climate phenomena and their impacts on the city, assesses the city's sensitivity to those phenomena, and evaluates the city's ability to independently manage the consequences of climate change. In response to the risks identified in the diagnostic section of the document, adaptive actions necessary to increase the city's resilience to current and future phenomena have been outlined. The plan includes three types of actions:

informational and educational actions,
organizational actions,
technical actions.

The plan of adaptation also specifies the rules for implementing adaptation measures (responsible entities, financing framework, monitoring indicators, evaluation assumptions, and document updates). The main objective indicated in the Plan is the development and increased attractiveness of Rzeszów through improving the state of the environment and increasing adaptive capacity, taking into account the principle of sustainable development in the conditions of climate change. The main goal of the Plan, on the other hand, is to increase the city's resilience to the predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and dry periods with high temperatures by 2030, as well as the increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfalls resulting in flooding, and to the occurrence of smog through the implementation of multiple adaptive actions that have a synergistic effect. Adaptation measures will help the city to adjust to climate change by reducing the vulnerability of the following sectors: public health/vulnerable groups, water management, transportation, and tourism understood as recreational areas in the city. The selection of adaptive actions was made in such a way that each adaptive goal was achieved in an optimal manner, taking into account, among others, the criteria of sustainable development, cost-effectiveness, and the synergistic impact of action effects in also reducing other threats. Increasing readiness and capacity to respond to the effects of climate change described by specific objectives requires action in various areas of the city's functioning - its organization, education, warning residents about hazards, and technical solutions in urban space. Organizational activities concern changes in local law in areas such as spatial planning, organization of public space, development of guidelines for dealing with climate threats, improvement of the functioning of municipal services or systems warning against hazards. Information and educational activities are actions that support and raise climate awareness and promote good adaptive practices. They allow to make the city and its residents resilient through appropriate educational programmes and intensified informational activities. Technical actions are investment activities involving the construction of new or modernization of existing infrastructure that contribute to protecting the city from the negative effects of climate change.

## Importance

The climate change adaptation plan is crucial in the context of climate change adaptation by identifying investments in climate-resilient infrastructure, ecosystem protection, social education, and adaptation of energy infrastructure. Through those actions, the plan contributes both to the adaptation of the local community to climate change and to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which aligns with global efforts to combat climate change.

## Environmental Protection Programme of the City of Rzeszów

The document sets forth the primary objective as "The development of the city of Rzeszów through continued efforts to improve the state of the environment, guided by the principle of sustainable development". It encompasses the analysis and evaluation of the environmental state within the city of Rzeszów, addressing intervention areas for which the following strategic objectives have been defined:

climate and air quality protection: improving air quality and effective energy management,
noise hazards: reducing the negative impact of noise on the residents of the city of Rzeszów and the natural environment,
water and wastewater management: modernization and development of water and wastewater infrastructure in the city of Rzeszów, as a part of efforts to improve the condition of groundwater and surface water,
waste management and waste prevention: implementing actions aimed at improving the waste management system,
natural resources: preserving the richness of nature and the landscape values of urban spaces.

The above strategic objectives define the main direction of actions in the aforementioned areas of intervention and comprehensively describe the tasks planned for implementation in the years 2021-2024. The implementation of strategic goals through the execution of planned activities under the Rzeszów City Environmental Protection Program is subject to appropriate monitoring. Its correct execution requires assigning an indicator to each task, as well as its baseline and target values. The state of the environment is presented numerically, showing the levels that should be achieved during task implementation. The proposed indicators are planned to be achieved by 2024. The implementation of actions indicated in the Environmental Protection Program of the City of Rzeszów will contribute to

the improvement of the natural environment in the city and have a positive impact on the health and lives of its residents.

## Importance

The Environmental Protection Program of the City of Rzeszów aims to protect natural resources, preserve biodiversity, prevent pollution, promote sustainable development, and ensure a healthy environment for future generations, thus aligning with the goal of achieving climate neutrality.

## Sustainable development plan for public collective transportation for the years 2021-2030 with elements of electromobility development strategy for the city of Rzeszów and neighboring municipalities.

The main goal of the Plan is to ensure the functioning of public transportation according to the principles of sustainable development, which is mainly manifested in cities by the share of public transportation in transportation at the level of 25-50%. The supplementary objectives of the transportation plan are as follows:

Ensuring the principles of accessibility to public transportation services, including for people with disabilities, required and specified in European Union directives and national regulations, as well as in so-called good practices.
Functioning of public transportation as a real alternative to traveling by private cars - by providing high-quality services and prioritizing collective transportation vehicles in road traffic.
Integration of public transportation, including urban and regional transportation - primarily in terms of fare and ticketing, schedule coordination, service information - as well as the construction of integration hubs.
Reducing the negative impact of transportation on the environment - by expanding the fleet of zero-emission vehicles, gradually replacing the worn-out bus fleet, and maintaining the established share of public transportation in urban transportation.

The main task of the Plan is to plan public utility transportation services within the city of Rzeszów and neighboring municipalities (with which the City Municipality of Rzeszów—acting as the transportation organizer—has signed agreements regarding local public transportation), in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. This is due to the significant importance of mobility for socio-economic development and the negative consequences of uncontrolled growth in individual motorization. The increase in awareness of the importance of transportation issues, including those related to pollution emissions and noise, has led to a change in the perception of combustion engine vehicles. Thanks to the Act on Electromobility and Alternative Fuels, the provisions of which are in line with global trends, regulations have been introduced to stimulate the development of low- and zero-emission transportation in Polish cities. Pursuant to the provisions of the aforementioned law, local governments have become one of the main participants in the process of popularizing the use of alternative fuels to meet the daily transportation needs of their residents.

## Importance

Taking into account the fact that the transportation sector is a significant source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, the Plan defining sustainable public transportation, not only in Rzeszów but also in neighboring municipalities, can contribute significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gases and be a key document in the context of the climate neutrality goal that needs to be achieved in the coming years.

## Update of the Air Protection Program for the Rzeszów City Area.

Air protection programmes are adopted by the Voivodeship Assemblies, therefore the Update of the Air Protection Program for the Rzeszów City Area. was adopted by the Podkarpackie Voivodeship Assembly, but its implementation is the responsibility of the Mayor of Rzeszów. The program aims to identify the causes of air pollution exceedances in the area. It specifies the directions of corrective actions, the implementation of which is intended to improve air quality, and indicates the implementation of mandatory actions, such as:

conducting oversight activities (to ensure compliance with the provisions of the resolution on introducing restrictions on fuel combustion installations in the Podkarpackie Voivodeship),
increasing the share of greenery in the city area of Rzeszów,
rzeszów
capital of innovation

environmental education.

## Importance

The Update of the Air Protection Program for the Rzeszów City Area is crucial in reducing air pollution emissions, with the main sources being low emissions and the transportation sector. These are primarily suspended particles PM10 and PM2.5, as well as benzo(a)pyrene. Given that the source of those pollutants is the burning of fuels in the municipal and household sector for heating buildings or in vehicle engines, implementing measures to reduce those pollutants will align with efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the implementation of the Update of the Air Protection Program for the Rzeszów City Area aligns with the goal of climate neutrality.

## Resolution on introducing restrictions on fuel combustion installations in the Podkarpackie Voivodeship

The resolution adopted by the Voivodeship Assembly constitutes a local legal act and establishes the following obligations for the city of Rzeszów (and also for the entire Podkarpackie Voivodeship):

From June 1, 2018, it is not allowed to burn in heating devices (boilers, fireplaces, etc.): brown coal and solid fuels produced using this coal; coal sludge and coal flotation concentrates and mixtures produced using them; fuels with a grain size below 5 mm and ash content above 12%; solid biomass with a moisture content exceeding 20% in the working state.
Deadlines for replacing heating devices purchased before June 1, 2018:
until December 31, 2021, installations operated for over 10 years from the date of production or without a nameplate (not meeting any of the classes of the PN-EN 303-5:2012 standard).
until December 31, 2023, installations operated for 5 to 10 years from the date of production (not meeting the emission standards of any of the classes of the PN-EN 303-5:2012 standard).
until December 31, 2025, installations operated for up to 5 years from the date of production (not meeting the emission standards of any of the classes of the PN-EN 303-5:2012 standard).
from January 1, 2028, installations meeting the emission requirements of classes 3 and 4 of the standard. PN-EN 303-5:2012.

Currently, only the operation of installations that meet the requirements of Ekoprojekt is allowed.

## Importance

The anti-smog resolution aims to prevent the negative impact of fuel combustion installations on human health and the environment. Due to the indication of specific time intervals in which specific solid fuel devices are to be replaced, it is a very important operational element that enables a real reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution from the municipal and household sector.

The above policies implemented and carried out for the protection of the environment aim to prevent climate change. Some of the policies implemented recently, i.e. The Study of Conditions and Directions for Spatial Development of the City of Rzeszów or the assumptions for the plan of heat supply, electricity and gas fuel for the city of Rzeszów - Update for the years 2023-2026 clearly and unambiguously indicates the directions of actions for environmental protection and prioritizes the activities that need to be undertaken to achieve climate neutrality. The study of conditions is also an excellent example of involving residents in the process of adopting documents - far beyond the classical perception of social consultations. The Study was widely presented, residents had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the document, as well as have direct conversations with designers and representatives of BRMR (e.g. at Urban Lab Rzeszów). Many comments were submitted, each of which was analyzed individually. Study - referred to as the "Green Constitution of Rzeszów," aims to plan the city's future development in a manner that harmoniously incorporates the allocation of areas for green spaces, which are crucial for CO2 absorption.

The adaptation plan to climate change for the City of Rzeszów until 2030 and the Sustainable Development Plan for Public Collective Transport for the years 2021-2030 with elements of electromobility development strategy for the city of Rzeszów and neighboring municipalities, including tasks and interventions outlined by the year 2030, indicates main and detailed goals, some of which will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The adaptation plan to climate change for the City of Rzeszów until 2030 will be updated in 2025, due to the fact that since its adoption, the city has expanded its administrative boundaries.

On the other hand: the Development Strategy of the City of Rzeszów until 2025, the Low-Emission Economy Plan for the City of Rzeszów, and the Environmental Protection Program for the City of Rzeszów are the least up-to-date documents. The actions and goals outlined in them are planned to be achieved by 2025 at the latest, hence they will need to be redeveloped, taking into account the priority of the City's sustainable development and ambitious goals that will enable achieving climate neutrality. For those documents, the developed Climate City Contract will serve as an "umbrella", ensuring that intervention pathways and planned actions are consistent.

Finally - Update of the Air Protection Program for the Rzeszów City Area. and Resolution on introducing restrictions on fuel combustion installations in the Podkarpackie Voivodeship - are documents that are adopted by the Podkarpackie Voivodeship Assembly, while the implementation is the responsibility of the Mayor of Rzeszów. These documents are consistent with the vision of sustainable city development and correspond to the goal of achieving climate neutrality.

# Poland's energy policy until 2040

The aim of the State Energy Policy is to ensure energy security, while ensuring the competitiveness of the economy, energy efficiency, and reducing the impact of the energy sector on the environment, with optimal use of domestic energy resources. Energy security means meeting the current and future needs of consumers for fuels and energy in a technically and economically justified manner, while maintaining environmental protection requirements. This means the current and prospective guarantee of the security of raw material supplies, production, transmission, and distribution of energy, i.e., the entire energy chain. Main indicators of achieving the goal of the analyzed Policy:

not more than 56% of coal in electricity generation by 2030,
at least 23% of RES in final gross energy consumption in 2030,
implementing nuclear energy in 2033,
reducing GHG emissions by 30% by 2030 (compared to 1990),
reducing primary energy consumption by 23% by 2030 (compared to consumption forecasts from 2007).

According to the assumptions, energy policy is based on three pillars:

Just transformation,
Zero-emission energy system,
Good air quality.

Specific goals of Poland's energy policy until 2040:

optimal, as long as possible utilization of own energy resources (transformation of coal regions),
expansion of electricity generation and network infrastructure (capacity market, implementation of smart networks),
diversification of supplies and expansion of natural gas, crude oil, and liquid fuels network infrastructure (construction of the Baltic Pipe and the second line of the Pomeranian Pipeline),
development of energy markets (implementation of an Action Plan aimed at increasing cross-border transmission capacity of electricity, development of electromobility, gas hub),
implementation of nuclear energy (Polish Nuclear Energy Programme),
development of renewable energy sources (implementation of offshore wind energy),
rzeszów
capital of innovation
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
O

development of district heating and cogeneration (development of systemic district heating),
improvement of energy efficiency (promoting the improvement of energy efficiency),
development of the hydrogen market.

By 2040, over half of the installed capacity will consist of zero-emission sources. The implementation of offshore wind energy and the launch of a nuclear power plant will play a significant role in this process in the Polish power system. These will be two strategic new areas and branches of industry that will be developed in Poland. Parallel to large-scale energy, distributed and citizen energy will develop - based on local capital. According to PEP 2040, the use of renewable energy technologies is assumed in heat production and in transportation through the development of electro and hydrogen mobility.

## Importance

Poland's energy policy until 2040 is of crucial importance in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the transformation of the energy sector towards greater energy efficiency, increased use of renewable energy sources, and promoting sustainable transportation. Through those actions, this policy contributes to achieving climate goals and creating a more sustainable and environmentally friendly society.

## National Energy and Climate Plan for the years 2021-2030

In the "National Energy and Climate Plan for 2021-2030", climate and energy goals for 2030 were formulated. They include, among others: reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the share of renewable energy sources, and increasing energy efficiency. The document highlights the problem of so-called "low emissions" generated by transportation or individual heat sources. Attention is drawn to the need for the development of renewable energy sources (OZE) and support for existing installations, as well as newly emerging investments related to renewable energy.

Significant attention is given to energy efficiency. These actions aim to reduce energy consumption, as well as to limit emissions and contribute to the achievement of climate and energy goals. There is also a need to implement actions related to climate change adaptation. The Plan sets the following climate and energy goals for 2030:

7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in sectors not covered by the ETS system, in comparison to the level in 2005,
21-23% share of RES in final gross energy consumption (the 23% target will be achievable if Poland is granted additional EU funds, including those allocated for a just transition), taking into account:
14% share of RES in transportation,
an annual increase in the share of RES in heating and cooling by 1.1% on average per year,
23% increase in energy efficiency compared to PRIMES2007 forecasts,
reducing coal's share in electricity production to 56-60%.

It encompasses an integrated approach to the five dimensions of the Energy Union:

reduction of emissions,
energy security,
energy efficiency,
internal energy market,
scientific research, innovation, and competitiveness.

Currently, the document is being updated. The future strategy for updating the National Energy and Climate Plan for the years 2021-2030 will be based on two transformation scenarios: the baseline scenario (WEM) and the ambitious scenario (WAM). The baseline scenario presents the development of the situation based on existing instruments and planned policies. The ambitious scenario assumes the implementation of new instruments of energy and climate policy, with the aim of accelerating decarbonization in a way that strengthens our economy. The update presents the first of two scenarios (i.e. WEM). It is based on implemented and planned transformation policies, therefore resulting in a scenario similar to "business as usual". This is a scenario of balanced aspirations - it shows what the effects will be if we lack pro-climate ambitions. Its result is a relatively low level of CO2 emission reduction by 2030 and a relatively high level of coal, gas, and other fossil fuel consumption. This scenario does not achieve the EU goal of reducing GHG emissions by 55% compared to 1990. Solutions enabling the achievement of the goal of reducing GHG emissions in Poland to a level similar to the EU will be

By promoting renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, modernizing the energy sector, and implementing low-emission transportation solutions, such a plan contributes to the creation of a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy policy in Poland.

# Update of the National Air Protection Programme

Strategic document defining corrective actions to be implemented in the short-term perspective until 2025, medium-term perspective until 2030, and long-term perspective until 2040, which will not only be consistent with the previously implemented policy of improving air quality and preventing climate change at the national, voivodeship, and municipality levels, but above all will determine new directions of action in this area.

The document aims to coordinate actions derived from the national air quality policy framework in connection with policy areas related to the household and municipal sector, clean energy, heating, and renewable energy sources, as well as transportation.

The main goal of the Update of the National Air Protection Programme is to protect the health and quality of life of residents and the natural environment as a whole, particularly by urgently improving air quality in designated areas, where, as indicated by the annual air quality assessment conducted by GIOŠ, exceedances of permissible and target levels of certain pollutants are still observed. This goal will be achieved through the implementation of actions specified in selected intervention areas.

The anticipated key outcome of implementing this document is the improvement of air quality by bringing it to levels that comply with national and EU legislation, and, in the longer term, working towards achieving the standards recommended by the WHO.

The intervention directions leading to the achievement of specific goals, i.e., meeting and maintaining at least the air quality standards set out in EU and national legislation, will be:

maintaining the priority of improving air quality and developing the air quality assessment system by increasing the number of monitoring stations included in air quality measurements, as part of the State Environmental Monitoring,

reducing the volume of air pollutant emissions from the household and municipal sector,

reducing the volume of air pollutant emissions from the road transportation sector,

reducing the level of air pollution in cities, urban policy,

increasing the share of clean energy, heat, development of renewable energy sources,

environmental education,

of buildings. For the purpose of developing the strategy, a review of all buildings in Poland, both public and private, was conducted, which shows that there are 14.2 million buildings in Poland, of which nearly 40 percent are single-family residential buildings. A significant portion of buildings is characterized by low energy efficiency and will require urgent thermal modernization in the coming years. The data indicates a significant variation in the energy efficiency of buildings, both in terms of their purpose and the year they were commissioned. Buildings commissioned in the 21st century are characterized by relatively high energy efficiency, but older ones have a high energy demand and require thermal modernization.

From 2020 to 2030, it is planned to carry out thermal modernization of  $236\mathrm{k}$  buildings annually, from 2030 to 2040 - 271 k buildings, and from 2040 to 2050 - 244,000 buildings. and from 2021 to 2050, 7.5 million thermal modernization projects have been planned. The strategy assumes an average annual rate of thermal modernization of about  $3.8\%$  with the assumption that by 2050,  $65\%$  of buildings will achieve an PE indicator of no more than  $50\mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^2$  per year.

Strategy recommended in the action plan is to combine rapid growth in the scale of shallow thermal modernization with gradual dissemination of deep, more comprehensive thermal modernization by 2030.

# REPowerEU

A plan for rapid reduction of dependence on Russian fossil fuels and ecological transformation (REPowerEU) in response to the difficulties and disruptions in the global energy market caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The basic assumptions of this program include:

diversification of supplies, which is implemented through EU cooperation, with international partners,
energy saving, which according to the European Commission can be the fastest, cheapest and safest way to reduce not only dependence on imported fossil fuels from Russia, but also to lower bills,
replacement of fossil fuels in homes, industry, and energy production, as well as accelerating the use of energy obtained from renewable sources. This will help in building energy independence and ecological transformation.

These assumptions are to be implemented through the introduction of voluntary and mandatory actions for member states. These include changes in regulations that provide for the termination of public support for fossil fuel devices and an increase in support for the use of environmentally friendly solutions. An example of such actions is the announcement of changes regarding boilers and other devices powered by fossil fuels. Such devices are to receive the lowest energy efficiency classes, and at a later stage, the possibility of introducing them into circulation in the EU is to be terminated. In addition, Member States are encouraged to launch support programs, utilize EU financing, and introduce new rules regarding the use of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources in buildings.

## Importance

REPowerEU is a key program of the European Union that contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by promoting renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, electrifying transportation, investing in clean energy technologies, and international cooperation.

# RED II Directive 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources

"The RED II Directive", also known as the biofuels directive, indicates actions supporting the use of renewable energy sources. The directive sets an overall goal for 2030 – at least 32% of energy production from renewable sources. The aim is to ensure the achievement of this goal in a cost-effective manner for individual member states, by establishing a stable, market-based European approach to cost-effective and market-based financial support for electricity from renewable sources. The directive promotes the production of biofuels from waste, for example by double-counting the mass of fuel produced from waste (such as bakery waste) compared to the mass of fuel produced from natural resources (such as rapeseed, wheat, corn). The RED II Directive also applies to the production of high-quality products from plastic waste, placing great emphasis on certification according to the standards of the circular economy (based on which it can be demonstrated that a given raw material, as a semi-finished product or finished product, comes from waste). The directive sets out the targets for the use of renewable energy sources between 2021 and 2030. The document aligns with the objectives of the EU energy policy, which include, among others, supporting renewable forms of energy. It obliges Member States to "establish a framework conducive to promoting and facilitating the development of renewable energy consumption, based on an assessment of existing unjustified barriers to renewable energy consumption in their territory and energy networks".

## Importance

The RED II Directive is a comprehensive set of regulations and guidelines aimed at promoting the use of energy from renewable sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions throughout the European Union. By setting targets for renewable sources, supporting innovation, electrifying transportation, improving energy efficiency, and protecting the environment, this Directive contributes to the transformation of the European energy sector towards a more sustainable and low-emission development model.

# Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) - on climate protection and cost savings

The document is part of the "Fit for 55" package and will replace the existing EED directive from 2018. By amending the directive on energy efficiency, the European Union aims to move closer to achieving climate neutrality by 2050. The new target, which aims for an 11.7% reduction in final energy consumption, exceeds the original proposal from the Commission in July 2021, which set the level at 9%. According to the new version of the EED directive, all EU member states will have to achieve an average annual energy savings rate of 1.49% between 2024 and 2030 (the current requirement is 0.8%). This will significantly reduce energy consumption in sectors such as construction, industry, and transportation. The directive assumes that European Union countries should prioritize improving energy efficiency for vulnerable consumers, low-income households, and people living in social housing. This is associated with new energy-saving obligations. The public sector is also subject to obligations. It aims to achieve an annual reduction in energy consumption of 1.9%. Public transportation and armed forces have been exempted from this obligation. In addition, member states will be required to renovate at least 3% of the surface area of buildings belonging to public institutions each year. Public authorities will have to take into account energy efficiency requirements when making purchasing decisions.

According to the new law, energy management systems will become mandatory for large energy consumers (exceeding 85 TJ of annual energy consumption), who will be subject to audits in case of discrepancies. Companies with energy consumption exceeding 10 TJ will be required to conduct an energy audit and prepare an action plan for each recommendation. The directive also introduces an obligation to monitor energy consumption in data centers. The new regulations also promote local heating and cooling plans in larger municipalities. Based on the revised definition of an efficient heating and cooling system, included in the EED directive, the minimum requirements will be gradually tightened in the coming years.

This will allow for the creation of fully emission-free district heating and cooling networks by 2050. The EED Directive additionally supports provisions on financing energy efficiency. EU countries are supposed to promote financing systems dedicated to investments in improving energy efficiency.

# Importance

The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) is a key legal instrument of the European Union that will contribute to climate protection by promoting energy savings and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By introducing energy efficiency goals, improving the energy efficiency of buildings and industry, promoting energy efficiency in transportation, supporting companies and households, and monitoring progress, the EED Directive supports the pursuit of sustainable and low-emission economic development.

# Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)

The directive primarily concerns increasing the energy efficiency of buildings by improving their physical parameters, which leads to a reduction in electricity and heat supply. Thanks to this, the consumption of electricity, gas, biomass, and other energy carriers necessary for the proper functioning of the building is reduced. Main assumptions:

lack of subsidies for boilers using fossil fuels from 2025,
zero-emission new public utility buildings from 2028 onwards,
mandatory photovoltaics on new non-residential and public utility buildings with an area exceeding 250 m²,
mandatory photovoltaics on all new residential buildings and zero-emission new residential buildings from 2030 onwards,
reducing average primary energy consumption by at least 16% by 2030 and at least 20-22% by 2035,
need to renovate 16% of non-residential buildings with the worst energy performance, and 26% of such buildings by 2033,
phasing out coal-fired boilers from 2040 onwards,
zero-emission building stock in the European Union by 2050.

# Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008. on air quality and cleaner air for Europe

The directive sets goals for air quality, including ambitious and economically viable goals to improve human health and environmental quality. It also specifies methods for assessing those objectives and taking corrective actions in case the set standards are not met. It also provides for informing the public. The directive consolidates the majority of existing provisions on air quality into one document and includes the following key elements:

thresholds, permissible values, and target values are established to enable the assessment of the content of each of the pollutants covered by this directive: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, lead, benzene, and carbon monoxide,
national authorities designate the appropriate bodies to carry out those assessments, using data collected at selected sampling points,
in a situation where pollution levels in a specific area exceed the established thresholds, air protection plans must be implemented to address the situation; those plans may include specific measures to protect vulnerable social groups, such as children,
if there is a risk that pollution levels may exceed permissible thresholds, short-term plans to reduce traffic intensity, construction work, or certain industrial activities must be implemented to prevent danger,
national authorities must ensure that not only social organizations, but also environmental, consumer and other relevant organizations, including public health bodies and industry federations, are informed about the quality of outdoor air in their area,

Behavioral systems: encompassing changes in individual behaviors and habits of residents, in the context of the need to take action to achieve climate neutrality, including the use of public transportation, waste segregation, and respect for and conservation of energy in households.
Spatial planning system: seems to be crucial in the context of achieving climate neutrality by ensuring sustainable development, efficient use of natural resources, and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. The preservation and protection of green areas, as carbon dioxide sinks and from the perspective of biodiversity conservation, is also crucial. Sustainable spatial planning can also contribute to promoting energy efficiency (sustainable construction, renewable energy sources, etc.). Spatial planning also has enormous potential in terms of adapting to the effects of climate change, such as extreme weather events, flood risks, or urban heat islands.

Due to the complex nature of the challenge of achieving climate neutrality by 2030 and the necessary just transition in various systems, it is necessary to identify all barriers and gradually overcome them.

Rzeszów is at the beginning of the road to achieving climate neutrality, but there are many actions that need to be taken. In various areas, a number of barriers have already been identified, hence:

Insufficient level of support at the national level, lack of targeted programs - current government programs primarily focus on improving air quality, with less support for deep thermal modernization. Rzeszów, like many other cities in Poland, is struggling with insufficient funds for infrastructure development. Insufficient government support for local investments limits the ability to attract new companies and investors. The city of Rzeszów needs greater support in terms of tax relief, grants, development programs, and the implementation of pro-ecological projects. Lack of proper coordination of national-level actions in the field of regional policy can impact the competitiveness and efficiency of the economy in Rzeszów. In summary, the insufficient level of support from the national level can be a significant obstacle to the development of Rzeszów and meeting

the needs of its residents, which emphasizes the need for greater cooperation between local governments and the central government.

**Possible solution to the barrier:** The response to insufficient support from the national level for the city of Rzeszów is primarily dialogue and cooperation with the government. Organizing meetings with government representatives, during which specific projects will be presented that can bring benefits to residents and the region. Establishing cooperation with non-governmental organizations, universities, and the private sector to jointly create projects that can be implemented at the local level and could receive national support. Organizing informational campaigns for residents to raise awareness about the city's needs and encourage them to actively participate in local life.

Local, regional, national, and European strategic documents and legal regulations - not adapted to needs, created based on outdated data, unclear, unreadable, or allowing for various interpretations, hindering or often preventing the implementation of innovative and urgently needed projects, thus completely blocking their potential. Variable political priorities.

**Possible solution to the barrier:** Creating and promoting demands regarding the adaptation of regulations and strategies at the regional, national, and European level. Cooperation with the relevant authorities, thanks to which they will pay attention to the specificity and needs of Rzeszów. Conducting a detailed analysis of the needs of residents and local companies, including engaging the community in the process of identifying key challenges and expectations. Organizing meetings with representatives of local institutions, non-governmental organizations, entrepreneurs, and residents. Cooperation and open dialogue will help in better understanding the local context and key issues that should be included in the strategic documents of the city of Rzeszów. Furthermore, it is necessary to establish closer cooperation with local universities, which can provide knowledge and resources in the field of creating competent and tailored documents.

Insufficient cooperation between local government and higher authorities, as well as poor involvement of local governments as initiators and organizers of the decarbonization process, mobilizing other partners in the city.

Poor understanding of the meaning of the climate crisis, the positive meaning of the decarbonization process, avoided costs, and direct and indirect benefits. Lack of integrated approach between different sectors and bodies. Silos mentality in management, project-oriented rather than process-oriented approach.

Lack of appropriate structures for monitoring and evaluating actions. Staff shortages and competency gaps. There are no current strategies that would indicate goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

**Possible response to the barrier:** increasing communication and coordination through organizing regular meetings and workshops between the local government in Rzeszów and regional and national authorities, with the aim of exchanging experiences and best practices. Hiring specialists to help the city develop a decarbonization strategy and draft grant-funded projects. Additionally, organizing training sessions for employees of the Rzeszów City Office on actions related to decarbonization and raising public awareness of the benefits of decarbonization. It is also important to encourage other local governments and the private sector to collaborate with Rzeszów in implementing decarbonization projects.

Insufficient knowledge of modern technical solutions, complexity of the investment process with a low level of general technical culture, low awareness of financial and environmental costs and additional benefits, little interest from building managers, difficulty in reaching consensus in multi-family buildings.

Some people responsible for building management in Rzeszów do not have sufficient knowledge about available innovative technologies. This causes reluctance to take risks and invest in modern systems that could bring long-term benefits. The process of making changes in multi-family buildings is complicated. It requires collaboration from multiple parties, such as architects, engineers, material suppliers, and investors. This complexity often leads to delays and increased costs, which discourages decisions about undertaking thermal modernization. Additionally, a major problem is the low awareness of financial and environmental costs. Many people are not aware of the costs that

can be saved through building modernization, as well as the ways in which sustainable practices can impact the environment. The described barrier is complex and multifaceted. It requires taking educational actions to promote modern solutions and changes in the approach to investment management in construction in order to minimize the symptoms of the described difficulties and lead to more effective use of modern technologies.

**Possible solution to the barrier:** Organization of trainings and workshops for residents of Rzeszów and building managers regarding modern technical solutions. The workshops should cover technical, financial, and environmental aspects, such as energy savings, financing opportunities, and health benefits. Presentation of cases where the implementation of new technologies has brought tangible benefits. Well-documented case studies can inspire residents and building managers in Rzeszów to take similar actions. It would be helpful to conduct analyses of current maintenance and operating costs of buildings, taking into account potential savings resulting from modernization. The above actions would contribute to raising awareness of the impact of technology on the environment and the health of residents, and would help build trust between the city and building managers and residents.

**Technological/infrastructural barriers** - lack of adequate infrastructure for the production, storage, and distribution of renewable energy (or currently insufficient infrastructure, such as power networks), and the lack of technologies that enable effective management of greenhouse gas emissions. The increasing importance of RES, such as solar or wind energy, is associated with the need for energy storage.

In Rzeszów, there is a lack of appropriate storage systems, which results in the inability to effectively utilize energy. The introduction of innovative RES technologies and the modernization of infrastructure require significant investments. In Rzeszów, there are limitations in financing such projects due to a lack of financial support. Technological and infrastructural barriers in Rzeszów in the area of renewable energy are still a significant challenge that requires an integrated approach, investment, and cooperation of different sectors to achieve sustainable development goals.

**Possible solution to the barrier:** Expansion of power networks and implementation of smart networks, which will allow for better management of energy flow, optimization of consumption, and integration of various renewable sources. Investments in modern battery systems that will enable the storage of surplus energy produced from renewable sources and its later use when needed. Introduction of various technologies, such as thermal storage, batteries, or mechanical solutions, to minimize energy losses. In addition, it is important to organize trainings and educational programs for the residents of Rzeszów and local entrepreneurs on the benefits of renewable energy and efficient energy management. Promoting the benefits of renewable energy sources and renewable energy through informational campaigns in the city and public events. Subsidies and tax incentives play a significant role. Supporting local companies through grant programs and tax incentives for renewable energy installations, which will encourage investments in solar panels, wind turbines, and other technologies.

To sum up, in order to overcome technological and infrastructural barriers in Rzeszów, it is necessary to coordinate actions in the areas of investment, education, innovation, and cooperation between different entities. The transformation towards sustainable energy will require the involvement of local authorities in Rzeszów, residents, and the private sector.

**Lack of financing models and business models enabling achieving large scale, with the involvement of mixed, private and public, capital without burdening users with excessive costs.**

The city of Rzeszów is facing difficulties in attracting investments that would encompass both the public and private sectors. Lack of clear financial models that could attract investments leads to a situation where project initiators and entrepreneurs are unable to effectively calculate costs and benefits. Public-private cooperation requires the creation of clear structures to support projects. Without proper institutions and platforms for exchanging experiences, business models may not be able to gain popularity and efficiency. The city has a limited budget that is not sufficiently flexible to invest in new, unconventional solutions. As a result, the lack of adequate regional and local funds means that many projects have no chance of being implemented.

The above barrier is the result of a combination of various factors that can hinder the development

rzeszów
capital of innovation
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
C

of innovative financing models in Rzeszów. Overcoming those limitations will require integrated strategies and cooperation between the public sector, private sector, and non-governmental organizations.

**Possible solution to the barrier:** Creating a platform that would connect various stakeholders, including authorities in Rzeszów, private investors, non-profit organizations, and residents. Meetings and workshops could help in identifying needs and collaboration opportunities. Projects that involve both public and private capital, such as projects related to infrastructure, sustainable development, renewable energy, or housing, should be initiated.

Additionally, the city should invest in the development of financial technologies that would enable efficient capital acquisition and cost optimization for users. Awareness and education of the local community are also important. Creating awareness about the benefits of investments and financial models that help in the development of local initiatives. Educational programs can be organized to help residents understand the benefits they can gain from those initiatives. Furthermore, supporting local entrepreneurs and start-ups through incubators, accelerators, and access to funds can stimulate the development of innovative business models. Regular assessment of the effectiveness of implemented financial and business models will allow for ongoing adjustments and adaptation of strategies to changing market conditions and community needs. Implementation of those steps, with active involvement of all stakeholders, can help overcome current barriers and create dynamic financing models in Rzeszów.

Too slow pace of decarbonization of private buildings (residential, commercial, etc.) - due to relatively low profitability of building modernization, low energy and process efficiency of applied solutions, technical problems (poor technical condition of buildings, historic character) and legal problems (unregulated ownership, inefficient management structures).

The fragmentation of decisions also does not favor the effect of synergy and scale. The slow pace of decarbonization of private buildings in Rzeszów, as in many other cities, can be attributed to numerous barriers. One of the key obstacles is the lack of sufficient financial resources and environmental awareness among the residents and property owners in Rzeszów. Implementation of decarbonization technologies, such as heat pumps, photovoltaic panels, or building insulation, is associated with high initial costs. Many people do not have enough savings or cannot afford to take out a loan. Although there are grant programs and tax incentives, they are not always sufficient or well-known to residents. Sometimes application procedures are complicated, which discourages people from using those opportunities. Furthermore, many people lack sufficient knowledge about the benefits of decarbonization, both financial and environmental. Information campaigns on energy efficiency and sustainable development are still insufficient.

Changes in the building infrastructure require residents of Rzeszów and property owners to make decisions about long-term investments. There is often a lack of understanding for the benefits that such changes can bring, which results in a conservative approach to building modernization.

**Possible solution to the barrier:** Organizing campaigns aimed at raising awareness about the benefits of decarbonization, both for the environment and for financial savings, as well as training and workshops on ecological building solutions and available support programs. The next step should be to increase the availability of grants and tax incentives for building owners who invest in low-carbon technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps, thermal insulation, and the development of low-interest credit programs for individuals wishing to invest in building renovations. Furthermore, encouraging cooperation between local government and developers to support green investments and mobilizing local businesses to engage in decarbonization projects as part of their social responsibility. Implementation of systems to monitor progress in building decarbonization and reporting this data will allow for a more accurate analysis of the effectiveness of the actions taken.

To overcome the barriers in decarbonizing buildings in Rzeszów, integrated actions are needed that combine education, financial support, legal regulations, and technological innovations. Collaboration with residents, the private sector, and public institutions will allow for faster achievement of goals related to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions reduction.

Poor public understanding of climate and environmental challenges.

Poor understanding of social climate and environmental challenges in Rzeszów affects the effectiveness of environmental protection and climate change adaptation actions. Low awareness of climate issues and their consequences results from insufficient number of appropriate educational programs and lack of engagement from residents. Furthermore, climate issues are often not present in local media, which limits the availability of information for citizens, especially in the senior group.

Possible response to the barrier: organizing educational programs aimed at different age groups, which will help increase ecological awareness. Conducting informational campaigns in local media that will explain climate-related issues and their consequences for the residents of Rzeszów. Encouraging the creation of local groups and initiatives that will take action to protect the environment, such as planting trees, cleaning green areas, etc. Establishing cooperation with non-governmental organizations dealing with ecology to jointly organize projects and events. An important issue is to enable the residents of Rzeszów to participate in social consultations regarding climate policy and environmental protection, as well as to collect residents' opinions on spatial development plans and ecological investments.

Through those actions, both the understanding of local climate challenges and the engagement of Rzeszów residents in active environmental protection activities can be increased. Thanks to joint effort, it is possible to build a more conscious and responsible society.

Gaps in knowledge, lack of data and tools, high costs of acquiring them, lack of standardized methods of data acquisition, aggregation, utilization, and their verification, monitoring, and evaluation. Data digitization.

Barriers related to data digitization in Rzeszów can be characterized on several levels, which largely concern general challenges in acquiring, managing, and utilizing data. Here are the key points that make up this barrier:

knowledge gaps: many institutions in Rzeszów (both public and private) lack the necessary knowledge and expertise in data digitization. This includes technical skills, understanding of legal regulations related to personal data and data protection, as well as knowledge of best practices in data analysis.

lack of data and tools: sometimes institutions do not have access to appropriate data (for example, due to data fragmentation in different systems or its complete absence) and technological tools enabling efficient data collection, analysis, and visualization.

high costs of data acquisition: purchasing data analysis tools, software, or employee training are associated with significant expenses. In the case of limited budgets of public institutions or small companies, this constitutes a significant obstacle in the process of digitalization.

verification, monitoring, and evaluation: without clear methods of verifying, monitoring, and evaluating data, there is a risk that decisions will be based on incorrect or erroneous information. This limits the effectiveness of actions and can lead to wasting resources.

Possible response to the barrier: introduction of standardized methods for data acquisition, aggregation, and verification. This can be achieved by creating guidelines and best practices, as well as training employees.

Developing data classification schemes, which will facilitate its organization and subsequent use. It is also important to establish cooperation with higher education institutions, research institutes, and technology companies that can help in the development and implementation of effective technological solutions.

It is important to organize workshops and seminars that will promote the exchange of knowledge and experience in the field of data digitization and the search for external funds, such as EU grants, which can help cover the costs of purchasing data management tools. Furthermore, it is particularly important to educate the residents of Rzeszów about the benefits of data digitization, which can increase interest and support for such initiatives. Development of monitoring systems that allow for real-time evaluation of the effectiveness of digitalization-related activities and the quality of collected data, as well as regular assessment of data acquisition and analysis processes, which will enable their continuous improvement.

By taking the above steps, Rzeszów can effectively minimize barriers related to data digitization and create a solid foundation for further development in this field.

Independent situations causing destabilization of availability and prices, inflation growth, etc., such as a pandemic, war in Ukraine.

Independent situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the war in Ukraine, have a significant impact on the economy of the region, including Rzeszów, causing destabilization of availability and prices and contributing to inflationary pressures. Here are a few key barriers that may result from those situations:

disruptions in supply chains - the pandemic and armed conflicts lead to disruptions in international supply chains,

In the case of Rzeszów, which is an important industrial and technological center in Poland, those problems result in a shortage of raw materials and components, which hampers production and increases costs,

rising production and transportation costs - translate into higher prices of goods and services in Rzeszów,

investment slowdown - uncertainty related to crisis situations discourages investors from investing capital in the region. In Rzeszów, where the development of technology and industry is crucial, a lack of new investments can lead to economic stagnation and an increase in unemployment,

increased public spending - increasing spending on economic support leads to growing public debt. In the longer term, this may affect the stability of public finances and tax policy,

changes in the labor market - crises lead to destabilization of the labor market. In Rzeszów, where many people work in sectors sensitive to economic changes, such as the aviation industry or IT, this situation can result in an increase in unemployment and a decrease in household incomes,

problems with the availability of products and services - as a result of crises, the availability of certain goods and services becomes significantly limited, leading to increased competition for resources. In Rzeszów, this can apply to both everyday products and specialized services, which can raise prices and lead to consumer frustration.

In summary, independent situations such as a pandemic and war pose a serious challenge to the economic stability of Rzeszów, affecting prices, availability of goods and services, as well as the job market. The long-term effects of those crises can be exacerbated by the need for both companies and local and national decision-makers policies to adapt.

Possible solution to the barrier: To overcome the barriers related to independent situations that can destabilize availability and prices in Rzeszów, such as a pandemic, the war in Ukraine, or other economic crises, multi-faceted actions must be taken. Offering grants, tax incentives, or other forms of support to local businesses that may be affected by crises, as well as supporting local producers and companies, which can increase the availability of products in Rzeszów and reduce transportation costs, would be beneficial. This will contribute to the stabilization of the labor market and the local economy. Furthermore, regular analysis of market trends and predicting potential threats allows for faster implementation of preventive actions. Additionally, through transparent communication and educating society about market cycles and the external effects of events, we can build greater resilience and understanding among residents.

By implementing those strategies, Rzeszów can better cope with unpredictable situations that affect the availability of products and prices, thus contributing to the stabilization of the local economy.

Transport - Rzeszów, as a developing city, has its unique transportation barriers that affect the mobility of its residents.

Despite the continuous development of transportation infrastructure, there are still areas where there is a lack of proper roads, intersections, or parking lots. Increased traffic during peak hours in many places leads to difficulties and frustration for drivers. Despite a good public transportation system, residents encounter difficulties such as infrequent services in some parts of the city, lack of direct connections between certain districts, and limited availability during evening and Sunday hours. Despite the growing popularity of electric bicycles and scooters, there is a lack of appropriate bicycle paths and infrastructure conducive to their use. The intensification of car traffic contributes to air pollution and noise, which lowers the quality of life for residents.

Possible response to the barrier: encouraging residents to use various means of transportation, such as public transportation, bicycles, electric scooters, or walking, as well as organizing informational campaigns about the benefits of sustainable transportation.

Improving transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new bicycle paths, sidewalks, and the expansion of public transportation networks, plays a significant role. It should be noted that the city has been systematically investing in improving public transportation for many years by increasing accessibility for people with limited mobility, modernizing city bus stops, replacing the bus fleet with eco-friendly vehicles, and introducing a city card for residents, which makes travel cheaper than the cost of a single ticket. With each passing year, there is a noticeable increase in the number of people using public transportation. The above actions will significantly improve the transportation situation in Rzeszów and make it even more accessible and environmentally friendly for residents.

Given the above barriers and challenges, the following possibilities have been identified for urban systems:

Development of new technologies and utilization of the potential of renewable energy sources, systematic development of PV installations and wind farms in order to create a locally sustainable energy area, understood as a limited area that, as a result of investments made, can balance its energy demand through production from sources located within this area. The process of creating such an area includes 5 main sectors: energy generation, energy transmission and distribution, energy storage, energy consumption, energy management.
Investments in public transportation, but also in alternative means of transportation, such as bicycles, electric scooters. Promoting alternative solutions to car transportation.
Use of digital technologies for monitoring emissions and managing them, for example by implementing smart energy management systems in buildings or traffic monitoring systems to reduce exhaust emissions.
Use of public-private partnerships as a financing and implementation formula for projects aimed at achieving climate neutrality.
Conducting systematic and multi-directional social campaigns and broad education to raise public awareness of the problem of climate change and encourage a change in lifestyle towards a more sustainable one, with particular emphasis on the needs of marginalized groups.
Creating attractive investment financing programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions - grants, tax incentives for entrepreneurs and residents.

The use of the above possibilities will certainly contribute to overcoming barriers and thus accelerating actions towards achieving climate neutrality.

To accelerate actions for a just energy transition, it is also necessary to make rational use of assets, resources, and processes owned or being implemented by the city. The key skills will be:

Transport infrastructure - investments in the development of transportation infrastructure, i.e. pedestrian paths, bicycle paths, public transportation with fleet powered by alternative energy sources, development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
Taking action to create a sustainable energy area and develop a city's energy security strategy.
Improving energy efficiency in public and residential buildings (deep thermal modernization, modernization of heating systems, renewable energy sources).
Sustainable spatial planning enables sustainable development, taking into account or even giving high priority to protection of nature and natural resources. Promoted must be ecological solutions, such as low- or zero-emission construction, clean transportation zones, creation of new and protection of existing green areas, etc.
Education, information, and social participation - combining educational and informational activities with social participation will raise residents' awareness of climate neutrality and engage them in the decision-making process regarding environmental protection. This will contribute to greater acceptance by residents of the actions that need to be taken to achieve climate neutrality.
Continuation and intensification of existing cooperation with business representatives and universities, achieving common ecological goals.

The involvement of all stakeholders is essential for conducting a fair climate transformation. However, in order to achieve mutual understanding and take into account different perspectives, the following are necessary:

1

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Dialogue and open communication: It is important to openly communicate with other stakeholders and listen to their opinions and experiences. Dialogue can help in understanding different perspectives and finding common ground.
System analysis (mapping): Conducting a systemic analysis can help identify dependencies and interactions between different elements of the system, which can lead to a better understanding of the whole.
Collaboration and cooperation: working with various stakeholders and involving them in the decision-making process can help to consider different perspectives and achieve consensus.
Developing empathy and empathetic listening: It is important to be ready to understand and empathize with the point of view of others, even if it differs from our own. Empathic listening can help build trust and mutual understanding. This is particularly important in the case of marginalized groups or those affected by energy poverty.
Education and awareness building: well-executed education, tailored to different groups, can help in understanding different perspectives and views, as well as building awareness of the complexity of systems.

The city is aware that the above elements are necessary for a fair transformation, especially with regard to residents - that is why the first citizens' panel was held in 2023, in which a representative group of residents was asked "How can Rzeszów achieve climate neutrality by 2030?". It was an excellent opportunity for educating residents, building awareness, dialogue, and open communication. The suggestions of the residents have influenced the document being developed and have been reflected in the planned actions to be implemented. Furthermore, MunicipalLab organizes many meetings, conferences, and debates in the urban space, also on the topics of ecology and climate transformation.

The city has established the Ecology and Social Affairs Team within the Economic Framework under the Mayor of the City of Rzeszów, in relation to the next very important group of stakeholders, namely entrepreneurs. The concept of the Contract and the significance of participation in the Mission have been repeatedly discussed in a broader forum of Rzeszów entrepreneurs, which also indirectly allowed for the development of this document thanks to cooperation and dialogue. A more detailed description and other examples of stakeholder engagement are described in the later in the document.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

The pathways to achieving climate neutrality in Rzeszów are based on previously identified systemic barriers. It should be remembered that the results of the GHG inventory for the area of the City of Rzeszów clearly indicate that the main sources of emissions in our city are stationary energy and transportation, which is why the main tasks are focused on the aforementioned areas.

# Key tasks faced by Rzeszow

The key actions and activities in Rzeszów will focus on eliminating all sources of solid fuels, significantly increasing the use of renewable energy sources, and implementing deep thermal modernization in residential (single and multi-family), commercial, industrial, and public utility buildings. It should be noted that energy efficiency is also an important element of sustainable resource utilization. The decarbonization of the district heating network in Rzeszów (which has a length of 241 km, of which 93 km are pipes in modern pre-insulated pipe technology) has a significant impact on reducing GHG emissions. Similarly - all tasks in the field of transportation, both investment and organizational measures have a high potential for GHG reduction. Scientific studies, including IPCC reports, clearly indicate that achieving climate neutrality requires taking intensified dual-track actions. On the one hand, actions towards decarbonization should be taken, on the other hand, actions towards preserving biodiversity should be taken. In Rzeszów, efforts are being made to intensify and continuously plan new investments aimed at increasing green spaces, which are crucial for achieving climate neutrality. The adaptive value of actions aimed at increasing green areas and developing blue-green infrastructure cannot be underestimated. Defined impact pathways for Rzeszów enable a systematic approach to planning, implementation, and evaluation of strategies, helping to identify key actions, potential barriers, and opportunities. Thanks to this, the goals related to climate protection and sustainable development of the city will be achieved more effectively.

# Significant system levers

To achieve climate neutrality by 2030, a wide range of systemic levers must be utilized. All levers will have significance for the respective areas of operation. However, the impact of each lever can vary significantly depending on the area of operation and will change with the changing conditions in the future. Identification and implementation of the appropriate intervention can cause significant and lasting changes in the system. These will be political, technological, social, economic actions, as well as partnerships and cooperation at various levels. The key element is a holistic approach that integrates various aspects and engages a wide range of stakeholders. This allows for effectively pursuing ambitious climate goals. The predicted direct effect of various levers is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which will lead to achieving climate neutrality. The indirect effects, on the other hand, mainly concern the improvement of quality of life, greater societal engagement and the undertaking of innovative initiatives, creation of new jobs, and many others.

# Paths of action for Rzeszów as key tasks on the road to transformation.

In relation to the identified systemic barriers, Rzeszów as a local government makes attempts to establish cooperation with higher-level authorities by participating in ministerial meetings. These discussions have the potential to develop national support for cities and adapt legal regulations to current needs. The same systemic barriers described in table B 1.2 will no longer be a blocking issue in the path towards decarbonizing the city, and they will become an area for work on their elimination. The authorities of the city of Rzeszów, by joining the Mission "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" have attempted to stand out among other Polish and foreign cities and position themselves as the initiators and organizers of the decarbonization process. In the process of developing the action plan, both internal and external stakeholders in the city are involved. The efforts made during its development, as well as those undertaken after its creation, are intended to lead to a better understanding of the significance of the climate crisis, the positive impact of the decarbonization process, and to raise awareness among decision-makers about the avoided costs and both direct and indirect benefits. Identifying barriers such as a lack of integrated approach between different sectors and institutions, silo mentality in management, a project-oriented approach rather than a process-oriented one, slowly to take deliberate steps to turn the situation in favor of the decarbonization process. Identified lack of appropriate structures for monitoring and evaluating actions, as well as staffing shortages and competency gaps can potentially be filled.

and the lack of current strategies that would result in greenhouse gas emission reduction goals will be replaced by a well-prepared plan.

Rzeszów organized its first citizens' panel, which revolved around the issues of decarbonization process in Our City in order to facilitate understanding of social climate and environmental challenges among its residents. This was one of the first meetings with the residents of Rzeszów addressing the issue of climate change. Meetings in this or any other format will also be planned in the future. Rzeszów, participating in the Mission of Cities, tries to talk about growing social and environmental problems, about the increasing pressure of climate challenges, in order to initiate a dialogue and invite residents to co-create solutions. By doing so, it replaces the lack of dialogue and inclusion of residents in decision-making processes with a stable agreement that combats resistance to change and fills gaps in knowledge.

The problem that Rzeszów must face is also the lack of data and tools necessary to undertake climate transformation on an urban scale - achieving energy efficiency, such as in the process of decarbonizing the district heating network. Rzeszów must address the high costs of acquiring them and develop and standardize methods for their acquisition, aggregation, utilization, verification, monitoring, and evaluation.

Rzeszów must also be prepared for independent situations that cause destabilization of availability, and prices, inflation growth, and similar events, such as a pandemic or the war in Ukraine. Such situations cannot lead to a lack of fluidity in operation and deviating from the set goals.

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

Residual emission strategy refers to compensating for approximately 20% of the city's baseline greenhouse gas emissions. Residual emissions are those greenhouse gas emissions that cannot be reduced through existing plans, strategies, policies, and planned tasks. These emissions come from various sources such as buildings, district heating, electricity, industry, transportation, waste management, and other areas of urban life.

To develop an effective residual emissions strategy, it is necessary to identify the sources of these unavoidable emissions and assess the feasibility of implementing emission reduction compensation measures.

In the planned strategy, key solutions are those that enable the capture and storage of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while ensuring long-term benefits from emissions reduction. Those solutions primarily involve significantly increasing natural absorbers, such as forests and wetlands, and in the future implementing permanent absorption methods, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Broad stakeholder partnership, particularly with the private sector, will be essential in this regard.

The main goal of the city of Rzeszów is to continuously increase green areas. In 2022, there were 234 hectares of green areas available to the residents in the city. By 2030, this area is expected to increase by approximately 204 hectares, so that according to the plans, by 2045, there will be approximately 894 hectares of green areas available to residents. The need for a significant increase in green areas is already addressed in the developed and being developed planning documents, such as the Study of Conditions and Directions for Spatial Development of the city of Rzeszów adopted on 26 September 2023 by the resolution of the Rzeszów City Council and the General Plan of the city of Rzeszów being developed. In those documents, green areas and their sustainable development are of paramount importance.

Investments in green infrastructure &amp; nature-based solutions, which, in addition to absorbing CO₂, have enormous adaptive significance, so crucial in a changing climate, will also be developed intensively and systematically. At the same time, existing greenery is continuously maintained due to its value.

In summary, the plan for dealing with residual emissions aims to achieve further reductions in emissions from the city area, while also considering the crucial importance of long-term carbon storage and the need for sustainable solutions to prevent climate change.

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

### C-1.1: Description or visualisation of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

Effective management structures and processes are crucial for overcoming barriers and harnessing opportunities on the path to climate neutrality. An integrated approach including planning, collaboration, stakeholder engagement, financial instruments, innovation, and strong regulatory frameworks can significantly increase the chances of achieving this ambitious goal by 2030. The complexity of the challenge of achieving climate neutrality by 2030 requires the city authorities of Rzeszów to take a series of actions. The most important of them is a change in the way the internal organization of the Rzeszów public administration is structured, by abandoning the traditional division of responsibilities and silo mentality in favor of efficient flow of information and collaboration.

### Internal organizational structure change

Taking the above into consideration, there has been a change in the internal organizational structure at the City Office of Rzeszów, and a unit has been separated within the structure of the Department of Climate and Environment (previously the Department of Environmental Protection and Agriculture), which prioritizes issues related to climate protection through, among other things, analyzing the city's state in terms of threats resulting from climate change and identifying the city's adaptive potential. As part of those activities, issues related to water management, biodiversity, environmental resource protection, air quality, etc. are being analyzed. The projects of local spatial development plans are also reviewed in the unit in terms of adaptation to climate change, and cooperation with the substantive unit is carried out in the preparation of projects financed from external sources on topics implemented by the newly created unit, thus implementing the idea of breaking down competency silos. One of the main goals of the newly established Department is to raise awareness among residents about climate change and, consequently, to plan and organize activities aimed at rationalizing energy consumption and promoting solutions that reduce its usage in the city. The competences of the Department also include collecting and gathering information on innovations, new technologies in the field of energy saving and environmental protection, as well as providing advice in this area, as well as creating energy-saving activities in municipal organizational units and promoting energy saving and renewable energy sources in the city, and implementing actions to reduce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions.

### Innovations in organization and management

Innovations in organization and management are a key element that will enable the Rzeszów city council to adapt to changing market conditions and improve operational efficiency.

New management models are being created, both internal - such as the establishment of the Climate Neutrality and Smart City Team in the city - and external - inviting independent entities to cooperate with local government.

This is an innovative work organization. The key to success seems to be managing and organizing work according to the logic of multilateral cooperation, with distributed leadership and multi-level management - aimed at overcoming identified barriers to achieving climate neutrality by 2030. Integrating actions for social responsibility that support sustainable development and benefit both the city of Rzeszów and local communities.

It is extremely important for achieving effectiveness in action and increasing the likelihood of achieving set goals that Rzeszów cooperates with national and foreign organizations promoting rational energy use and management, as well as participating in programs funded by European and national funds related to the scope of the department's activities.

In view of the above, Rzeszów participates in numerous initiatives and programs that can bring many developmental benefits, supporting sustainable economic, social, cultural, and ecological development. The key element of success is effective cooperation, knowledge exchange, and a shared pursuit of ambitious goals. An example of Rzeszów's commitment to identifying, developing, and creating a multi-level approach to stakeholder collaboration is its participation in the Capacities Project.

The project aims to initiate and strengthen national change processes to establish national networks and management structures and provide dedicated support to public authorities (at national, regional, and local levels) in creating conditions and means enabling cities to implement Climate-Neutral and Smart City Missions.

The fact that Rzeszów's character and the strong commitment of the City Authorities (especially the Mayor) to actions towards achieving climate neutrality remain significant, makes the decision-making process in Rzeszów in this regard incomparably shorter than in other cities, allowing for a quick response to changes.

# Rzeszów active at the local community level.

Appropriate management structures and processes are crucial for overcoming organizational, legislative, competency, social barriers, etc., and harnessing opportunities on the path to climate neutrality. An integrated approach including planning, collaboration, stakeholder engagement, financial instruments, innovation, and strong regulatory frameworks can significantly increase the chances of achieving this ambitious goal of climate neutrality by 2030, as all key issues are complex and have a high potential for impact. The integration of internal stakeholders at the local, regional, voivodeship, and national levels is extremely important in order to strengthen the network of mutual support and replicate good practices. It is also necessary to take action at the local community level.

It is worth noting that at the end of 2023, Rzeszów hosted its first Citizens' Panel. 60 randomly selected residents of Rzeszów, representing a "city in a nutshell" in terms of the diversity of its inhabitants, took part in it. For 5 days, participants collectively pondered the answer to the question: "How can Rzeszów achieve climate neutrality by 2030?"

The processes of cooperation with residents and the implementation of informational activities are carried out through the social media platform Facebook, where the page "Rzeszów-Klimat to My" has been created.

The website "ekoRzeszów" is also being prepared.

The Department of Climate and Environment, in cooperation with other stakeholders, engages in the organization of cultural events, such as "Reggae by the Wislok River. Playing for the Climate."

Additionally, every year the Mayor of the City of Rzeszów organizes visits to residential areas in Rzeszów, which aim to be closer to the residents, conversations, negotiations, and making joint decisions. During the meetings, he talks about changes in the city, new investments, improvements, and plans for the near future. He talks about urban priorities, about so-called contracts with residents. The meetings are also attended by directors of all departments of the City Office, chairpersons of neighborhood councils, and city councilors. During the meetings, officials are also on duty, providing information and accepting written applications from residents. This is an innovative form of management that significantly shortens the distance between residents and officials and allows for an increase in residents' trust in the Office.

The instrument newly established under the City Mayor is the Economic Council. This is an advisory body that can significantly support the development of the local economy. Table C-1.2 contains a detailed description of the role, functions, potential benefits, and opportunities provided by collaboration with the Economic Council. By providing valuable analysis, recommendations, and supporting investment and innovation initiatives, the Council can contribute to the dynamic and sustainable economic development of Rzeszów, raise the quality of life for its residents, and increase the city's attractiveness on both national and international levels.

# Rzeszów wants to be a Smart City.

Rzeszów, as one of the dynamically developing cities in Poland, has undertaken initiatives aimed at transforming it into a Smart City. This concept assumes the use of modern technologies to improve the quality of life for residents, increase the efficiency of city management, and promote sustainable development. The implementation of those solutions encounters certain systemic barriers, but at the same time opens up numerous opportunities for the city.

In Table C-1.2, some key aspects and initiatives that Rzeszów can implement or is already implementing as part of the transformation into a smart city are presented. The transformation of Rzeszów into a smart city is a complex process, but it brings numerous benefits for residents and the city administration. The key is to create a coherent strategy, efficient resource management, and educate and engage residents. Thanks to the appropriate approach and cooperation of various sectors, Rzeszów has a chance to become a modern, smart city of the future.

The "smart" energy management platform ROBOT (a solution based on direct observation and technology) is a solution that refers to advanced energy management systems that utilize modern technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, the Internet of Things (IoT), and automation to optimize energy consumption in various sectors. Implementation of such a system can bring many benefits for companies, public institutions, and entire communities. Energy management systems based on ROBOT technology offer a wide range of possibilities for optimizing energy consumption, reducing costs, and improving energy efficiency. The co-benefits of those systems include

C

financial, environmental, social, and technological benefits. Implementation of such systems can bring significant savings, improve the quality of life for users, and support sustainable development by reducing CO₂ emissions and promoting energy efficiency.

In terms of smart solutions, it is worth noting among urban innovations that Rzeszów has access to the Obliview application. This is a versatile analytical tool that supports the management and optimization of public space.

Partially, it can be used to manage the construction standards implemented in the city, described in more detail in table C-1.2, which are focused on energy efficiency, low emissions, and sustainable solutions crucial for creating more ecological and energy-efficient buildings. Implementing those standards and utilizing their capabilities contributes to the creation of more sustainable, energy-efficient, and healthy buildings, which benefits both users and the environment.

In order to coordinate all investments related to spatial development of the city and the implementation of energy-efficient solutions, cooperation with the City Municipal Planning and Architectural Commission may be crucial for the implementation of many investment projects, but it is associated with significant challenges. Systemic barriers such as complex administrative procedures, lack of transparency, conflicts of interest, complicated regulations, and lack of resources can hinder the process. Effective management of those challenges requires a strategic approach that includes early and regular consultations, thorough documentation preparation, proactive project management, relationship building, and the use of modern technologies.

## Thinking outside the box

Citizen engagement in climate action requires a multidimensional approach that combines education, participation, collaboration with NGOs and businesses, and supportive policies and regulations. The key is to build awareness, understanding, and a sense of responsibility and community in climate action in order to achieve lasting and effective results.

The above indicates that a complete change in city management system, going beyond established operating patterns, and promoting a shared commitment to achieving goals by changing the way public administration works in a way that engages stakeholders at different levels of influence is the only way to achieve climate neutrality, as well as the realization of other ambitious objectives.

## Responsibility for climate mitigation policy

The main responsibility for climate change mitigation policy and intersectoral coordination of the climate program and actions lies with the national government. In Poland, the key entity is the Ministry of Climate and Environment, which coordinates actions related to climate policy, collaborating with other ministries and local government units. Intersectoral coordination:

Climate Council - a ministerial working group on climate change adaptation - brings together representatives from various levels of government administration, as well as experts and representatives from the private sector. Their task is to coordinate climate policies and actions in various sectors of the economy.
Local and regional authorities - implementing climate policies also requires the involvement of local and regional authorities, which are often responsible for implementing specific projects within national climate strategies.
International cooperation - due to the global nature of climate change, national governments collaborate with international organizations such as the United Nations, the European Union, and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to coordinate actions at the international level.

## Involvement of relevant stakeholders

Engaging the relevant stakeholders and integrating systems related to emission sources are crucial for the effective implementation of climate policy. Some of the mechanisms that can support those processes:

Consultations and public forums:
social consultations conducted to obtain the opinions of citizens, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), companies, and other stakeholders on climate policies.
discussion forums and workshops: organizing them enables stakeholders to exchange ideas, information, and best practices.

Public-private partnerships (PPP):
cooperation with the private sector: creating partnerships with companies that can offer the technologies, innovations, and investments necessary for emission reduction.
demonstration projects: supporting pilot and demonstration projects that can showcase the effectiveness of new technologies and approaches.

Intersectoral cooperation platforms:
Intersectoral councils and commissions: the establishment of advisory bodies involving representatives from various sectors of the economy, non-governmental organizations, scientists, and government agencies.
research and innovation consortia: creating consortia that bring together the knowledge and resources of various stakeholders to develop new technological and operational solutions.

Financial instruments and incentives:
grants and subsidies: providing financial resources for projects related to emission reduction, energy efficiency, and renewable energy sources.
tax incentives and financial incentives: the use of tax incentives, tax credits, and other financial incentives for companies and individuals investing in green technologies.
market mechanisms: emissions trading systems (e.g. EU ETS) and offset programs that incentivize companies to reduce emissions through market mechanisms.

Monitoring, reporting, and verification systems:
mandatory reporting: requirement for companies and other entities to regularly report greenhouse gas emissions
standardized methodologies: the use of standard methods and tools for measuring and reporting emissions, which facilitates data comparison and progress assessment.
audit and verification: conducting independent audits and verifications of reported data to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

Education and informational campaigns:
educational programs: initiating educational programs for various stakeholder groups to raise their awareness of climate change and methods of emission reduction.
social campaigns: conducting informational campaigns aimed at society to promote sustainable behaviors and practices.

International cooperation:
participation in international agreements: active participation in international climate agreements and cooperation with other countries.
transfer of technology and knowledge: supporting the transfer of technology and knowledge from developed countries to developing countries, which can help in global emission reduction.

Local and regional initiatives:
local climate plans: accurate diagnosis and development and implementation of local and regional climate action plans that take into account the specific needs and capabilities of a given region.
"green budgeting": introducing green budgeting at the local and regional level to ensure that public expenditures support climate goals.

The above-mentioned mechanisms were used during the development of the Climate City Contract, in particular the tasks contained in this document. The strategic goals and individual activities were therefore developed through various consultations with a wide range of stakeholders, both owners of the task and its actors.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Participation of relevant stakeholder is crucial to supporting processes
Diagram 7. Stakeholder engagement

# Citizens' engagement

On the other hand, mechanisms for engaging citizens and building common understanding and support for the climate agenda and its additional benefits focus on:

Educational and informational campaigns: initiatives such as "Earth Day" and "Earth Hour" engage citizens and raise awareness about climate change and simple actions everyone can take; dedicated educational programs in schools (integrating climate and sustainability topics into curricula at all educational levels); online platforms and social media - using the internet and social media to disseminate information about climate change and promote positive actions.
Public consultations and social dialogue: open social consultations during which citizens can express their opinions on climate policies and proposed actions, e.g. consultations on local climate action plans; citizen dialogues - initiatives such as "Citizens' Climate Assemblies" engage randomly selected citizens in discussions on climate strategies, enabling them to co-create public policies.

In order to increase citizens' willingness to participate in decision-making processes and increase their involvement in the life of the city of Rzeszów, the position of Coordinator for Social Participation has been created, which can significantly increase the effectiveness of actions related to climate transformation, thanks to active involvement of residents, better communication, education and integration of local initiatives. The Coordinator for Social Participation will be responsible for monitoring the progress of climate actions and their impact on the local community. Regular assessment will allow for the modification of strategies and adjustment of actions to the real needs of residents, and systematic reporting of results and collecting feedback from residents will enable ongoing response to challenges and problems, which will increase the effectiveness of the conducted activities. The position is crucial and important in the situation of implementing recommendations in tasks after

a conducted citizens' panel, when it is necessary to coordinate and inform the panelists and the general public about the usefulness of the recommendations developed.

In November 2023, the first "Citizens' Panel" was conducted in Rzeszów, in which 60 randomly selected residents of Rzeszów, representing a "city in a nutshell" in terms of the diversity of its inhabitants, spent 5 days collectively pondering the answer to the question: "How can Rzeszów achieve climate neutrality by 2030?" The coordinating team of the Rzeszów Climate Panel summarized the course of the entire process and its most important effects in the report. Panelists selected from 10,000 households in Rzeszów listened to the positions of non-governmental organizations, expert presentations, and speeches from the City Office on the energy efficiency of buildings and the future of sustainable transportation. The recommendations that emerged during the initiative have been included in the Action Plan, hence the contribution of residents to the process of creating this document is significant, and selecting tasks with strong social support will guarantee their implementation.

Participation in local initiatives and projects: organizing volunteer programs related to environmental protection, such as tree planting, cleaning local green areas, or urban gardening projects; local social projects - initiatives such as urban community gardens, projects related to renewable energy sources in local communities, or shared solar installations can engage citizens in climate action.
Collaboration with non-governmental organizations (NGOs): partnerships with NGOs - non-governmental organizations often carry out campaigns, projects, and educational initiatives that support climate awareness building and mobilize society to take action; educational programs and workshops - NGOs organize workshops, trainings, and seminars for various social groups to increase knowledge about climate change and promote pro-environmental behaviors.
Participatory mechanisms and co-decision-making: participatory budget - citizens can directly decide on the allocation of part of the city budget to projects related to environmental protection and climate; platforms for submitting ideas and initiatives, where citizens can submit their ideas for pro-climate actions and vote on proposals from others.
Media campaigns and storytelling: success stories - presenting positive examples of climate actions and their benefits, both at an individual and community level, can inspire others to take similar actions; campaigns in traditional media - using television, radio, press, and advertisements to raise awareness about climate change and promote specific actions.
Business and corporate initiatives: sustainable development programs in companies - Companies can engage their employees and customers in pro-climate actions through internal sustainable development programs, green marketing, and CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility); green products and services - promoting products and services that are climate-friendly can raise consumer awareness and encourage them to make more sustainable choices.
Policies and regulations supporting citizen engagement: tax incentives, grants, and other financial incentives for citizens who invest in renewable technologies, energy-efficient solutions, or other environmentally friendly actions; municipal and regional programs - local authorities can create support programs for residents, such as subsidies for solar panel installations, support for sustainable transportation, or grants for green projects.

The city used the above-mentioned mechanisms to engage residents in the process of creating the Climate City Contract. The citizens' assembly was of particular value in developing the tasks presented in the Action Plan. It was an excellent opportunity for educating residents, building awareness, dialogue, and open communication. The suggestions of the residents have influenced the city's Climate Contract being developed and have been reflected in the planned actions to be implemented.

The citizens' panel clearly showed that the residents of Rzeszów are convinced about the need to take action for a just climate transformation is evident from the recommendation supported by  $92\%$  of the panel participants, which states: "the city recognizes the importance and urgency of energy transformation in budget planning, not avoiding large and challenging investments that bring savings in the longer term". Furthermore, residents want to actively co-create the development of the city in which they will live, because they feel responsible for it. The recommendations were officially accepted by the Mayor of the City of Rzeszów in the presence of the Minister for Civil Society Affairs and representatives of the residents, which further emphasized the role of the panel as an effective tool for influencing reality.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan Guidance

## C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

In Rzeszów, a series of actions have been implemented to support and promote social initiatives, social entrepreneurship, and social awareness. Below are presented the key social innovations:

### Urban Lab

Urban Lab is a space for experimenting with selected solutions for cooperation between city authorities, residents, companies, and scientific entities, aimed at improving the quality of life for residents through innovative solutions to identified problems (initiating, testing, implementing, and evaluating projects) and generating additional value using urban resources.

MunicipalLab conducts a wide range of activities as an “urban laboratory”, which is a space for discussions among residents, social organizations, representatives of higher education institutions, and businesses about the city's development directions.

Urban Lab's mission is based on 4 pillars:

collaboration with Partners to develop solutions for diagnosed urban problems,
sharing urban data on the website www.otwartedane.erzeszow.pl useful for all urban stakeholder groups, which can also be used to create innovative solutions and projects implemented by Urban Lab and its Partners,
running MunicipalCafe, which is a space for meetings and debates between city residents and their authorities, local government officials, scientists, and business representatives, where coffee is just a pretext for discussion,
activity of the Innovation Incubator, supporting the process of developing innovative projects submitted by residents.

### Rzeszów Climate Panel

The first Rzeszów Climate Panel took place in 2023 and was dedicated to climate change and the climate neutrality of the city. Sixty randomly selected residents of Rzeszów, representing a “city in a nutshell” in terms of the diversity of its inhabitants, spent 5 days collectively pondering the answer to the question: “How can Rzeszów achieve climate neutrality by 2030?”

Participants selected from 10,000 households in Rzeszów were educated by non-governmental organizations, experts, and City Office officials on the energy efficiency of buildings and the future of sustainable transportation. Empowered by scientific knowledge, they took a practical look at the city in three moments of the panel:

about the values that the city should follow when making any decisions regarding climate neutrality,
about the visions of city development in two areas of the panel in the long-term perspective,
about detailed recommendations that they have developed or modified themselves.

The actions of city authorities aiming for climate neutrality should, according to the panel, be based on expert knowledge, long-term, systemic, and resistant to politics, and should take into account the diverse situation of residents.

In the field of energy efficiency, the panel composition has chosen a vision of development that involves reducing energy demand - both in urban buildings and private homes. The city should conduct an information campaign to raise awareness among residents about the need to save and respect electrical and thermal energy, and to supplement shortages primarily from a decentralized network of citizen and renewable energy sources. In the vote on specific recommendations, the following three received the highest support from the panel in the housing sector:

the city is designing an energy storage system in Rzeszów (e.g. in distributed warehouses) – as part of the expansion of the urban infrastructure of Renewable Energy Sources - based on feasibility analysis and in cooperation with the world of science and business, and also planning a schedule for its implementation,
the city takes into account the importance and urgency of energy transformation in budget planning, not avoiding large and challenging investments that bring savings in the longer term,
the city establishes regular cooperation with technical universities in the field of innovative solutions that can be implemented in the city.

According to the panelists, in the area of sustainable transportation, the city should focus on a strong expansion of the zero-emission public transportation system. Ecological transportation, but also transportation accessible - through the synchronization of timetables and significant increase

in frequency of service, price reductions, passenger amenities and promotional campaigns, as well as restrictions on private car traffic in favor of promoting bicycle and walking. The most popular specific recommendations included the following three:

the city is building well-connected Park&amp;Ride parking lots on the outskirts and offering a favorable deal to drivers who use this solution, The construction of parking lots should be preceded by public consultations regarding their location and connectivity to the city center,
the city is installing secure bicycle racks at public transportation stops, especially in areas far from the city center,
the city supports the construction of bicycle parking lots at workplaces, schools, offices, housing communities, etc.,

# Green Fund for Rzeszów

The City Greenery Management Authority in Rzeszów, in cooperation with Urban Lab, is running a program called "Green Fund for Rzeszów", which is a response to grassroots initiatives of residents, donors, experts, socially responsible companies, and individuals interested in improving the space of the City of Rzeszów. The reported initiatives are implemented in areas maintained by the City Greenery Management Authority in Rzeszów.

A number of projects are being implemented, ranging from large investments such as planting in roadside strips or creating sensory gardens, to small projects that can be equivalent to flower meadows, plantings in flower beds, or trees.

Adding a small contribution in the form of a "donation" allows for financing a specific goal, such as planting trees, ornamental plants, building small architecture, or supporting wildlife-friendly spaces.

An example of grassroots initiatives carried out in Rzeszów was the collection of ideas for "Rzeszów To MY" conducted as part of the Urban Lab Rzeszów project. As part of the project, ideas from residents were implemented, such as: nest boxes for swifts and hedgehog houses, Bee Meadow, and a solar bench. Actions have also been carried out to integrate the school community with its surroundings, such as a community fruit and vegetable garden and an ecological mural.

"The Green Fund for Rzeszów" engages stakeholders in decision-making processes and provides the opportunity for financial support for specific projects. Thanks to the implementation of various ecological initiatives, this program plays a role in striving to reduce greenhouse gases by, among other things, increasing green infrastructure and promoting biodiversity. Promoting this initiative can contribute to long-term impact and an increased number of green investments.

# Citizens' budget

The participatory budget is a unique opportunity for real and direct co-decision-making on how a part of our city's budget will be spent. Since 2014, residents have continuously come up with and submitted projects every year, and then voted on which ones will be implemented. Many of the submitted and implemented projects concern green infrastructure. Through the implementation of the participatory budget, the City provides an opportunity for all residents to participate in decision-making.

# RzeszówToMy application

The RzeszowToMY mobile application combines an informational function, allowing you to familiarize yourself with news about Rzeszow and the events calendar, facilitating access to information about municipal education, social consultations, taxes, warnings, and road disruptions, as well as an intervention function. The application is integrated with an online resident account, which allows for remote handling of selected official matters. The Internet resident account is a collection of various local government services gathered in one place.

# Social Dialogue Commission for Tree Affairs

The Commission is an advisory body to the Mayor, it assesses the appropriateness of planned or proposed actions related to deforestation and issues opinions and recommendations in this regard. The commission consists of representatives of the City Office, municipal units, municipal companies,

capital of innovation
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
C

associations, and foundations - enabling collaboration between investors and representatives from both the local government and the community.

## Meetings of the Mayor with residents

The Mayor regularly meets with residents of housing estates in Rzeszów. Representatives from all departments, units, and companies of the Rzeszów City Office participate in the meetings. Each of them is connected with shifts, which are performed on site by representatives of individual departments of the Rzeszów City Office, municipal units and companies, as well as associations and organizations operating in the city and its surroundings. This allows for direct conversations with officials, handling many issues, and submitting documents on-site. Organizations collaborating with the city present their activities to the residents of Rzeszów and encourage cooperation.

Meetings are crucial for supporting participatory, transparent, and accountable local government. They help build trust, promote civic engagement, effectively solve local problems, and ensure inclusive and informed decision-making.

## Consultation walks with the Mayor of the City of Rzeszów

City consultation walks are held with the Mayor and representatives from the Rzeszów City Office, focusing on the topics of the walks discussions. Sample walks discussions: development of green areas, reduction of light pollution, removal of barriers for people with disabilities.

## Rzeszów Social Councils

The Rzeszów Councils perform an advisory and consultative function for the city authorities on matters concerning the socio-economic life of Rzeszów. Members of the Council represent public institutions, non-governmental organizations, universities, and business entities.

Rzeszów Social Councils:
Economic Council,
Women's Council,
Culture Council,
Senior Council,
Sports Council,
Strategic Group and Thematic Teams,
Youth Council,
Student Council,
Council of Public Benefit Activities.

## Program of cooperation of the city of Rzeszów with non-governmental organizations

The aim of the Cooperation Program is to build partnerships with non-governmental organizations in carrying out activities aimed at raising the quality of life of the residents of Rzeszów. Priority areas of cooperation in 2024 include: health care and promotion; activities for people with disabilities, activities for seniors, social assistance, including assistance to families and individuals in difficult life situations and equalizing opportunities for those families and individuals, supporting and promoting physical culture, culture, art, protection of cultural goods and national heritage; activities for the integration of foreigners.

Specific objectives of the Cooperation Program include:
creating conditions for strengthening existing non-governmental organizations, establishing new entities and citizen initiatives,
using the potential of non-governmental organizations as a complement to the City's activities in areas not covered by local government structures,
taking innovative and more effective actions for the benefit of the residents of the City,
strengthening the social awareness of responsibility for the local community and its tradition.

## ConnectedCity

This is one urban ecosystem where the collaboration between residents and technology allows the city to become a safe and friendly place to live. It is a platform that, on one hand, has

an informative character - for example, it indicates the locations of educational institutions, the location of fire department units, air sensor measurements, and the history of readings from other sensors. On the other hand, it has an intervention character - residents can report inconveniences or threats, such as damaged infrastructure or flooding, through the platform, to which the relevant Departments and units of the Office respond promptly.

The interventions presented above show that the city is constantly implementing social innovations. Special emphasis is placed on engaging residents. The implementation of the climate panel not only engaged residents in the decision-making process (the Mayor committed to implementing the recommendations), but also allowed for education and raising awareness of climate naturalness. The example of including city decisions in the process is also the Civic Budget, recent years show that residents often choose green projects. The Social Dialogue Commission for Tree Protection also gives residents the opportunity to influence administrative decisions regarding tree felling.

The city wants to know the needs of its residents, which is why meetings are held in neighborhoods and consultation walks. This is an opportunity to talk to residents about issues that directly concern them.

It is important for society to have easy access to information, undoubtedly the RzeszowToMy and ConnectedCity applications serve this purpose. Interactive Tree Canopy Map is being refined, which will provide information on how urban greenery is developing in the city. Engagement and cooperation with businesses and organizations are very important. Therefore, the Economic Council was established under the Mayor and the Cooperation Program with non-governmental organizations is developed every year. The Green Fund for Rzeszów, on the other hand, provides an opportunity to finance green initiatives.

Future projects will be more clearly and in details focused on climate neutrality, while future initiatives will be built on the foundation already established in previously implemented projects and draw inspiration from other cities. A wide range of stakeholders will be more closely involved in the process of co-creating the city. This is one of the key factors that can contribute to achieving climate neutrality in the city.

Residents and other stakeholders will be involved in every future iteration of the Action Plan, in order to collectively shape the future of the city and have a real impact on the quality of life.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

# Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iteration

Achieving climate neutrality in Rzeszów by 2030 is an extremely ambitious and very difficult task. It means a completely different organization and approach to planning and implementing tasks, as well as managing the city, than the ones previously used in local governments. It requires a vision and bold decisions of the Rzeszów city leadership, including innovative management models, as well as the important aspect of pioneering evolutionary processes, tests, pilots, without which the implementation, and ultimately achieving climate neutrality of the city of Rzeszów, will not be possible. Joining the EU Mission "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities", which requires the development and systematic - effective implementation of the Climate City Contract, is an expression of such a decision.

The Climate City Contract was developed primarily by the Climate Neutrality and Smart City Team established by the Mayor of Rzeszów by Order dated August 23, 2022. The team is interdisciplinary, consisting of individuals with various competencies from different departments, units, and municipal companies with different levels of responsibility. The intra-city team is also systematically enriched with external competencies (business, universities, NGOs). The main challenges for the Team in the near future will be: strengthening communication within and outside the Team, monitoring the implementation of actions indicated in the Climate City Contract and responding to ongoing changes, building the Team's competencies and collaborating with various stakeholders, including city residents, systematically strengthening the mandate for action and the role of the Team in the city.

# Planned actions within the iterative process.

Achieving climate neutrality goals requires not only project management but also reflective learning. Therefore, the Climate City Contract will be a "living" document that will continuously adapt to ongoing changes as needed. It will take the form of a strategic umbrella document, overarching other future documents in the field of environmental protection. Acquiring reliable data will be extremely important, as its analysis will enable making the right decisions and implementing actions with the highest possible efficiency. Therefore, the implementation of a platform automating data management, aggregation, analysis, monitoring, and reporting is planned.

As part of the iterative process of continuous improvement, the Climate City Contract will be reviewed within 2 years of its approval. It should be kept in mind that as a result of this process, many changes and improvements will be introduced - some of the planned tasks will be significantly detailed. The second iteration is planned for 2028, while in 2030 an analysis is scheduled to determine whether the contract's goals and assumptions have been met.

Various data necessary for assessing the implementation of the Climate City Contract will be collected from different sources in one place to facilitate their analysis. The data will be checked for accuracy and consistency. Any errors or inaccuracies will be addressed or corrected. The analysis of the acquired data will be conducted from both a quantitative perspective—statistical analysis to understand trends and patterns—and a qualitative perspective—evaluation of qualitative data, such as stakeholders' opinions gathered through interviews and surveys.

Regular reports on the progress of environmental actions will be produced based on the collected data, highlighting the results achieved in comparison to the set goals. The data will be visualized for easier presentation of the results. All the above-mentioned elements will enable the assessment of the effectiveness of planned actions and provide the opportunity to make modifications to the plan based on the results of the analysis in order to increase its effectiveness.

Furthermore, progress in achieving the goals of the Climate Contract will be verified through greenhouse gas inventories, which will annually monitor emission levels in Rzeszów. Based on it, it will be possible to assess at what stage of transformation the city is currently at and how much remains to be done. Additionally, in the near future, there are plans to expand greenhouse gas inventory from the Basic level to the Basic+ level. Planned inventory expansion will

capital of innovation
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
C

include the following sectors: Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) and Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) and additional greenhouse gases.

All stakeholders will be regularly informed about the progress and results of the environmental actions being carried out and will be invited to provide their feedback to ensure effective implementation of the actions.

Upon completion of the action cycle, a thorough analysis will be conducted to identify strengths and areas for improvement. In subsequent cycles, improvements derived from the analyses and monitoring conducted will be implemented.

Effective monitoring of progress will require a systematic approach and the involvement of all stakeholders, enabling the optimization of actions and the achievement of the intended environmental goals.

The decision regarding the acceptance of the document by a resolution of the Rzeszów City Council will be made at a later stage. If the decision is positive, the document will be widely consulted and undergo a formal procedure of social consultations. It will be presented to various stakeholder groups, and their comments will be collected in accordance with the requirements of the law. The conclusions drawn from this process will be reflected and mirrored in subsequent versions of the document.

In the next steps, social participation will also be developed - perceived as a process of building and strengthening the knowledge of society as a whole about actions planned and undertaken by local government. It gives local authorities a valuable opportunity to present and justify their actions and subject them to public discussion, in which all social groups can present their point of view. Thanks to this, it will be possible to introduce certain corrections, changes in proposed actions, which will make them better perceived by society and allow for a better way to achieve the set goals. The educational and informational aspect is also invaluable.

The goal for the near future is also to analyze the potential of obtaining energy from dry geothermal sources, in close cooperation with Municipal Companies, universities, and research institutes – the State Geological Institute as well as private investors.

The City authorities will also be looking for opportunities in the near future to implement installations that capture and permanently store carbon dioxide - in cooperation with companies that are the largest GHG emitters in the city.

# Introduction

# Vision for the City in 2030

The development of Rzeszów will proceed in accordance with the vision outlined in the "Development Strategy of the City of Rzeszów until 2025": Rzeszów – the growth hub of the Podkarpac region – is a city that is friendly to people, offering and expanding numerous metropolitan functions. It is a place where it's worth living, with a high quality of life and environment, as well as comprehensive economic, social, and cultural development.

The sectoral strategic goals for the development of the City of Rzeszów, which are based on the Vision and Mission for the Development of the City, include:

Smart City – creating favorable conditions for the development of Rzeszów as an attractive location for business activities, as well as for the advancement of education, higher education, science, and culture.

The development of economic activity will lead to the creation of new jobs, which in turn will increase employment levels and contribute to income growth. This, in turn, will improve the standard of living by providing better access to services, housing, and other goods. Investments in higher education, science, and education contribute to raise the overall level of knowledge and skills among residents. The development of the cultural sector enriches the social life of residents. An increased number of cultural events, festivals, art galleries, and theaters will offer more opportunities for recreation and personal development. Culture fosters community cohesion, strengthens local identity, and encourages active engagement in public life. Access to green spaces, bicycle paths, sports events, and cultural centers fosters an active and healthy lifestyle, which in turn contributes to improved health and well-being.

A socially cohesive and integrated city – improving both the living conditions of residents and public safety.

A socially cohesive and integrated city fosters an environment where residents can experience an improved quality of life through strong social bonds, a sense of security, equal opportunities, and active participation in community life. In integrated communities, individuals are more inclined to offer help and support to one another. Social cohesion promotes balanced development across different neighborhoods in the city, helping to prevent the marginalization of specific social groups. Social cohesion contributes to increased trust in public institutions such as local administration, healthcare, and education. Residents who feel heard and represented are more likely to cooperate with city authorities, leading to improved public services and more efficient city management.

Urban mobility and infrastructure – development and improvement of the functioning of the transportation and technical infrastructure system.

Systematic and well-planned development of technical infrastructure, including transportation, is essential for the city's growth and the quality of life for its residents.

Utilization of resources - protecting clean energy and rich heritage, while managing the values and resources of the natural and cultural environment.

The above has a multifaceted, positive impact on the quality of life for residents. It contributes to improving health, increase the city's attractiveness, preserving cultural identity, and promoting long-term sustainable development.

Achieving climate neutrality is one of the key and most ambitious goals, the realization of which will contribute to the city's development in line with the established vision.

City Goals: An Smart City and Socially Cohesive and Integrated Cities are fully coherent with the goals of the Mission, particularly in addressing social challenges and actively involving residents in this effort. Actions developed in collaboration with residents carry a strong social mandate, which can ensure their effective implementation.

# City's background in climate actions.

Climate scenarios for Poland indicate that the frequency of heatwaves currently experienced in Rzeszów is expected to increase in the coming decades. Forecasts indicate a tendency for their for duration to increase, leading to the emergence of drought. Just as severe in Rzeszów are the short but very intense rainfalls that cause flooding, which may lead to more significant floods in the future.

The climate changes occurring before our eyes are impacting urban ecosystems, placing plants under increased stress, particularly due to their urban environment, which makes them more vulnerable to

pests and diseases. Furthermore, warmer winters extend the growing season of plants, altering their growth cycles and thereby reducing their resistance. Climate warming is associated with an increase in insect populations and the number of fungi that can survive the winter, leading to a higher number of infection foci in the following season. The impact of climate change on the species composition and condition of urban forests is significant and will become increasingly evident.

Cities, which are, on the one hand, significant emitters of greenhouse gases, and on the other hand, the primary recipients of the negative effects of climate change, are key actors in the climate transformation process. The urgent necessity thus becomes the need for coordinated actions that, complementing and intersecting with each other, will guarantee a horizontal approach towards achieving neutrality and resilience in urban areas. For this reason, the activities undertaken will be implemented across various areas, including air quality, energy transformation, zero-emission transportation, waste and wastewater management, as well as green spaces and urban water retention.

Recognizing the need for urgent and immediate action towards achieving climate neutrality, the city of Rzeszów has joined the "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities" Mission and expressed its ambition to attain climate neutrality through a just, effective, and socially acceptable transformation. At the same time, it acknowledges the necessity of accelerating efforts to achieve climate neutrality and making it a priority in the city's policy in the City Municipality of Rzeszów.

Achieving climate neutrality will require a range of diverse actions that must be harmoniously combined and complementary to each other in order to maximize synergy in addressing the challenges posed by climate change. A joint effort and the engagement of stakeholders at various levels are crucial for achieving lasting and positive changes in both preventing the causes and adapting to the impacts of climate change. Effective management of air quality, energy transformation, transportation, as well as urban greenery and water retention, is a crucial element in creating a more sustainable and environmentally friendly city. However, it is important for the local community to also make responsible, eco-friendly choices. Responsible actions by residents, entrepreneurs, and local authorities are necessary to achieve positive outcomes for the environment and future generations. Regardless of the need for systemic changes, each of us can contribute to improving the quality of life in cities through informed decisions and changes in habits.

# Environmental policy of Rzeszów

Rzeszów implements an environmental policy through the following actions:

2016 - adoption of the "Development Strategy of the City of Rzeszów until 2025", which is a document defining the directions of the city's development. Sustainable development, prioritization of environmental protection issues, including mitigation and adaptation to climate change, promotion of low- and zero-emission economy, investment in research and innovation, and raising awareness of residents and ecological education can significantly contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and help achieve climate neutrality,
2017 - adoption of the "Low-Emission Economy Plan for the City of Rzeszów", which focuses on improving energy efficiency, increasing the use of renewable energy sources, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The essence of the Plan is to achieve economic, social, and environmental benefits resulting from actions reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
2019 - adoption of the "Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the City of Rzeszów until 2030", which sets out Rzeszów's policy on taking actions to prevent and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. The plan describes the most significant threats arising from climate change and the associated areas of risk for the City and its residents, and also indicates the directions of actions through which the City will protect itself from the negative effects of climate change phenomena.
2021 - adoption of the Environmental Protection Programme of the City of Rzeszów that aims to protect natural resources, preserve biodiversity, prevent pollution, promote sustainable development, and ensure a healthy environment for future generations, thus aligning with the goal of achieving climate neutrality. Work is currently underway on a new document for the years 2025-2029,

2021 - adoption of the “Sustainable Development Plan for Public Mass Transport for the years 2021-2030 with elements of electromobility development strategy for the city of Rzeszów and neighboring municipalities”, which defines sustainable public mass transportation not only for Rzeszów, but also for neighboring municipalities, thus contributing significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gases and being a key document in the context of the climate neutrality goal to be achieved in the coming years.
2022 - establishment of structures for managing the climate transformation process. The establishment of the Department of Climate and Environment, whose tasks include, among others, coordinating the city's climate policy, initiating actions and processes related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, and shaping the city's energy security policy.
2022 – The establishment of the Climate Neutrality and Smart City Team, whose primary goal was to initiate actions aimed at achieving climate neutrality for the city of Rzeszów by 2030, particularly within the framework of the “100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030” EU Mission.
2022 - application to the Pilot Cities Programme under the 100 EU Cities Mission, receiving a grant and joining the consortium of the “NEEST - Neutral and Environmentally Sustainable Municipal Areas” project.
2023 - updating by the Podkarpackie Voivodeship Assembly the document “Air Protection Programme for the Rzeszów city zone - due to the identified exceedance of the permissible level of suspended particulate matter PM10 and the permissible level of suspended particulate matter PM2.5, along with the expansion related to achieving the national goal of reducing exposure and taking into account the target level of benzo(a)pyrene and the Short-Term Action Plan”. It specifies the directions of corrective actions, the implementation of which is intended to improve air quality. Given that the source of these pollutants is the burning of fuels in the municipality and household sector for heating buildings or in vehicle engines, implementing measures to reduce these pollutants will align with efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the implementation of the Update of the Air Protection Program for the Rzeszów City Area aligns with the goal of climate neutrality.
2023 – conducting Rzeszów's first Citizens' Panel entitled “How Can Rzeszów Achieve Climate Neutrality by 2030?”,
2023 - adoption of the Study of Conditions and Directions for Spatial Development of the City of Rzeszów, which, due to changes in Polish law, will be transformed into a so-called master plan, but already at present, as a fundamental document shaping the spatial policy of the city, it plays a crucial role in the context of undertaking mitigation and adaptation actions.

# Documents outlining the climate policy of Rzeszów

At present, Rzeszów's climate policy is determined by two documents:

"Environmental Protection Programme of the City of Rzeszów"

The document sets forth the primary objective as "The development of the city of Rzeszów through continued efforts to improve the state of the environment, guided by the principle of sustainable development". It encompasses the analysis and evaluation of the environmental state within the city of Rzeszów, addressing intervention areas for which the following strategic objectives have been defined:

climate and air quality protection: improving air quality and effective energy management,
noise hazards: reducing the negative impact of noise on the residents of the city of Rzeszów and the natural environment,
water and wastewater management: modernization and development of water and wastewater infrastructure in the city of Rzeszów, as a part of efforts to improve the condition of groundwater and surface water,
waste management and waste prevention: implementing actions aimed at improving the waste management system,
natural resources: preserving the richness of nature and the landscape values of urban spaces.

"Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the City of Rzeszów until 2030"

The document was created in response to one of the most important environmental protection issues, which is climate change and the need to adapt to its effects. The plan outlines a vision, overarching goal, and specific objectives for adapting the city to climate change, which should be achieved through the implementation of selected adaptation actions in four of the city's most vulnerable sectors: public health/vulnerable groups, water management, transportation, and tourism, specifically in recreational areas. The adaptation plan aims to prepare the city for climate change, reduce its vulnerability to extreme events, and increase its capacity to manage the impacts of those events and their consequences.

The adaptation plan includes a diagnostic section that describes the climate phenomena and their impacts on the city, assesses the city's sensitivity to those phenomena, and evaluates the city's ability to independently manage the consequences of climate change. In response to the risks identified in the diagnostic section of the document, adaptive actions necessary to increase the city's resilience to current and future phenomena have been outlined.

The above documents do not clearly indicate the climate goal expressed as a % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the city area. This goal, however, was outlined in the Resolution of the Rzeszów City Council No. LXVIII/1502/2022 of October 25, 2022, regarding the achievement of climate neutrality by the city of Rzeszów by 2050. The resolution clearly indicates that the City Municipality of Rzeszów will strive to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 through a just, efficient, and socially acceptable transformation. Furthermore, it is deemed necessary to accelerate efforts to achieve climate neutrality and make it a priority in the city's policy in the City Municipality of Rzeszów.

Rzeszów's participation in the European Commission's "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" Mission is a crucial step towards achieving climate neutrality. The city's participation in such an ambitious Mission is seen as an opportunity to gain the following benefits:

sustainable development — by achieving an ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across all areas of the city's activities,
financing and support — through access to expert/technical and advisory support from the European Union level, as well as dedicated financing, which can accelerate the implementation of pro-ecological and innovative projects,
innovation and technology — through the implementation of smart solutions in the city's management process,
improvement of quality of life through the implementation of activities related to climate neutrality and smart city management, leading to better air quality, reduced noise, improved infrastructure, and more efficient management of urban resources, which directly improves the quality of life for residents,
strengthening the City's image: participation in a prestigious initiative helps build a positive image of Rzeszów as an innovative, eco-friendly city actively engaged in combating the climate crisis, which can attract investors, tourists, and new residents,

international cooperation: enabling the establishment of contacts and collaboration with other European cities, fostering the exchange of experiences, knowledge, and best practices in city management.

The key action is the development of the Urban Climate Contract, which, through the pathways included in it to achieve the planned - extremely ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  $80\%$  compared to the baseline year, will enable significant and necessary acceleration of actions indicated in strategic documents. The developed Urban Climate Contract will take the form of a strategic umbrella document, overarching other future documents in the field of environmental protection.

# Needs and engagement of residents

The city is aware that, to achieve climate neutrality, it must actively engage its citizens - therefore, the first citizens' panel took place in 2023, where a representative group of residents was asked "How can Rzeszów achieve climate neutrality by 2030?" It was an excellent opportunity for educating residents, building awareness, dialogue, and open communication. The suggestions of the residents have influenced the city's Climate Contract being developed and have been reflected in the planned actions to be implemented.

Sixty randomly selected residents of Rzeszów, representing a "city in a nutshell" in terms of the diversity of its inhabitants, spent 5 days collectively pondering the answer to the abovementioned question. Participants selected from 10,000 households in Rzeszów were educated by non-governmental organizations, experts, and City Office officials on the energy efficiency of buildings and the future of sustainable transportation. Empowered by scientific knowledge, they took a practical look at the city in three moments of the panel:

about the values that the city should follow when making any decisions regarding climate neutrality,
about the visions of city development in two areas of the panel in the long-term perspective,
about detailed recommendations that they have developed or modified themselves.

The actions of city authorities aiming for climate neutrality should, according to the panel participants, be based on expert knowledge, long-term, systemic, and resistant to politics, and should take into account the diverse situation of residents.

The citizens' panel clearly showed that the residents of Rzeszów are convinced about the need to take action for a just climate transformation is evident from the recommendation supported by  $92\%$  of the panel participants, which states: "the city recognizes the importance and urgency of energy transformation in budget planning, not avoiding large and challenging investments that bring savings in the longer term". Furthermore, residents want to actively co-create the development of the city in which they will live, because they feel responsible for it. The recommendations were officially accepted by the Mayor of the City of Rzeszów in the presence of the Minister for Civil Society Affairs and representatives of the residents, which further emphasized the role of the panel as an effective tool for influencing reality.

The residents emphasized the importance of systematic education in the field of climate neutrality, which is why the developed Action Plan includes, in addition to investment tasks directly affecting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, a wide range of educational activities.

To continue the successful and effective collaboration with residents, the well-known space Urban Lab will be used. It hosts numerous meetings, conferences, and debates, including those on ecology and climate transformation.

The Consultation and Information Point "Clean Air", operated by the Department of Climate and Environment of the Rzeszów City Office, is also an excellent form of interaction with residents. Here, residents receive assistance in completing the necessary documentation to obtain financing for thermal modernization and replacement of heat sources, as well as information on applicable laws, solutions, and possibilities for modernizing their buildings.

Such a form of running the point and direct contact with residents inspires trust and shortens the distance between the resident and the official. Numerous consultations conducted within the Point allowed for the acquisition of knowledge regarding individual residents' needs, which was used in designing tasks in the Action Plan.

Recognizing the benefits of the above solution, in the near future residents will have access to energy advisors who will support them in a comprehensive way in planned activities.

# Stakeholder engagement (business, universities, NGOs, institutions)

The Climate Contract for the city has strong support from various stakeholder groups. In the first stage of document creation, data was gathered on ongoing and planned climate-positive actions from internal stakeholders (departments, city units) and external stakeholders (municipal companies).

The next stages of creating the document and the pathways to achieving climate neutrality included in it were discussed during numerous meetings of the Climate Neutrality and Smart City Team, together with invited external stakeholders. Furthermore, the City's participation in the Mission and its goals, as well as the need for climate transformation, were presented to business representatives and universities during meetings of the Economic Council under the Mayor's office. During the meetings, business and science representatives proposed their solution for achieving climate neutrality. These proposals have been included in the Action Plan. Entrepreneurs recognize the urgent need to take action for a just climate transformation and are aware that local government alone cannot achieve this goal, which is why they declare close cooperation in this area. Representatives of universities express their willingness to cooperate with the Rzeszów local government in order to protect the climate and the environment, as well as promote sustainable development, while also indicating the areas in which they will actively work to achieve this goal.

The list of signatories supporting the city's actions is a result of strong stakeholder engagement in the process of creating and implementing the Climate Contract.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

## Goal

Rzeszów has declared its commitment to achieve climate neutrality no later than 2050, and this is a priority expressed in the Resolution of the Rzeszów City Council No. LXVIII/1502/2022 dated 25 October 2022. However, considering the enormous impact of climate change on the environment, especially how strongly the effects of climate change are felt in cities, it has been deemed necessary to accelerate actions towards achieving climate neutrality and make them a priority of the municipal policy in the City Municipality of Rzeszów. In view of the above, by joining the City Mission, Rzeszów has taken on the challenge of achieving the goal of climate neutrality by 2030, which means reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% compared to 2022. The above goal covers the entire administrative territory of the City Municipality of Rzeszów and is fully consistent with the goal of the City's Mission. Objects covered by the emissions trading system are excluded for reduction purposes. The total reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will be 80.06%. Achieving the above goal will be possible thanks to planned actions that allow for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner:

Stationary energy - 81.06% of the reduction in this area (839,717 tCO₂e),
Transport - 80.05% of the reduction in this area (275,694 tCO₂e),
Waste - 14.33% of the reduction in this area (2114 tCO₂e).

It should be noted that the Stationary Energy and Transport sectors are the areas with the highest greenhouse gas emissions.

Additional benefits associated with taking action to achieve climate neutrality:

ensuring the energy security of Rzeszów by becoming independent from fossil fuels and diversifying energy sources,
reducing the operating costs of the city by increasing energy efficiency and the number of its own diversified energy sources,
reducing energy costs for residents through increased energy efficiency and the development of a prosumer energy generation model,
raising ecological awareness and engaging residents in climate transformation and actions for the city, building co-responsibility for the city,
improvement in the quality of life and health of residents resulting from the reduction of air pollution and the decrease in environmental pollution levels caused by noise and light; improvement in the well-being of residents (both physical and mental), reduction in healthcare costs,
improvement of the quality and aesthetics of urban space and increasing its attractiveness,
optimizing space utilization through sustainable design,

new business models enabling the acquisition of investors with private capital,
educated staff with desired competencies in the Office.

# 3 Strategic priorities

## Strategic priorities

Strategic priorities were established based on the results of greenhouse gas inventory for Rzeszów, taking into account the results of an economic model - a tool supporting climate transformation planning based on existing data and assumptions.

## Main sources of emissions

The conducted inventory clearly indicates the main sources of emissions for Rzeszów. The total amount of inventoried greenhouse gas emissions in carbon dioxide equivalent from the area of the City Municipality of Rzeszów in 2022 amounted to 1,395,839 tCO₂e. The sector with the largest share of carbon dioxide emissions in the city was the Stationary Energy sector - 74% of the total balance, followed by the Transport sector - 25% of the total carbon dioxide emissions balance. The Waste sector was responsible for approximately 1% of total emissions.

In light of the above, the strategic and systemic priorities for Rzeszów to achieve its reduction target by 2030 are:

## I. Generating electricity from renewable sources within and beyond the city's boundaries.

The key issue in achieving climate neutrality is the development of the city towards an energy-sustainable area, i.e. one that is able to balance its energy demand through production from sources located within this area. An ambitious plan is being developed for the Rzeszów area to balance the demand for electrical and thermal energy used by buildings and structures, as well as to replace fossil fuel consumption in the transportation sector with energy sourced entirely from renewable sources. Strategic partnership with the energy sector (energy distributors and producers) will be necessary in implementing the strategy for achieving climate neutrality, in areas such as: increasing the production of energy from non-fossil sources (e.g. biogas), modernization of energy networks enabling optimal utilization of energy produced by prosumers, utilization of waste energy, energy storage, increasing the supply of certified green energy, searching for new energy supply sources (hydrogen energy, modular SMR reactors, geothermal energy). The involvement of private capital will also be crucial -
rzeszów capital of innovation

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

#

discussions are currently underway with developers of clean energy solutions who have the technical/technological and financial potential to implement the planned activities.

The key stakeholders in implementing this priority are:

State energy companies - energy producers, due to the fact that the pace of decarbonization of power plants supplying the city with energy depends on the pace of decarbonization of the entire city,
Energy distributors - continuous and consistent efforts are necessary to modernize and increase the efficiency of the network, also to unlock the potential of RES,
The government of the Republic of Poland and relevant ministries - the main shareholder in energy companies is the government of the Republic of Poland, which has an influence on their policies, as well as on the national decarbonization policy. Furthermore, legislative initiatives are needed to support the development of RES and the prosumer energy market, such as more favorable settlements with prosumers for the electricity they feed into the network, or regulations allowing for the establishment of energy cooperatives in cities,
Entrepreneurs - obtaining private capital for the implementation of highly capital-intensive activities will guarantee their implementation,
Neighboring local governments (municipalities) - in order to implement ambitious investments (e.g. new RES installations), it will be necessary to acquire land beyond the administrative boundaries of Rzeszów.

The priority in question is characterized by a very high level of ambition, which makes it very complicated. Given the numerous factors that need to be considered throughout the long-term process of creating and building an energy self-sufficient area, from 2024 to 2030 (and beyond), the following steps have been proposed: identifying needs and development plans, preparing a detailed consumption profile, developing investment options to meet current and future demand, formulating a development plan with a detailed schedule, commencing work and obtaining the necessary implementation permits, carrying out construction according to the approved schedule, and integrating the components of the sustainable development area with system management.

## II. Reducing the demand for thermal and electrical energy from fossil sources.

The priority in question will be implemented mainly through increasing the energy efficiency of buildings. It primarily involves the thermal modernization of municipal residential and commercial buildings, as well as the thermal modernization of private buildings, cooperative housing, and those owned by companies and institutions not related to local government. Rzeszów will focus on carrying out modernization of its own buildings in the next 3-5 years, in order to increase their energy efficiency, as well as on creating incentives and support systems for private building owners to undertake such actions.

Currently, as part of preparatory projects involving the preparation of analyses, building selection, and development of modernization models (e.g. NEEST project), the city is preparing to increase the scale of thermal modernization activities for urban buildings.

The implementation of the priority will also include the implementation of a free energy advisory system for residents in the coming months, covering technical issues and the use of municipal, regional, and national financing programmes.

The key stakeholders in implementing this priority are:

The Polish government, the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, and other operators of financing programmes - deep thermal modernization of buildings is associated with enormous costs (for own investments or financial support for residents), hence the key role here is to ensure adequate financing for local governments from external sources,
The science sector - reducing the demand for primary energy requires continuous search and implementation of innovative solutions in the form of: methods of reducing consumption, energy recovery methods, ways of utilizing waste energy, efficient energy storage,
Municipal companies and production, commercial, and service companies - those are entities that consume a large amount of energy and have a significant potential for reducing consumption and utilizing waste energy,
Construction companies, renovation companies, as well as housing cooperatives and housing communities - entities operating in the construction industry and entities managing buildings have a huge impact on the development and implementation of new energy standards in new and renovated buildings. Without their commitment, it will be difficult to carry out effective actions in this area,

C

Residents, especially in the area of ensuring fair energy transition and protecting vulnerable groups, such as those at risk of energy poverty.

## III. Increasing the level of electrification of public transportation and reducing the scale of individual car transportation.

Transport is the second, after stationary energy, source of greenhouse gas emissions in Rzeszów - accounting for 25% of all emissions and a very serious source of air pollution. These emissions are mainly caused by road transportation, with the largest share being individual car transportation. Therefore, the key actions of the discussed priority focus on the development of low-emission alternative ways of getting around the city, which will become an attractive (comfortable, accessible, safe) alternative for a large number of people who currently use individual car transportation in the city.

Rzeszów systematically increases the level of electrification of public transportation and takes actions to make public transportation the preferred solution for residents, not only of the city but also of the neighboring municipalities. This integrated approach will enable us to achieve the goal of significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution from this area. Currently, the plan includes the purchase of zero-emission buses along with the necessary charging infrastructure (20 units of 12-meter buses powered by electricity from hydrogen fuel cells). Buses will be adapted to the needs of people with limited mobility and parents/guardians with children, ensuring a comfortable and safe trip. The activities will also include the preparation of appropriate infrastructure - bus shelters and pylons with timetables - selected objects will be green and equipped with energy-saving LED lighting powered by PV energy, and integral elements of the shelters will be planters allowing for planting various types of climbers and grasses.

The next element aimed at reducing emissions from individual car transportation will be the development of electromobility through investment, together with private partners, in appropriate infrastructure: expanding the network of electric vehicle charging stations, parking spaces for electric vehicles, preferences for moving around urban roads (access to bus lanes). Car-sharing and other forms of vehicle sharing (such as electric bicycles, scooters, and mopeds) will also be promoted.

The key stakeholders in implementing this priority are:

The Polish government, the National Fund for Environmental Protection, and other operators of financing programmes - investments in public transportation are costly, so ensuring adequate financing for local governments from external sources plays a crucial role here. However, the development of electromobility requires support through, for example, appropriate tax incentives or subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles,
Companies - operators of vehicle charging stations, which allow for the expansion and maintenance of the necessary infrastructure to encourage the purchase and use of electric vehicles,
Municipal companies - responsible for the development of pedestrian and cycling infrastructure as well as public transportation networks,
Residents - issues related to restricting car traffic and changing transportation habits are socially sensitive topics, therefore residents of the areas affected by the changes will be, each time, included in the consultation process for specific solutions.

## IV. Development of blue-green infrastructure

According to data from the Statistical Office, Rzeszów clearly surpasses other voivodeship cities in terms of the total area of greenery per capita. It also ranks first in terms of the share of green areas in the city's total area. The city is investing heavily in new greenery and the protection of existing greenery. Maintenance and development of blue-green infrastructure are crucial both in terms of carbon dioxide sequestration and adaptive actions that increase the city's resilience to the effects of climate change and improve residents' access to recreational areas. The activities planned to be implemented under the discussed priority will focus on:

the constant and systematic development of green areas within the city,
de-paving of concrete surfaces, including parking lots,
application of solutions for retaining a portion of stormwater on new development sites,
planting trees and trellises with climbers on heavily sealed streets,
developing or modifying spatial development plans and other planning documents to increase public spaces with new green areas, blue-green infrastructure solutions, and de-paving of high-density urban areas,

broad education in the field of protection of nature and the natural environment; promotion/information about the undertaken and planned actions in the city regarding urban greenery.

The key stakeholders in implementing this priority are:
City Greenery Management Board in Rzeszów - in terms of investments in blue-green infrastructure on the areas under its jurisdiction and in terms of establishing and enforcing green management standards, as well as other municipal units and companies on the areas owned by them (or under their management),
Housing cooperatives, building and land administrators, housing communities,
Companies and institutions,
Higher education institutions and scientific institutions in the field of searching for new solutions regarding the development of blue-green infrastructure,
Residents, both in the context of consulting on the method of land development and in the context of promoting the introduction of solutions on land belonging to residents.

The city of Rzeszów considers the EU mission “100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030” and participation in the mission as a very important element of climate policy.

## Principles guiding the implementation of the Municipal Climate Contract:

integrated approach - taking into account all aspects influencing the goals indicated in the document and multi-level coordination between different sectors and levels of administration,
scientific foundations - basing decisions and actions on the latest scientific research and evidence, and close collaboration with experts and research institutions,
social participation - engaging society in the process of planning and implementation with simultaneous education and information on the importance of the Climate Contract,
transparency and fairness - full transparency in actions taken, maintaining open and transparent communication with all stakeholders, considering the impact of actions on different social groups, especially the most vulnerable; fair distribution of costs and benefits associated with actions taken,
risk management - ongoing identification of potential risks and implementation of strategies to minimize them,
monitoring and evaluation - monitoring progress of implementation based on established indicators, regular reporting of results and making necessary adjustments, clear mechanisms for accountability for actions taken and results achieved.

## Management structure of the City Climate Contract

The Urban Climate Contract, developed as part of the Urban Climate Contract Mission, is the first step towards synchronizing and optimizing all urban actions that fully or partially address the goal of the Municipal Mission. The Climate Neutrality and Smart City Team will be responsible for managing the Climate Contract of the city, which will synchronize various activities that have been carried out separately by departments, units, or municipal companies. The team will collaborate in this area with all stakeholders, including city residents.

In the implementation process of the Municipal Climate Contract, we will base on previous good experiences and practices, enriching them with the experiences and knowledge gained during the implementation of actions: from our project partners, advisors, other cities, stakeholders, etc.

The priority is also the systematic involvement of new stakeholder groups, including residents, in the entire process - greater agency and co-responsibility for its appearance and functioning mean that City Managers have a stronger mandate to implement investments and actions developed jointly with residents.

## Planned actions within the iterative process.

Achieving climate neutrality goals requires not only project management but also reflective learning. Therefore, the Climate City Contract will be a “living” document that will continuously adapt to ongoing changes as needed. It will take the form of a strategic umbrella document, overarching other future

documents in the field of environmental protection. Acquiring reliable data will be extremely important, as its analysis will enable making the right decisions and implementing actions with the highest possible efficiency. Therefore, the implementation of a platform automating data management, aggregation, analysis, monitoring, and reporting is planned.

As part of the iterative process of continuous improvement, the Climate City Contract will be reviewed within 2 years of its approval. It should be kept in mind that as a result of this process, many changes and improvements will be introduced - some of the planned tasks will be significantly detailed. The second iteration is planned for 2028, while in 2030 an analysis is scheduled to determine whether the contract's goals and assumptions have been met.

Various data necessary for assessing the implementation of the Climate City Contract will be collected from different sources in one place to facilitate their analysis. The data will be checked for accuracy and consistency. Any errors or inaccuracies will be addressed or corrected. The analysis of the acquired data will be conducted from both a quantitative perspective—statistical analysis to understand trends and patterns—and a qualitative perspective—evaluation of qualitative data, such as stakeholders' opinions gathered through interviews and surveys.

Regular reports on the progress of environmental actions will be produced based on the collected data, highlighting the results achieved in comparison to the set goals. The data will be visualized for easier presentation of the results. All the above-mentioned elements will enable the assessment of the effectiveness of planned actions and provide the opportunity to make modifications to the plan based on the results of the analysis in order to increase its effectiveness.

Furthermore, progress in achieving the goals of the Climate Contract will be verified through greenhouse gas inventories, which will annually monitor emission levels in Rzeszów. Based on it, it will be possible to assess at what stage of transformation the city is currently at and how much remains to be done. Additionally, in the near future, there are plans to expand greenhouse gas inventory from the Basic level to the Basic+ level. Planned inventory expansion will include the following sectors: Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) and Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) and additional greenhouse gases.

All stakeholders will be regularly informed about the progress and results of the environmental actions being carried out and will be invited to provide their feedback to ensure effective implementation of the actions.

Upon completion of the action cycle, a thorough analysis will be conducted to identify strengths and areas for improvement. In subsequent cycles, improvements derived from the analyses and monitoring conducted will be implemented.

Effective monitoring of progress will require a systematic approach and the involvement of all stakeholders, enabling the optimization of actions and the achievement of the intended environmental goals.

The decision regarding the acceptance of the document by a resolution of the Rzeszów City Council will be made at a later stage. If the decision is positive, the document will be widely consulted and undergo a formal procedure of social consultations. It will be presented to various stakeholder groups, and their comments will be collected in accordance with the requirements of the law. The conclusions drawn from this process will be reflected and mirrored in subsequent versions of the document.

Mr.
Konrad Fijotek
Mayor of the City of Rzeszów

Dear Mayor of the City of Rzeszów,

This is the letter of appreciation for the City of Rzeszów for undertaking efforts to develop the Climate City Contract.

The Ministry of Climate and Environment recognizes the urgent need for actions to be taken to achieve climate neutrality, mitigate the effects of climate change, and accelerate the efforts towards a sustainable future of cities. Therefore, we support the initiative of the City of Rzeszów, which aims to develop and implement the Climate City Contract.

The aforementioned Climate City Contract of the City of Rzeszów is closely related to national actions undertaken to implement international climate commitments. We strongly believe that we can accelerate progress on our common goals and create significant changes at the local and national level by supporting and participating in these commitments.

The Ministry of Climate and Environment coordinates the implementation of the National Energy and Climate Plan until 2030. The National Plan is a strategic document developed by the Member States of the European Union, in which they define the goals and means for achieving the so-called EU climate and energy targets. In particular, this concerns the aim of climate neutrality in 2050. The plan includes strategies for: reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the contribution of energy from renewable sources, improving energy efficiency and other actions aimed at limiting the impact of human activity on climate change.

The National Energy and Climate Plan until 2030 presents objectives and targets as well as policies and actions in 5 fields of the energy union, i.e.: energy security, internal energy market, energy efficiency, decarbonisation and research, innovation, and competitiveness. The Ministry of Climate and Environment approves all actions of the City of Rzeszów defined in the Climate City Contract that will contribute to these goals.

In addition, the Ministry of Climate and Environment expresses its willingness to jointly overcome challenges and conduct a permanent dialogue in order to systematically increase climate resilience of the cities and help them to achieve climate neutrality. The Ministry of Climate and Environment will also make efforts to build a cooperation platform involving other ministries, using the previous experience of the Ministry and local governments participating in the Mission of 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030.

Your sincerely

Paulina Hennig-Kloska
