# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses, and other stakeholders.

The Municipality of Thessaloniki recognises the global challenges and the role of cities to act proactively to mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis and implement strong approaches to address current and future challenges.

The city's main challenge is to rapidly adapt sustainable systemic changes including redesigning and delivering urban infrastructures and services that enhance citizen's participation, connectivity and community, shape a thriving and sustainable city, build a dynamic urban economy, become responsive and support climate resilience and disaster management. Tremendous opportunities for the city to be improved, advanced, and maintain its contribution to the goals of sustainable development lie also in the utilization of big data computing and the underpinning technologies, and in the implementation of their novel applications.

The Municipality of Thessaloniki was selected to join the European Commission's Mission for 100 climate neutral and smart cities by 2030, after an intensive process led by independent experts from the European Commission and among 377 European cities that expressed interest. Thessaloniki in 2030 aims to have become a climate neutral, smart, sustainable, resilient and attractive city with positive benefits for public health, accessibility and well-being of citizens. This requires, on the one hand, robust policies and investing in ambitious actions, concerning public space, processes and resources that are within its sphere of competence and go beyond existing plans and strategies and, on the other hand, mobilizing and involving relevant stakeholders, institutions and businesses to achieve targets in various sectors that are higher than the corresponding national targets.

Thessaloniki's pathways towards climate neutrality cross various sectors for which the Municipality of Thessaloniki has a specific vision with specific measurable targets been set. The sectors chosen for Thessaloniki are Electricity, Buildings and Heating, Transport &amp; Logistics, Water &amp; Waste management, Land Use and Green Infrastructure, as well as the one related to Smart Cities and Governance, which contribute reaching climate neutrality horizontally.

The objective of the Action Plan is the overall reduction of emissions from all the aforementioned sectors in 2030 at a level of 80% (taking into account 20% of residual emissions). Regarding residual emissions, the Municipality of Thessaloniki includes in the plan an integrated strategy in cooperation with stakeholders and plans/ implements mitigation actions, such as small-scale biogas energy production, carbon capture agriculture, as well as nature-based actions, such as the densification of urban green areas and the development of new urban areas.

Reaching the goal of climate neutrality requires, apart from finding financial programmes and tools, the creation of a Transition team to orchestrate the process of collaboration and coordination actions of multiple actors across sectors. Besides, the goal of transition to climate neutrality by 2030 does not consist only the vision of the Municipality but is the output of co-creation and cooperation between all stakeholders of the quadruple helix model (Public, Private, Research Community and Citizens) in planning and decision-making. Particular attention must be paid to interacting with civil society and consulting with them, so that the actions implemented have the maximum possible acceptance, thus multiplying their impact and making society itself the agent of this transition. It is also proposed that an open forum for dialogue be set up to involve citizens in the decision-making process and monitor progress in implementing the actions.

At the same time, the Municipality of Thessaloniki plans to approach the Central Government in a targeted manner and together with the other five Greek cities participating in the above mentioned mission of the European Commission (Athens, Kozani, Trikala, Ioannina, Kalamata).

Finally, the Municipality of Thessaloniki is expected to work with large private organizations that will

act as "Climate Neutrality Ambassadors", in order to commit to implementing climate neutrality actions. These actions will involve both de-carbonisation of their operations and "green" donations for the wider benefit of the local community.

According to calculations and estimations derived from the "economic model" (methodology proposed by the EIT Climate KIC and adopted for the calculations carried out in the framework of Action Plan &amp;Investment Plan establishment for the Municipality of Thessaloniki), in the year 2030, under "business as usual" conditions, i.e. without the implementation of targeted projects and actions for the climate neutrality transition, i.e. without the implementation of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, the emissions within the Municipality of Thessaloniki borders are estimated at 2.84 tons of CO2 equivalent per capita. More specifically, emissions from the electricity and heating sectors of the building stock will be at high levels, with rates of 47% and 26% respectively, which ranks them as the two most important sectors that can be improved in terms of energy savings and emissions reduction, by planning and addressing appropriate efficient actions. The transport and logistics sector contributes about a quarter of total emissions (23%), while the waste management sector also contributes 4%.

The recognition of the contribution of the sectors to energy consumption and environmental burden also shapes the Municipality's strategy, which prioritises a series of actions to address pollutant emissions and consequently climate change, aiming at climate neutrality by 2030. Emblematic Interventions for the creation of climate-neutral areas focusing on sustainable mobility, electromobility, addressing climate change impacts and energy efficiency in buildings are listed within the Action Plan.

The electrification of the energy system (and, in this regard, the implementation of actions related to e.g., electric cars, installation of heat pumps, etc.) requires the de-carbonisation of the electricity grid. To achieve this, the following are required: a) a significant increase in the share of RES for electricity generation (&gt;80% of electricity will come from RES, in line with national energy targets) and b) enhancing the flexibility of the grid. In this direction, it is foreseen to increase local/distributed RES electricity generation with parallel technical interventions to upgrade the electricity grid, in cooperation with local, regional and national relevant actors, in particular electricity providers and distributors. These measures contribute to upgrade the municipality energy security, by reducing its exposure to external energy inputs. In addition, it is necessary to develop actions aiming at significant increase of distributed photovoltaic systems in common/public spaces. These actions aim to increase the self-consumption from RES within the municipality, to further enhance the sustainability of the energy mix and act as complementary means of raising awareness and mobilising citizens (e.g., dissemination and adoption of good practices), particularly if the benefits of installing such systems are sufficiently communicated to citizens and civil society.

The Municipality of Thessaloniki understands and recognises the need to address energy poverty, so that the energy transition is implemented in a socially just and acceptable way. Priority will be given to serving energy vulnerable households, with the ultimate aim of reducing energy poverty within the Municipality.

As far as buildings and heating are concerned, extensive technical interventions development for buildings' energy upgrade (passive and active systems), is a basic prerequisite for the reduction of the energy needs of the building stock and the increase of RES to cover these needs, results which will lead to the de-carbonisation of the energy needs of the Municipality's building stock. The Municipality of Thessaloniki adopts the principle "energy efficiency comes first" whenever possible and tries to prioritise the order of interventions in view to achieve the best result with the available resources (e.g., having sufficient thermal insulation before replacing the heating system). In addition, new technologies, Information Technology and telecommunications solutions are offering new opportunities to manage and control buildings. According to the latest European directives (e.g., new EPBD), intelligent buildings are equally important in achieving a better quality of life and

as a supporting means to increase buildings' energy efficiency.

In order to achieve the Municipality of Thessaloniki climate neutrality targets, a renovation rate of 3.5% (percentage of buildings renovated annually) is required, of which 60% are extensive renovations (energy savings of 30-60%). This percentage increases (5.5%) if interventions only consist lamps and appliances replacement with more energy-efficient ones, as these initiatives are considered more likely to be implemented, given the lower capital investment required. The specific targets, although optimistic, are achievable as: a) there is a very high potential for renovation due to the age of the buildings within the Municipality of Thessaloniki and b) there is a strong construction activity (buildings and infrastructure).

In addition to existing buildings, it is also important to ensure high energy efficiency in new buildings. More specifically, the aim is to construct new buildings that will meet the highest energy standards (A+/A) by a percentage of 35%, in line with the estimates of other cities participating in the Mission that have similar characteristics to the Municipality of Thessaloniki. Finally and further to the building stock upgrade, the Municipality of Thessaloniki aims to increase other installations' energy efficiency (e.g., lighting, water supply installations, etc.), thus aiming to further reduce emissions from anthropogenic activities within the Municipality.

In the Transport and Logistics sector, the Municipality of Thessaloniki announces its intention to achieve the climate neutrality transition by 2030, by initially aiming to modernise mobility services and infrastructure management, through the implementation of infrastructure projects (such as redevelopments, cycle paths, etc.) and projects included in the Thessaloniki Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), planned for 2025 horizon. These projects are either ongoing or are in tendering phase. The above-mentioned projects aim to reshape the public space and its functions, resulting in a reduction of private passenger cars use and increase of public transport use, in order to also upgrade road safety. In addition, in order to modernise mobility services and infrastructure management and in parallel with the metro operation, public transport network restructure is planned, to enhance multimodal stations and park &amp; ride facilities (people usually park their cars in the suburbs and take the bus or metro to avoid congestion in the city center). These actions aim to promote public transport and multimodality, resulting in reduction of car use, increase of public transport and active mobility, leading, also, in the long term, to the improvement in citizens' health.

In order to ensure a sustainable city with improved living conditions, the Municipality of Thessaloniki aims to create new and combined mobility services based on public transport and micro-mobility, as well as to promote services such as car sharing, ridesharing and carpooling.

This has resulted in the creation of a set of new mobility services that act as a counterbalance to car ownership, emphasising multimodality and, thus, reducing car use, while increasing both the use of public transport and the average number of passengers per car. In order to ensure the sustainability of the city through the modernisation of mobility services and infrastructure management, the Municipality of Thessaloniki sets as an additional objective; the promotion of electro-mobility infrastructure in public spaces, an action that will attract users of all categories. In addition, among the actions included in the promotion of electro-mobility is the gradual conversion of the urban bus fleet to electric buses.

Finally, the Municipality of Thessaloniki has set within its medium-term objectives the transition towards the full digitalization of mobility and transport by utilizing existing structures and tools, such as the Mobility Living Lab, developed by HIT/ CERTH (Hellenic Institute of Transport/ National Center for Research and Technological Development). This will enhance multimodal transport management, the adoption of the "Mobility as a Service" concept (a concept that aims to shift from the pattern of trips by private car to a new model of trips by shared means and public transport) and, finally, data-driven decision and policy making to improve transport and mobility conditions, as well as to inform commuters in order to make decisions that ultimately serve climate neutrality. These

objectives are being promoted through the implementation of specific actions and projects and the digitisation of mobility, which have either already been implemented or are ongoing or at the process towards tender.

In the Water and Waste management sector, the introduction of separate collection of bio-waste, which accounts for the largest share of the waste stream composition, is the most important factor in achieving the landfill diversion target. In order to achieve the Municipality of Thessaloniki climate neutrality targets, the composting rate needs to reach 70%, while the treatment of bio-waste through the development of the necessary infrastructure is also a key factor. The ultimate aim of the above is to reduce the environmental footprint and thus improve the quality of the environment. At the same time, the Municipality of Thessaloniki aims to upgrade the existing electronic recording and monitoring systems for waste management. The aim is to speed up the resolution of waste management issues and identify areas for improvement, in order to make them more transparent. An additional objective of the Municipality of Thessaloniki is to reduce the volume of waste for landfill (recycling of paper to 85%, plastic to 55%, metals to 60% and glass to 75%), thus reducing the environmental footprint of waste management and enhancing the city cleanliness. This will be achieved by modernising and renewing the cleaning and recycling equipment.

The strategic interventions of the Land Use and greening infrastructure sector aim to create a low-emission urban form. In the Municipality of Thessaloniki this transition is required to be achieved through extensive tree planting and increase of the area of the city covered by tree foliage. This can be achieved without changing the total area of green space, beyond what is foreseen in the Municipality Urban land uses Plan, but by densifying trees and replacing low green (grass, ornamental plants) with high green (trees). In addition to the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by trees, the replacement of low greenery with high greenery will have other benefits, such as reduction in surface and atmospheric temperatures and heat islands found throughout the surface of Thessaloniki, noise absorption as trees act as natural noise barriers, protection of biodiversity as trees provide shelter and food for various species of birds, insects and other animals, helping to promote biodiversity in the urban environment.

Finally, interventions in the area of Smart City and governance are foreseen, which will contribute horizontally to the achievement of the Climate Neutrality objective. They concern the creation of digital infrastructure and digital citizen services and social participation, environmental sustainability support and Climate Footprint monitoring.

The 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan describes all interventions, including those to reach our priorities, as well as all further actions, and describes how the city plans to implement them, including both actions related to strengthening cooperation with stakeholders (Governance Enhancement Actions) and social innovation actions to ensure the active participation of citizens.

The progress of the implementation of the plan as well as its results will be monitored on a permanent basis, in order to propose, at regular intervals, any necessary modifications and improvements to the action plan. In order to reach this goal, the establishment of a Carbon Progress Indicator Monitoring System and a Climate Transition Observatory are foreseen, including the methodology and tool development aiming at supporting the Municipality of Thessaloniki in monitoring progress towards the climate transition and providing information on progress reports to the EU Mission Agency, as well as in taking decisions on the review of the Action Plan. The methodology and tool will be based on the way the baseline inventory of the Action Plan was created as well as on the multi-source Carbon Footprint monitoring platform developed/ operated by HIT/ CERTH.

The priorities that the Municipality of Thessaloniki has set for the implementation of the Action Plan consist, on the one hand, to the prioritization of actions within the municipality boundaries, and, on the other hand, to the synergies with the other Greek cities participating in the European Commission's Mission initiative for the mobilization of the National Government and relevant

# 1 Introduction

Local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and description of the gap to be addressed

The Municipality of Thessaloniki was selected to join the European Commission's Mission for 100 climate neutral and smart cities by 2030, after an intensive process led by independent experts from the European Commission and among 377 European cities that expressed interest. Thessaloniki in 2030 aims to have become a climate neutral, smart, sustainable, resilient and attractive city with positive benefits for public health, accessibility and well-being of citizens.

Municipality of Thessaloniki acknowledges the global challenges and the role of the cities to act proactively to mitigate the effects of climate crisis and implement robust, approaches to address current and future challenges.

The city's main challenge is to rapidly adapt sustainable systemic changes including redesigning and delivering urban infrastructures and services that enhance citizen's participation, connectivity and community, shape a thriving and sustainable city, build a dynamic urban economy, become responsive and support climate resilience and disaster management. Tremendous opportunities for the city to be improved, advanced, and maintain its contribution to the goals of sustainable development lie also in the utilization of big data computing and the underpinning technologies, and in the implementation of their novel applications.

Thessaloniki aims to become a climate-neutral and smart city by 2030, reducing the expected CO2 emissions within its municipal boundaries by 80%. Achieving the target will transform Thessaloniki into a sustainable, resilient and attractive city with positive benefits for public health, accessibility and well-being of citizens. This requires, on the one hand, robust policies and investing in ambitious actions, concerning public space, processes and resources that are within its sphere of competence and go beyond existing plans and strategies and, on the other hand, mobilizing and involving relevant stakeholders, institutions and businesses to achieve targets in various sectors that are higher than the corresponding national targets.

Thessaloniki's pathways towards climate neutrality crosses various sectors for which the Municipality of Thessaloniki has a specific vision with specific measurable targets been set. More specifically:

Buildings &amp; Heating: Renovation and upgrading of the building stock will be at a high level for all types of buildings, private (residential and commercial), municipal and other public. New buildings will largely follow the highest energy efficiency standards. Heating will largely use high efficiency electrical systems. Public facilities will be upgraded as a whole.

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

Transport &amp; Logistics: the vast majority of trips by polluting private cars will be replaced in 2030 by tripsusing sustainable/ "green" means of transport (private or shared bicycles and micro-mobility vehicles, private or shared electric cars, public transport) within a sustainable multimodal transport system. The urban logistics system will be transformed and optimized, within a regulated operating environment and will use sustainable means of transport.

Figure 1: Ecosystem for climate neutrality

In addition, the Municipality of Thessaloniki is expected to work with large private organizations that will act as "Climate Neutrality Ambassadors", in order to commit to implementing climate neutrality actions. These actions will involve both de-carbonisation of their operations and "green" donations for the wider benefit of the local community.

Over the last decade, the European Union has stepped up its efforts to mitigate climate change by setting high targets for Member States to achieve. In this context, Greece is working systematically to align national legislation with the relevant European energy and climate guidelines and is promoting financial programmes in this direction, both in the public and private sectors. In parallel with the national policy documents, the Municipality of Thessaloniki, recognising the need to achieve climate neutrality, has formulated local/regional action plans to address specific issues within the targeted sectors.

According to calculations and estimations derived from the "economic model" (methodology proposed by the EIT Climate KIC and adopted for the calculations carried out in the framework of Action Plan &amp;Investment Plan establishment for the Municipality of Thessaloniki), in the year 2030, under "business as usual" conditions, i.e. without the implementation of targeted projects and actions for the climate neutrality transition, i.e. without the implementation of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, the emissions within the Municipality of Thessaloniki borders are estimated at 2.84 tons of CO2 equivalent per capita. More specifically, emissions from the electricity and heating sectors of the building stock will be at high levels, with rates of  $47\%$  and  $26\%$  respectively, which ranks them as the two most important sectors that can be improved in terms of energy savings and emissions reduction, by planning and addressing appropriate efficient actions. The transport and logistics sector contributes about a quarter of total emissions  $(23\%)$ , while the waste management sector also contributes  $4\%$ .

The recognition of the contribution of the sectors to energy consumption and environmental burden also shapes the Municipality's strategy, which prioritises a series of actions to address pollutant emissions and consequently climate change, aiming at climate neutrality by 2030.

# 2 Work Process

## Work Stream - Methodology for the formulation of the Action Plan

The development of the Action Plan was based on the methodology proposed by the European Commission and in particular the Net Zero Cities initiative. In particular, the standard texts for the "Climate City Contract", the "Action Plan" and the "Investment Plan" were used, as well as all the proposed texts and guidelines from the initiative. Key elements for the drafting of the Action Plan were both the proposal submitted by the Municipality of Thessaloniki to join the network of 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities for 2030, and the participation and views of citizens and stakeholders in the wider area of the Municipality of Thessaloniki.

For the development of the baseline emissions inventory, the year 2020 (later than 2018, as required by the relevant directives) was chosen as the base year. Although 2020 was the year Covid-19, the sectors "Electricity", "Buildings &amp; Heating", "Water &amp; Waste management" and the "Land Use &amp; Greening Infrastructure" sectors are not affected. On the contrary, for the sector "Transport &amp; Logistics", given the unquestioned influence of Covid-19 on this sector, a typical travel year (2019) was chosen. The data came from the Traffic Model maintained by HIT/ CERTH and was also used for the compilation of the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan of the Municipality of Thessaloniki.

For the required data to be included in the emissions inventory, the proposed "Economic Model" tool from Net Zero Cities was used, and they were collected according to their availability for the Municipality of Thessaloniki. More specifically, for those data for which no values were available, assumptions were made based on national and regional data, as well as international literature, according to availability in each case. It is worth mentioning that for the calculation of emissions per sector in the year BAU2030 (Business as Usual), the "Economic Model" tool required the forecast of the annual change in the population of the Municipality of Thessaloniki for the year 2030, so it was chosen to keep the population of 2030 similar to that of the 2021 census.

The objective of the Action Plan is the overall reduction of emissions from all the above mentioned sectors from BAU2030 to 2030 at a level of 80% (taking into account 20% of residual emissions). For the year 2030, specific targets for KPIs were set which were requested by the "Economic Model" in order to achieve climate neutrality for the city of Thessaloniki. And in the case of target setting for the year 2030, for those data where no values were available, assumptions were made based on national or European targets as well as international literature, depending on availability in each case.

The goals set by sector are expected to be achieved by the proposed actions of the Action Plan, always in conjunction with the achievement of national targets by national institutions and central government. As mentioned above, an important factor in the formulation of the Action Plan was the holding of participatory workshops with citizens and stakeholders from the wider area of the Municipality of Thessaloniki in order to identify problems, barriers and opportunities for achieving climate neutrality for the Municipality of Thessaloniki.

In addition, in order to record actions and activities planned by the various services of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, as well as by the stakeholders, an electronic questionnaire was designed and distributed, where the required information on the planned actions and activities was filled in. In addition, further communication with some of these stakeholders was deemed necessary, which was carried out either by telephone or face-to-face meetings in order to complete the Action Plan more correctly and completely.

# 3 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

Part A "Existing situation" describes the starting point of the Municipality of Thessaloniki towards climate neutrality, including the existing commitments and strategies of key local actors and businesses, setting the background for fast and effective climate action.

## 3.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

Module A-1 "Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory" describes in detail the procedure and results of the last emissions inventory of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, for the reference year 2020, based on which the targets and residual emissions for 2030 will be derived. The methodology was based on the "Economic Model", which supports the calculations required for the Climate City Contract, as well as the requirements of the Mission's Info Kit for Cities and the Action Plan Guidance.

More specifically, for the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector and electricity consumption, scope 1 and scope 2 emissions were taken into account. Scope 1 emissions included emissions resulting from the consumption of fuel to meet the heating and DHW Sanitary Hot Water) demand of all buildings within the boundaries of the Municipality of Thessaloniki. More specifically, the consumption of natural gas and heating oil was taken into account. Tier 2 emissions include emissions from the use of energy produced outside the boundaries of the municipality through the grid. In this case, the total electricity consumption (for all uses) was taken into account, as it was assumed that the majority of electricity consumed within the municipality is centrally generated and distributed through the electricity grid, in line with the indications of the Net Zero Cities model. Within the boundaries of the system for the Municipality of Thessaloniki, municipal buildings and installations, tertiary and residential sectors were included. The industrial and agricultural sectors were excluded from the analysis due to the very low relevance for the Municipality of Thessaloniki (minimal relevant activity) and due to the inability of the Municipality to intervene and influence actions in these sectors.

Similarly, for the calculation of GHG emissions from the transport &amp; logistics sector, scope 1 emissions were taken into account. These emissions include emissions from motorised traffic and more specifically from passenger vehicles, buses, municipal vehicles, as well as urban delivery vehicles and trucks operating in the area of the Municipality of Thessaloniki.

Finally, for the calculation of GHG emissions from the waste sector, in line with the relevant guidance from City Advisor, scope 3 emissions were taken into account. These emissions refer to the total volume of waste collected within the boundaries of the Municipality of Thessaloniki.

The following summarizes and describes the main data and calculations related to greenhouse gas emissions in the Municipality of Thessaloniki, as they were obtained from the Net Zero Cities "Economic Model" tool.

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

The methodology followed to formulate the baseline GHG emissions inventory was developed above and was based on the completion of the indicators and quantities requested by the proposed "Economic model" tool.

In the base year (2020), the electricity sector is the one with the highest GHG emissions at  $44\%$  (399,507 equivalent tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  per year), followed by the building stock heating sector at  $27\%$  (250,416 equivalent tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  per year). The transport and logistics sector is also very close at  $25\%$  (225,737  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  equivalent tonnes per year), while emissions from waste management account for only  $4\%$  (39,876  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  equivalent tonnes per year) of total emissions (Table A-1.4b).

In more detail, the Municipality of Thessaloniki has significant energy needs for heating its building stock, both for space heating and water heating, amounting to 1,332 GWh per year, while the electricity needs within the boundaries of the Municipality, including lighting and other infrastructure loads, are estimated at 989 GWh per year (Table A-1.3). With regard to the most energy demanding category, that of heating for the building sector, it is observed (Table A-1.1) that the main source of heating fuel is natural gas and therefore it appears that the Municipality of Thessaloniki is highly dependent on the availability and supply of natural gas.

In the transport and logistics sector it is clear that both passenger and freight transport contribute to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, passenger car journeys are 767 million kilometres per year, while bus journeys are around 14 million kilometres per year. Similarly, the freight transport sector makes a significant contribution of 350 million kilometres per year, which demonstrates the importance of having measures and actions in place. As regards waste management, 142,839 tonnes of waste are collected annually for the Municipality of Thessaloniki (Tables A-1.1 and A-1.3).

It is worth mentioning that although the energy consumed in GWh in the electricity sector is lower than that for heating the building sector, the emissions in tonnes of CO2 equivalent are higher. This

variation is due to the emission factors adopted for this Plan, as shown in Table A-1.2, which were formulated taking into account relevant factors from international literature based on relevant standards (for gas and oil) and the emission factors for electricity taking into account the energy mix for 2020.

Moreover, although the kilometres travelled by buses are significantly lower than those of passenger cars, the emissions released in the former case are much higher (Table A-1.2) which is mainly due to the age of the urban bus fleet. At the same time, emissions from freight transport are significantly higher than those from passenger transport by car, which demonstrates the need to strengthen this sector with actions towards climate neutrality.

In order to achieve the climate neutrality target for the Municipality of Thessaloniki, the reduction of emissions from all sectors is required to reach 80%. This reduction is required to be made by BAU 2030 (Business as Usual 2030), where keeping the city's population constant until 2030, as commented above, the final contribution of each sector to GHG emissions is derived.

![img-11.jpeg](img-11.jpeg)

## εκπομπές ανά κάτοικο

,84 t CO₂ ισοδύναμο/κάτοικο

According to the calculations resulting from the "Economic Model" in the year BAU 2030 the emissions per inhabitant of the Municipality of Thessaloniki are 2.84 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent/ inhabitant.

In more detail, emissions from the electricity and heating sectors of the building stock will be at equally high levels with rates of 47% and 26% respectively, which places them in two important sectors that can be improved in terms of energy savings and emissions reduction with appropriate efficient actions. At the same time, the transport and logistics sector is responsible for about a quarter of total emissions at 23%, while the waste management sector also appears in this case at 4%.

In the field of land use and green infrastructure, the estimation of greenhouse emissions is based on Hellenic Statistical Authority data on economic activities in the Municipality of Thessaloniki, on data derived from the GIS of the Municipality of Thessaloniki and on data provided by the AUTH, UoM, and TIF - Helexpo. Three topics were considered (a) activities and greenhouse emissions, (b) tree plantations and CO2 absorption capacity, and (c) existing renewable energy production facilities in public and common areas. The sector's GHG emissions result from agricultural activities not related to buildings, energy, and waste, which are recorded in other sectors of this report. Hellenic Statistical Authority data show that GHG emissions from forestry activities in the Municipality of Thessaloniki are zero.

The activity that produces greenhouse gas emissions in the Municipality of Thessaloniki is related to the crops in the area of the vegetable gardens, which according to the Municipality Urban land uses Plan is of 1,880 hectares. The estimate of greenhouse gas emissions from the cultivation of vegetables and fruit ranges from 0,5 to 2 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year. We chose an average of 1 ton per acre per year, and the total annual GHG production is estimated at 1,880 tons. In the forthcoming Municipality Urban land uses Plan, the area with vegetable crops is limited to 25 acres.

The recognition of the contribution of the sectors to energy consumption and environmental burden also shapes the Municipality's strategy, which prioritises a series of actions to address pollutant emissions and consequently climate change, aiming for climate neutrality by 2030. What is worth mentioning is that reducing emissions from the two most energy-intensive sectors, electricity and heating of the building stock, mainly requires actions that are not the responsibility of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, but relate to decisions and actions of the Central Government. On the other hand, in the transport and logistics sector, actions to reduce emissions are mainly the

In this context, Greece is working systematically to align national legislation with the relevant European energy and climate guidelines and is promoting financial programmes in this direction, both in the public and private sectors.

Indicative examples of funding programmes for energy and climate at national level, in which the Municipality of Thessaloniki has participated in the past: EKSOIKONOMO-OTA, Bioclimatic urban renewals, while the following funding programmes are currently ongoing: Save 2021/exoikonomo2021, Save-Renovate for young people, Photovoltaics system on roof program grant, Recycle - replace my appliance, kinoume ilektrika and Green Taxi, which address individuals, , as well as ELEKTRA and "Antonis Tritsis", which aim to upgrade the energy efficiency of public sector buildings. At the same time, the Municipality is eligible for financing the implementation of projects that serve national objectives through the NSRF, the Green Fund and Public Investment Program. Finally, the Municipality's participation in the Greek Smart Cities Programme funded by the Recovery Fund and the launch of the new Research-Innovate 2021-2027 is expected to strengthen the city with actions and projects that will facilitate its digital transformation and accelerate its transition to a smart, sustainable and interconnected city. The Municipality of Thessaloniki Operational Programme can integrate several of the proposed actions within the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, focusing on those within its direct responsibility.

Law 4936/ 2022: National Climate Law - Transition to climate neutrality and adaptation to climate change, urgent provisions to address the energy crisis and protect the environment" is the most recent relevant law, which emphasizes the goal of climate neutrality by 2050. Law 4936/ 2022 establishes measures and policies to ensure the country's gradual transition to climate neutrality by the year 2050 and sets interim climate targets for the years 2030 and 2040 towards the reduction of net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The law provides, amongst others, for the preparation of Regional Plans for Climate Change Adaptation, as well as Municipal Emission Reduction Plans. Specifically, the Municipal Emission Reduction Plan includes an inventory and emission reduction targets for energy-consuming buildings, equipment and infrastructure used by first-tier local authorities and legal entities supervised by them. The Law as a whole promotes the penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) while eliminating the production of electricity from fossil fuels. It also introduces specific measures to reduce emissions from buildings, for example

from 1/1/2025 the sale and installation of heating oil burners will be prohibited.

Also, at the end of 2019, the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan was integrated into the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), emphasizing quantitative targets per sector of action to mitigate climate change. A revision of NECP is expected within 2023, which mainly further promotes the Photovoltaics installation for electricity generation and the energy efficiency of the country's building stock through energy saving programmes and the installation of heat pumps. For building stock upgrading, investments of 642 million euros per year are foreseen for the period 2021-2025 and 935 million euros per year for the period 2026-2030.

At regional level and in accordance with the requirements of Law 4414/ 2016, the Region of Central Macedonia has developed the Regional Plan for Climate Change Adaptation, which is a policy document for the implementation of the region's strategy to address the consequences of climate change and to shield the region against them. In terms of addressing climate change directly through the use of 'smart solutions', the plan proposes the creation of smart grids and demand management to mitigate the effects of increased electricity demand due to warming. In addition, the Regional Spatial Planning and Sustainable Development Plan was also established, which is an update of the Regional Spatial Planning Framework of Central Macedonia based on the National Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation and the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) as well as the requirements of the de-carbonisation. Within the plan there is a clear reference to the intention to strengthen international best practices for increasing energy efficiency as well as reducing energy demands by focusing on reducing losses through the development of smart energy grids at regional and local level. Finally, the Integrated Sustainable Urban Development Strategy for Thessaloniki includes projects and actions aiming at sustainable mobility promoting, improving the urban environment for the benefit of residents and tourists and ultimately reducing environmental impacts.

At local level, the Thessaloniki 2030 Urban Resilience Strategy has four pillars/ objectives that include proposals and actions to make Thessaloniki a jointly open sustainable city with a dynamic local economy and an urban governance system. At the same time, a key objective of the Strategy is to redefine the city's relationship with the sea with benefits for its resilience and its population. Since the Strategy was formulated in 2017, two evaluation reports have been carried out, in 2020 and 2022, which strongly emphasise the weakness of data collection and the lack of services interconnection to systematically make information available for evaluation. An important conclusion of the two evaluations of the Strategy is the difficulty in collecting data and the lack of systematic communication between the relevant Services and stakeholders. For this reason, relevant action on the development of an appropriate governance and communication model between partners will be analysed in Module C-1.

The Covenant of Mayors is a European initiative launched in 2008 in which local and regional authorities can participate and make a voluntary commitment to achieve European climate and energy targets. Since 2016, the Covenant of Mayors has been addressed at international level, with the main objective of reducing greenhouse gases by 40% by 2030, promoting the updating of Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAPs) into Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans (SECAPs) towards the climate change mitigation. The Municipality of Thessaloniki joined the Covenant of Mayors in 2011 and in this framework it developed a SEAP in 2014, creating a series of proposed actions in different sectors for energy saving, use of renewable energy sources and reduction of pollutants, with emphasis on the building and transport sectors. In addition, the city of Thessaloniki has developed its 2030 Strategy for Resilience and prosperity, which includes actions to reduce pollutants, improve air quality and provide environmental education for citizens.

The National Smart Specialisation Strategy 2021-2027 is a strategy document for the promotion of innovation, research and technology, aiming to enhance sustainable growth in 8 sub-sectors of economy. The National Smart Specialisation Strategy is further specified by region. The Region of

Central Macedonia adopted its strategy in 2016. Within the National Smart Specialisation Strategy, extensive reference is made to measures and actions that can be implemented at national and regional and local level regarding Sustainable Energy.

At local level, the Digital Transformation Strategy for the city of Thessaloniki 2017-2030 is inextricably linked to the long-term planning of the Municipality and specifically to the strategy "Thessaloniki 2030". In terms of its structure, the strategy is based on the following five axes: a connected city, a city for all, a city that shares its data, a participatory city and a city that supports digital innovation. Each axis takes into account the benefits for the city and its citizens, the priorities, objectives, actions and the vision of the municipality. The formulation of the Digital Transformation Strategy of the Municipality of Thessaloniki was a prerequisite for the continued transformation of the city into a Smart City, while aligning ICT projects and actions with strategic objectives to increase added value. The implementation of the Digital Transformation Strategy is being developed over three time periods, with an evaluation at the end of each period, in order to achieve optimal targeting of the relevant actions.

In the transport sector at national level, in recent years, legislation has been adopted to support the acceleration of the transition of the transport and urban mobility system to the era of climate neutrality and innovative interconnected mobility. Law 4784/ 2021: Greece on the move: Sustainable Urban Mobility Micromobility Regulations for the modernization, simplification and digitization of procedures of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport and other provisions (Government Gazette Vol. A' 40/16.3.2021) establishes the framework for the preparation of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans for the first and second tier local authorities in Greece. The process of preparing the Thessaloniki Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan is in accordance with this legislation and in June 2022 with the Government Gazette Vol. B' 2775/03.06.2022 it was officially characterized as the Urban Mobility Plan of the Municipality of Thessaloniki. In addition, the framework for micro-mobility vehicles is initially established in Greek cities, providing a solution to various issues that had arisen from their entry into the transport systems of cities. Problems related to the speed limit, traffic lanes, parking space, training, etc. By establishing a framework for their operation, cities are given the opportunity to introduce these vehicles safely into the lives of their inhabitants, thereby reducing car use and promoting sustainable mobility.

In addition, Law 4710/ 2020: Promotion of electromobility and other provisions, launched a national effort to transition the transport system to more environmentally friendly forms of energy, providing fiscal and non-fiscal incentives for the development of electromobility. At the same time, the law organises the electromobility market in the country and defines urban planning regulations for the installation of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. The National Electromobility Plan is currently under public consultation, with targeted policy measures for the electrification of vehicle fleets, the development of charging infrastructure and the development of ecosystems electrification.

At local level, the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan of Thessaloniki was formulated in accordance with the current legislation for the preparation of such plans (4599/ 2019), while it also took into account the updated European directives Elitis. It was adopted in 2021 and is the main strategic document, on behalf of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, related to transport and sustainable mobility, aiming to upgrade the urban fabric and the quality of life of its residents and visitors. The main purpose of the SUMP is to facilitate the movement of residents, visitors and goods in order to ensure maximum ease and upgrade accessibility to all daily activities. To this end, the SUMP promotes alternative means of transport (public transport, walking and cycling), which will lead to an increase in the level of safety for all travellers, a reduction in environmental pollution and a total improvement of the quality of the urban fabric. With the implementation of the SUMP interventions by 2030, redefining the role and functioning of areas of the Municipality of Thessaloniki in the new era of the multimodal public transport system and supporting polycentricity and the creation of local

centres, significant improvements in the daily life and quality of life of the Municipality of Thessaloniki residents are expected. The Thessaloniki SUMP refers to the development of an action plan for the participation of citizens and stakeholders, as well as the signing a Memorandum of Cooperation. Both of the above actions were carried out during the SUMP implementation. Module C-1 includes actions related to the cooperation model of the actors involved in the SUMP implementation.

In 2022, the Electric Vehicle Charging Plan was completed, which proposes 225 locations where Electric Vehicle Charging Stations will be installed with a total of 444 charging slots. Through the EVCP, areas of potential interest for the installation of electric vehicle chargers have been identified, taking into account their social and functional characteristics (population density, proximity to points of interest, etc.).

The Municipality of Thessaloniki, recognizing the need to integrate innovation in mobility management to achieve the transition to the goals of climate neutral cities, but also the need for a human-centered approach to the use of technological solutions in mobility to facilitate the daily life of citizens and to support urban freight transport with the sustainable development of cities, signed in 2022, a declaration of intent to cooperate and participate in the ecosystem of the EIT Urban Mobility Regional Innovation Hub.

In addition, the Municipality of Thessaloniki will sign a Memorandum of Cooperation with the Thessaloniki Smart Mobility Living Lab (THESSM@LL), where HIT/ CERTH, as the coordinator of THESSM@LL, will provide the Municipality of Thessaloniki, amongst others, support in planning and decision-making for solving mobility problems and in achieving its climate neutrality goals, monitoring of KPIs related to mobility and transport of persons and goods, as well as air quality and climate neutrality related metrics, as well as the ability to evaluate the performance of an innovative service/ solution and support the Municipality in the innovative transition through its eventual adoption by users.

Law 4819/ 2021, which is the integrated framework for waste management - Incorporation of Directives 2018/ 851 and 2018/ 852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 amending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste and Directive 94/62/EC on packaging waste, framework for the organisation of the Hellenic Recycling Organisation, provisions on plastic products, sets as targets the priority of circular economy over recycling, the recycling of municipal waste of at least 55% by 2025 and at least 65% by 2035 and the recycling of packaging waste of at least 65% by 2025 and 70% by 2030. In addition, it introduces the compulsory implementation of the Pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) scheme in local authorities with more than 100,000 inhabitants from 2023 and in local authorities with more than 20,000 inhabitants from 2028. Sets separate waste collection: in at least 11 waste streams, including new products such as textiles, household hazardous waste, pharmaceuticals and finally setting a quantitative target of 30% reduction of food waste by 2030 at retail and consumer level.

At national level, the new National Waste Management Plan (NWMP) was published in September 2020, which incorporates the European Directives on the Circular Economy into national legislation, with the aim of implementing it in the period 2020-2030, while it will be evaluated every five (5) years and if necessary revised. The NWMP 2020-2030 reflects a set of EU policies, such as the First and Second Action Plans for the Circular Economy, the European Green Deal and the Plastics Strategy. Indicative targets of the NWMP at national level are to minimise landfill to 10% by 2030 and to introduce mandatory separate collection at least for metals, paper, glass, glass, plastic, textiles (from 2023). At the same time, the organisation of new Alternative Management Systems (AMS), the strengthening of Source Separation and the transition from the linear production model to the circular economy by strengthening and incentivising circular entrepreneurship are among the most important changes that the NWMP is expected to raise. In order to implement the policies of the Regional Waste Management Plans (RWMPs) are established in each region, which specify the

management of all waste generated in the relevant geographical unit, in compliance with the objectives and provisions of the NWMP.

At local level, the Municipality of Thessaloniki has established the Local Waste Management Plan (LWMP) with targeted actions for the optimal management of municipal waste generated within the boundaries of the Municipality of Thessaloniki with specific targets and actions for the next 5 years (2021-2025), which is based on a new, more decentralized management model that emphasizes combined actions of the Municipality and the Region. The main objective of the Municipality is to promote an integrated plan for the rational management of municipal waste through prevention, reuse and recycling actions towards a "zero waste" city. In a similar context, the proposals of the feasibility study Expansion and Optimization of Waste Collection Services in the Integrated Urban Waste Management System of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, where an investment plan 2020-2030 is proposed for the improvement and expansion of the separate waste sorting system of the Municipality of Thessaloniki.

The Municipality Urban land uses Plan defines the framework for climate change strategies in the Municipality of Thessaloniki. It was approved by the Municipal Council in April 2019 and is awaiting approval by the Ministry of Environment and Energy. It sets out policies and strategies for the spatial organisation of Thessaloniki, energy, local economy, circular economy, waste, transport, housing, green spaces, renewable energy and nature-based solutions.

The Municipality Urban land uses Plan includes climate neutrality regulations and actions that affect greenhouse emissions in the Land Use &amp; Green Infrastructure, such as limiting agricultural land for crops in the vegetable garden area of 25 acres, protecting and developing forests and woodlands in the Municipality of Thessaloniki, expanding green spaces in extensions on the perimeter of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, increasing open space and green space and curbing heat island conditions, interventions in 7 ex-military camps by creating new green spaces and tree canopy. Also the creation of three large metropolitan parks. In the city centre, a significant area of the Thessaloniki International Fair (TIF) is being shifted to common use as green space, and combined with open spaces of the Museums, the ex-military cam (Trito Soma Stratou), the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the Teloglio, the Pasha Gardens and the eastern walls. To the east, a park of approximately 185 hectares is being created in the area of Nea Elvetia and to the west a metropolitan park of 195 hectares is planned on the site of the old commercial railway station and the Holocaust Museum currently under construction. It also includes interventions in the port, with piers 1-3 receiving civic uses and port uses limited to piers 4-6. Redevelopment of the TIF with half of its area allocated to the metropolitan park. Expansion of six categories of parking (I-VI), pedestrian walkways, and bicycle lanes. Increase the use of renewable energy sources. The Municipality Urban land uses Plan foreseens the limitation of the agricultural area for growing vegetables in the Vegetable Gardens to 25 acres, rather than 1,880 acres, so in 2030 these emissions will not exist and no mitigation actions are required.

The approved (2020) Thessaloniki International Fair (TIF) Special Urban Plan provides for the creation of a single building block with a maximum building coefficient of 0.6, a coverage of 45%, and a maximum permissible building area of 96,000 sq.m. The remaining 176 hectares of the area of the TIF concern open spaces, public spaces and green areas. The draft Presidential Decree for the redesign of the Thessaloniki International Fair, covering a total area of 176 hectares, was approved by the Council of State as constitutional and legal (2021). In order to create green spaces and expand the tree cover in the redevelopment of the TIF, TIF-Helexpo S.A. has submitted a proposal to the Growth fund (National Fund of greece) to finance the project through a PPP scheme that provides for private participation with funds of 100 million euros. The budget of the project is estimated at 280-300 million euros and seems to be adopted by the Growth fund.

development character and prospects of the maritime zone, as shown by demographic characteristics, economic activities and employment, and any comparative advantages of the area in relation to the wider environment. The guidelines and arrangements for spatial development and the organisation of overarching planning levels for the wider area are defined, giving a brief profile of the spatial framework and analysing the specific relationship and role of the coastal zone with the hinterland of the Urban Agglomeration of Thessaloniki. The key elements of the proposal for the spatial development and organisation of the coastal zone are then set out, and the pattern of development, spatial and urban organisation of its reference area in relation to the wider built environment. The permitted land uses and building conditions (building coefficient, maximum permitted coverage, maximum permitted height) are also specified, reference is made to the network of open public spaces and public facilities and the network of footpaths (status - structure - flows), as well as to the proposed infrastructure networks.

The inventory and analysis of current policies and strategies show that there are various frameworks available, either mandatory through legislation or voluntary through initiatives, at national, regional and local level, in order to take supporting actions appropriately designed for the gradual achievement of climate neutrality. It is clear that all the above-mentioned frameworks have been set up with a central focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which will directly serve the long-term goal of climate neutrality. It should be noted, however, that the National Law and the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) set the target of climate neutrality by 2050, while the renewed Covenant of Mayors sets the target of 40% GHG reduction by 2030. Consequently, the Municipality of Thessaloniki will need to update its action plans and climate strategies, based on an accelerated plan for more immediate and ambitious measures to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. Finally, as ICTs become even more prominent and digitalisation even more necessary, policy frameworks on Smart Cities and Governance as a lever to halt climate change are expected to be further specified.

Residual emissions consist of those emissions which can't be reduced through climate action and are being offset. Residual emission may amount to a maximum of 20% as stated by the Mission Info Kit.
Emissions reduction target percentage for "Other" sector is assumed to be the same as for the other 4 main sectors.

As presented in the previous sections, BAU2030 emissions for the year 2030 emitted by the electricity sector uses are the highest with the buildings &amp; heating and transport &amp; logistics sectors following. Emissions from the waste management sector are significantly lower, however it is a sector with great potential for improvement. Based on the calculations from the "economic model", residual emissions from each sector were derived which are the emissions that cannot be reduced but can be mitigated by actions by stakeholders.

According to the Municipality of Thessaloniki's target for its climate neutrality transition, each sector contributes to the achievement of the final target. As shown in the table, to reach the overall target of  $80\%$ , the buildings &amp; heating sector should mitigate emissions by  $88\%$  and the electricity sector by  $78\%$ . The transport &amp; logistics and waste management sectors mitigate their emissions by  $75\%$ , which shows that there is space for improvement for these sectors with additional actions and projects mainly under the responsibility of the Municipality of Thessaloniki and local stakeholders. The other sector concerns emissions from vegetable gardens within the Municipality of Thessaloniki, with the new Municipality Urban land uses Plan reducing the area of vegetable gardens from 1,880 to 25 hectares, so in 2030 these emissions will not exist and no mitigation actions are required.

A different illustration of each sector's contribution to the 2030 target shows the percentage that each sector contributes to achieving the overall  $80\%$  emissions reduction. In more detail, the electricity sector contributes  $46\%$  and the buildings &amp; heating sector  $29\%$ . The transport &amp; logistics sector follows with a contribution of  $22\%$  and the waste management sector with  $3\%$ .

Overall, by reaching the 2030 target, emissions per capita are 0.57 t CO2 equivalent/ capita.

The existing planning of the Municipality of Thessaloniki includes a number of projects and interventions that will contribute to partially meeting the above objective for the transition to climate neutrality (and are included in Module B of this document). However, in order to achieve the final target of reducing GHG emissions by 80% in the whole BAU 2030, additional actions and activities are required, as well as synergies at the level of stakeholders in the local Ecosystem as well as at the national level. Finally, a significant parameter for achieving the target is the active involvement of citizens and businesses in the municipality and the use of social innovation tools.

# 3.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

In Module A-3 " Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality", the Municipality of Thessaloniki lists the systems (fields of action) that present barriers and opportunities for its transition to climate neutrality by 2030. It also maps in regard to these systems the stakeholders and potential stakeholders that can contribute removing barriers and support energy and environmental actions towards the transition to climate neutrality.

## A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers and opportunities – textual elements

The Municipality of Thessaloniki is at an early stage in its transition to climate neutrality. It consists of 6 Municipal Units, while together with 10 other neighbouring Municipalities form the Metropolitan Unit of Thessaloniki and is characterised by dense construction with high buildings, narrow streets and virtually no public open space. Only 4% of the city consists of green and open spaces, with 2.73 m2 of green space per inhabitant, while the internationally accepted minimum is 10 m2 per inhabitant.

Municipality-wide electricity demand, including lighting and other infrastructure loads, is estimated to exceed 900 GWh per year, leading to annual emissions of 399 kt CO2 eq. This value of electricity consumption, together with the resulting emissions of pollutants, refers to the total electricity consumption (low and medium voltage) of the Municipality, excluding the agricultural and industrial sectors. Especially for the year 2022, the consumption of electricity for street and square lighting, as well as to cover the needs of municipal buildings, resulted in a monthly cost of about 800,000 euros. Based on DAPEEP (Renewable Energy Sources Operator &amp; Guarantees of Origin) data for the year 2020, the electricity needs are mainly covered by the use of fossil fuels with an estimated 62%, while the contribution of renewable energy is around 31%, with the contribution of hydroelectricity at 7%. Regarding the utilization of RES, according to the available open data of the HEDNO, as of November 2021, 500 kW of municipal photovoltaic systems had been installed, while additional 526.77 kW of private photovoltaic systems had been installed within the boundaries of the Municipality of Thessaloniki and connected to the local electricity grid. Nevertheless, the total photovoltaic capacity of about 1 MW represents a very small percentage of local RES utilization, indicating that there is significant space for improvement and available RES potential.

The Municipality of Thessaloniki has a very large building stock, with a total surface area of more than 22,000,000 m², with an energy saving potential of more than 60%. In particular, based on the 2011 census, more than 80% of the buildings of the Municipality of Thessaloniki were constructed before 1990, so they need radical energy upgrading due to their age and lack of design/ materials for thermal protection. However, it is estimated that only 0.9% of the existing building stock is renovated on an annual basis. It is therefore important to immediately increase the renovation rate of energy inefficient buildings, as indicated by the relevant European and national targets. Specifically for the heating of the building stock of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, the energy needs, both for space heating and water for use heating, are estimated to exceed 1,300 GWh per year, leading to annual emissions of 250 kt CO2 eq. These needs are mainly covered, about 79%, by the use of fossil fuels, with an emphasis on the use of natural gas.

The Municipality of Thessaloniki understands and recognises the need to address energy poverty, so that the energy transition is implemented in a socially just and acceptable way. Energy poverty results from a combination of low income and high costs to meet energy needs, especially with regard to the energy efficiency of the building stock. People living in inefficient buildings are more exposed to illness (e.g. colds), heat waves and other impacts of climate change. A related study concluded that in 2020, 8% of the population within the EU would not be able to keep their homes sufficiently warm. Therefore, energy poverty remains a major challenge and helping vulnerable

citizens is a key task for the EU and its member states. In this context, the Municipality of Thessaloniki seeks and proposes actions that will create value and generate benefits for all its residents, without discrimination. Further financial tools with an emphasis on supporting low-income social strata (e.g. more favourable loan conditions for energy interventions), targeted information actions, reduction of bureaucracy (faster processing of relevant permits) and social benefits (e.g. distribution of low consumption light bulbs, consideration of further income-based reduction of municipal parking spaces, development of green spaces in different neighbourhoods within the municipality, etc.) are indicative ways to mitigate energy poverty. The Municipality of Thessaloniki intends to proceed with the quantification and monitoring of selected indicators related to energy poverty, taking the first key step to address it within its boundaries.

The size and morphology of the city favours travel by bicycle and walking, while the tourist development of the city has brought a high demand for travel within the central area in order to visit places of interest, which favours the use of soft modes of transport. The distribution of travel by means demonstrates the predominance of motorised private cars over sustainable means of transport (public transport, walking, cycling), which is supported by the high percentage of households (44%) that have a private car as their main means of transport (2018). A significant percentage of households have no vehicle (19%) due to the large student population living in the city. The public transport network consists of the OASTH (Organisation of Urban Transportation of Thessaloniki) buses, with the metro under construction, and the percentage of daily trips made by bus with at least one end within the Municipality of Thessaloniki is 32%. Annually, 920 million passenger-kilometres are travelled by passenger cars, while the figure for buses is 326 million passenger-kilometres per year. On the contrary, only 63 million passenger-kilometres per year are covered by bicycle and/ or walking. At the same time, due to the age of the bus fleet, 1,455 grams of CO2/ km are emitted, which suggests the need to modernise the fleet, and indeed to electrify it.

Moreover, as the Municipality of Thessaloniki serves a high volume of through transport (due to trips that have both ends outside the Municipality), the main roads axes of the centre (Nikis Avenue, Egnatia, Agiou Dimitriou, Tsimiski) are significantly overloaded and the phenomenon of illegal parking is particularly critical, as the percentage of illegal parking in the central area of the Municipality of Thessaloniki reaches 50%. Therefore, the need to mitigate motorised trips and shift to more sustainable modes of transport using appropriate and safe infrastructure becomes evident.

In the freight transport sector, a large number of light (&lt;3.5 tons) and heavy (&gt;3.5 tons) trucks travel significant distances within the Municipality of Thessaloniki on a daily basis, with the problems of unloading and increased greenhouse gas emissions being evident in most parts of the historic centre. The lack of a Sustainable Urban Freight Transport plan makes it difficult to address the issue of freight transport in an integrated way and to create the right ecosystem of stakeholders to rationalise freight transport and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

At the same time, the Thessaloniki Smart Mobility Living Laboratory (THESSM@LL), coordinated by HIT/ CERTH, supports the Municipality of Thessaloniki in planning and decision-making for addressing mobility problems as well as in achieving its climate neutrality goals,

The Municipality of Thessaloniki produced 29.5% of the total production of Urban Solid Waste (USW) of the Regional Unit of Thessaloniki. Currently, about 80% of the total USW production is sent to landfill. In cooperation with the Regional Association of Solid Waste Management Agencies of Central Macedonia (FODSAKM), it is planned to include in financing the supply of equipment for the separate collection of biowaste (bins, garbage trucks, branch shredders) and an integrated information and awareness campaign for citizens and businesses. FODSA KM has also proceeded with the inclusion for funding of projects that include the treatment of pre-sorted bio-waste and until their construction, FODSA foresees to cooperate with private bio-waste treatment companies in order to serve the municipalities of the region of Central Macedonia. With the supply of separate bio-waste collection equipment, the Municipality will be able to develop a road map. The

Municipality is implementing separate glass collection, having installed 437 glass collection bins. Recyclable packaging is collected in bins and transported by the Municipality for processing at the Sorting Centres of recyclable materials located at Thermi (6 583,99 tn/year), Ionia (9 938,04 tn/year) and Sindos (3 244,19 tn/year) for a total of 19 766,22 tn/year. The residue from the sorting of packaging waste is transported to the Mavrorachi landfill site for disposal.

Considering the existing situation of the Municipality as outlined above, the built environment, energy systems, transport and waste are the four main "systems" of the Municipality to be exploited in order to move towards climate neutrality by 2030. Of course, the horizontal digital governance system will also play an important role in this whole process.

At the level of synergies, the Municipality of Thessaloniki is a founding member of the Green Cities Network since 2012 and has already collaborated with a number of institutions, such as the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Federation of Industries of Northern Greece, the Exporters' Association, the Commercial Association of Thessaloniki, the Thessaloniki Hotels Association, the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the University of Macedonia, the Consumers Protection Center, the Ecological Movement of Thessaloniki, the Association of Cycling Associations of Macedonia-Thrace, the Pedestrians Association, the Museums of the city, etc. Furthermore, the Municipality of Thessaloniki, recognizing the need to integrate innovation in mobility management to achieve the transition to the goals of climate neutral cities, but also the need for a human-centered approach in the use of technological solutions in mobility to facilitate the daily life of citizens and support urban freight transport with the sustainable development of cities, joined the EIT Urban Mobility Regional Innovation Hub, an initiative of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology in the field of urban mobility, and the European Commission's initiative to promote the use of mobility technologies. It also participates in European funding projects for actions related to the environmental and energy upgrading of the municipality. In addition, there are relevant funding projects underway for both public and private sectors, as mentioned above in Module A-2.1.

While there is the capacity, as presented above, the Municipality, in order to accelerate its climate action transition, will need to overcome the existing systematic barriers, as considered, identified and listed below.

Despite the operation of specific departments for the necessary studies and the drafting of technical specifications in the structure of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, the main obstacle to the implementation of actions is the fragmentation and/ or overlapping of relevant responsibilities, and even the lack of interaction between the various administrative and technical services of the Municipality. Significant delays are noted in the process of tendering for projects (objections, disputes between bidders, etc.), but also in the procedures for calling for funding programmes and obtaining grants. There is also a lack of expertise at the level of municipal officials in terms of design and implementation of climate practices and the use of smart energy systems, and a lack of energy data, particularly on energy consumption in the building sector.

Another main obstacle is the inadequacy of the municipality's financial resources to implement the climate action pipeline foreseen to achieve the climate targets, but also the limited access to financial mechanisms, as well as the lack of experience, expertise and human resources in terms of climate finance and investment. The absence of a Metropolitan Governance System leads to a lack of financial independence for municipalities and the creation of complex legislative barriers between municipalities, regional authorities and central government. The municipality is heavily dependent on European/ national funding for new projects, so it needs to diversify its funding sources and leverage new partnerships to access private investment. As a result of these obstacles, the Municipality is turning to external support from specialist consultants.

The barriers to climate neutrality can therefore be divided into 3 main areas: Governance and
CITY OF THESSALONIKI
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Policy, Finance, Learning and Education. At this point it should be noted that for the development of climate actions and the climate neutrality transition, it is important to involve the local community in decision making and to have their consent to energy and climate actions. Therefore, an additional area to be managed by the municipality is that of seamless citizens climate awareness. Furthermore, the exchange of experience and know-how between municipalities on governance, good practices, financing models, etc., can enhance the knowledge and capacities of the municipality to accelerate its way to climate neutrality. The Municipality should also establish an open dialogue with the private sector in the region to exchange views and identify needs and opportunities for upgrading.

Concerning the movement of people and goods, problems related to infrastructure, organisation of systems, communication between actors and fragmentation of responsibilities are identified. At the same time, the inability to adopt innovative solutions to facilitate travel choices (e.g. access restriction systems in areas, non-extensive use of electric/ hybrid vehicles, traffic management systems) is recognised. Insufficient coordination and cooperation between these actors can hinder the development and implementation of effective strategies. Adequate financial resources are essential for the implementation of infrastructure projects and therefore limited funding may hinder the transition towards climate neutrality.

In the area of land use and green infrastructure, systemic barriers are limited, as nature-based solutions are well accepted by all stakeholders and the urban community. The sector's contribution to Thessaloniki's climate neutrality is positive and is done in several ways: by the absence of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and forestry activities due to the highly urban character of the city, by removing CO2 from the atmosphere through tree foliage, and by contributing to the development of renewable energy sources that have zero greenhouse gas emissions where they are used. The dynamics of these pathways, with the full replacement of traditional forms of food production by new forms of urban agriculture (vertical farms), the mobilisation of all stakeholders and the city's population in increasing tree foliage, and the development of RES with installations in the public space of the city, can maximise the contribution of the Land Use and green infrastructure sector to the climate neutrality of Thessaloniki. The key elements therefore of the Land Use and green infrastructure sector's neutrality scheme are two: on the one hand, maximising CO2 absorption with nature-based solutions, and on the other hand, increasing the production of RES with installations in the public space of the city and using the renewable energy produced in all types of urban activities and infrastructure.

Trees absorb CO2 through the process of photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, tree leaves absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and, using sunlight, convert CO2 into glucose and oxygen. The glucose is used by the tree for growth, while the oxygen produced is released back into the atmosphere. Barriers and risks to increasing the area of urban tree cover include deforestation and loss of peri-urban forest; lack of forest management; changes in climate conditions such as high temperatures, drought and flooding that can affect tree health and growth; harmful effects such as disease, pests or weed attacks; and densification of urbanization that limits the potential for tree planting in private residential areas. Opportunities concern reforestation and planting of new trees in deforested areas or on unused land, adoption of sustainable forestry practices such as selective logging, reforestation with deciduous trees, expansion of hydroponics, public education and awareness of the importance of forests and natural CO2 absorption that can lead to increased social support and participation in forestry and reforestation initiatives.

The public space of the city can contribute to the production of renewable energy in various ways. Some opportunities include the deployment of photovoltaic systems in parks or other public spaces, the installation of wind turbines in areas with sufficient winds and limited disturbance, the automation of public lighting and reduction of lighting intensity in the absence of users, or the use of public lighting systems with integrated photovoltaic panels. Despite the opportunities that public

space provides for renewable energy generation, potential barriers that may affect the implementation of these initiatives include lack of funding, limited available space and availability of open space to install such systems, which may compete with other public space needs and requirements, legal and bureaucratic barriers, permitting procedures, safety requirements and environmental regulations, lack of awareness and understanding by the public and community.

On issues related to digital governance in Greece, there are often significant delays in the development of a basic digital policy in areas such as the legislative framework, financial support, appropriate infrastructure and education. However, over the last decades efforts have been made, at least at the legislative level, to gradually modernise e-services. The city of Thessaloniki has made significant efforts in recent years to digitally modernise the operation of the municipality and provide modern digital services to its citizens. Thessaloniki is also an important technological hub, as it hosts universities, research centres and business associations, and therefore benefits from many projects that have been implemented or are in progress by the city's stakeholders. However, the low level of civic participation and the lack of digital skills of a large proportion of citizens are frequent and significant problems.

The Municipality intends to intensify its efforts to collect and record data related to climate change (climate, energy, greenhouse gas emissions, etc.), through upgrading the Air Pollution and Meteorological Parameters Measurement Network stations, and through the installation of a network of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for measuring air quality, in order to use them to monitor the transition to climate neutrality and to take targeted environmental and energy actions. This data will be available to all stakeholders on a full, open and free basis. It should be noted that data protection is important for the Municipality of Thessaloniki, which has a specific policy on information collection practices, including the categories of data it may collect, maintain, process, the purpose of collection, the categories of persons to whom the data are disclosed and the rights deriving from them. The Municipality of Thessaloniki has in recent years had (permanent) cooperation with a Data Protection

## A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

The Municipality of Thessaloniki, taking into account the systems it will use to move to climate neutrality, the available synergies, existing barriers and opportunities, presents a participatory operating model, further utilizing the available relevant departments and the Resilience Office, which is staffed by the relevant staff of the Department of Operational Planning and Monitoring of Development Programmes, as well as from temporary staff, when available, through funded proposals. The Resilience Office in collaboration with other relevant departments of the Municipality of Thessaloniki will be responsible for the management of data (environmental, energy, etc.), for the continuous circulation of information resulting from the participatory model, and for monitoring and effectiveness of the participatory model, proposing corrective actions for improvement.

The relevant departments and the Office will cooperate on a regular basis to exchange information and take decisions. The Office will designate officers to form the Transition team. The Transition team will be divided into 4 sub-groups, each of which will be responsible for addressing existing barriers in the sectors: Governance and Policy, Financing, Learning and Education, Citizen Awareness. Each sub-group will be composed of the on board partners and stakeholders directly concerned, who will discuss on a regular basis and define actions to remove the barriers identified per sector. The long-term cooperation between the Municipality and the stakeholders will be ensured through the Climate City Contract. Finally, the sub-groups will inform the Transition team on the progress of the actions and the Coordination Group will in turn inform the Departments and Directorates so that any corrective actions and adjustments can be made where necessary. It

should be noted that an interdepartmental working group has already been set up which includes representatives from all the Services of the Municipality of Thessaloniki. The coordination of the group is carried out by the staff of Department of Operational Planning and Monitoring of Development Programmes (ATESPAP) - Resilience Office.

Particular attention must be paid to interacting with civil society and consulting with them, so that the actions implemented have the maximum possible acceptance, thus multiplying their impact and making society itself the agent of this transition. It is also proposed that an open forum for dialogue be set up to involve citizens in the decision-making process and monitor progress in implementing the actions.

A participatory governance model is also necessary both to maximise CO2 absorption through nature-based solutions and to maximise the installation of renewable energy systems in the public space of the city. This model should promote cooperation between public bodies, the private sector, civil society and academia. These actors can work together in the design, implementation and management of CO2 absorption projects and renewable energy systems. Participatory processes in decision-making, consultations, hearings and meetings with the community and stakeholders, transparency and democratic processes, training and information to develop common understanding and enhance participation. In addition, use of funding mechanisms such as the Recovery and Resilience Fund, the Fair Transition Fund, the Green Fund and other investment mechanisms can provide the necessary resources for the implementation of actions. Furthermore, a participatory governance model can include mechanisms to monitor and evaluate CO2 absorption projects and renewable energy systems, by collecting data, measuring performance, publishing results to build trust and continuous improvement initiatives. A participatory governance model encourages collaboration, transparency and stakeholder accountability, making them active players in the design and implementation of initiatives to address systemic barriers and seize related opportunities.

# 4 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B constitutes the core of the Action Plan of the Municipality of Thessaloniki as formulated by the local authority, local businesses, research bodies and stakeholders (as defined in Part A), and includes a) the key strategic objectives, short and medium term outcomes and long term impacts that are expected to be achieved, b) the full and detailed portfolio of actions that the Municipality of Thessaloniki intends to implement until 2030 in order to achieve its objectives and c) appropriate indicators from monitoring and evaluating its implementation progress.

## 4.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

The development of the Impact Pathways was based on the Net Zero Cities (NZC Theory of Change) which takes a structured approach to describing how the defined actions will lead to short (1-2 years) and medium (3-4 years) term outcomes and ultimately to direct (climate neutrality) and indirect impacts by 2030. Systemic barriers and opportunities, as presented in Module A-3, have also been taken into account, with the ultimate aim of proposing actions aiming at improving the sectors that mostly contribute to the carbon balance of the Municipality of Thessaloniki (see Module A-1). The Municipality of Thessaloniki, in full compliance with the guidelines, has developed different pathways for each of the action areas and for different systemic levers including A: Technology and infrastructure, B: Governance and policies, C: Social innovation, D: Democratic participation, E: Financing and F: Learning and competences. The different impact pathways for each of the considered action areas are summarized in table B-1.1. The short and medium term outcomes were selected to serve the basic needs of the municipality and the strategic objectives of the EU.

## B-1.2: Description of impact pathways– textual and visual elements

The Impact Pathway for the Electricity (Energy Systems) sector is developed in 3 systemic levers:

A. Technology and infrastructure: The electrification of the energy system (and by extension the implementation of actions related to e.g. electric cars, installation of heat pumps, etc.) requires the decarbonisation of the electricity grid. To achieve this requires: a) a significant increase in the share of RES for electricity generation (&gt;80% of electricity will come from RES, in line with national energy targets) and b) enhancing the flexibility of the grid. An anarchic and sudden increase in RES electricity generation (and especially variable RES i.e. PV and Wind Turbines) would have negative effects on grid stability and lead to significant energy losses. For this reason, it is envisaged to increase local/distributed RES electricity generation with parallel technical interventions to upgrade the electricity grid, in cooperation with local stakeholders, especially electricity providers and distributors. These measures contribute to the energy security of the municipality by reducing its exposure to external energy inputs. In addition, it is necessary to develop actions aimed at significantly increasing the number of distributed PV systems in common/public spaces. These actions aim to increase the self-consumption from RES within the municipality, to further enhance the sustainability of the energy mix, and act as a complementary means of raising awareness and mobilising citizens (e.g. imitation of good practices), especially if the benefits of installing such systems are sufficiently known to the general public. It should be stressed that as there is no district heating system within the Municipality of Thessaloniki, no corresponding actions and objectives relating to wider heating/cooling networks/systems are included.

C. Social innovation: The Municipality of Thessaloniki intends to organise/support social awareness and information actions for citizens (e.g. on the benefits of implementation, the availability of financial instruments, etc.), which are expected to lead to an increase in energy self-production (e.g. through the installation of active/hybrid energy systems). The ultimate objective is to change the role of the citizens from passive to active consumers (i.e. prosumers), which may also bring economic benefits (e.g. through the sale of excess energy). By implementing relevant actions, a change in the mindset of the citizens of the municipality is also sought, so that they are fully aware of both the benefits and the obligations arising from this action plan - as it is impossible to achieve the climate neutrality objectives without their direct contribution. This change will also enable the achievement of individual targets (e.g. electrification of heating, installation of PV on roofs, etc.) which are higher than the national average.

D. Democratic participation: The involvement of citizens and stakeholders in decision making related to how to achieve the energy transition of the municipality is expected to lead to increased acceptance of strategies-actions related to the de-carbonization of the energy grid and is a prerequisite for a just energy transition. This involvement can be achieved through the creation of working groups, memoranda of understanding, a specific information and exchange platform, etc. Such actions are ancillary to the effort to change the mindset of citizens and mobilise them.

The Figure below illustrates the logical continuity and the interactions of the various outcomes and impacts with regard to the "Electricity - Energy Systems" Impact Pathway.

![img-16.jpeg](img-16.jpeg)
Figure 9: Impact Pathway "Electricity - Energy Systems"

The Impact Route for the Buildings &amp; Infrastructure sector Heating - Built Environment is developed in 4 systemic levers:

A. Technology and infrastructure: The elaboration of extensive technical interventions for the energy upgrading of buildings (passive and active systems) is a key prerequisite for reducing the energy needs of the building stock and increasing the use of renewable energy to meet these needs, results which will lead to the de-carbonisation of the energy needs of the Municipality's building stock. Although thermal and electrical needs are mentioned as separate pathways for practical reasons, this does not mean that actions to couple different sectors will not be considered and implemented.

The Municipality of Thessaloniki adopts the principle "energy efficiency comes first" whenever possible, and tries to prioritize the order of interventions in order to achieve the best result with the available resources (e.g. having sufficient thermal insulation before replacing the heating system). In addition, new technologies and IT and telecommunications solutions are unlocking new possibilities in how we manage and control a building. According to the latest European directives (e.g. new EPBD), intelligent buildings are equally important in achieving a better quality of life and as a supporting means to increase the energy efficiency of buildings.

In order to achieve the climate neutrality targets of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, a renovation rate of  $3.5\%$  (percentage of buildings renovated annually) is required, of which  $60\%$  are extensive renovations (energy savings of  $30 - 60\%$ ). This percentage increases  $(5.5\%)$  if only interventions involving the replacement of lamps and appliances with more energy-efficient ones are taken into account, as these initiatives are considered more likely to be implemented due to the lower capital required. The specific targets, although optimistic, are achievable as: a) there is a very high potential for renovation due to the age of buildings within the Municipality of Thessaloniki as reflected in Module A-3, b) there is a strong construction activity (buildings and infrastructure), which even for the year 2022 showed the highest growth in European Commission at national level - this trend is reinforced by
CITY OF THESSALONIKI

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

relevant policies and financial tools as presented in Module A-2 (e.g. better loan conditions for interventions leading to buildings of higher energy class renovations, subsidy for new appliances, etc.). It should also be noted that the corresponding target of the renovation rate at European level is 3% (but with a longer-term horizon).

In addition to existing buildings, it is also important to ensure high energy efficiency in new buildings. More specifically, the aim is to construct new buildings that will meet the highest energy standards (A+/A) by a percentage of 35%, in line with the estimates of other Mission cities that have similar characteristics to the Municipality of Thessaloniki. Finally, as regards this systemic driver, the Municipality of Thessaloniki aims to increase the energy efficiency of installations other than buildings (e.g. lighting, water supply, etc.), thus aiming at further reducing emissions from human activities within the municipality.

**B. Governance and policies:** The Municipality of Thessaloniki recognizes that in order to achieve its vision of climate neutrality by 2030, the development of new structures (see also Module A-3) and partnerships with stakeholders related to energy efficiency in buildings and facilities are required. This will lead to more efficient (both in terms of time and content) decisions. The implementation of innovative actions (e.g. installation of innovative energy systems, large-scale infrastructure, participation in international European research projects, etc.) is expected to attract new players (e.g. companies, skilled personnel, start-ups, etc.) to the region. The Municipality of Thessaloniki sets as a key objective the development of entrepreneurship within its boundaries, and the creation of an environment of cooperation and innovation enhances the achievement of this objective.

**E. Funding:** In a sustainable development framework, in addition to environmental and social aspects, it is necessary to ensure the cost-effectiveness of the proposed solutions. The Municipality of Thessaloniki, with the synergy of local institutions, businesses and stakeholders, aims to develop business models in order to create and deliver value to residents, taking advantage of the knowledge, experience, data, etc. that will be acquired during the implementation of the Action Plan. These models are expected to facilitate access to financial instruments for energy upgrading - energy saving buildings. The ultimate aim is to achieve cost savings (e.g. by reducing energy bills, providing better loan conditions, etc.) which in turn will indirectly lead to an increase in the rate of renovation (and/ or construction of new buildings with high energy standards) and a reduction of energy poverty.

**F. Learning and competences:** The Municipality of Thessaloniki understands the importance of properly informing citizens and businesses operating within its boundaries about the energy benefits of energy efficiency in buildings and the availability of energy efficiency solutions. The majority of citizens are not aware of the available solutions and tools (especially the latest technology) that are available, and the relevant information is fragmented and requires either a considerable amount of time or the outsourcing of work to specialists, which entails much higher costs and/or solutions that are not fully in line with needs. Relevant information and education (where possible) will lead to a stronger knowledge base of citizens and businesses on issues related to the energy and environmental performance of their buildings, which in turn will help to significantly increase private initiatives related to energy efficiency upgrading of buildings - which is essential for achieving climate neutrality targets.

The figure below illustrates the logical continuity and the interactions of the various outcomes and impacts with regard to the Impact Pathway "Buildings &amp; Heating - Built Environment".

Figure 10: Impact Pathway "Buildings &amp; Heating - Built Environment"

The Transport &amp; Logistics Impact Pathway is developed in 6 systemic levers:

A. Technology and infrastructure: The Municipality of Thessaloniki announces its intention to achieve its vision of climate neutrality by 2030, by initially aiming to modernise mobility services and infrastructure management through the implementation of infrastructure projects (such as redevelopments, cycle paths, etc.) and projects included in the SUMP to be elaborated with horizon 2025 programme of the SUMP. These projects are either in progress or in the tendering phase. The aforementioned aims at reshaping the public space and its functions, resulting in a reduction in the use of private passenger cars while increasing the use of public transport to ensure road safety. In addition, in order to modernise mobility services and infrastructure management, it is proposed that further to the metro operation, the public transport network shall be restructured, with the operation of transfer stations and park &amp; ride areas (people usually park their cars in the suburbs and take the bus to avoid congestion in the city centre). These actions aim to promote public transport and multimodality resulting at reduction of car use and increase of public transport use and active mobility, ensuring in the long term improvement in citizens' health.

In order to ensure a sustainable city with improved living conditions, the Municipality of Thessaloniki aims to create new mobility services based on public transport and micro-mobility, as well as to promote services such as carsharing, ridesharing and carpooling. This results in the creation of a set of new mobility services that act as a counterbalance to car ownership by emphasizing multimodality and thus reducing the car use rate while increasing both the use of public transport and the increase in the passengers car occupancy. In order to ensure the sustainability of the city through the modernization of mobility services and infrastructure management, the Municipality of Thessaloniki sets as an additional objective the creation of infrastructure and facilities for elector mobility at public space, an action that will attract users of all categories. In addition, among the actions included in the promotion of electro mobility is the gradual conversion of the urban bus fleet to electric buses.

Finally, the Municipality of Thessaloniki has set within its medium-term objectives the transition
CITY OF THESSALONIKI

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

towards the full digitalisation of Mobility and Transport. This will enable multimodal traffic management, the adoption of the concept of Mobility as a Service and the use of data to improve travel conditions. These objectives are being promoted through the creation of technological projects and the digitisation of mobility, which have either already been implemented or are currently being tendered.

B. Governance and policies: According to this systemic lever, the main objective of the Municipality is to promote coordinated actions to promote policies, strategies for multimodal mobility management. This can be achieved by organising a cooperation scheme between different stakeholders related to mobility management. This will have the effect of strengthening the effort to decarbonise transport while promoting cooperative models of mobility management. An additional action that will contribute to the climate neutrality of the city by 2030 is the creation of a Mobility as a Service ecosystem that aims to create the appropriate digital infrastructure and organisational framework for the development of multiple collaborative mobility services. This action promotes the smooth functioning of coordinated models for the development of innovation in the field of mobility. In order to adapt in a timely manner to the ever-changing new conditions, it is proposed to promote a SUMP observatory (a map of all the SUMPs in Greece) with the aim of creating a mechanism for monitoring actions in order to contribute to the effort to decarbonise transport.

C. Social Innovation: The Municipality of Thessaloniki is taking important initiatives by organizing actions to promote environmental awareness and activate citizens. Through social awareness and information actions, the Municipality aims to change the mindset of citizens regarding their mobility habits. The transition from the use of private cars to more sustainable and environmentally friendly means of transport is a central pillar of this effort. The creation of alternatives for transport and services makes it easier for citizens to switch to more environmentally friendly means of transport, thus contributing to the sustainable development of the city. However, these impacts go beyond the obvious change in mobility habits. Finally, the impact of these efforts is highlighted beyond the benefits in terms of travel mode. The preference for sustainable modes of travel has a direct positive impact on the health of citizens, ensuring a cleaner and healthier environment for the community.

D. Democratic participation: through the creation of working groups, the conclusion of memoranda of understanding and the development of specific platforms, the Municipality aims to activate the community by giving citizens and stakeholders the opportunity to actively participate in the decision-making process. In addition, citizens will have the opportunity to use the Smart Mobility Living Lab of HIT/ CERTH. Their involvement is expected to add more value to strategic actions aimed at decarbonizing the city's transport system. Further direct impacts of the above-mentioned initiatives are the strengthening of the public spirit and the acceptance of the necessary changes needed to promote sustainable mobility. Finally, citizen involvement is the driving force for innovation. In particular, through their participation in working groups and cooperation platforms, citizens actively contribute to the development of new ideas and approaches that respond to their real needs.

E. Funding: The Municipality of Thessaloniki aims to develop new business models and provide incentives to both enhance active mobility and gradually change the vehicle fleet to more environmentally friendly electric vehicles. This approach is intended to facilitate access to financial instruments for the implementation of actions by private entrepreneurs, while at the same time strengthening actions that promote a change in the mindset of citizens. The ultimate aim is to speed up the implementation of the proposed de-carbonisation actions. Through pilot projects and the gradual introduction of new elements in the transport system, the Municipality is promoting the development and implementation of more sustainable and efficient technologies. Future new investments will help to promote sustainable development and improve the quality of life of the citizens of the Municipality of Thessaloniki.

F. Learning and competences: The Municipality of Thessaloniki aims to inform citizens through actions focusing on the safe use of micro-mobility vehicles and bicycles, as well as the promotion of active

#

mobility. Through seminars on the safe use of these vehicles, the Municipality offers citizens the opportunity to be trained and informed about best practices and safe traffic rules. In the medium term, an increase in the use of micro-mobility vehicles and bicycles is expected to be observed, thus reducing the impact resulting from the use of private motor vehicles. The immediate impact of these efforts is reflected in a faster implementation of actions aimed at de-carbonising transport. By strengthening the information base and education of citizens, the City promotes environmental sustainability and the overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

# Municipality Urban land uses Plan

The Impact Pathway for the Water &amp; Waste management sector is developed in 4 systemic levers:

A. Technology and infrastructure: The introduction of separate collection of bio-waste, which accounts for the largest share of the waste stream composition, is the most important factor in achieving the landfill diversion target. In order to achieve the climate neutrality targets of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, the composting rate needs to reach  $70\%$ , while the treatment of bio-waste through the development of the necessary infrastructure is also a key factor. The ultimate aim of the above is to reduce the environmental footprint and thus improve the quality of the environment. At the same time, the Municipality of Thessaloniki aims to upgrade the existing electronic recording and monitoring systems for waste management. The aim is to speed up the resolution of waste management issues and to identify areas for improvement in order to make them more transparent. An additional objective of the Municipality of Thessaloniki is to reduce the volume of waste for landfill (recycling of paper to  $85\%$ , plastic to  $55\%$ , metals to  $60\%$  and glass to  $75\%$ ), thus reducing the environmental footprint of
CITY OF THESSALONIKI
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

solid waste and enhancing the cleanliness of the city. This will be achieved by modernising and renewing the cleaning and recycling equipment.

B. Governance and policies: Understanding the importance of improving the quality of the environment, the Municipality of Thessaloniki aims to manage municipal waste more efficiently. Therefore, it aims to increase the percentage of recyclable materials and to reduce the environmental footprint of waste, achieving this through the optimisation of the existing waste management system (mixed and recyclable). Fully in line with the objectives of improving environmental quality is also the reduction of the volume of waste to be landfilled by organising new Alternative Management Systems (AMS) with the inclusion of new streams in the extended producer responsibility regime.

C. Social innovation: The Municipality of Thessaloniki intends to organize/ support social awareness and activation actions for citizens on prevention and management of waste generated, enhancing their environmental awareness in order to reduce co-mingled materials and reduce the environmental footprint of waste. Raising citizens' environmental awareness with a view to reducing co-mingled materials and thus reducing the environmental footprint of waste can be achieved by minimising the final disposal of waste through its reuse.

E. Funding: The Municipality of Thessaloniki's use of new financial tools for the maintenance/ replacement of equipment with more modern and environmentally friendly equipment aims to improve the functionality and efficiency of the vehicles, while the ultimate goal is to increase the efficiency of waste collection and management. At the same time, the Municipality of Thessaloniki aims to encourage the co-financing of projects and programmes by various bodies in order to develop new technologies and innovative practices related to waste management. This is achieved by gradually introducing new elements of the waste collection system, with pilot projects in the first phase and then expanding them. The result of this is the development and implementation of more sustainable and efficient technologies for the management and reduction of solid waste.

Figure 12: Impact Pathway "Water &amp; Waste management Sector"

The Impact Pathway for the Land Use and Green Infrastructure sector is developed in 6 systemic levers:

A. Technology and infrastructure: Aim to create a low-emission urban form. In the Municipality of Thessaloniki, especially in the Land Use and Environment sector, this pathway can be implemented through extensive tree planting and increasing the area of the city covered by tree foliage. This is possible without changing the total area of green spaces, beyond what is foreseen in the Municipality Urban land uses Plan of Thessaloniki, by densifying trees and replacing low green (grass, ornamental plants) with high green (trees). In addition to the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by trees, the replacement of low greenery with high greenery will have other benefits, such as a reduction in surface and atmospheric temperatures and heat islands found throughout the surface of Thessaloniki, noise absorption, as trees act as natural noise barriers; protection of biodiversity, as trees provide shelter and food for various species of birds, insects and other animals, helping to promote biodiversity in the urban environment.

B. Governance and policies: Includes participatory processes to improve urban greening and the ratio of m2 of green space per inhabitant and the creation of a Living Lab for nature-based interventions suitable for Thessaloniki. The expected medium-term results are increased citizen participation and social acceptance of nature-based solutions, as well as the emergence of new solutions for nature-based interventions with greater interdisciplinarity and effectiveness. Immediate impacts are the activation of citizens in nature-based interventions, the expansion of the implementation of related solutions, as well as new interventions in the natural ecosystems of Thessaloniki. Indirect impacts relate to the improvement of the quality of the environment in the city.

C. Social innovation: Includes social networks and digital applications for enhancing Thessaloniki's natural environment and social entrepreneurship for nature-based interventions. The medium-term results are based on increasing the number of citizens and bottom-up actions for the environment and greenery and activating the private sector in environmental protection issues. Direct impacts are on the expansion of environment and green actions and the creation of new non-profit entrepreneurship
#

CITY OF THESSALONIKI

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

activities, while indirect impacts include the integration of nature-based solutions into social processes to improve the quality of life of Thessaloniki's residents.

D. Democratic participation: It focuses on open governance in the decisions of the Municipality of Thessaloniki in the field of environment and urban and peri-urban green, which is expected to provide greater acceptance and social legitimacy to the decisions and policies of the municipality. The direct impact will be on the decisions of the public administration due to the activation of social intelligence mechanisms, while the indirect impact will be on the implementation of policies that correspond to the problems and objectives of the city's society.

E. Funding: Includes (a) mobilization of private and non-profit resources for environmental improvement actions, (b) a greater share of public investment in environmental issues, and (c) private investment and new business models in the environmental sector. The expected medium-term results are an increase in investment in environmental and green actions, infrastructure, and projects.

The direct impacts include private non-profit initiatives, increased public funding for the environment, and the development of green entrepreneurship, while the indirect impacts include the development of the city's economy and job creation through actions for the environment, greenery, the city's natural ecosystems

F. Learning and competences: Focus on mimicking natural ecosystems to address environmental &amp; anthropogenic challenges, training for LEED-ND compliant urban regeneration, and developing methods and competences for nature-based interventions for all ecosystems of Thessaloniki, natural and anthropogenic. It is expected to develop capacities for nature-based interventions with broader interdisciplinarity and greater effectiveness, with direct impacts on innovation, new models for environmental interventions and nature-based solutions, and direct impacts on a better understanding of climate change and natural methods of coping with its risks.

The Figure below illustrates the logical continuity and the interactions of individual Impact Pathways in the sector "Land Use and Environment".

The systemic levers on which the Impact Pathway is developed in the Smart City - Governance sector are:

A. Technology and infrastructure: The Municipality of Thessaloniki recognizes that in order to achieve its vision of climate neutrality by 2030 as part of the EU initiative, changes related to the systemic driver Technology and Infrastructure are crucial. Upgrading the digital infrastructure entails strengthening the technological framework and connectivity within the municipality. Improving the broadband network, expanding Wi-Fi coverage and building advanced communication systems are a few of the actions that will directly improve service delivery and informed decision-making in climate action in the future. At the same time, the Municipality aims to modernize and optimize various devices and systems used on a daily basis by both citizens and employees. These actions under the systemic Technology and Infrastructure lever signal the City's commitment to leverage technological advances and upgrade its physical assets to accelerate the transition to climate neutrality.

B. Governance and policies: According to this systemic, the City's key objective is to make changes to modernize data management and analysis, as well as modernize e-government services within the City. The modernization of data management and analysis implies the adoption of advanced technologies and tools to collect, organize and analyze data related not only to day-to-day governance (e.g. e-citizen services) but also data related to climate change and GHG emissions (e.g. use of sensors or IoT devices to collect real-time environmental data). By modernizing data management and analysis, the municipality can better understand its carbon footprint, identify key areas for reducing emissions, and track progress towards climate neutrality targets. At the same time, the modernisation of e-government services ensures that the municipality can effectively communicate and engage with stakeholders, encouraging their active participation in climate initiatives and facilitating a more inclusive decision-making process.

C. Social innovation: The Municipality of Thessaloniki recognizes that in order to achieve its vision of climate neutrality by 2030, it is necessary to organize social awareness and information actions for citizens. The Municipality's main focus is to integrate social awareness campaigns, educational material and relevant information on climate change and sustainability into digital platforms accessible to the community. These platforms may include municipal websites, mobile apps, social media channels or community forums. By providing easy access to information and resources, the municipality aims to raise awareness about climate issues, inspire behavioural change and empower citizens to actively engage in sustainable practices.

D. Democratic Participation: in full alignment with the climate neutrality targets for 2030, and in conjunction with the objectives of the Social Innovation systemic lever, the Municipality aims to directly enhance the democratic participation of citizens. The aim is to provide platforms that enable inclusive collaboration. The design of collaboration platforms includes the creation of digital spaces or tools that allow various stakeholders, including citizens, community organizations, businesses and government officials, to meet, exchange ideas and co-create solutions to address climate challenges. These platforms facilitate open dialogue, information sharing and collective problem solving, fostering a participatory approach to decision-making.

F. Learning and skills: the Municipality of Thessaloniki aims at specific actions focusing on informing citizens about environmental sustainability and climate footprint monitoring, as well as strengthening citizens' entrepreneurship and training them in new technologies. Informing citizens about environmental sustainability and climate footprint monitoring includes the provision of educational resources, workshops and campaigns that raise awareness about the importance of sustainable practices. Empowering citizens and training them in new technologies involves equipping individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to use new technologies and innovative solutions to address climate challenges. These combined changes underscore the City's commitment to building a

|   |  Comments on implementation | This action is characterized as an action of high importance as it directly affects the environmental impact and the effectiveness of the electrification actions. Achieving the climate neutrality objectives requires the replacement of the use of fossil fuels with renewable energy for electricity generation by 78% by 2030, a reduction that leads to an ultimate share of electricity generated from fossil fuels of 14%. This value is in line with national targets to reduce fossil fuels in the national energy (electricity) mix to below 20% by 2030. It becomes evident that the successful implementation of this action is only possible if the national targets for the penetration of renewables (>80%) in the country's energy mix by 2030 are met. Local initiatives - municipal pilot projects for the production of RES (e.g. see Action 1.1.), although they seemingly satisfy a very small share of the total energy needs (<1%), act mainly as a means of raising awareness and mobilising citizens and the business world.  |
|  Impact & cost | Generated renewable energy (if applicable) | >790 GWh (according to the projected 2030 electricity mix, which includes ≈80% RES (86% including hydropower), and assuming that the EE needs remain constant (balancing consumption reduction from saving measures and consumption increase due to heat pumps, in fact an increase in electricity consumption within the Municipality is expected).  |
|   |  Removed/substituted energy, volume, or fuel type | ≈475 GWh (in line with the projected reduction of the contribution of fossil fuels to electricity generation from 62% to 14%).  |

|   |  Comments on implementation | The success or otherwise of this action is mostly based on the mobilisation of property owners, and its implementation is therefore inextricably linked to the implementation of national initiatives (e.g. subsidies, changes in legislation/regulations). Achieving the climate neutrality targets of the IOT requires achieving an annual renovation rate of the building stock of 3.5%, with the majority (60%) of renovations having to achieve energy savings of at least 30-60% (see Section B-1). The organisational and social innovation interventions as defined in Sections C-1 and C-2 as well as the national financial instruments-programmes (see Section A-2) contribute to the achievement of these objectives.  |

|   | Comments on implementation | In order to achieve the climate neutrality targets, it is planned to increase the share of new buildings built to the highest standards and regulations. More specifically, it is foreseen that around 35% of new buildings built will be of energy class A or A+, with the remaining new buildings being at least class B+. Overall, a 50% improvement in energy efficiency is sought compared to the minimum statutory requirements (see Module B-1). The main driver for the implementation of this action is the national and European legislation on minimum energy efficiency standards for new buildings, but the Municipality of Thessaloniki will try to accelerate their adoption through information actions, development of synergies with relevant bodies, etc.  |

|   |  Comments on implementation | As highlighted in the previous sections, the electrification of the energy system and the decoupling from natural gas/oil to meet the thermal needs of the building stock, are key prerequisites for achieving the climate neutrality objectives. Consequently, a significant increase in the percentage-share of thermal needs met by electrical systems (e.g. heat pumps, efficient air conditioning systems, etc.) is required. More specifically, total heating needs by 2030 should be covered by: a) 35% by fossil fuels (current value: 79%), 60% by high efficiency electrical systems (current value: 20%) and 5% by biofuels (current value: 1%). These specific target values were chosen taking into account corresponding projections at European level, market penetration trends of heat pumps, and calculations to meet the 80% carbon dioxide emission reduction target. This transition is a particular challenge as a significant proportion  |

|   |  | of buildings use gas burners for heating. Therefore, as in the case of actions related to building envelope renovation, the success or otherwise of this action is inextricably linked to the implementation of national initiatives (e.g. subsidies, change of legislation/regulations). New EU initiatives such as the 'renovation passports' are supporting the implementation of the action.  |

|   | Action description | As the achievement of climate neutrality of the Municipality of Thessaloniki requires a 21% reduction in the number of journeys made by motorised means, the implementation of teleworking is one of the key measures that should be considered/established.

Its implementation in the Municipality of Thessaloniki is initially proposed to start from the Municipality's services and then to be extended to other public services. The focus will be mainly on employees who travel long distances to and from work on a daily basis.

At the same time, with appropriate incentives (financial support for the purchase of laptops etc.) in private companies, teleworking can be extended to the private sector. Companies that implement the measure to achieve climate neutrality can join the climate neutrality ambassadors of the Municipality of Thessaloniki together with other bodies that will reinforce climate neutrality.  |

In order to achieve the climate neutrality objectives of the Municipality of Thessaloniki and to achieve a 40% increase in the use of public transport and environmentally friendly means of transport, additional networks of cycle paths are proposed in the action.

The Municipality of Thessaloniki, as a member of the URBACT network "RESILIENT EUROPE - RESILIENT EUROPE", has set the objective of formulating Integrated Action Plans to address specific challenges facing the city. In particular, as regards the upgrading and extension of cycling infrastructure, a network of 75 km of cycling infrastructure was designed in principle, including 31 km of primary network, 32 km of secondary and 12 km of local network.

During the planning process, emphasis was placed on the connection with the neighbouring municipalities with a view to creating a metropolitan network of cycling infrastructure and the feasibility of the proposals was examined in terms of the geometric and functional characteristics of the urban road network.  |

|   |  Action description | The action includes the proposed network of sidewalks and redevelopments of the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan with emphasis on the functional interconnection of sidewalks and redevelopments to support green travel. Through the action, the Municipality of Thessaloniki wishes to enable pedestrian mobility from the different regeneration areas to the rest of the areas, providing a unified experience of environmentally friendly mobility that supports sustainable mobility.

Along the routes, it is proposed to use smart technologies and in particular the creation of smart crossings in order to increase the level of safety provided to travellers. The pedestrian routes are extended in the eastern part of the municipality in order to connect neighbourhoods outside the central area.  |

|   |  Comments on implementation | More specifically, in the SUMP the creation of five pedestrian routes is proposed (Moni Latomou - N. Kountouriotis, Evangelistria - Beach front, Urban vineyard of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki - Beach front, Philippou - Tsirogianni and Kautantzoglou - Beach front) which either cross existing pedestrian streets and roads with wide sidewalks or cross road sections of inappropriate infrastructure where the Municipality should intervene to create the appropriate infrastructure and conditions for the use of this infrastructure.

In the east of the Municipality, six routes are proposed (Toumba - Nea Paralia, Toumba-Rema, Papanastasiou - Megaro, Solonos - Patrikou Park, Nea Elvetia Park - Bottsari and Kellarios Ormos - Allatini), which include the installation of smart crossings.

Two supporting projects based on technological  |

Other interventions  |
|   |  Action description | The Action concerns the implementation and operation of competitive shared mobility vehicle services by different private providers of the relevant services. The shared vehicles will be available in different parts of the city (private off-street areas operating as rental and drop-off stations or virtual stations on pavements where the allocation of public space is required). The development of the services will be open to private investors but will need to follow the regulatory framework for the use of public space, and security set by the City. If there is a concession of public space (mainly parking spaces on pavements or other public spaces) there should be a clear framework of reciprocity to the municipality. In the same context, the Municipality will take the initiative to establish and maintain a relevant cooperation network, which is part of the relevant Mobility as a Service (MaaS) network.
Beyond the buffer, the City will be responsible  |

However, the supply and operation of shared bicycles by the Municipality is an alternative or parallel intervention that may be selected at a later stage depending on the progress of the project.

The implementation of Action 2.3.3 relies heavily on private capital that will come from competing micro-mobility car-sharing services. The Municipality of Thessaloniki will ensure the creation of the relevant regulatory framework, as well as the location and layout of the micromobility stations.

Action 3.3.3 is directly related to Action 3.4.4 (Mobility as a Service) and is one of the main interventions for the implementation of an integrated Mobility as a Service for Thessaloniki.  |

|   |  Action description | The Action concerns the implementation of the basic requirements for the operation of an integrated Mobility as a Service (MaaS) system for Thessaloniki.

The MaaS of Thessaloniki will include competitive carpooling and co-passenger services combined with public transport. The Action foresees firstly the preparation of a plan for the implementation of the integrated Mobility as a Service system in Thessaloniki...

The integrated system will be based on the implementation of a neutral platform on which the interconnection of all individual mobility services (information, electronic tickets, payment, etc.) will be based and the possibility of their use in multimodal chains by the travellers.

The Action includes the development of a digital application, available on mobile and web, through which commuters will be able to plan their journey, make transport reservations and purchase tickets and access to them. The design of the system will be such as to allow simultaneous provision of services by more than one digital application (for example one may be operated by an Operator and another by a private digital application provider).

The Action includes a number of supporting interventions for the operation of MaaS, such as the establishment of a governance framework and operating rules for the relevant Ecosystem, and the promotion of MaaS services and implementation.  |

The on demand ridesharing application is also a digital mobile application to support co-pooling, but the main difference from the previous car pooling application is that in this case co-pooling with shared transport means is supported, be it electric cars car sharing (Action 3.8.3), or taxis or even public transport buses (link to Action 32.4.5). In addition to the implementation costs and study costs, the action includes costs to support the start-up and finally a subsidy of part of the passenger transport costs as an economic incentive.

The Action includes promotion of services with a focus on specific categories of users whose trips are attracted by large travel generators, such as students. In addition, measures are proposed to restrict the movement of private cars with fewer than two passengers from specific lanes. In these lanes, vehicles with more than two passengers will be allowed to move (in addition, and for the policing of the measure, systems for the supervision and monitoring of the measure can be provided, which will have to be studied and, if deemed necessary, budgeted for - at this stage, not included in the costing).  |

|   |  Comments on implementation | The supply of the vehicles will be implemented in two phases. The first phase, which is expected to be completed by mid-2024, will involve 130 new vehicles, 12m long, 100% electric vehicles in the fleet of Thessaloniki's public urban transport, of which 110 vehicles with an autonomy of 160km and 20 vehicles with an autonomy of 130km. In Phase B, it is estimated that 240 new zero-emission vehicles will be acquired. For Phase B, the type of vehicles in terms of both size and propulsion technology has not been finalised. Thus, of the total of 515 vehicles currently on the road under the current programme, 370, i.e. 72%, will be zero-emission vehicles. However, the bus electrification target under this action plan is to reach 100% of the City's circulating fleet by 2030. Therefore, all buses operating within the City in 2030 should be electrified (in 2019, baseline year, the number of buses operating within the City was 231 buses).  |

|   | Action description | The path to climate neutrality goes through electrification with the electrification of the public and private vehicle fleet. Other actions in the Plan include the electrification of the fleet of Public Transport, the Municipality and other bodies, while a special action concerns the electrification of urban delivery vehicles and waste collection vehicles.

In order to reach the target of 36% electrification of the private and business fleet by 2035, incentives for the replacement of conventional vehicles for private and business customers are necessary. Currently there are funding schemes available, such as the Buy Electric scheme, which should be strengthened with more emphasis on areas such as the Municipality of Thessaloniki that are required to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

Particular emphasis is also placed on the electrification of the taxi fleet, where funding programmes are also in place, such as green taxis. The entire taxi fleet is expected to be electrified by 2030 through the action.

At the same time, given that the Municipality of Thessaloniki has developed the Electric Vehicle Charging Plan, the action proposes the expansion of the network of charging infrastructure and the relevant actions for the implementation of the Electric Vehicle Charging Plan proposed in the SUMP.  |

|   |  Action description | The Action concerns the creation of competitive car sharing services by different private providers of electric car mobility services. The shared vehicles will be available at various locations in the city (private off-street areas operating as rental and drop-off stations or virtual roadside stations, in which case the allocation of public space is required) equipped with fast chargers. The development of the services will be open to private investors but will need to follow the regulatory framework for the use of public space, charging and security set by the City. Where there is a public space concession (particularly alongside on-street parking) there should be a clear framework for reciprocity to the City. In the same context, the Municipality will take the initiative to set up and maintain a network of cooperation, which is a sub-network of the relevant Mobility as a Service (MaaS) network.
Beyond the buffer, the City will be responsible for the zoning and striping of the shared vehicle parking spaces.  |

|   |  Involved stakeholders | Competent departments of the Municipality of Thessaloniki in cooperation with private providers of car sharing services  |
|   |  Comments on implementation | The app will help the goal of electrifying the private vehicle fleet by replacing the use of conventional cars with shared, electric cars. The target is at 36% (compared to 34% envisaged in the consultation document of the national electrification plan).

The implementation of Action 3.8.3 relies heavily on private capital that will come from competing car sharing services. The Municipality of Thessaloniki will ensure the creation of a relevant regulatory framework (the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure is expected to prepare an institutional framework for the introduction of carsharing, carpooling and caron demand transport), as well as the location and layout of car sharing stations.

Action 3.8.3 is directly related to Action 3.4.4 (Mobility as a Service) and is one of the main interventions for the implementation of an integrated Mobility as a Service for Thessaloniki.  |

The data collected in the data space will come from the participants in the Transport and Logistics Network, i.e. from existing systems and observatories. This primary data will be processed to produce useful knowledge that will be fed back to the Ecosystem to support the decision making of the entities and enterprises that are part of it (Digital Services to the Ecosystem). In the same framework, a digital twin will be developed for the impact assessment of alternative scenarios of climate neutrality policies and actions, but this is a separate Action due to the complexity of its implementation.

The basis for the implementation of Actions 3.9.2-3.9.3 is the existing Mobility Living Lab operated by HIT/ CERTH, which will be expanded to include more data and interfaces with other data spaces. The Living Lab will support a fourfold helix, i.e. interaction with Government/Agencies, Business, Research Institutions and Citizens.  |

It will also calculate other parameters related to the usage targets of specific means of transport given the current situation and the availability of resources (for example, if there is an increasing demand for shared means of transport that are out of stock, the application will give priority to other means of transport that are under-used at the time). The application will evaluate the degree of penetration of different methods of influencing commuters, for example gamification, loyalty points, other incentives and accordingly suggest the optimal use of one or a combination of the methods of influence by the mobile application.  |

|   |  | strike a balance between the operational requirements for high efficiency and low costs and the social requirements for low CO_{2} emissions, high safety and sustainability.

The action includes the development of the urban freight transport ecosystem in the city of Thessaloniki involving both public and private actors. The aim of the action is to develop appropriate models of cooperation in order to optimise the urban freight transport processes in Thessaloniki and improve the quality of life of its inhabitants.

The Municipality of Thessaloniki will be the coordinator of the ecosystem which will consist of stakeholders of the quadrilateral helix. These actors in the freight transport and logistics sector can be classified into three broad categories, as follows:

Urban Logistics Actors: shippers, freight forwarders and freight carriers, last mile deliveries, final consumers/residents, local businesses and retailers.

Authorities and Accelerators: the Municipality of Thessaloniki, the Region of Central Macedonia, research and academic institutions (CERTH/IMET, AUTH), regulatory authorities, the Regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry, civil society, scholars.

Urban Logistics Facilitators: property/vacancy owners, real estate agents, technology providers, providers of sustainable and flexible transport solutions especially for last mile deliveries.  |

|   |  Action type | Other Interventions  |
|   |  Action description | In the Municipality of Thessaloniki and especially in streets outside the central area there are several unoccupied shops. At the same time, and given that these roads have limited lanes, the stops of lorries for unloading create problems of both traffic congestion and increased environmental pollution. In addition, the limited space in existing shops does not allow traders to maintain a high level of stock, which increases the requirements for more frequent loading and unloading.

The action includes the recording of unoccupied stores within the central area of the Municipality  |

|   | Action description | The action includes the development of a regulatory framework and incentives for the collection and provision of digital urban freight data by private parties (action C.10). This will facilitate the monitoring of transport activities and the analysis of data to improve the transport of goods. The mapping of transport companies and stakeholders collecting data will lead to the mapping of the ecosystem in which they will be given appropriate incentives to link up with observatories and living labs.

The observatory will then be developed to monitor urban freight transport and its impact on the environment and the local economy. The observatory will collect data through appropriate interfaces, process it and provide support to decision makers through appropriate artificial intelligence tools. The observatory will evaluate the results and through appropriate interfaces feed the monitoring of environmental footprint reduction indicators and their impact on traffic, which will be carried out in the tool to be developed in Action 3.6.9 Carbon Progress Indicator Monitoring System and Climate Transition Observatory.  |

|   |  Action type | Technical  |
|   |  Action description | An urban area is classified as an "Urban Heat Island (UHI)" when it is significantly warmer than nearby peri-urban or rural areas due to man-made infrastructure and human activities.
A key factor in the creation of the urban heat island phenomenon is the covering of the ground with artificial non-water permeable materials that do not allow rainwater to be absorbed. In addition, buildings and narrow streets trap heat by reducing air flow. Human activities such as heating buildings and driving cars also add heat to the environment.
Vegetation and other nature-based applications and solutions (rain gardens, grass and  |

|   |  Action description | This action involves upgrading sensors to collect data on air quality, specifically targeting air pollution and meteorological parameters. The existing sensor network, Municipal IoT Sensor Network (AIRTHINGS), will be upgraded with IoT technology to enhance its capabilities. This network was initially created under the AIRTHINGS project and is now operated with the municipality's own resources. The upgraded network will help identify air pollution mitigation strategies in the region, helping to improve air quality.

Replacement of the 6 Network Stations with energy autonomous, powered by photovoltaic panels and equipped with new generation pollution measurement analyzers, which do not require continuous use of air conditioning for their operation. In addition, the network for measuring air pollution and meteorological parameters will be upgraded by replacing six stations with energy-autonomous stations powered by photovoltaic panels. These upgraded stations will be equipped with new generation pollution measurement analysers that operate without continuous air conditioning, reducing energy consumption.

In addition, a multi-source carbon footprint assessment and monitoring platform is being developed. This platform will integrate data from various sources and interfaces to develop an integrated CO2 emissions monitoring system. The platform is being developed by HIT/CERTH in cooperation with the Municipality of Thessaloniki (Detailed description Action 3.9.4).  |

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

Mitigation actions for the remaining 20%.

Installation of PV at the Efkarpia Waste Transfer Station and at the rehabilitated Tagarades landfill to meet the energy needs of FODSA through RES

The FODSA has taken actions for the installation of PV stations as follows:

Installation of PV in Tagarades with non-injection of energy into the grid (Zero Feed-in scheme) with an installed capacity of 182,03kW (Local Community of Agia Paraskevi, District of Thermi, P.E. Thessaloniki). A contract has already been signed to commission a study for the installation of PV

Installation of PV in the SMA Evkarpia with Virtual Net Metering (Virtual Net Metering) with an installed capacity of 999,53 kW (Evkarpia area of Pavlou Mela, P.E. Thessaloniki). A primary request has been posted on KIMDES and the procurement procedure for the award of a contract for the study for the installation of PV

From the installation of the PV plants, the energy produced will primarily cover the needs of the FADSA's facilities, while it will contribute to the saving of primary energy, the reduction of pollutants and a very significant reduction in energy costs.

Energy production from biogas

A. The Power Plant (HPP) from the biogas of the Tagarades landfill

The E/I station at the Tagarades landfill was constructed in the period 2005-2006, while it became operational in November 2006. The plant is a companion project of the landfill and pumps the biogas produced in order to be used for electricity production, which is injected into the distribution network of the PPP. The biogas is combusted in internal combustion engines (gas engines) in the most appropriate way in order to limit emissions to the atmosphere. The plant operates 24/7/365 and is the second largest landfill biogas energy recovery facility in Greece. The facility includes all the necessary electrical and mechanical equipment for the uninterrupted and efficient operation of the plant. In particular, it includes four gas engines (1.26 MWel each), as well as peripheral equipment.

B. The power plant (E/P) from the biogas of the Mavrorachi landfill

The E/I station at Mavrorachi Landfill was licensed and constructed between September 2017 and July 2020, and was put into trial operation in August 2020. The regular operation of the facility started at the end of February 2021. The plant is a companion project to the Mavrorachi Landfill and pumps the biogas produced through vertical wells and horizontal collection networks. The electricity produced is injected into the medium voltage grid of the HEDNO. The biogas is burned in state-of-the-art internal combustion engines (gas engines) in the most appropriate way in order to limit emissions to the atmosphere. The plant operates 24/7/365 and is the most modern facility for the energy recovery of biogas from landfills in Greece. The installation includes all the necessary electrical and mechanical equipment for the uninterrupted and efficient operation of the plant. In particular, it includes three gas engines (1.17 MWel each), as well as peripheral equipment.

The plant produces electricity from the biogas of the waste that arrives at the landfill. According to a representative of the contractor, the electricity produced amounts to 26,500 MVH per year, and can power around 7,000 households, while capturing 140,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. In particular, the plant exploits biogas produced from organic matter accumulated in the landfill after anaerobic treatment. The biogas is mainly methane and is one of the most greenhouse gas contributors. The plant has three 1.15 megawatt dynamics engines separately. The availability of the plant is close to 95%, i.e. the installed capacity is almost the same as that produced. At the same time, about

,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide are saved.

## 3. Coal Binding Agriculture

Pilot application of carbon sequestration agriculture in the Environmental Parks of the FODSA KM for soil remediation in contaminated soils, with emphasis on remediated landfills in the Region of Central Macedonia.

Under the European Green Deal and the new Common Agricultural Policy 2023-2027 (CAP), the European Union has set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, in order to achieve climate neutrality at EU level by 2050. In particular, one of the environmental objectives of the CAP 2023-27 is to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, including through reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon capture and sequestration, and to promote sustainable energy. The proposal aims at piloting carbon capture techniques in agriculture on rehabilitated former landfills of the FODSA KM (Environmental Parks of Thermi and Derveni). By exploiting former uncontrolled waste disposal sites for the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) methods with specific crops, an environmentally degraded area, which cannot support other types of crops, is transformed into a site that will contribute to achieving climate neutrality in the future.

## 4. Nature-based solutions (nature-based solutions)

Three actions with nature-based solutions contribute to removing CO2 from the atmosphere and reducing residual CO2 emissions.

(1) Densification of urban greenery in the Municipality of Thessaloniki. Tree planting is one of the most effective methods for CO capture2. In the Municipality of Thessaloniki, the estimated CO2 sequestration capacity is 4,007 tn per year, through the existing cover and planting of 50,000 new trees. This is an excellent step in the right direction to increase the density of urban greening, especially in public and common areas.

(2) Similar is the action for the creation of a Metropolitan Park of Memory - Holocaust Museum that combines historical and social memory with environmental sustainability. On a site of about 70 hectares, the park could accommodate various species of trees and plants that would contribute to CO2 sequestration while raising awareness about the consequences of war and totalitarian regimes.

(3) The pilot action to curb the heat island effect in a district of Thessaloniki, by increasing the green cover and the water permeable surfaces, can be an effective measure to reduce the energy used for cooling and therefore the CO2 emissions.

## 4.3 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

In Module B-3 the Municipality of Thessaloniki presents the monitoring, evaluation and learning indicators related to the implementation of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan 2030. A set of measurable and verifiable key performance indicators (KPIs) is an important prerequisite for monitoring, evaluation and continuous analysis of the Municipality's achievements. The indicators were selected from the NetZeroCities comprehensive indicator sets and are related to the action areas and impact pathways listed in Section B-1. The selected indicators are presented in Table B-3.1 along with their associated outcomes and impacts, targets, and evaluation points, and Table B-3.2 presents each indicator with its metadata.

For the action area "Smart City - Innovation - Governance" there is no clear reference to specific action indicators, so their selection is approximate. The selected indicators are presented in Table B-

In order to remove existing barriers to climate neutrality (see Section A-3.2), the Municipality of Thessaloniki has defined specific interventions to improve its organisation and governance, with the ultimate goal of achieving its climate targets by 2030. First, it wishes to build on the Climate City Contract (CCC), which has recently been developed as a useful governance tool, with the main objective of accelerating the transition to climate neutral and sustainable cities. The Municipality together with other stakeholders (municipalities, educational institutions, public interest companies, NERC, etc.) is going to sign the CMP, through which it will ensure the long-term commitment and cooperation of a large number of stakeholders. It is important to ensure the participation of the Region of Central Macedonia, other Municipalities and Regions of the country, as well as relevant Ministries, in order to achieve climate cooperation between different levels of government (local, regional, national). With the CSP, the Municipality will be led to more efficient and inclusive decision-making processes and to attract new ideas and stakeholders, gaining a strategic advantage in the efficiency of climate actions.

Also, as discussed in Section A-3.3, the City has and is developing the Office of Resilience to improve its organizational structure related to the implementation of climate actions. The Office of Resilience will be responsible for coordinating the relevant City departments, as well as organizing, prioritizing, and monitoring the City's climate neutrality-related actions. In addition, the Office will ensure data collection, the smooth circulation of information and the acceleration of bureaucratic procedures, helping to address fragmentation and/or overlapping responsibilities, as well as any delays in the context of tenders, project awards, etc. (key systemic barriers, Section A-3.2). By upgrading the Office dedicated to resilience and climate change, the Municipality gains a strategic advantage in terms of efficiency of actions, participation in synergies, etc. and achieve alignment with relevant national and international policies.

In addition, the Municipality has designed a participatory governance model under the Office of Resilience to further improve its organisational structure, strengthen its partnerships with stakeholders, both governmental and non-governmental, and promote citizen participation in climate neutrality decision-making. The participatory model is based on the Climate Coordination Group, which is divided into 4 sub-groups, each of which is tasked with addressing existing barriers in the sectors: Governance and Policy, Financing, Learning and Education, Citizen Awareness (key systemic barriers, Section A-3.2). Each sub-group is composed of relevant stakeholders (municipalities, regions, chambers, businesses, etc.) and citizens, and will function as a Local Climate Team (LCT). The participatory model of the municipality promotes multi-level governance, collaboration and exchange of know-how and good practices with other stakeholders and democratic participation, leading to increased uptake of climate actions and a just energy transition.

The Municipality of Thessaloniki, as part of its governance, intends to adopt the policy of Green Public Procurement (GPP). GPP allows public authorities to contract for goods, services and projects with a lower environmental impact throughout their life cycle, compared to other available goods, services and projects that perform the same primary function. In this way, the municipality contributes to direct emission reductions and energy and money savings, especially when the full life-cycle cost of a contract is taken into account and not just the purchase price.

Regarding access to investment capital, the Municipality intends to work on the development of new business models, in cooperation with investment institutions (such as energy service companies, banking institutions, businesses, etc.) and electricity providers and operators, which will facilitate access to financial instruments and capital for energy infrastructure upgrades. In this way, the City will unlock significant funds to be allocated to energy saving projects towards climate neutrality. Increasing the rate of energy upgrades will lead to an immediate reduction in the cost of electricity bills, addressing energy poverty. We note that TIF has already received a loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and under certain circumstances, this is something it is willing to do again. In addition, the EIB loan was complemented by funds from the Public Investment
CITY OF THESSALONIKI
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
4

Programme, thus increasing the available investment funds (a total of €25 million).

In addition, the Municipality has a strategic priority to save energy from large consumers. In order to identify the largest energy consumers (electrical/thermal) within the Municipality, a specific study will be carried out with the ultimate goal of planning the installation of CHP/RES and solar systems. In the same strategic priority, the Municipality will try to enter into voluntary agreements/memoranda of cooperation with large consumers (hospitals, universities, hotels, etc.) who wish to save energy, while the Municipality will provide them with compensatory benefits (e.g. reduction of fees, free parking spaces, etc.).

The Municipality of Thessaloniki, in order to further increase its strategic advantage in forthcoming partnerships and funding towards climate neutrality, will carry out energy audits and certifications of selected municipal buildings, the development of digital representations (BIM) and assessment of the intelligence of these buildings (based on the SRI - Smart readiness indicator method). In this way, thorough solutions will be developed for the conversion of municipal buildings to near-zero emissions.

With regard to Transport &amp; Logistics, it is proposed to create two sub-networks of stakeholders that will help to support the climate neutrality objectives and will also serve the broader objectives of well-managed mobility as well as the transition to a digitised mobility situation. The proposed cooperation networks can operate autonomously or within the overall participatory governance proposal of this paper, but in any case the Municipality of Thessaloniki should take the initiative for their creation, mainly because it does not have the competence in some traffic and mobility related subjects, such as Public Transport, which are however, crucial for the success of the actions described.

The first network concerns the cooperation of different bodies with responsibilities for managing individual parts of infrastructure and mobility services. The institutionalization of a cooperation scheme for multimodal Traffic and Mobility Management issues between entities such as the Region of Central Macedonia, OSEΘ, the Municipality of Thessaloniki, the transport project executing agencies, the other Municipalities of the Metropolitan area with the assistance of EKETA/IMET, can effectively contribute both to the planning and execution of actions that have to do with the overall management of all transport means and infrastructure and with the integration of different management systems for the direct and integrated management of the transport infrastructure.

The Action Plan includes a series of technological actions that have as a direct or indirect result the digitalisation of transport and the acceleration of the introduction of innovation in the transport system of the Municipality of Thessaloniki:

Creating a data space for mobility
Creating a common infrastructure to support Mobility as a Service schemes
Physical mobility services based on the use of digital applications
Strengthening the role of the smart mobility living lab operated by CERTH/IMET.

The second network concerns the cooperation of stakeholders to coordinate the development of the entire digital infrastructure proposed in relation to transport, and the multiplier effect of this infrastructure. The network has the ultimate goal of creating an Ecosystem, and adopting a governance framework that ensures the fair and equitable participation of all parties, from both the public and private sectors.

In order to monitor the implementation and results of the SEAP, it is proposed to establish a mechanism for monitoring the SEAP. The mechanism will include an observatory for the implementation of the SEAP, as well as the definition of critical indicators of the effectiveness of the
CITY OF THESSALONIKI
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
5

implementation of the SEAP interventions. Depending on the results of the implementation or the emergence of new circumstances, there may be a redefinition of the objectives and actions, with a corresponding study, as well as a new participatory consultation of the stakeholders involved.

Finally, it is proposed to examine and adopt new business models that aim to raise funds from alternative sources to finance investments related to the Action Plan, as well as to create a new framework of cooperation between the Municipality of Thessaloniki and private parties, through the concession and exploitation of public space for the development of actions that serve the objectives of the Mobility Action Plan, e.g. incentives for the widespread use of electromobility, leasing of public space for the installation and operation of electric vehicles, etc. The new business models address three main areas: Electromobility, Mobility as a Service and Urban Distribution &amp; Logistics.

In the area of digital governance and innovation, through the action on making public data and public information available, citizens will have access to public data available through platforms in machine-readable form through open standards and easy access for all. The Municipality of Thessaloniki already has a number of open data platforms, such as the Municipality of Thessaloniki Open Data Portal and the Municipality of Thessaloniki Risk Data Portal. The upgrade of the e-services offered by the Municipality to citizens aims to improve their functionality immediately. Through the upgrade of these platforms, urban centres can become more efficient and interconnected while facilitating the management and monitoring of big data and providing new services for citizens and relevant stakeholders.

Privacy and information management mechanisms available either from smart sensors, logging devices or spatially enabled data discovery/disposal mechanisms. The action on the urban governance model with a focus on transparency and cybersecurity will emphasise the interoperability of the different information systems with each other and cybersecurity. It includes the upgrading of the Electronic Document Circulation System to cover new services mainly concerning documents with a financial scope (e.g. invoices, multiannual commitment decisions, etc.) and the creation of a repository of the Municipality of Thessaloniki for the digitised archives of the Historical Archive of the Municipal Council.

The digitisation of documents and procedures includes actions to streamline administrative procedures and reduce paper consumption in order to satisfy citizens by enabling them to access information from anywhere. Already before 2020, the Municipality of Thessaloniki operates an Electronic Document Circulation System (EDCS). As part of these actions, the existing web portals will be upgraded, as well as mobile applications will be developed for easy access to public services for citizens. In this way, citizens will be able to more easily submit documents and follow procedures they have requested, from wherever they are. Finally, digital signature and authentication systems will be implemented to ensure the security and legitimacy of online transactions with public bodies.

The action on teleworking and commuting refers to the promotion of initiatives related to teleworking. Teleworking was successfully implemented during the pandemic in the Municipality of Thessaloniki, but due to the cyber-attack on the Municipality of Thessaloniki in 2020 it was not implemented again. By upgrading the municipality's cybersecurity systems, it is now possible to re-promote it, which can significantly contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as it significantly reduces the daily commuting of employees. Administrations can encourage employees in both the public and private sectors to adopt flexible working policies that allow them to work remotely, either full or part-time, by providing them with infrastructure and support for remote working (e.g. laptops).

Organisational and intergovernmental innovation interventions on land use and environment face systemic barriers to activating the pathways mentioned and implementing sectoral actions. They are located in issues of planning, organisation, and social acceptance. The proposed interventions address systemic barriers and opportunities through improved organisational structures and
CITY OF THESSALONIKI

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

governance models. This includes creating a framework for cooperation between municipal authorities, local stakeholders and residents, and strengthening participation in decision-making processes and project implementation.

## Design interventions include

The preparation of a strategic plan for each intervention with the typical strategic planning modules (analysis, objectives, action plan, implementation, measurement and evaluation). The plan should also include the governance of the interventions, the development of infrastructure, the facilitation of licensing procedures and the securing of support from the local community.

The preparation of a Municipal Emission Reduction Plan. According to Law 4936 "National Climate Law - Transition to climate neutrality and adaptation to climate change", and Article 16. "By 31 March 2023, each first-tier local government (LGU) shall prepare a Municipal Emission Reduction Plan (Municipal Emission Reduction Plan). The Municipal Emission Reduction Plan shall calculate the carbon footprint in accordance with para. 2, investigates, identifies and prioritises in an evidence-based manner the necessary measures and actions for reducing emissions of the local authority concerned, is compatible with the objectives and policies of the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), and is reviewed at least every five years. In particular, it shall include an inventory and emission reduction targets for energy-consuming buildings, equipment and infrastructure used by the first-tier local authorities and the legal entities supervised by them, and may also include removals."

Contributing to the National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (YPE, 2016), which provides, among other things, for the need to maintain a Special Register of Planted Surfaces and the creation of a data bank that will be continuously updated with the notifications of the construction of planted surfaces submitted to the local building services. In Section 4.12 Built Environment, Measure 4, the ESIF supports the increase of urban greening. "The relationship between built space and greenery will need to change to balance the coming climate changes. This will include making use of underutilised sites, redistributing and restoring green space in the built environment. Finally, the integration of greenery into existing structures (roofs, vertical surfaces, etc.) should be a priority."

## The organisational interventions include

Develop synergies and partnerships with stakeholders or programmes at regional, national or international level that share the same climate commitment.

Working with local organisations, citizens' groups, educational institutions and businesses to achieve synergies and strengthen interventions. This may include training programmes, voluntary activities and financial support.

The development of strategic partnerships between public administration, the private sector and local stakeholders can help to strengthen interventions. Through these relationships, common strategies can be achieved, knowledge and resources can be exchanged, and the smooth management and operation of the infrastructure that will be created can be achieved.

## Public awareness interventions include

Educate stakeholders and the public on the need for action for sustainable development and environmental protection. This can be done through educational programmes, seminars, talks and events.

Consultation with the local community of Thessaloniki for decisions regarding proposed
CITY OF THESSALONIKI
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

interventions, crowdsourcing of design and improvement ideas.

Encourage local community participation in the interventions through various actions, such as information campaigns, meetings and consultations with residents, participatory planting schemes, protection of RES infrastructure in common areas.
Educate and inform the public about the benefits of photovoltaic systems and wind farms and their contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This may include information campaigns, events and visits to installations of renewable energy systems.

With regard to Solid Waste, it is proposed to create a network of initiatives and partnerships between the parties involved in the management and recycling of MSW, aiming at the development of common strategies and targets for the recycling of packaging and biowaste in Thessaloniki. The network has the ultimate goal of creating an ecosystem with the active participation of stakeholders and citizens, and the adoption of a governance framework that will ensure the fair and equitable participation of all

# 5.2 Module C-2 Social and Other Innovation Interventions

Module C-2 consists of a summary table presenting the social innovation interventions of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, with the stakeholders involved, the correlation with climate neutrality and the additional benefits (C-2.1), and a sub-section that provides detailed information on these interventions (C-2.2).

## C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions – textual and visual elements

In order to remove existing barriers to climate neutrality (see Section A-3.2), the Municipality of Thessaloniki, in addition to the interventions for improving organisation and governance mentioned in Section C-1, has also identified interventions for social innovation, with the ultimate aim of further contributing to the achievement of its climate goals by 2030. Initially, the Municipality will establish Local Climate Teams (LCTs) as part of the new participatory governance model, as described above. Through the Local Climate Action Teams, the involvement of citizens and stakeholders in decision making leads to the implementation of actions that have secured the acceptance of society, and thus to a just and democratic energy transition.

The Climate Neutrality Action Plan will be updated taking into account key indicators for a just energy transition and social cohesion, in line with relevant strategies and initiatives (e.g. Covenant of Mayors). The assessment of key parameters related to the energy poverty phenomenon involves measuring and monitoring selected indicators related to energy poverty - including: heating/cooling rating days, share of buildings renovated annually, percentage of households that cannot be adequately heated, percentage of households living more than 1km from the nearest public transport station, percentage of municipalities in an arrangement with energy supply companies, etc.

In addition, the Municipality intends to develop an Energy Transition Office with a public service platform. This new structure will function as a support office for citizens and businesses interested in renovating their buildings, in the sense of a "one-stop-shop" for the provision of relevant services (e.g. technical specifications, available funding programmes, engineering advice, etc.). Useful information material on the possibilities and requirements for energy upgrading of buildings will also be available on the public service platform, through which individuals will be able to submit and resolve any questions. The Office aims to increase private initiatives related to energy upgrading of buildings in order to promote climate neutrality through the private building sector, but also to attract new investments - businesses locally and create green jobs.

To implement a broad publicity action on climate change, the Municipality chooses to organise an annual Energy Forum - Conference, with the participation of many stakeholders from different levels of government, as well as non-governmental organisations, such as NGOs and citizens. In this way, open dialogue, exchange of experiences, good practices and know-how, attraction and promotion of new ideas for the climate neutrality of the Municipality, creation of new synergies are promoted. The aim is to improve the level of knowledge of all stakeholders on climate, to promote new ideas and collaborative initiatives, to attract new investments - businesses, with the ultimate goal of a just and democratic energy transition.

For the transport sector and the active participation of civil society in climate neutrality issues, the Municipality of Thessaloniki will synergize with organized groups of cyclists, pedestrians and
CITY OF THESSALONIKI
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

people with disabilities, with the organization of a sustainable urban mobility forum playing an important role in the relevant ecosystem. All of the above will be supported by various cooperation networks that the Municipality plans to develop either with businesses and start-ups active in digital mobility &amp;MaaS, or with commercial companies and logistics and urban distribution companies. Finally, the widespread use of the mobility Living Lab and the integration of citizens in it as a 4° helix following the EU proposals for citizens' engagement in Living Labs is one of the actions that the Municipality of Thessaloniki is expected to promote in cooperation with EKETA/ IMET as coordinator of THESSM@LL.

The transition to climate neutrality and the acceleration of innovation in the transport systems of modern cities should be combined with the possibility of unrestricted accessibility for all social groups, such as people with reduced mobility, low-income, vulnerable groups, etc. Research shows that public transport users belonging to low-income families, women, the elderly and people with reduced mobility identify transport systems without comfort and safety and with limited access. Inclusive and accessible public transport systems are one of the main priorities of the Municipality of Thessaloniki in the process of reorganising its bus system, as well as in the planning of the multimodal transport system with the introduction of the metro and innovative micro-mobility and shared vehicle systems.

In addition, the Municipality, recognizing the importance of the participation of the younger generation in climate actions, proposes targeted information and education actions, in cooperation with educational institutions, especially in primary schools (e.g. storytelling, puzzles, treasure hunts, visits to demonstration facilities, digital media, games, etc.). The actions will be implemented by involving students and teachers in actions related to the goal of climate neutrality (e.g. protection and maintenance of green spaces (pocket parks, planted rooms, etc.) of the Municipality of Thessaloniki. This approach improves the knowledge background on climate from childhood, gets the younger generation involved in climate action and promotes new ideas/initiatives.

Finally, the Municipality pays special attention to the Thematic Training Actions, which concern both the employees of the Municipality and the citizens. The training actions for municipal employees will concern procurement through Green Public Procurement (GPP), drafting of technical specifications, tendering and award procedures, in order to promote the reduction of environmental pollutants and accelerate the implementation of climate actions. Training actions for citizens will be related to private initiative towards climate neutrality (e.g. energy efficient household appliances (ecolabel, Ecodesign), possibilities of self-production through RES, etc.). It is expected that these actions will strengthen the knowledge base on climate and private initiatives that will help to attract new business investments, create green jobs and accelerate towards climate neutrality.

In addition, in the transport sector in particular, the various information and awareness-raising actions for the general public on issues related to electromobility, active mobility (cycling, walking) and the promotion of public transport and multimodal transport are of great importance. In addition, specific awareness-raising campaigns for tourists and cruise visitors, as well as campaigns promoting car pooling/ ridesharing are also expected to be of benefit.

The use of augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) techniques combined with digital representations allows citizens to be informed and participate in the actions of the Municipality that promote climate neutrality as the proposed interventions are visualized and the expected benefits are understood. This achieves an interactive experiential presentation of the design of the municipality's regeneration/interventions through virtual environments for both planners and citizens, leading to greater awareness and adoption. The creation of Digital Innovation hubs and incubators of high-tech companies based in the city and the use of the city's open data for business opportunities and value creation is an immediate priority for the municipality. At the same time, the provision of an
CITY OF THESSALONIKI
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

online platform for human capital utilization and job placement is envisaged.

The action on the **education and training of citizens in new technologies by sector and employment category** concerns the creation of training seminars aimed at further training the citizens of the Municipality of Thessaloniki in new technologies and the simultaneous provision of a construction and collective space suitably equipped with modern electronic and mechanical equipment. This action aims to reduce the digital inequality between the different population groups of the city and provide equal opportunities for all and promote an entrepreneurial ecosystem of circular economy and synergy.

Finally, through the **enhancement of citizen participation in municipal actions with Gamification techniques / Voting**, citizens will have direct and full information and the possibility of active participation in the decision-making of the municipality and the participation of citizens in municipal actions related to the energy transition is enhanced. Utilising new technologies and solutions (e.g. digital participation platforms, gamification with avatars, hackathons, ideathons, etc.) a network of partnerships and initiatives is promoted putting citizens at the heart of the smart cities ecosystem with co-creation strategies, while meeting their requirements.

A series of social innovation interventions for the development of smart city applications can contribute to the activation and social acceptance of the Land Use and AFOLU actions. They complement and reinforce the organisation and governance interventions mentioned above. They include:

Application for adoption and digital management of planted trees, monitoring the health and growth of trees. This can be done using sensors and wireless networks to detect soil moisture, temperature and air quality, offering remote monitoring and management. The platform can also include functions for citizen participation, suggestion of planting sites, tree adoption, and other social participation activities to increase tree planting in Thessaloniki.
Digital monitoring of photovoltaic systems in public space: Development of a management platform for the monitoring of photovoltaic systems in public and common areas. The platform can provide information on energy production, panel performance, carbon dioxide emissions reduced by the use of solar energy. It can also include solutions to reduce vandalism of equipment or removal of equipment installed in public spaces.
Smart wind farm management systems with an application that will provide information on the wind farm's energy production, the performance of the wind turbines and the status of the equipment. It can provide alerts of any problems or potential failures and allow remote monitoring and audits.

Regarding the Solid Waste sector, the Municipality aims to fully **inform and raise awareness on recycling**. This intervention is aimed at informing citizens about the environmental and economic importance of recycling, with the ultimate aim of adopting the principles of the Circular Economy. In addition, it aims to design and produce communication material to promote recycling in social media and mass media. Particular emphasis is also placed on the organisation of the annual recycling festival to raise awareness among citizens, businesses and students. Also included are educational programmes and awareness-raising events for citizens and students such as a second-hand bazaar, a recycling festival and the operation of a citizens' information hotline for all waste streams. Implementation of a comprehensive information and awareness programme for citizens on the implementation of the **separate collection of bio-waste**. Special awareness-raising activities for schools, which will take place in the Environmental Parks under the responsibility of the FEDSA, as well as the construction of an Environmental Education Recycling Park. Particular emphasis will be placed on special campaigns aimed at young people, such as schools.

The **waste prevention plan** refers to the design and implementation of measures and practices
CITY OF THESSALONIKI
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
1

aimed at reducing the volume and burden of waste generated. The implementation of the plan will focus on promoting circular consumption, information, awareness raising and providing tools for citizens (such as guides, studies, technical standards) to move from a linear to a circular model of behaviour and consumption. In addition, awareness-raising and information campaigns will be carried out targeting the general public or specific consumer groups and presenting success stories of prevention programmes already in place.

At the same time, voluntary agreements with social networks and companies are promoted to reduce waste at source through systematic repair and reconstruction, promoting the design of products for easy disassembly. In addition, programmatic agreements with social networks are planned to develop collection of specific streams, reuse actions and promotion in secondary materials.

In addition, the implementation of pay-as-you-throw (POP) systems is foreseen. A "pay-as-you-throw" system is a system whereby waste producers are charged based on the actual amount of waste they produce. In application of this system, the calculation of the uniform fee for cleaning and lighting may also be based on the production of waste per household or building complex, professional activity, urban or municipal unit, provided that the first-tier local authority concerned has a system for measuring the waste produced or for one of the waste streams produced.

With the aim of reducing food waste, it is proposed to support free food distribution through voluntary agreements by the catering, tourism and retail sectors. In particular, actions are proposed to save and provide food and food at every level of the food chain, as well as awareness-raising programmes on food waste and strengthening the prevention of food waste. In addition, appropriate guides will be produced which will include techniques for food waste management in places of sanitary interest.

## 6 Outlook and next steps

**Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration – textual elements**

The Climate Contract of the City of Thessaloniki was signed on 8 September 2023 with a multitude of stakeholders involved in climate neutrality in all sectors participating in its signing. The actors involved in the signing of the Climate Contract represent all stakeholders in the triple helix, private sector/business, public authorities and the academic research community. Citizens will also play a

key role in the implementation of the action plan, both through social innovation actions and participation in the co-creation of interventions.

The priorities that the Municipality of Thessaloniki has set for the implementation of the Action Plan relate on the one hand to the prioritization of actions on its part and on the other hand to synergies with the other Greek cities participating in the EU initiative for the mobilization of the National Government and relevant stakeholders in order to achieve the national targets.

More generally, the energy and building and heating sectors are the most energy-intensive sectors with the highest GHG emissions. However, the majority of actions related to these sectors are outside the competence of the Municipality of Thessaloniki. The priority actions that fall within the competence of the Municipality of Thessaloniki are: Implementation of the relevant renovation and energy upgrades of municipal buildings, Conversion of the entire municipal fleet (municipal vehicles and refuse collection vehicles) to electric.

The transport &amp; logistics and waste sectors include the majority of the actions under the responsibility of the Municipality and their implementation can start immediately.

For transport &amp; logistics: implementation of the entire SUMP and the strengthening of the traffic management system of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, development of the Sustainable Urban Freight Transport Plan (SUVM) for the more detailed description of the relevant interventions in order to optimize urban distribution in the Municipality of Thessaloniki and the creation of an ecosystem for the development of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and the promotion of multimodality.

For waste: Implement the whole of the PRSP in order to achieve the ambitious targets set to reach the European packaging and bio-waste recycling rates.

Important for achieving climate neutrality is the adoption of digital actions through the creation of a cross-sectoral Living Lab and the corresponding digital data infrastructures. The existing Thessaloniki Smart Mobility Living Lab is the model for the creation of the relevant Roadmap.

It is necessary to establish a mechanism to monitor indicators of carbonisation progress and a climate transition observatory. Its implementation requires monitoring of relevant indicators (KPIs) at regular intervals (2025, 2027, 2030). The Municipality of Thessaloniki has a Platform for Assessment and Monitoring of its Footprint.

In addition, the Municipality of Thessaloniki together with the other Greek cities of the network will claim specific resources from the Central Government for the achievement of the actions that mainly concern the exceeding of the national targets:

Incentives to achieve the increased electrification rate of the car fleet compared to the national target.
Incentives for the electrification of private car fleets, especially those involved in urban deliveries.
Increased percentage of RES use compared to the national target.
Creation of funding programmes mainly for actions that are implemented by private individuals (households and businesses), such as replacement of heating systems, building renovations, as well as upgrading of lighting systems and electrical appliances.

Finally, it plans to seek partnerships with large private organisations that will act as "Climate Neutrality Ambassadors" to engage them in climate neutrality actions. These actions will involve both carbonization of their operations and "green" donations for the broader benefit of the local community.

# 1 Introduction

Thessaloniki's motivation to join the EU Mission “100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030” and the city's commitments to climate action. Aims of the document.

Municipality of Thessaloniki acknowledges the global challenges and the role of the cities to act proactively to mitigate the effects of climate crisis and implement robust, approaches to address current and future challenges.

The city's main challenge is to rapidly adapt sustainable systemic changes including redesigning and delivering urban infrastructures and services that enhance citizen's participation, connectivity and community, shape a thriving and sustainable city, build a dynamic urban economy, become responsive and support climate resilience and disaster management. Tremendous opportunities for the city to be improved, advanced, and maintain its contribution to the goals of sustainable development lie also in the utilization of big data computing and the underpinning technologies, and in the implementation of their novel applications.

Thessaloniki aims to become a climate-neutral and smart city by 2030, reducing the expected CO₂ emissions within its municipal boundaries by 80%. Achieving the target will transform Thessaloniki into a sustainable, resilient and attractive city with positive benefits for public health, accessibility and well-being of citizens. This requires, on the one hand, robust policies and investing in ambitious actions, concerning public space, processes and resources that are within its sphere of competence and go beyond existing plans and strategies and, on the other hand, mobilising and involving relevant stakeholders, institutions and businesses to achieve targets in various sectors that are higher than the corresponding national targets.

Thessaloniki's pathways towards climate neutrality crosses various sectors for which the Municipality of Thessaloniki has a specific vision with specific measurable targets been set. More specifically:

Electricity: widespread installation of Renewable energy sources (RES) in public space and buildings. Thessaloniki will become a pioneer in promoting the replacement of fossil fuels by RES at national level.
Buildings &amp; Heating: Renovation and upgrading of the building stock will be at a high level for all types of buildings, private (residential and commercial), municipal and other public. New buildings will largely follow the highest energy efficiency standards. Heating will largely use high efficiency electrical systems. Public facilities will be upgraded as a whole.
Transport &amp; Logistics: the vast majority of trips by polluting private cars will be replaced in 2030 by trips using sustainable/ “green” means of transport (private or shared bicycles and micro-mobility vehicles, private or shared electric cars, public transport) within a sustainable multimodal transport system. The urban logistics system will be transformed and optimized, within a regulated operating environment and will use sustainable means of transport.
Water &amp; waste management: Packaging recycling will increase rapidly to reach the corresponding European targets. Bio-waste management will be modernised through composting infrastructure and food waste will be dramatically reduced.
Land Use &amp; Green Infrastructure. Extensive tree planting programme and increasing the area of the city covered by tree foliage. Nature-based solutions and reduction of surface and atmospheric temperatures, heat islands, noise absorption. Protection of biodiversity.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Whole city's ambition as a unique and common commitment for 2030. A summary of how these areas will be addressed towards 2030. The 2030 ambition is supported by a City Council Decision [No. 25/26-01-2022 (6JULOR5-TCL)] and by the relevant city's stakeholders ecosystem approve, involvement, support and transition team commitments. Other indirect benefits are included - objectives alongside the transition to the climate neutrality goal, such as well-being, health, equity, justice, economic prosperity.

Over the last decade, the European Union has stepped up its efforts to mitigate climate change by setting high targets for Member States to achieve. In this context, Greece is working systematically to align national legislation with the relevant European energy and climate guidelines and is promoting financial programmes in this direction, both in the public and private sectors. In parallel with the national policy documents, the Municipality of Thessaloniki, recognising the need to achieve climate neutrality, has formulated local/ regional action plans to address specific issues within the targeted sectors.

In order to achieve climate neutrality transition, the Municipality of Thessaloniki aims the reduction of at least the 80% of emissions from all sectors. According to calculations and estimations derived from the "economic model" (methodology proposed by the EIT Climate KIC and adopted for the calculations carried out in the framework of Action Plan &amp; Investment Plan establishment for the Municipality of Thessaloniki), in the year 2030, under "business as usual" conditions, i.e. without the implementation of targeted projects and actions for the climate neutrality transition, i.e. without the implementation of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, the emissions within the Municipality of Thessaloniki borders are estimated at 2.84 tons of CO₂ equivalent per capita. More specifically, emissions from the electricity and heating sectors of the building stock will be at high levels, with rates of 47% and 26% respectively, which ranks them as the two most important sectors that can be improved in terms of energy savings and emissions reduction, by planning and addressing appropriate efficient actions. The transport and logistics sector contributes about a quarter of total emissions (23%), while the waste management sector also contributes 4%.

The recognition of the contribution of the sectors to energy consumption and environmental burden also shapes the Municipality's strategy, which prioritizes a series of actions to address pollutant emissions and consequently climate change, aiming at climate neutrality by 2030.

The electrification of the energy system (and, in this regard, the implementation of actions related to e.g., electric cars, installation of heat pumps, etc.) requires the de-carbonization of the electricity grid. To achieve this, the following are required: a) a significant increase in the share of RES for electricity generation (&gt;80% of electricity will come from RES, in line with national energy targets) and b) enhancing the flexibility of the grid. In this direction, it is foreseen to increase local/distributed RES electricity generation with parallel technical interventions to upgrade the electricity grid, in cooperation with local, regional and national relevant actors, in particular electricity providers and distributors. These measures contribute to upgrade the municipality energy security, by reducing its exposure to external energy inputs. In addition, it is necessary to develop actions aiming at significant increase of distributed photovoltaic systems in common/ public spaces. These actions aim to increase the self-consumption from RES within the municipality, to further enhance the sustainability of the energy mix and act as complementary means of raising awareness and mobilizing citizens (e.g., dissemination and adoption of good practices), particularly if the benefits of installing such systems are sufficiently communicated to citizens and civil society.

As far as buildings and heating are concerned, extensive technical interventions development for buildings' energy upgrade (passive and active systems), is a basic prerequisite for the reduction of the energy needs of the building stock and the increase of RES to cover these needs, results which will lead to the de-carbonization of the energy needs of the Municipality's building stock. The Municipality of Thessaloniki adopts the principle "energy efficiency comes first" whenever possible and tries to prioritize the order of interventions in view to achieve the best result with the available resources (e.g., having sufficient thermal insulation before replacing the heating system). In addition, new technologies, Information Technology and telecommunications solutions are offering

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

new opportunities to manage and control buildings. According to the latest European directives (e.g., new EPBD), intelligent buildings are equally important in achieving a better quality of life and as a supporting means to increase buildings' energy efficiency.

In order to achieve the Municipality of Thessaloniki climate neutrality targets, a renovation rate of 3.5% (percentage of buildings renovated annually) is required, of which 60% are extensive renovations (energy savings of 30-60%). This percentage increases (5.5%) if interventions only consist lamps and appliances replacement with more energy-efficient ones, as these initiatives are considered more likely to be implemented, given the lower capital investment required. The specific targets, although optimistic, are achievable as: a) there is a very high potential for renovation due to the age of the buildings within the Municipality of Thessaloniki and b) there is a strong construction activity (buildings and infrastructure).

In addition to existing buildings, it is also important to ensure high energy efficiency in new buildings. More specifically, the aim is to construct new buildings that will meet the highest energy standards (A+/A) by a percentage of 35%, in line with the estimates of other cities participating in the Mission that have similar characteristics to the Municipality of Thessaloniki. Finally and further to the building stock upgrade, the Municipality of Thessaloniki aims to increase other installations' energy efficiency (e.g., lighting, water supply installations, etc.), thus aiming to further reduce emissions from anthropogenic activities within the Municipality.

In the Transport and Logistics sector, the Municipality of Thessaloniki announces its intention to achieve the climate neutrality transition by 2030, by initially aiming to modernize mobility services and infrastructure management, through the implementation of infrastructure projects (such as redevelopments, cycle paths, etc.) and projects included in the Thessaloniki Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), planned for 2025 horizon. These projects are either ongoing or are in tendering phase. The above-mentioned projects aim to reshape the public space and its functions, resulting in a reduction of private passenger cars use and increase of public transport use, in order to also upgrade road safety. In addition, in order to modernize mobility services and infrastructure management and in parallel with the metro operation, public transport network restructure is planned, to enhance multimodal stations and park &amp; ride facilities (people usually park their cars in the suburbs and take the bus or metro to avoid congestion in the city center). These actions aim to promote public transport and multimodality, resulting in reduction of car use, increase of public transport and active mobility, leading, also, in the long term, to the improvement in citizens' health.

In order to ensure a sustainable city with improved living conditions, the Municipality of Thessaloniki aims to create new and combined mobility services based on public transport and micro-mobility, as well as to promote services such as carsharing, ridesharing and carpooling.

This has resulted in the creation of a set of new mobility services that act as a counterbalance to car ownership, emphasizing multimodality and, thus, reducing car use, while increasing both the use of public transport and the average number of passengers per car. In order to ensure the sustainability of the city through the modernization of mobility services and infrastructure management, the Municipality of Thessaloniki sets as an additional objective; the promotion of electro-mobility infrastructure in public spaces, an action that will attract users of all categories. In addition, among the actions included in the promotion of electro-mobility is the gradual conversion of the urban bus fleet to electric buses.

Finally, the Municipality of Thessaloniki has set within its medium-term objectives the transition towards the full digitalization of mobility and transport by utilizing existing structures and tools, such as the Mobility Living Lab, developed by HIT/CERTH (Hellenic Institute of Transport/ National Center for Research and Technological Development). This will enhance multimodal transport management, the adoption of the "Mobility as a Service" concept (a concept that aims to shift from the pattern of trips by private car to a new model of trips by shared means and public transport) and, finally, data-driven decision and policy making to improve transport and mobility conditions, as
CITY OF THESSALONIKI
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

well as to inform commuters in order to make decisions that ultimately serve climate neutrality. These objectives are being promoted through the implementation of specific actions and projects and the digitization of mobility, which have either already been implemented or are ongoing or at the process towards tender.

In the Water and Waste management sector, the introduction of separate collection of bio-waste, which accounts for the largest share of the waste stream composition, is the most important factor in achieving the landfill diversion target. In order to achieve the Municipality of Thessaloniki climate neutrality targets, the composting rate needs to reach 70%, while the treatment of bio-waste through the development of the necessary infrastructure is also a key factor. The ultimate aim of the above is to reduce the environmental footprint and thus improve the quality of the environment. At the same time, the Municipality of Thessaloniki aims to upgrade the existing electronic recording and monitoring systems for waste management. The aim is to speed up the resolution of waste management issues and identify areas for improvement, in order to make them more transparent. An additional objective of the Municipality of Thessaloniki is to reduce the volume of waste for landfill (recycling of paper to 85%, plastic to 55%, metals to 60% and glass to 75%), thus reducing the environmental footprint of waste management and enhancing the city cleanliness. This will be achieved by modernizing and renewing the cleaning and recycling equipment.

The strategic interventions of the Land Use and greening infrastructure sector aim to create a low-emission urban form. In the Municipality of Thessaloniki this transition is required to be achieved through extensive tree planting and increase of the area of the city covered by tree foliage. This can be achieved without changing the total area of green space, beyond what is foreseen in the Municipality Urban land uses Plan, but by densifying trees and replacing low green (grass, ornamental plants) with high green (trees). In addition to the removal of CO₂ from the atmosphere by trees, the replacement of low greenery with high greenery will have other benefits, such as reduction in surface and atmospheric temperatures and heat islands found throughout the surface of Thessaloniki, noise absorption as trees act as natural noise barriers, protection of biodiversity as trees provide shelter and food for various species of birds, insects and other animals, helping to promote biodiversity in the urban environment.

Finally, interventions in the area of Smart City and governance are foreseen, which will contribute horizontally to the achievement of the Climate Neutrality objective. They concern the creation of digital infrastructure and digital citizen services and social participation, environmental sustainability support and Climate Footprint monitoring.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

Summary of selected systemic strategic priorities to be implemented for the Thessaloniki transition to climate neutrality by 2030. These changes are essential and have a profound impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the city, such as de-carbonising the city's heating system or energy generating from renewable sources. Commitments between the city and other local stakeholders' ecosystem address these key priorities and contribute to their achievement.

The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan describes all interventions, including those to reach our priorities, as well as all further actions, and describes how the city plans to implement them.

# Electricity (Energy system)

Installation of RES in public spaces (outside buildings and the built environment): refers to the installation of distributed photovoltaic systems in public spaces (outside the built environment) with net metering and/ or feed-in-tariff) and/ or the installation of photovoltaic parks outside the boundaries of the Municipality with virtual net metering, with a total production capacity of &gt;16.24 GWh/ year.
CITY OF THESSALONIKI
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Wind farm for electricity generation: Creation of a Wind Farm, with a total production capacity of 17.25 GWh/year, in areas of the port of Thessaloniki, in the area of the 6th pier, 3 km from the front Thessaloniki waterfront.
Electricity network upgrading/ strengthening within the Municipality of Thessaloniki: It concerns the upgrading of the electricity network through targeted technical solutions (e.g. transformers upgrade), aiming at increasing the flexibility and stability of the network. In addition, it includes the pilot installation of centralized batteries in selected areas - streets of the Municipality of Thessaloniki. The exact definition and sizing of the relevant sub-actions will be determined during the implementation of the Action Plan, by the competent management bodies (Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network Operator- HEDNO) and according to the current needs.
Certified green electricity: Refers to obtaining certificates (official record) proving that a certain amount of electricity has been produced from renewable energy sources. Green certificates can be traded separately from the energy produced. The Municipality of Thessaloniki and the relevant stakeholders will consider during the implementation of the Action Plan the possibility of obtaining such certificates.

An indicative example is the securing of an electricity supply contract through bilateral power purchase and sale contracts with money settlement (Financial/ Virtual Corporate PPA Pay-as-Produced) to cover the energy needs of E.Y.A.TH. S.A. for a period of eight years, with a four-year option right and a total volume of one hundred (100) gigawatt hours (GWh) per year, in order to ensure the energy security of the contracting entity. The requirement is for all of the company's water supply and waste water treatment facilities (200 facilities). The total annual volume will be covered 50% by Photovoltaic Power Plants and 50% by Wind Power Plants.

## Transport &amp; Logistics

Emblematic Interventions for the creation of climate-neutral areas focusing on sustainable mobility, electro-mobility, addressing climate change impacts and energy efficiency in buildings. These include:

A) Designation of the Rotonda area as a low emission zone and as a climate neutral district. Interventions to discourage the entry of private vehicles, while increasing bicycles and electric vehicles (shared micro-mobility vehicles) accessibility, removing on-street parking by subsidizing off-street parking, supporting electrification for residents through and serving deliveries within the zone exclusively by electric vehicles. Also public space redevelopments are included, as well as interventions for climate upgrading of buildings and protection from climate change impacts (for example shading and air renewal canopies in electricity generation with contribution to electricity generation for municipal lighting, etc.). The programme is also interconnected with interventions on the Egnatia road and in the area of the AUTH (in line with the Municipality of Thessaloniki's SUMP). Beyond the urbanisation and road infrastructure projects, there are a number of governance, social innovation and participation interventions related to the active involvement and support of citizens and businesses in the area, as well as cooperation with AUTH.

B) Urban planning measures for the interconnection of land use with Metro stations through green mobility (Transit oriented development zones), with emphasis on the areas: Delphon, Voulgari, New Railway Station, City Hall. Creation of climate neutral zones developed around major Metro stations. This includes interventions to build park&amp; ride facilities, redevelopment of the peripheral zones around the stations, traffic management and multimodality facilities (connecting stations with bicycle infrastructure, car-sharing stations). The action includes a focused project concerning the creation of a climate-neutral zone including the hub areas of City Hall, the AUTH and TIF - HELEXPO. The development of electro-mobility, park and ride (in the area of an ex-military camp - G' Soma Stratou) and shared mobility infrastructure is foreseen, while interventions related to the Egnatia Street (Emblematic Egnatia project) and the prevention of the entry of private cars to AUTH (in accordance with the Municipality of Thessaloniki's SUMP) are foreseen.

C) Creating climate neutral local centres and neighbourhoods &amp; interconnecting different land uses (residential, employment, commercial) through "green" mobility
CITY OF THESSALONIKI
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

corridors (Mixed used development zones). According to the Municipality's SUMP, there have been recorded high volumes of through traffic flows (private cars) passing through major, urban axes, aggravating CO2 emissions in the city center. To address this problem, the creation of a polycentric urban structure is proposed. Potential local centers should be the following areas: Toumba, Harilaou, Triandria, Fleming and AgiaTriada. Interventions include urban renewal, interconnection between centres by sustainable means of transport (bicycle and bus lines), buildings energy upgrades, creation of shared electric vehicle and bicycle stations, electromobility, parking model change (subsidies for use of parking spaces in selected areas near metro stations, incentives for conversion of buildings into parking spaces, etc.), and changes in the urban distribution/ logistics model.

Development of urban freight consolidation centers, freight hotels and micro fulfillment centers.

The action includes the development of urban freight consolidation centers in two areas at the edges of the Thessaloniki city center (New Railway Station area and TIF - HELEXPO area) in order to increase the load occupancy rate of vehicles entering the central area of the Municipality and reduce the trips distances in urban distribution. At the urban consolidation centers facilities, goods are collected, orders are consolidated and then dispatched to customers using environmentally friendly means of transport (e.g., cargo bikes). For the consolidated dispatch of goods, a framework of cooperation between the companies will be developed in order to reduce transport costs, as well as the impact on traffic and the environment.

Development of a SUSTAINABLE URBAN LOGISTICS PLAN/ Urban freight transportation (UFT) plan for the entire Municipality of Thessaloniki

The Action concerns the development of an integrated Sustainable Urban Freight Transport Plan (SUFTP) for the entire Municipality of Thessaloniki. The development of the SUFTP will be carried out according to the specifications of the relevant Eitis "Topic Guide - Sustainable Urban Logistics Planning", which was prepared by HIT/CERTH. In addition, the action includes relevant studies on specific distribution systems.

Water &amp; Waste management

Implementation of separate collection and recovery of bio-waste

This action includes the implementation of the system of separate collection of bio-waste from targeted producers through the supply/ distribution of bio-waste collection bins (660L) and the separate collection of bio-waste from households through the supply/ distribution of bio-waste collection bins (240lt). The supply of waste collection vehicles (5 and 14 m3) and branch shredders. In addition, through the household composting program, it is planned to supply and distribute household composting bins to Children's centers, School Units and private public areas. Since the full development of the system requires the operation of a composting facility in the Regional Unit of Thessaloniki, which is not planned before 2024-2025, the plan foresees the start of collection from mass production points of bio-waste and schools (2% of the final target in 2022, 2023 and 5% of the final target in 2024).

The cooperation of FODSA with private biowaste treatment plants and subsequently with the operation of the Bio-Waste Treatment Unit, the plan provides for collection through the network of brown bins and household composting, with the aim of diverting from landfill the pre-sorted biowaste and achieving the 47% Source Separation target for household biowaste.

Land Use &amp; Green Infrastructure

Extensive tree planting program in public and common areas of the Municipality of Thessaloniki - removing CO2 from the atmosphere

Planting of trees in public space of the Municipality of Thessaloniki with a total of 50,000 new tree plantings for the expansion of parks and densification of roadside tree rows, corresponding to a 79.4% increase in the number of trees within the city.

Addressing heat islands in a district of Thessaloniki
CITY OF THESSALONIKI
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

The aim of the action is to mitigate the heat island in a specific area of the city center (the urban district of Diikitirio) with solutions that will increase the green cover and water permeable surfaces of the district to 40% of its total surface area.

A key factor in the creation of the urban heat island phenomenon is the covering of the ground with artificial non-water permeable materials that do not allow rainwater to be absorbed. In addition, buildings and narrow streets trap heat by reducing air flow. Human activities such as heating buildings and driving cars also add heat to the environment. Vegetation and other nature-based applications and solutions (rain gardens, grass and permeable floors in public spaces, artificial water bodies, water mirrors, etc.) help to cool the air, unlike asphalt and concrete which absorb heat, causing a temperature rise.

Thessaloniki ConfExPark: redevelopment of TIF - HELEXPO

The redevelopment of the central urban island of TIF - HELEXPO constitutes a process of redefining central land use, while at the same time it is an important opportunity for the city to experiment with the creation of a zero urban island as a whole, in terms of public space management, design and construction of the planned structures, as well as in terms of space management, waste management and circularity. The master plan envisages the realization of the above objective through key sustainability factors such as dismantling and circularity, site design and building, choice of materials, operation and management, communication and participation.

Metropolitan Park of Memory - Holocaust Museum

Creation of a metropolitan memorial park near the Holocaust Museum, on an area of approximately 70 ha resulting from the contribution of the land of the old/commercial railway station.

## Smart City and governance

Greek Smart Cities: investing in infrastructure and Smart Sustainable Cities (SSC) systems for a sustainable &amp; green urban future. The project includes the following actions: -Smart pedestrian crossing -Smart surveillance of public spaces -Smart vehicle counting and categorization system using sensors -Smart lighting -Smart lighting control platform (remote management and fault detection) and energy consumption monitoring -Smart lighting control platform (remote management and fault detection) and energy consumption monitoring -System for early warning of natural disasters -Signals wireless internet access - Integrated Education Services - Interconnection of Municipal Authority Buildings to support Smart City - Development of Data Center at City Hall - School energy consumption management - Upgrading of Electronic Citizen Services and development of Participatory Democracy platform
Decarbonation Progress Indicator Monitoring System and Climate Transition Observatory. Development of a methodology and tool aimed at supporting the Municipality of Thessaloniki in monitoring progress towards climate transition and providing information on progress reports to the EU Mission Agency, as well as in decision making for the review of the Action Plan. The methodology and tool will be based on the way the baseline inventory of the Action Plan was created as well as on the multi-source Carbon Footprint monitoring platform developed/ operated by the HIT/ CERTH.

## 4 Principles and process

Key principles that will guide the Municipality of Thessaloniki to the implementation of the City Climate Contract, such as stakeholders' role and involvement, transparency, new holistic approaches and new models of synergies for the transition to the climate neutrality goal. The processes include principles such as co-creating, innovation, multi-actor and citizen engagement and should be systemic and demand-driven in nature

Reaching the goal of climate neutrality requires, apart from leveraging funding resources, the creation of a Transition team to orchestrate the process of collaboration and coordination actions of multiple actors across sectors. Besides, the goal of transition to climate neutrality by 2030 is a joined vision addressed by the cooperation between local stakeholders under the lens of the
CITY OF THESSALONIKI
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

quadruple helix model in planning and decision-making: 1. the business sector, 2. the public sector, 3. research/ academic centers, 4. civil society organizations. At the same time, the Municipality of Thessaloniki collaborates with the Government as a joint effort along with the other five Greek cities participating in the EU Mission “100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030” (Athens, Kozani, Trikala, Ioannina, Kalamata), under the context of a mutual platform entitled ClimaNet.

The Municipality of Thessaloniki, considering the required principles and process needed to address climate neutrality, the synergies, the existing barriers, and opportunities, presents a participatory operational and administrative model under the management and competence of the Resilience Office and the Department of Operational Planning and Development Programs Monitoring. The MoT aims to scale up its capacity and human resources by exploiting European development programs (Horizon, Life, etc). The Resilience Office, in cooperation with other competent departments of the Municipality of Thessaloniki, aim to form the Transition team, upskilling and reskilling to monitor the implementation or updates of the CCC.

The MoT developed this CCC in a participatory and robust approach, seeking to co-create a roadmap with multiple stakeholders to reach tangible goals and deploy doable action plan and realistic investment plan to become Thessaloniki climate neutral and smart until 2030. Even more the Municipality joined forces with an interdisciplinary team structured by Thessaloniki’s Development Agency MDAT SA, the CERTH and the Research Unit of AUTH, URENIO elaborating all together in writing and deploying both the Action Plan and Investment Plan. In addition to the City Advisor’s Mr Alvaro Soldevila aid and the NetZero Cities tools, highlighted with the summer school participation and network with other cities such as the Spanish cities and finally the economic model tool provided by Sean Murray in collaboration with Julio Lumbreras.

Particularly, in January 30th and 31st 2023, the inaugural meeting and workshop was held where more than 60 stakeholders from public and private sector, academia and researchers participated and at least 70 officers from all the Municipality’s division in which the EU Mission was presented with the aid and presence of the City Advisor Mr Alvaro Soldevila and the foundation of engagement was set to jointly work on the structuring the Action plan main sectors. An extensive questionnaire followed in which main stakeholders projected their actions or plans of their entity/organization to be considered and linked to the Municipality’s goal for climate neutrality. During the months followed, the MoT organized workshops with students, youth in collaboration with the Action Aid Hellas (Youth Hub Thessaloniki) under the context of a Climate Academy and workshops with Academia postgraduate, master of PhD students in collaboration with the Faculty School of the local University (Aristoteles University of Thessaloniki). In total at least 50 stakeholders (local/regional/national level) and more than 200 people (including teenagers and youth) participated and worked to structure Thessaloniki’s CCC.

The CCC’s principals are inclusivity, accessibility and energy poverty actions for which the MoT made consultation with the National RES organisation responsible for energy poverty affairs at national level.

Additionally, on the national level, Municipality of Thessaloniki along with the other 5 Greek cities and Limassol from Cyprus, sealed their cooperation by creating a platform entitled ClimaNet with the support of the Secretary General of Spatial Planning of the Ministry of Environment and Energy.

The Transition team, is divided into 4 sub-groups, each of which is tasked with addressing existing and future challenges in the sectors: Governance and Policy, Financing, Learning and Education, Citizen Awareness. Each sub-group will be composed of stakeholders and multiple actors and partners across sectors on board, who will discuss on a regular basis and define actions to remove potential barriers identified by sector. The long-term cooperation of the City with stakeholders is ensured through this “Climate City Contract” commitments. The coordination of the group is carried out by the staff of the Department of Operational Planning and Development Programmes Monitoring - Resilience Office.

In addition, the Municipality of Thessaloniki aims to work with large private organizations that will act as “Climate Neutrality Ambassadors”, in order to advocate and commit in climate neutrality actions.

These actions will involve both de-carbonisation of their operations and “green” donations for the wider benefit of the local community.

Particular attention is paid in interaction with the civil society and consulting relations aiming to be established, so that the actions implemented have the maximum impact on the ground, multiplying the co-benefits even on a neighborhood and district level. An open forum for dialogue will be established to actively involve citizens in the decision-making process and monitor progress or becoming agents of transition.

The MoT acknowledges that a participatory governance model is necessary to implement projects both to maximise $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ absorption through nature-based solutions and installation of renewable energy systems in public spaces around the city. The experience gained on the Resilient Strategy development and implementation has strengthened staff capacity for the succession of this cooperative model of work. Even more, this model aims to embed a range of cooperative tools such as participatory processes in decision-making, consultations, hearings and meetings with the community and stakeholders, transparency and democratic processes, training and information to develop common understanding and enhance participation. The basic actors, who have already collaborated in co-designing, have consolidated their cooperation in the implementation phase, too. In addition, the Investment Plan aims to leverage a diverse range of investment and funding mechanisms and resources such as the Recovery and Resilience Facility, the Just Transition Fund, EIB and to facilitate the legitimate use of controversial tools like Green Bonds. Monitoring and measurement is essential for the succession of this collaboration and projects’ implementation particularly on renewable energy systems and a platform is going to be set up to publish results, update the CCC and build confidence and safeguard the continuity of the efforts and commitment. For the MoT this participatory governance model aims to encourage the collaboration, transparency, and stakeholder accountability, making them active players to address systemic transformation and seize related opportunities.
