# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CCC Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses, and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

The City of Kranj is the third largest city in Slovenia with the population of 57,171 (2023) and area of 151 km². It is characterised by its strategic transit and central location, and technological and Alpine cultural background. Since the adoption of the City of Kranj's Integrated Sustainable Urban Development Strategy 2030 (ISUDS) in 2016, which was followed by several climate related sectoral plans, the city has been pursuing the sustainable development goals (SDG) and intensively introducing smart city, renewable energy, sustainable mobility and building regeneration measures in practice.

Being selected as one of the EU Cities Mission cities in 2022, the city and its partners have accelerated the joint ambitious towards becoming the first smart and climate neutral city in Slovenia by 2030. While the effort is supported by the decision of the Kranj City Council and numerous partners signing the Climate Neutrality Commitments, the decarbonisation pathway is outlined in this 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan and its supporting Investment Plan.

The total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Baseline of the City of Kranj, calculated for the year 2018 in accordance with the Cities Mission's guidelines, accounted 238.832 t CO₂eq. The main contributors of the city's GHG emissions are transport (29%) and buildings (28%), followed by agriculture, forestry and land use (21%), industry (11%) and waste sector (11%).

While the impact of the city is limited with respect to the transport on TEN-T highway corridor crossing the city and nearby national airport, the high dependence on fossil fuels for heating and daily commuting by car is the City's core decarbonisation challenge. Although the industry is a major source of emissions, a large part of them is deducted due to EU Emission Trading Scheme and the use of green energy produced locally by a large Hydro Power station HE Mavčiče. More than half of the city territory is covered by forests. Due to the severe natural disasters in period prior the 2018, no sequestration has been observed.

Considering the overall context, the division of the responsibilities between the governance levels in Slovenia and the estimated private interest, at least 80% reduction of CO₂eq emissions is envisaged by 2030 compared to 2018. Thus, this Action Plan proposes an intervention framework combining the existing national strategies measures (33%) and a set of hard and soft climate actions of the City of Kranj and its local public and private partners (47%) in all five sectors: energy systems, mobility and transport, waste and circular economy, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions as well as built environment.

The main actions anticipate a transition to 90% renewable energy sources in the city district heating supply, increased solar energy production in the scope of 55.000 MWh, achieving "one car by household" target, and a decrease of daily car commuting by 30% enabled by setting a smart multimodal public transport system, circular and smart waste management, improved green infrastructure management and integrated energy-efficiency programme in the remaining not yet retrofitted public and residential buildings. In many actions, the role of the City will be to take the initiative as to demonstrate benefits and raise commitment of other stakeholders.

A comprehensive Smart Kranj Platform – city data digital platform and education and governance measures are already supporting the design, implementation and acceptance of the climate actions among the citizens and enterprises. The setting and running of one-stop shop for climate neutral and smart city with citizens participation activities is being prepared and coordinated as part of the UP-SCALE NetZeroCities Pilot Programme.

In this way the City of Kranj will achieve climate neutrality and continue to contribute to the overall Slovenian National Climate strategy and the European Green Deal targets.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

The City of Kranj defined an overarching vision to become a city of opportunities, a sustainable, progressive, and vibrant urban centre of Gorenjska Region by 2030 in the Integrated Sustainable Urban Development Strategy - City of Kranj 2030. The strategy was adopted in 2016. Since then, the City has increased its ambition to becoming the first smart and climate neutral city in Slovenia based on the sustainable development principles, innovative economic ecosystem and inclusive and adaptable society. As of 2013 the City of Kranj is also a member of the Covenant of Mayors. Regional Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) for Gorenjska was adopted in 2018 with the target of 40% GHG emission reduction by 2030 compared to the base year 2005.

GHG inventory for the year 2018 and in-depth analyses of GHG emissions by sectors and scopes for the City of Kranj were defined in the Local Energy Concept (LEC) of the City of Kranj and are relevant for the entire administrative boundaries of the City of Kranj (NUTS 5), the area of 143 km² and population of 57.171 (2023) of which 75% lives in urban areas and 25% in rural areas.

The GHG inventory 2018 included emissions from stationary energy, transport, IPPU (ETS and non ETS sector) and emissions generated from public lighting. The total emissions amounted to 295.053 t CO₂eq. Significant emissions are sourced from IPPU sector – 129.592 t CO₂eq, 43,9% of all emissions, most of which are registered in the Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). The calculations from 2018 GHG inventories were included in Cities Mission Expression of Interest.

For preparation of this Action Plan (AP) the LEC 2018 GHG emissions inventory was completed according to the methodology recommended in Climate City Contract (CCC), consequently including Waste and AFOLU¹ sectors in the calculations and excluding emissions registered in ETS.

According to the new methodology, the numbers show that transport is the main sector of GHG emissions with a share of 29%, followed by built environment (28%), AFOLU (21%), industry (11%), and waste sector (11%). All sectors accounted to 238.832 t CO₂eq in 2018 as the baseline of this AP.

In the period from 2018 to 2022, the City of Kranj has taken on many sustainable measures introducing strategies in digital, energy, sustainable mobility and waste sectors. Green investments were significant: car and bike sharing system, public transport, piloting smart and comprehensive energy management solutions in the first neighbourhood – the Smart Mlaka project. 52% of city premises and 90% of multi-unit residential dwelling have been energy retrofitted, the city has been replacing the existing municipal vehicle fleet and public

transport bus fleet with e-cars and e-busses. New cycling paths and e-charging infrastructure have been built. Smart LED lighting has been installed.

As citizens benefit from sustainable improvements in the city, the actions have been favourably accepted among them. The importance of sustainable practices, circular economy, innovative technologies, processes and renewable energy sources is steadily penetrating throughout industry and transport, growing the awareness among citizens, although the critical scope is not yet reached.

Activities in recent years have reduced GHG emissions, especially in the building, energy and waste sector. With this Action Plan, the city is encouraged to address the climate gap in the fields that are the largest sources of emissions, have the greatest potential for reduction and where the city has the biggest power to act and influence the transition to carbon neutrality by 2030. This approach is reflected in the action plan portfolio and supported by the investment plan. Accordingly, the Integrated Sustainable Urban Development Strategy City of Kranj 2030 and other major municipal sector plans (SUMP, LEC, spatial plan, digital strategy) will be revised and adopted in the following years with measures, activities and required budget aligned with the Cities Mission 2030 targets.

The challenges of capacities and competences, limited influence on emissions from industry and transport sources, pre-existing national policy environment, limited budgets, and long-term capital projects are addressed by intensive stakeholder engagement throughout the planning processes, work processes built on the EU green goals, strong local partnership, and joint commitment.

Thus, the Action Plan is a result of an effective participatory process coordinated by the City of Kranj Administration (CoKA), Office for the Development and Smart Community and its operational body - Transition Team (TT) throughout the 2023. A comprehensive governance structure with a 21-member City of Kranj Strategic Council for Climate Neutral and Smart Community (SCCNSC) lead by the mayor was set up, succeeding previous Smart City Strategy Council, bringing together representatives of policy, business, academia, NGOs and key city implementing partners. SCCNSC represents the central think-tank and partnership body for the City of Kranj Climate City Contract.

In parallel, an open dialog with citizens in the form of an online survey (April and May 2023,  $N = 507$ ) and series of accompanying workshops and technical meetings with different sectors and target groups took place, which provided inputs for the design and adjustments of the intervention framework. See Figure 3 below. Detailed report on the co-creative and participatory process is attached as Annex 2.

Considering the limited financial and human resources, the CoK defined the implementation framework including monitoring, evaluation and learning indicator scheme (NZC MEL). All these allowed the City of Kranj to present an internally consistent and ambitious plan that provides a sound basis for the investment plan. The plan was fine-tuned after NetZeroCities review and consultations between January and March 2024.

The AP is understood as a dynamic document that guides the Transition Team though implementation, its regular ongoing monitoring and risk management. Major mid-term review of the progress made in the period 2018-2025 and update of the GHG inventory is foreseen in 2026 followed by planned revision of the Action Plan.

# City of Kranj socio-economic background

Location: With 57,171 (2023) inhabitants, the City of Kranj (NUTS 5) is the third largest municipality in Slovenia and serves as an economic, commercial, transport, sports, and educational hub of the Gorenjska region (NUTS 3). Nestled at the foothill of picturesque Alps, between two rivers, along the European transport corridor and in the immediate vicinity of the national airport, and only 30 minutes away from Ljubljana, the city embraces favourable location for life and business. Further to the index of the development of Slovene municipalities the City is placed as 17. among 212 municipalities.

Territory and environment: The administrative area of the city covers over 151 km² and 49 settlements. 54% of the territory are forests, 3% agriculture area, 1% water areas, while 15% of the territory is urbanised. 19,4% of the city area is designated as Natura 2000 and 15% identified as natural values. The naturally protected Kokra River gorge is stretching through the very urban centre of the city. The rural lowlands are favourable for agriculture production and livestock farming, while mountain hinterland provides quality spring water supply and various outdoor recreation possibilities. Sava River is exploited for production of hydro energy. With the completion of the sewage network and improvement of wastewater treatment facilities in the city and the region, the quality of rivers is found in good ecological condition. So is the air quality, as none of the measurements indicated exceedances of the permissible limits in 2022 in all 6 measuring points in 2022.

Demographics: Over the last decade the population of the city is slightly growing (0,1% annually, 55.527 population in 2013). The growth is a result of economic immigration, mainly young families from the Republic of Kosovo and other countries of the SE Europe as well as construction of new residential areas. Still, the overall population is aging. In 2023, 16% of Kranj residents were younger than 15 years, 64% of age 15-64 and 19,6% over 65. Average citizen age in 2023 was 43,1 years comparing to 41,4 in 2013. 75% of the city population lives in the urban areas and 25% in rural areas. Balancing rural-urban needs, integration of newcomers into the society and aging are trends addressed by different city policies.

History: The city of Kranj holds significant historical importance. It was the first capital of the Slovenes, serving as the centre of the Slavic principality of Carniola from the 8th century onwards. The old town has preserved its historic character and is designated as a national cultural monument since 1983.

Economy: The industrialisation from the 19th to the end of 20th century significantly influenced the current socio-economic picture of the City of Kranj. In Yugoslavia, Kranj was one of the most powerful and growing industrial and technological centres (electro, rubber, textile, shoe industry), which influenced the rapid immigration of labour force from various parts of the Balkan and urbanization of vast neighbourhoods and industrial sites around the historic centre. Planina, with more than 15.000 inhabitants and several thousands of apartments is still the largest residential urban neighbourhood in Slovenia. Slovenian independence in 1991 and globalization seriously affected the labour-intensive industry, caused its decline, redundancy, loss of traditional working places, and occurrence of derelict industrial sites. The separation of certain rural areas from the City of Kranj and formation of many independent municipalities, as part of the national reform of local self-government, resulted in decrease of some of its vital business areas and functional territories.

This determined the recent economic, spatial, environment and living situation and perspectives of the city. From the past strong industries - the electronic, telecommunication and rubber industries survived, many successfully by merging with global corporations. Hence, the traditional engineering background remains and is nowadays reflected in the dynamic entrepreneurship and SMEs ecosystem in IT sector and their collaboration with the Smart Kranj Platform. In 2022, the average gross monthly salary of a resident was 2.253 EUR which is 3% higher than national average. In 2022, there were 11.981 jobs in Kranj, while 14.382 residents commute daily to Ljubljana and neighbouring business areas. Daily commuting and traffic transit on the highway and to nearby Škofja Loka and Naklo generates high traffic and daily congestions in the city, reaching 20.000 vehicles per day at some of the entrance roads. Opening new high-quality job opportunities in Kranj remains a primary goal for the new Business Park Hrastje, currently in the development stage.

During the last decades, Kranj has been transforming from industrial city into an urban centre with diverse cultural, social, educational, sports and green areas providing an active, healthy and sustainable living space.

# 2 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

Part A “Current State of Climate Action” describes the point of departure of the city towards climate neutrality, including commitments and strategies of key local businesses, and informs the subsequent modules and the outlined pathways to accelerated climate action.

## 2.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

Module A-1 “Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory” details and describes the latest GHG inventory, where available from 2018 or more recent, referring to a clearly stated geographic boundary. The aim of this section is to establish the emission baseline and to establish the emissions gap to 2030 climate neutrality according to the inventory specifications defined in the Cities Mission’s *Info Kit for Cities*² and the process outlined in the CCC Action Plan Guidance and Explanations.

### GHG Emissions Baseline inventory

The results of the City of Kranj GHG Emissions Baseline inventory are provided below in total and by sectors.

#### TOTAL GHG emissions for the base year – 2018

In determining the baseline for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the year 2018 has been selected. This decision is anchored by the robust dataset on emissions stemming from energy consumption, predominantly from fossil fuels, as detailed in the Local Energy Concept of the City of Kranj (LEC). The Concept, which provides an in-depth analysis of the city's energy dynamics, was ratified by the Kranj City Council in 2020 and forms the cornerstone of our GHG inventory. The adoption of 2018 as the baseline year allows for the utilization of this vetted data, ensuring that our inventory is both accurate and aligned with established local energy policies.

The GHG inventory for the City of Kranj has been diligently formulated based on the guidelines set forth by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). By adopting the IPCC guidelines, the City of Kranj aligns its reporting practices with international standards. This approach not only enhances the credibility of the data presented but also ensures its comparability on a global scale.

Elektro Gorenjska d.d., provided the data on electricity consumption. The consumption figures for natural gas were provided by Domplan d.d., the gas distribution system operator for the area. Complementing these primary sources, the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SURS) also contributed significant insights. This was further supplemented with other publicly available data, ensuring a holistic understanding of the sector's emissions.

In terms of the overall energy consumption for the year, direct emissions from sources within Kranj of residential, public and commercial buildings amounted to 205.307 MWh/year. Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the city reached 68.579 MWh/year. Thus, the combined energy consumption of residential, public and commercial buildings in Kranj for 2018 stood at 274.107 MWh/year.

Heating oil consumption was reported at 42.178 MWh/year. Biomass consumption in the sector was recorded at 43.158 MWh/year, while natural gas amounted to a consumption of 70.851 MWh/year. Buildings in Kranj consumed non-renewable electrical energy amounting to 68.579 MWh/year, and district heating consumption was registered at 49.341 MWh/year.

→ Direct emissions (Scope 1): 41.280 t CO₂ equivalent/year
→ Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, produced from non-renewable resources (Scope 2): 24.551 t CO₂ equivalent/year

Total Emissions: 65.831 t CO₂ equivalent/year

## Transport sector

Kranj, strategically situated in Slovenia, has seen a consistent rise in its transport energy consumption. Precisely analysing the energy utilization within transport for a municipality like Kranj, is a challenge, mainly due to the complexity of the calculations and the lack of comprehensive data. Importantly, a significant amount of motor fuels, both consumed and acquired, originate beyond the municipal boundaries.

The methodology to deduce energy consumption in transport leveraged publicly accessible data, concentrating on variables such as the number of registered vehicles, the total driving kilometres, and an estimated measure of distance traversed within Kranj. This estimation was obtained from the Slovenian Infrastructure Agency's traffic counters.

The data shows that cars are the primary energy consumers in transport, followed by trucks and buses. Rail transport, although a significant mode, has a lesser energy footprint due to its limited expanse (about 14 km railways in Kranj). The emissions calculation also accounted for aircraft operations at Jože Pučnik Airport Ljubljana. This inclusion recognizes the emissions from airplanes during their landing and take-off cycles, acknowledging the airport's integral role in Kranj's transport dynamics and its environmental impact. Predominantly, the energy source for transport remains fossil fuels. Diesel occupies a dominant 77% share, followed by gasoline at 20%. The remaining energy consumption is catered by electricity and other fuels. The push towards greener energy sources in transport is still in its early stages in Kranj.

In 2018, Kranj's transport sector reported an energy consumption of 257.989 MWh/year. Broken down, diesel contributed a substantial 200.496 MWh/year, gasoline 55.477 MWh/year, and electrical energy 2.016 MWh/year.

Total emissions: 68.068 t CO₂ equivalent/year

## Waste sector

In the City of Kranj, the waste sector is a significant contributor to the greenhouse gas emissions. For assessing GHG emissions from waste The First Order of Decay (FOD) method was applied in this assessment, offering a nuanced understanding of emissions over time, especially from waste, undergoing decomposition in landfills.

The primary data source for this analysis was Komunala Kranj d.o.o., the company responsible for waste and wastewater management in the city. Supplementary data regarding industrial waste was provided by the Slovenian Environment Agency (ARSO).

For the specified year, energy consumption in the waste sector of Kranj was as follows: diesel consumption was 1.785 MWh, and the indirect energy consumed from electrical energy was 1.085 MWh. Considerable emissions in the form of methane are being released from closed Tenetiše landfill. This data is under the consistent surveillance of the National Laboratory of Health, Environment and Food, ensuring its accuracy and yearly revision.

In conclusion, while waste management in Kranj is commendably efficient, its environmental impact indicates areas for further improvement. The adoption of more sustainable energy sources and advanced waste management techniques could significantly reduce the sector's GHG emissions.

# Industrial Processes and Product Use sector

For the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions from the Industrial Process and Product Use (IPPU) sector, we utilized energy consumption data from the year 2018, provided by Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SURS), Elektro Gorenjska d.d., Domplan d.d. and data from questionnaires that were distributed to various enterprises. This data was further refined using actual measured figures, especially concerning gas and heating oil. The consumption pattern in this sector mirrors the observations in buildings sector, with the dominant energy source being natural gas. Notably, energy consumption attributed to Goodyear Slovenija d.o.o., a company enrolled in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), was excluded from this evaluation. Additionally, we excluded electricity consumption that falls under Scope 2. In terms of energy consumption specifics, the IPPU sector recorded a total consumption of 119.754 MWh. Heating oil usage was at 31.752 MWh, natural gas consumption registered at 79.655 MWh, and district heating usage was registered at 8.347 MWh.

→ Direct Emissions (Scope 1): 27.256 t CO₂ equivalent/year

Total Emissions: 27.256 t CO₂ equivalent/year

# Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use

## Forestry and Land Use

Standard methods were used to estimate baseline net emissions in 2018 for the land use sector in accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Spatially-explicit land-use conversion data (Approach 3) were obtained on a systematic grid of 500 m × 500 m using a point sampling method with digital orthophotos as the basis for photo interpretation of land use. Emissions and removals in forest land were estimated using the stock-change method based on municipality-specific forest management data provided by the Slovenia Forest Service. For other land categories, emissions and removals were estimated by applying country-specific or default emission factors according to generic methodologies (IPCC, 2006, 2019). Emissions and removals for harvested wood products (HWP) were calculated using a ratio method in which the national net emissions for HWP from 2018 was used and the amount of felling in the City of Kranj was used as proxy data for the weight.

The estimates for the land sector showed that forests were a net source of emissions amounting to 14.901 t CO₂ eq. in 2018. We assume that the growing stock in the forests has decreased mainly due to natural disasters (ice storm, bark beetles and windbreak) that have devastated the forests of the City of Kranj in the last decade. Other categories such as cropland, grassland, settlements and HWP acted as a net sink, which amounted to -4.645 t CO₂eq. in 2018. Indirect N₂O emissions from N leaching and runoff were not estimated, nor were emissions from forest fires, as there are no records for 2018.

# Agriculture

To calculate greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture in the territory of the City of Kranj, data on livestock production, including the number of animals and body masses of cattle, and the area of agricultural land used for individual crops were gathered. Information on the numbers and body mass of cattle was sourced from the Central Data Repository for Cattle maintained by the Agricultural Institute of Slovenia (KIS). As the

specific data for the City of Kranj was lacking, national-level milk production data were used as an approximation. Data on the numbers of other livestock species and details on crop areas were obtained from subsidy application forms submitted to the Agency for Agricultural Markets and Rural Development.

To calculate GHG emissions, we applied the IPCC methods (2006, 2019) and factors for converting the greenhouse effect of methane and nitrous oxide according to AR5 (28 for methane and 265 for nitrous oxide). Enteric methane emissions from cattle were estimated using a detailed Tier 2 methodology, while emissions from pigs, horses, sheep, and goats were calculated using Tier 1, where the number of animals was multiplied by the corresponding emission factor. Methane from manure management, as well as direct and indirect emissions of nitrous oxide from manure management and managed soils, were calculated using Tier 1 (IPCC, 2019). The calculations consider the number of animals, annual average volatile solid excretion per head of animals, fraction of total annual volatile solids for each livestock species/category, emission factor, and manure management system. Emissions from crop residues were estimated using agricultural land areas from subsidy applications.

To calculate nitrous oxide emissions, data on nitrogen excretion were required, and this was determined using the default nitrogen excretion rate in a typical animal mass. When calculating emissions from fertilization, we considered the area of crops from subsidy application forms and the consumption of mineral fertilizers, which were estimated based on national statistics.

In the year 2018, there were a total of 40.667 tons of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalent emissions, including 21.368,9 tons from enteric methane, 7.977,6 tons from manure management, 11.172,6 tons from managed soils, 11,9 tons from lime application, and 70,4 tons from urea application. In terms of emissions, there were 25.796 tons of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalent emissions of methane, 14.723 tons of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalent emissions of nitrous oxide, and 148 tons of carbon dioxide.

# 2.2 Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

Module A-2 “Current Policies and Strategies” lists and assesses existing policies, strategies, initiatives, or regulation from local, regional, and national level, relevant to the city’s climate neutrality transition. This assessment contributes to identifying the gap (if any) between the emissions reduction due to existing initiatives and the city’s 2030 climate neutrality target. Filling this gap by identifying additional actions and levers to achieve the city’s emission reduction target is the focus of this Action Plan. The assessment of current policies and strategies offers hence a starting point for exploring the impact pathways (See Part C).

## A-2.1: Description &amp; assessment of policies

Strategies, acts and action plans are listed in respect of a strong strategic dimension with aligned objectives that already support the implementation of ongoing (BAU) and planned activities to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. They are selected according to:

vertical hierarchy to bridge national, regional, and local priorities, programmes, targets and projects;
horizontal cooperation among crucial policy areas to reach climate neutrality, especially on the local level, and
territorial cooperation in the region and to transcend administrative boundaries.

## National level:

Resolution on Slovenia’s Long-term Climate Strategy until 2050 (ReDPS50) as a strategy summarises key guidelines and measures of The Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), which is the Climate Strategy’s action plan. Both were adopted in 2020, drafted in coordination and both GHG emissions targets are identical. NECP policies and measures for achieving the targets are classified and presented by sectors (energy, industry, transport and mobility, buildings, agriculture, land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), and waste) in separate dimensions even though some actions impact multiple dimensions. According to energy scenario a reduction of sectoral GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2018 (base year) assess an impact by at least:

→ 15% in transport and mobility,
→ 41% from waste,
→ 27% in industry (non ETS),
→ 53% from wide use (improving energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption),
→ 0% from Agriculture,
→ LULUCF sector will not produce net emissions by 2030 (emissions in the sector will not exceed sinks).

National targets present national emission reduction intervention framework and are considered as existing strategy impact. Update of The Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP UPDATE) is in progress and new targets are more ambitious as existing one. Draft NECP targets are presented in the Annex 1 and should support activities and interventions of the CCC Action and Investment plan.

Measures and policies from NECP are contained in action plans and other strategies and operational documents which are not individually listed and described. Particularly exposed are four documents which were adopted after NECP ratification and have a significant impact on GHG emission reduction.

Long-term Strategy for Energy Renovation of Buildings until 2050 (DSEPS) (adopted in March 2021),
Act on Siting of Installations for Generation of Electricity from renewable energy sources (adopted in July 2023) and
CITY OF KRANJ
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Strategy on the Deployment of Alternative Fuels Infrastructure (adopted in May 2023) which affects new measures to support NECP objective,
Slovenia's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Strategic Plan (adopted in September 2023).

Their relevance to the CCC Action Plan is defined in the following table - List of relevant policies, strategies &amp; regulations.

## Regional level:

Territorial cooperation that addresses challenges to the transition to a climate neutral society and jointly develops potentials of Gorenjska region are defined in Regional Development Program of Gorenjska Region 2021 – 2027 (RDPG) and Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan of Gorenjska Region (SECAP).

Regional Development Program of Gorenjska sets the sustainable development strategy for the NUTS 3 region among others also measures to mitigate and adopt to climate changes through six development priorities:

→ Integrated development and effective governance to reduce development disparities (urban / rural areas) which outlines needs for coordinated approach towards regional spatial planning, defines Kranj as urban centre of Gorenjska Region in terms of economic, social, governmental and other public services, addresses tourism development across the Region as sustainable tourist destination.
→ Innovative and sustainable business environment - "Smart Gorenjska" to develop smart communities, smart countryside, and competences, promote knowledge and new technologies as well as promote and support economic development through financial initiatives and special purpose funds.
→ Raising the quality of life, social and demographic development opportunities through development of social infrastructure, sport and leisure infrastructure for the citizens aiming better health and quality of living environment. It supports systems to promote local food supply and to increase territorial food self-sufficiency.
→ Energy efficient and clean Region - Green Gorenjska, accelerating low-carbon projects in Gorenjska: Zero waste, wastewater management, Center for energy efficiency, sustainability and circle economy, green infrastructure, and forests, degradable – grey / brownfield development, energy system digitalisation.
→ Accessible, connected and traffic/road safe Gorenjska to promote and enable sustainable transport and mobility systems and infrastructure.

Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan of Gorenjska Region (SECAP) is based on methodology of Covenant of Mayors for Climate Change and Energy and is supporting climate transition taking into consideration climate changing trends, anticipated climate changes and risks, exposures, and resilience of selected sectors. List of measures and activities from action plan are coordinated with the set targets by sectors and dimensions in the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP). With set target to reduce GHG emissions by at least 40% by 2030 (base year 2005) measurements and activities related to

→ development of new renewable energy sources,
→ increased energy efficiency and renovation of public buildings,
→ sustainable transport and mobility,
→ establishment of smart networks and services,
→ an inclusive and tailored communication and engagement strategy,
→ promotion of energy efficiency and climate friendly society,

→ tackling energy poverty locally.

List of projects refers to hard and soft infrastructure of which some are already in progress or planned for the following years, though some priorities should be updated to the current climate challenges.

## Local level:

Listed strategies and action plans on the local level are documents with the focus on the climate change and climate transition to net zero emission society.

**Integrated Sustainable Development / Urban Strategy - City Kranj 2030** is overarching strategy of City Kranj adopted in 2016 with the defined vision: Kranj 2030 – city of opportunities – sustainable, progressive, and lively urban centre of Gorenjska. Development principles are focusing on innovative social and economic environment, sustainable development, inclusiveness, adaptability, and competitiveness. Sustainability and climate transition toward net zero emissions have been addressed through horizontal policy and projects across seven strategic sectors. In respect of the 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, the monitoring and evaluation of Sustainable Development/Urban Strategy implementation has been initiated by the Transition Team. The Strategy is being revised and completed according to the EU Cities Mission goals by 2030.

The most important sectoral policies, strategies and action plans which support implementation of overarching objectives, and zero emission transitions are summarised in the chart.

# 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

## A-3.1: Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

The urban system, systemic barriers and opportunities related to the city's GHG domains largely derive from the Slovenian national regulatory framework. Being a small country, governance systems in Slovenia are centralised to a high degree and thus, the responsibilities of the municipalities, as defined by the Local Self-Government Act, are rather limited. This is reflected in a high influence of national strategies on the city's emission gap and in the necessity for close collaboration of the City of Kranj with the climate relevant national bodies and implementing agencies. Furthermore, the Slovenian municipalities organise their major utility services in the form of municipal public companies or though concessions which rises the number of stakeholders relevant to deal with. While the City is responsible for the local roads, city's public transport, district heating, urban planning, municipal waste, water and sewage systems, many of climate important systems fall under the national authority or are of a business character (railway, regional public transport, main roads, electric distribution, financial schemes, higher education).

A comprehensive stakeholder mapping by urban systems is presented in the Figure 13 and described in detail in Table 8 while an in-depth analysis of systemic barriers and opportunities is given in the Table 9 at the end of the chapter. The most relevant urban systems and stakeholders for addressing the identified GHG gap, system barriers and opportunities for Kranj climate naturality are:

Infrastructure systems, in particular national transport infrastructure and energy distribution operators, municipal utility company Komunala Kranj with a wide range of environment related services and several city's concessioners for specific services. Active coordination between the City of Kranj and all relevant national /local operators is necessary to minimise the barriers deriving from shared responsibilities, incoherent priorities and operational deficiency.
Service systems with a set of new mobility service providers can seize the city's need and citizens' potential for sustainable commuting.
Building system with dispersed ownership (including the Government of RS), facility managers and residential heating boards can help unlock private capital in energy efficiency and RES.
Industrial and business processes representing largest industrial, service or trading sector employers with high interest and influence on the City of Kranj's climate neutrality.
Alliances, social processes, capacities: educational and upbringing systems representing mainly local institutions and NGOs having direct access to different target groups and thus enabling a significant impact on the knowledge base and behavioural change of citizens.
Funding systems, including the three biggest national financial institutions supporting sustainable development (Eco Fund, Climate fund, SID Bank – national promotional development bank) that shall release their capacities to better support EU Cities Mission.

In order to monitor the above systems and engage them for joint interventions, the most relevant stakeholders were invited in the City of Kranj Strategic Council for Climate Neutral and Smart Community (e.g. Ministry of the Environment, Climate and Energy, Forest Service of Slovenia, public utility providers ..) while others are approached individually, through workshops or specific actions proposed in the AP portfolio and its cross-cutting measures. At the operational level, the City of Kranj Administration has also established continuous working relationships with several Ministries and their implementing bodies which are additionally strengthened by the CCC process.

|  INFRASTRUCTURE - road, rail, bike and pedestrian network - and operation | The City of Kranj - City Administration - Office for Economic Affairs and Traffic, Department for Traffic - Joint Office for Urban planning | Local Authority | According to the Local Self-Government Act, the Municipality is responsible for local road, bike and pedestrian network planning, maintenance and operation. The mayor of Kranj has set up and leads the Strategic Council for Climate Neutral and Smart City of Kranj (SCCNSC) whereas all City Administration departments have nominated their staff in the Transition Team (TT) and participate in the Action Plan design and implementation. Influence on city climate neutrality by 2030: Local roads - high Sustainable mobility - cycling and walking - high The City has defined its future road network policy in the Municipal Spatial Plan (2014, 4th amendment preparation is underway) emphasizing the reduction and calming of the traffic in the city centre and improvement of the city ring and entrance roads. Both interventions are much interlinked in terms of improved traffic management. However, the ring roads (incl. cycling network) are of regional character and thus investments and operation fall under the national jurisdiction. In this respect, the City's influence on the overall traffic flows through infrastructure is limited. The City therefore focuses on the sustainable mobility measures where its impact is higher. Further to the Integrated Sustainable Mobility Strategy of City of Kranj (2017) and Comprehensive Study of Cycling Connections, Stationary Traffic and One-Way Connections with a Proposal for Sustainable Mobility Measures in the City of Kranj (2023), actions such as rearrangement of the inner road network into one-way streets, broadening of the spaces for pedestrians and bikers, completing the cycling network and building the missing bridging facilities are proposed. Regardless the municipal jurisdiction, the lack of funds, time consuming planning and citizens' acceptance jeopardize the mobility goals of the city. | High While noise and daily traffic congestions impede citizens' life quality, transport also contributes the most to the City's GHG emissions. It is of City of Kranj's high interest to address the traffic infrastructure and management challenges.  |

Railway Investments Division | National Body | According to the Slovenian legislation, the State is responsible for construction, restoration and maintenance of the public national and regional roads and railway. In City of Kranj, several key investments in ring and entry roads from the Corridor X. highway with major impact on the city future traffic management are in designing stage, yet the timing of investments in roads is uncertain. On the other hand, second track (new railway line) connecting Ljubljana and Kranj is in development stage, while the funding is foreseen by the Connecting Europe Facility (part of TEN-T). Thus, influence of DRSI in the field of future road traffic improvements on the Kranj climate neutrality goals is assessed as medium whereas high in case of railway.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

Following the results of the emissions inventory, in-depth stakeholder analysis, current national, regional and local strategies, current best practices and successful measures, climate neutrality goals and priorities defined in the Climate Neutrality Commitments and results from the citizens survey, an impact pathway addressing the identified emission gap was elaborated in close consultation with the Strategic Council, focus groups, experts from research institutes and public utility services. The strategy taken to address the emission gap of 113.263 t CO₂eq is:

primarily focusing on the sectors with the highest emission gap (transport, buildings),
secondarily focusing on the actions with greatest impact on GHG reduction (renewable energy production, sustainable mobility) and
thirdly focusing on actions under direct or indirect influence of the City of Kranj (energy systems, transport and mobility, waste &amp; circular economy). Nevertheless, the pathway addresses also other areas with lower impact on GHG emissions reduction but of greater benefit for awareness rising and well-being of citizens life (green infrastructure, urban agriculture.). The portfolio includes also upgrade of electric grid which has no direct GHG impact but it is a pre-condition for achieving the solar energy and green mobility targets.

The logical intervention pathway is presented in the overview diagram below (Figure 14 and 15) and defines actions, their early changes (2025) and late outcomes (strategic objectives) as well as direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits) by each field of action. Following the set targets (outcomes) the direct impact of all actions on CO₂eq is estimated, being a reduction or sequestration.

The connection between the proposed Action Portfolio and the source of emission from table A2.1 is given in Figure 16. The figure explains how the identified emission gap is addressed by concrete fields of actions. As evident, the proposed interventions directly reduce GHG emissions in all sectors, except IPPU. The Energy field (not counting under any of the emission sectors of the emission inventory) contributes to almost 41% of the total emission gap. In fact, due to the character of the interventions, energy actions help addressing emissions in several sectors: building sector (e.g. new energy source of district heating, RES electricity generation etc) as well as indirectly in the IPPU sector (e.g. use of industrial waste heat). From this and other reasons mentioned further on in the Action portfolio, built environment accounts only 7% to the reduction of the total GHG emission gap. On the other hand, transport generates nearly 40% of the emission gap whereas the proposed actions contribute to 32% of the emission gap reduction which corresponds the scope of City responsibility in the transport policy. The Action Portfolio fully addresses the emissions in waste sector while the city's contribution in the AFOLU is limited to the interventions in green infrastructure and urban agriculture programme.

In addition, Figure 17 clearly shows the importance of 6 actions that contribute to 80% of the emission gap reduction and shall be kept in the focus of the City and CCC stakeholders: solar electricity production (1.3), one car by household (2.1), phase out fossil fuels in the district heating (1.1.), centre for circular economy (3.3), electric and hydrogen charging infrastructure (2.5) and utilisation of waste heat from industrial and commercial facilities (1.2).

The portfolio of actions considers all six levers while its scale depends on the type of action, local needs, existing interventions and the capacities of the City of Kranj governance structures and its stakeholders as follows:
CITY OF KRANJ
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

TECHNOLOGY/ INFRASTRUCTURE: Majority of actions require hard investment being purely technological (e.g., PV), purely infrastructural (e.g. cycling network) or combined (e.g. district heating). State of the art technologies (e.g., hydrogen) are pursued while infrastructure supporting the green transition shall respect DNSH principle. Digital solutions supporting technology or infrastructure actions and their integration into the Smart Kranj Platform are strongly encouraged as a cross-cutting governance and social innovation intervention. Whenever possible and reasonable, citizen participation, social innovation, other levers are combined with this lever.

→ GOVERNANCE LEVERS: While climate neutral performance of all city structures is considered a horizontal lever, the introduction of new specific governance models is a prerequisite for success of several actions, in particular in the field of mobility (e.g., setting up governance structures supporting the "one car by household" programme) and green infrastructure (e.g. implementing green spatial plan in the City administration).

→ POLICY AND REGULATION LEVERS: Achieving climate neutrality goals requires an increase in the current regulatory standards and regulations defined by the city regulatory framework, particularly in the field of mobility (e.g. reduced transit traffic, waste management).

→ SOCIAL INNOVATION AND ECOSYSTEM INTEGRATION: Whenever possible, the Action Plan builds on existing local initiatives, non-government or expert partners to add value to the identified actions. Depending on the local institutional capacities at individual fields, actions foster participative solutions such as energy co-operatives and pilot irrigation system for vegetable production or provide opportunities to stimulate social innovation though new schemes like Kranj Circular City, Urban agriculture programme or One car by household.

→ DEMOCRACY AND PARTICIPATION: Without an open approach and vast citizens engagement, the climate neutrality by 2030 is not possible. The lever is thus considered a principle and embedded through the climate neutrality process. However, there are some actions which fully depend on citizen engagement and involvement (one car by households, zero waste, energy-efficiency of residential buildings) and require distinct approach and care.

→ LEARNING &amp; CAPABILITIES: The lack of particular skills is addressed at two levels: general citizen level through some individual actions (e.g. Centre for circular economy Zarta educating on consumption changes, One stop shop rising general awareness and practical tips) and horizontal level providing learning opportunities for technical and management staff of the city structures.

|  B-2.1: Description of action portfolios - textual or visual  |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Fields of action | Portfolio description  |   |
|   |  List of actions | Descriptions  |
|  Energy systems | 1.1. Phase out fossil fuel in district heating/cooling and replacement with RES
Utilization of waste heat from industrial and commercial facilities for Kranj district heating and cooling system
Solar electricity production
Hydro electricity production
Upgrade of electric grid
Energy-efficient and smart public lighting
Energy co-operatives | The actions in district heating systems and green energy production are essential for the City of Kranj as they represent 41% of its decarbonisation targets.

Replacement of fossil fuels with RES systems including potential usage of waste heat from industry in the city district heating and yet non-existing cooling system, are major technological interventions, all requiring innovative approaches and sound business model agreed between the City of Kranj, public district heating service provider, citizens and the private business partners.

Actions in photovoltaic (PV) at municipal, commercial and individual buildings, hydro energy as well as public lighting represent significant upscale and technological modernisation to increase green energy production and efficiency (e.g. smart solutions, batteries).

Piloting of a social innovation measure – energy co-operatives – will assure equal opportunities for people living in multi-unit residential areas in access to green energy. Further investments in solarisation and innovative energy solutions are conditioned by investment in grid capacity.  |
|  Mobility & transport | 2.1. “One car by household” promotion programme
Smart multimodal public transport system
Cycling and walking network
Car-free areas, shared space, one-way streets and P&R
EV and hydrogen charging infrastructure
EV and hydrogen powered municipal vehicles
Reduced transit traffic | Being located on the X. trans-European corridor (TEN-T) and in the gravitation area of the national airport and capital city Ljubljana, the City's influence on the emissions from transport is very limited. Thus, the actions focus primarily on fostering the citizens mobility modal shift – decreasing the volume of carbon intensive daily motorized commuting and short distance traffic to more sustainable modes of travel.

Ambitious actions combining physical investments in modern multimodal passenger hub, cycling and PV/hydrogen charging infrastructure supported by Smart Kranj digital solutions, diversity of new mobility services, improved city traffic management and awareness programme shall motivate citizens, commuters and visitors changing their traditional patterns when traveling to, within and out of Kranj.  |

|   |  | The combined mobility and transport measures shall contribute to 32% of Kranj’s decarbonisation targets.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Waste & circular economy | 3.1. Zero waste programme
Smart waste management
Centre for circular economy
Zarta with new waste management and support services
Kranj Circular City joint public-private innovation actions
Energy and resource efficiency in water supply | As major technological interventions in waste and wastewater management (including CHP facilities) have been completed before 2018, the remaining emissions deriving from waste are manageable.

Existing approaches reducing the scope and recycling efficiency of the communal waste, controlled closing of the landfill (methane) and investments in water supply efficiency will continue the realization of Zero waste strategy.

Hence, the decarbonisation attention is centred to tangible circular economy solutions that will be developed by the city public utility company and pilot public-private innovative projects while offered to citizens, local SMEs, farmers.

In this respect the action demonstrates 13% contribution to city’s decarbonisation goals.  |
|  Green infrastructure & nature-based solutions | 4.1. Sustainable management of green and blue infrastructure system
Greening municipal spatial planning
Green areas and green roofs
Promotion of plant and low emission livestock production
Urban agriculture programme | Even though the city of Kranj is surrounded by forests and agricultural areas, the latter are a source of emissions due to ice and windstorms in the past decade (from 2014) and consequent bark beetle attacks. Forests and agriculture land are constantly under urbanization pressures.

The City, in cooperation with the regional offices of forestry, agriculture and nature protection services and landowners, will designate significant area of forests as special urban forests, improve their management and accelerate maintenance and expansion of other green infrastructure. All possible green spatial planning mechanisms and urban agriculture programme promoting plant and low emission livestock production will be tested to turn the emissions trends.

% sequestration contribution to the city decarbonization targets is estimated.  |
|  Built environment | 5.1. Energy-efficiency renovation of public buildings
Energy-efficiency of residential buildings in urban and suburban neighbourhoods
Integrated smart and climate neutral re-development of urban brownfield areas | Due to long-lasting national funding scheme, the energy efficiency of most multi-unit residential buildings and many municipal buildings were energy retrofitted before 2018.

As a result, the proposed actions target the remaining public and private buildings emphasising integrated renovation as well as replacement of fossil fuel to RES, where possible, connection to the RES district heating.

Special attention will be given to poorly insulated and fossil fuel depending individual  |

houses, owned by vulnerable groups, both in urban and suburban residential areas.

In order to protect the urbanisation of agricultural land and forest, the City will support and participate in integrated regeneration project by investors with the aim to become climate neutral and smart zones. In this way, the results of implemented Smart Mlaka pilot project district will be implemented and upscaled in other neighbourhoods, new mixed zones and business parks.

These actions will make a direct contribution of 7% to the city overall decarbonisation target.

|   |  Action type | Soft intervention (business model, behaviour change, awareness rising)  |
|   |  Action description | To decrease volume of daily use of fossil fuel motor vehicles for short distance traffic within the city and accelerate the modal split shift to sustainable urban mobility, a substantial local policy measures and citizen behaviour change is needed.

There were 22.014 households and 30.064 personal fossil fuel powered motor vehicles in the municipality in 2018. At the same time shortage of 7.000 parking spaces for citizens and visitors is observed by recent studies (Lot 6: ELENA Mobility Slovenia – Sustainable mobility programme in Slovenia, Number of project: 22_1060 ELENA Kranj Contract: «Mobility study of the City of Kranj - lot 6: Comprehensive study of cycling connections, stationary traffic and one-way connections with a proposal for sustainable mobility measures in the City of Kranj» No. 371-0020/2022-12, PNZ and luz, January 2023).

An average household in Kranj has more than 1 car (1,37 car/household, 2018, SORS). Families usually use the second car for short distance travel within the city (e.g. driving kids to after-school activities, shopping, health centre etc.). An ambitious programme aiming at decreasing the number of fossil fuel powered cars to one per household by 2030 is envisaged, meaning a reduction of 8.050 cars.  |

|   |  | The programme complements planned interventions in the city public transport (Action 2.2) and includes governance, policy and promotional measures which would help reduce the need for the second car in the households such as:

“one car household benefit basket”
o free city bus,
o free city bike and other emerging urban mobility services,
o priority access to public parking.
Piloting “1-car multi-apartment facility” supported by e-car sharing lot etc.
Piloting digitalised shared mobility service (e.g. e-van), in particular for vulnerable groups (elderly visits to health centre, children’s’ after-school activities).

|   |  Action description | 25.601 persons commutes to, within and outward Kranj (towards Ljubljana and neighbouring business parks) for work, majority of them using personal cars (SORS, 2018). To make use of public transport attractive to citizens, and in particular daily commuters, further improvements and expansion of public bus transport and different mobility services is foreseen, together with their integration and digitization into a single smart multi-modal city public transport management system.

The following is planned:
(1) Central passenger multimodal terminal – mobility hub Kranj:
Integration of main train and bus terminal and other mobility services at one single hub - location at the current Kranj train station is foreseen. The action involves construction of a bus passenger terminal next to the train station, supported by other micro mobility services and park & ride facilities at the total area of 23.000 m², currently derelict site. In 2023, a comprehensive master plan for the location is being designed in the cooperation of the Government and the City of Kranj. With improved and frequent city bus lines the new terminal will be  |

|   |  | linked to the city centre and major city residential and business districts. By 2030 the terminal will be complemented with a second railway track between Kranj and Ljubljana, an investment run by the Republic of Slovenia. This shall increase rail capacity, train frequency and shorten the travel time between Kranj and Ljubljana.

(2) Kranj routing system: extension of public bus lines and bus frequency adjusted to the needs of commuters, daily users and major generators of hot spots (business and commercial parks, education, social and health centres...) within the urban area of Kranj

(3) Expansion of car-sharing including social innovation initiatives with unused car-fleet of municipality, businesses, schools, clubs etc.

(4) Further extension of city e-bike system from current 29 bike stations with 330 lockers and 200 bikes (125 classical, 75 e-bikes, 2 e-cargo bikes). https://www.krskolesom.si/

(5) Digital integration of urban mobility modes into one single product providing optimisation of routing system, commuting application, smart parking system etc. (MaaS application).  |

|   |  Action description | The relatively flat territory of the Kranj urban area and up to 5 km distances between major functional areas provide favourable conditions for mobility shift towards cycling and walking.

In 2018, there were 32,8 km of cycling paths (71 km, 01/ 2023) and 79,226 km (2022) of sidewalks and walking paths (note: excluding hiking and mountain biking trails).

This action thus focuses on elimination of key barriers in the city's cycling and walking network as identified in the recent study^{4}.

(1) Completion of the gaps in the cycling and walking network within the urban area of Kranj.
(2) Bridging facilities over the rivers Sava and Kokra to better connect river banks for cyclists and walkers and to overcome the elevation between the valley bottom and the city.
(3) Improving cycling and pedestrian connections and safety between Kranj centre, business parks, suburbs in the outer ring of the city and rural hinterland.  |

|   |  Action description | City of Kranj is still car-centred city, cars dominate the urban centre. There are no entirely car-free areas. Even the historic centre allows car access for residents, owners and under certain conditions also business units. All other central areas are not yet favouring pedestrians and bikers.

While on average 18.000 vehicles daily cross one of the city centre main roads (2018, 18.155 PLDP, Kidričeva KR Zlato polje) there are only 90 bikers counted on average per day on the same road (Koroška cesta, 2023). There is no data available on pedestrians. Therefore, the pressure on new parking areas is high. Further to recent studies and current demand, the city lacks approx. 7.000 parking  |

|   |  | spaces if no changes in the modal split are introduced.

Shift in urban and traffic planning in the central urban areas towards more sustainable and car-limiting solutions, together with correspondingly adjusted parking policy, is inevitable to improve the quality of life and reduce emissions from the traffic. The action involves introduction of:

(1) Car free or shared spaces or traffic limited zones with reconstructions and greening in the anticipated surface of approx. 35.000 m² such as:
o Ravnikarjeva ploščad and Slovenski trg (approx. 15.000 m²),
o Kranj historic centre (approx. 12.000 m²),
o Planina district and/or other (approx. 8.000 m²).

(2) One-way road system with speed limits, greening and additional space for pedestrians and cyclists in the city districts.
(3) Park and Ride and Park and Bike/Walk facilities with min 300 PM
o P+R Zlato polje,
o P+R in eastern part of the city.  |

A direct connecting road from Škofja Loka to Meja (City of Kranj) and further to highway is envisaged as part of the so-called 4^{th} Slovenian Development Axis. The road is being planned in both municipal spatial plans while investment is negotiated with the Government of Slovenia. The direct road would reduce traffic and air pollution in the City of Kranj as well as reduce travel distance for the transiting lorries and cars for 4 km.  |

|   |  Action description | The objective of the action is to introduce strategic and operational management of the green and blue infrastructure in the City of Kranj and strengthen its biodiversity. There are 54,3% (81,9 km²) of forests and 1% (1,5 km²) of water areas; 6,1% (9,3 km²) of the territory is protected nature, 15% identified as nature value sites, 19,4% designated as Natura 2000 (29,3 km²), and 20,9% recognized as ecological important area and, their management is left to landowners and the respective national/ regional bodies. Furthermore, the analysis shows that forests in Kranj are in poor condition which results in net total GHG emissions. As urban forests, waters and biodiversity are important value for the city's sustainable future, their vitality shall be improved, therefore the actions involve:

(1) Definition of the management system, including classification and the ecosystem services they provide;
(2) Integration and implementation of the system within the City’s Green Spatial Plan;
(3) Definition and protection of suburban forests as forests with special purpose (recreational and social function);
(4) Management plan for the green and blue infrastructure system emphasizing the appropriate forest management and biodiversity (incl. nature protected areas) in urban and suburban areas as to assure their CO₂ sink capacity and adapting the system to climate change;

15-minutes city planning concept (FMC);
Larger share of green areas;
Revised standards for parking space, requirements for charging stations and energy storage;
Circular principles in material use – use of re-cycled construction materials.

As the implementation of final target – zero-emission construction requires wide consensus of stakeholders and citizens, a gradual approach is foreseen, involving:
(1) Setting the standards for green spatial planning at the territory of the City of Kranj;
(2) Preparation guidelines for zero-emission construction and green spatial master plans (for implementation see action 5.3);
(3) Awareness rising, promotion and education on green solutions in the new developments and regeneration projects;
(4) Green municipal spatial plan: full introduction of green and climate neutral concepts in the new generation of spatial plan or in the next amendment of the existing spatial plan;
(5) Introducing green and climate neutral concepts in the wider functional area - greening of Regional Spatial Plan of Gorenjska region.

Hard intervention (infrastructure)  |
|   |  Action description | Further to Agriculture Census as of 2020, there are 448 farms in the City of Kranj which are in comparison to the EU of small size. The farms manage in total 9.122 ha of land, of which 4.938 ha is arable and 3.901 ha forests. The average farm has 11 ha of arable land and 8,7 ha of forests. 57% of farms raise livestock for meat or milk (18,6 livestock per farm), 15% have mixed production (mostly self-sufficient farming) and 21% are specialized in plant production. Due to predominant livestock farming, the estimated GHG from agriculture (above all methane from enteric fermentation and manure management) are relatively high. On the other hand, vegetable production is locally far undersupplied.

In addition to the national climate measures of the CAP Strategic Plan, the City of Kranj will invest in promotion of plant production and reduction of emissions from the livestock sector. The action includes measures such as:

(1) Accelerated local promotion and farmers' competences in:
Local vegetable production and local vegetable supply chains.
CAP measures: optimizing animal feeding, using additives to reduce enteric methane emissions, and fertilization practices that reduce ammonia emissions into the air. Through promotion, we will achieve that the implementation of these measures in the area of the City of Kranj will be greater than at the national level.
Nutritional strategies to mitigate emissions of methane from enteric fermentation, including the use of methane inhibitors.
Practices to improve the utilization of nitrogen from animal manure and mineral fertilizers.

(2) Setting up a pilot communal irrigation system in the surface of 100 ha in Sorško polje, the SW lowland area of Kranj municipality, including a new  |

Aiming at increasing local food self-sufficiency rate, preserving small substance suburban farming and more efficiently exploiting urban green and abandoned areas for food production, an urban agriculture programme is going to be designed and demonstrated. Some initiatives have already been identified during the CCC participatory process but are not exhaustive:

(1) Urban gardening:
Extended areas for community gardens;
Guidelines for common garden design;
Adjustments of the municipal regulatory and spatial planning framework;
Promotion, demonstrations and education on composting, drain water collection, use of (organic) fertilizers.
(2) “Farm to Fork” programme for daily distribution of local food to consumers.
(3) Joint dynamic digital public procurement system of all municipal public services for forecasting and purchasing of local food for schools.
(4) Public local food cool vending machines supplied by local farmers, digitally supported, installed at P+R, etc.
(5) Financial support for innovative farms’ projects, preferably ecological farms run by young farmers.
(6) Experimental food production in abandoned industrial and commercial facilities and roofs.
(7) Urban beekeeping initiatives.
(8) Donations for preserving subsistence farming, landscape and biodiversity – investors and businesses plant indigenous and traditional (fruit) trees and varieties of plants.  |

|   |  | A. Multi-apartment facilities

multi-unit buildings in several densely populated Kranj urban districts are managed by the major facility managing company. 65% of the buildings in their management have undergone energy-efficiency rehabilitation by 2018. Thus, this action refers to renovation of approx. 140 of remaining multi-unit residential buildings with approx. 2.400 apartments to reach the approx. 90% goal = 120 buildings):
50 buildings x 20 = 1.000 apartments (total 367 = 7.500 app) between 2018-2022
70 buildings x 20 = 1.400 apartments (total 437= 8.900 apartments) between 2023-2030

Wherever possible, energy-efficiency measures are complemented by measures improving the property life-span, climate and earthquake safety, accessibility and green areas.

B. Individual houses
There are 9.695 individual residential units with one (8728) or two flats (967) in the area of Kranj city predominantly constructed 40-50 years ago. According to LEC, majority of them still use fossil fuel (light fuel oil). To accelerate their transition to RES or one of the planned district heating systems (see action 1.1), the City intends to collaborate with LEAG and Slovenia Eco Fund or other financial partner developing special programme to provide engineering support and subsidies to individual house owners, in particular low-income owners and elderly, to undertake the energy-efficiency measures. The target is for 2.500 individual houses to be renovated.

## Summary strategy for residual emission

**Total residual emissions: 46.334 tonnes CO₂/year (20,00%)**

The City of Kranj has laid down an ambitious strategy for transition into a carbon-neutral entity by the year 2030. This commitment is anchored in a multi-sectoral approach that addresses the unique challenges and opportunities within each sector. The Climate Action Framework outlines a series of interventions, policies, and projects that are designed to collectively bring about a significant reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, pushing towards the overarching goal of climate neutrality.

Despite the robust strategies in place, it is acknowledged that some level of residual emissions will persist. These emissions, which will remain after all feasible measures have been implemented, present the final barrier to achieving complete neutrality. The quantification of these residual emissions allows for the identification of offsets and the development of additional strategies to mitigate the remaining carbon footprint.

Given all the challenges, City of Kranj, like many other cities, aims to minimize GHG emissions as much as possible. Once minimized, the city would then balance the remaining emissions with offsetting initiatives such as investing in renewable energy projects, reforestation, or other carbon capture efforts. The purchasing of certified renewable energy can also contribute to offsetting by ensuring that the energy the city consumes is being produced by renewable sources of energy.

In summary, while City of Kranj will strive to reduce their emissions to the lowest feasible level, some residual emissions are expected due to current technological, economic, and behavioural limitations. It is these residual emissions that the city plans to compensate for through credible offsetting strategies and renewable energy purchases to achieve their net-zero targets.

## Buildings

**Residual emissions after implementation of proposed actions: 13.166 tonnes CO₂**

Residual emissions in the building sector, post-implementation of proposed actions, are estimated at 13.166 tonnes of CO₂. This figure encapsulates emissions from both public and private buildings,
CITY OF KRANJ
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

which are often the most challenging to mitigate due to the nature of built infrastructure, historical preservation, and the need for balancing modernization with community acceptance. Reasons for residual emissions:

Heritage conservation: City of Kranj, with its historical buildings, faces challenges in retrofitting these structures to high energy efficiency standards without compromising their architectural integrity.
Investment limitations: Full-scale investment to upgrade all residential and commercial buildings to zero emissions or energy-plus status is beyond current budgetary provisions.
Adoption rates: Uptake of energy-efficient technologies by residents and businesses can be slower than needed due to various factors including costs, lack of awareness, or resistance to change.
Innovative technologies: The city is exploring advanced solutions such as smart building technologies, but full deployment and optimization are still in progress.
District heating systems energy security: In Kranj, energy security is of pivotal concern when considering the transition from natural gas to renewable energy sources in the district heating systems. The systems, currently reliant on natural gas, offers stability and rapid responsiveness to demand fluctuations. The planned integration of biomass, which will enhance sustainability but maintaining at least 10% natural gas baseline, is a strategic measure to ensure uninterrupted heat supply. This approach safeguards against supply disruptions and extreme weather, guaranteeing continuous service provision. It also mitigates risks associated with the variability of biomass supplies.

**Strategy:**

Influencing changes of national regulations and subsidies criteria for energy efficiency rehabilitation of heritage buildings – in collaboration with the Association of Historic Towns of Slovenia.
Initiation of an open dialog with citizens on the potential and eventual acceptance of incineration of commercial waste for district heating – renewable energy production.
Accelerated engagement of residents, property owners and investors who will not follow the rehabilitation and climate neutral construction by 2030 as envisaged by the actions.

**Transport**

**Residual emissions after implementation of proposed actions: 13.614 tonnes CO₂/year**

Kranj is working on modernization and decarbonization of its transport system through the promotion of non-motorized mobility, the electrification of public and private transport, and the development of smarter urban planning that reduces the need for vehicular travel. Despite these efforts, the transport sector will still contribute to the city's residual emissions. To address this, Kranj will be looking into offsetting projects that focus on advanced low-carbon mobility solutions and improving the efficiency of existing transport systems. Reasons for residual emissions:

Transition time: It takes time for public and private transport fleets to transition to zero-emissions vehicles due to the lifespan of existing vehicles and the pace of infrastructure development for alternative fuels.
Aviation: Some transport sectors, like aviation, have limited low-carbon alternatives available at present.
Technological development: Electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles are still evolving, and the technologies to fully replace conventional combustion engines are not yet completely mature or universally adopted.
Consumer choices: Despite incentives, the rate at which citizens move towards using sustainable transport options like cycling, public transport, or electric vehicles may not be rapid enough to eliminate all emissions by the target year.

# Strategy:

Initiating regional approach to sustainable mobility: design and adoption of a Sustainable Regional Mobility Strategy of Gorenjska region and setting up joint centre for promotion of sustainable mobility at BSC Kranj - Regional development Agency of Gorenjska.
Alignment of SUMPS in Kranj functional area: coordination of envisaged new SUMPS with neighbouring municipalities and the City of Ljubljana as a major commuting destination for Kranj residents.
Extension of Kranj city bus lines to Kranj's functional areas, in particular business parks, education centres and residential areas in neighbouring municipalities of Naklo, Šenčur, Preddvor, Tržič and in the direction Škofja Loka – Ljubljana.
Engagement of commuters and large traffic generators who will keep traditional commuting practices.

# Waste

## Residual emissions after implementation of proposed actions: 5.351 tonnes CO₂/year

Waste management is a critical aspect of Kranj's environmental strategy. By enhancing selective waste collection, increasing recycling rates, and educating the public on waste minimization, significant improvements are expected. Nonetheless, waste processes inherently produce residual emissions. To counteract these, Kranj will invest in projects that enable the circular use of resources. Reasons for residual emissions:

Biodegradable waste: Even with comprehensive recycling and waste reduction programs, some biodegradable waste will still decompose and produce methane, a potent GHG.
Technical challenges: Complete capture and utilization of gases from waste, particularly in existing landfills is technologically complex.
Consumer behaviour: Not all individuals or businesses may comply with recycling and composting schemes, leading to higher amounts of GHG-emitting waste.

# Strategy:

Initiating an open dialog with citizens on the potential and eventual acceptance of incineration of commercial waste for district heating – renewable energy production.

# Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU)

## Residual emissions after implementation of proposed actions: 5.451 tonnes CO₂/year

In the IPPU sector, City of Kranj will face residual emissions from industrial processes that are hard to reduce with current technology. While the City will continue to foster innovation and cleaner industrial processes, it will also support offsetting through mechanisms that support industry-related environmental projects. These projects will not only help offset emissions but will also stimulate local economic growth and industrial modernization. Reasons for residual emissions:

Process emissions: Certain industrial processes inherently emit GHG as a by-product of chemical reactions, not just from energy use.
Technological constraints: Some industries may not yet have viable commercial-scale technologies for capturing or eliminating emissions.
Economic factors: High costs associated with transitioning to low-emission processes can be a significant barrier, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Composting schemes: The schemes are leading to higher amounts of GHG-emitting waste.

# Strategy:

Promoting piloting carbon storage technologies in industrial processes, in particular in rubber processing industry.

# Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU)

## Residual emissions after implementation of proposed actions: 10.185 tonnes CO₂/year

There are significant externalities that influence the future emissions in the AFOLU sector and impact the estimated residual emissions:

Restoration of forests takes more than 10 years: After facing extreme natural disasters before 2018, the forests in the city areas are steadily recovering which shall together with sustainable management and conservative felling gradually increase their sequestration potential however the whole process might take beyond 2030.
Slow uptake of CAP climate measures among farmers: Although National Rural Development Plan provides subsidies and agriculture service to promote the transition to decarbonisation agriculture practices, their penetration among majority of farmers might be slower as expected.
Methodologies in AFLOU require longer observation periods.

# Strategy:

Anticipated changes in IPCC methodologies will most likely impact the reduction of GHG emissions from agriculture.
Restoration of forests with new tree species (higher emphasise on leaves instead of conifers) more efficient as envisaged by actions – consequently higher sequestration from forests as anticipated.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan


# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part C "Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030" aims to outline any enabling interventions, i.e., regarding organizational setting or collaborative governance models or related to social innovations – designed to support the climate action portfolios (Module B-2) as well as aiming to achieve co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Module B-1). These interventions also address the identified opportunities, gaps and barriers identified Module A-2 and A-3.

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

This module details the city's governance innovations for achieving city climate neutrality by 2030, describing innovations in institutional design, in leadership, and in collaborative and outreach processes, whether they are inter-organisational or internal to the key organisations responsible for the city's climate neutrality target. It also describes expected outcomes, for example how these governance innovations enable climate actions and their co-benefits (outlined in Modules B-1 and B-2), and how they address the opportunities, gaps and barriers identified in Modules A-2 and A-3.

### C-1.1: Description or visualisation of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

The City of Kranj climate neutrality commitment is a joint effort, thus it has been designed from the start as a participatory change process for all, the City, its citizens, businesses, public institutions and civil society. The proposed model builds on the existing City's participatory tools and the networks as well as identified gaps in the CCC co-creative process running over last two years.

The participatory process is based on engagement of all relevant stakeholders considering their mission, expertise, influence and interest, detailed stakeholder mapping presented in the chapter A.3.1 and motivation of target groups for decarbonisation – gradual abandonment of some traditional habits and replacing them with more sustainable ones. The participatory principles are embedded in three main pillars of the model: governance structure, partnership network and set of participation tools (see also Figure 18). The intensity of participation grows gradually along with the planning and implementation processes, starting inside within the governance structure and extending outwards to specific and general public.

for smart city. SCCNSC is continuously open to partners who have significant impact on Kranj climate targets.

Operational level represented by the TT composed by officers from the relevant city administration departments under the coordination of the Department for Green Transition.
The implementing level representing professionals from key institutions responsible to prepare and deliver individual actions in close cooperation with TT. They mainly come from municipal administration departments, municipal public service providers, utility companies and implementing agencies and represent an extended professional platform of the TT.

All of the above structures are in place, mentioned stakeholders involved in the planning process and agree in further cooperation.

$\rightarrow$  Kranj Climate neutrality partnership network representing broader ecosystem:

Local dissemination partners including envisaged One-stop shop for citizens, institutional dissemination partners (library, schools ...) and media who can significantly reach out towards specific target groups as well as motivate and advice broader public citizens and businesses in up-taking the climate neutral habits and solutions or participate in concrete actions.
Consultation and expertise partners such as local ad hoc focus groups, research, expertise and finance organisations from and outside the city and other Cities Mission cities who have the specific expertise, initiatives and funds to support the TT and implementing entities of the AP.

Most of the 'extended partners' have been approached during the planning phase while the concept of partners and one-stop-shop need to be further elaborated and its facilitation agreed.

$\rightarrow$  Participatory tools, practices and principles, many of which are already in place, have been successfully applied by the CoK over the past decades and need to be adapted to communicate the Kranj climate neutrality mission, goals and actions. However, Smart Kranj Platform remains the backbone of the communication and collaboration with citizens. The list of key communication and participatory tools extends from providing of information to provision of citizens participation opportunities. The list of tools is not fixed and exhaustive. They shall develop along with the process.

Information &amp; communication: web &amp; social media, climate neutral &amp; PR
Awareness &amp; education: education tools, events, best practice exchange, video tips, product specific apps such as KR'bike
Active participation: KR'say app, KR'suggest app, on-line survey, workshops, open public actions, ambassadors &amp; heroes, one stop shop

Following the outline of the participatory model, a detailed communication and participatory plan will be elaborated in 2024, focusing on the mobility challenges in the city. For its implementation, a participation and communication officer has been employed in the Department for Green Transition. Additional external support, preferably NGOs will be engaged for management of the process on a larger scale. See also more detailed report on the co-creative process and a preliminary framework for the future in Annex 2.

C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

Openness to innovation, being of social, digital/ technological or governance character, is embedded in the City of Kranj climate neutral and smart city development vision as a horizontal principle and its daily modus operandi. There are four main but complex intervention areas each of them supporting or integrating sectoral actions and addressing identified barriers and opportunities in module A-3. See also Figure 19 below.

CITIZENS' AND INVESTORS' ONE-STOP-SHOP AND SUPPORT PROGRAMME for climate neutral and smart city

Shift to climate neutral city is a common goal of all, thus engaging wider public and facilitation of the inclusive change process is the central task of the social innovation interventions. It involves setting up of the 'point' and continued delivery of its participation and awareness rising programme.

Innovative Climate neutral and smart city One-stop shop as an open, participatory and coordinated tool for citizen groups, businesses and investors. Two stage approach is foreseen: at first digital (through Smart Kranj Platform and mobile app Maas) and later as an public open space/office offering a meeting point and digital education tools - video/VR/real, infographics.
Providing citizens access to practical advice of different experts / institutions at one spot (energy-efficiency, mobility planning, reconstruction, gardening.) through digital and face-to-face assistance in cooperation with experts and existing public, PPP and educational institutions (EnSvet, LEAG, Vizije mobilnosti, CTM, BSC, RAS, CTRP and NGOs engaged in climate actions etc.)
Open and participatory communication based on specific mission identity, strong encouraging messages and existing multiple communication channels: website to provide detailed information, FAQs with quick answers to common questions, tips, best practices and articles explaining the concepts of climate neutrality and smart city technologies etc.), citizens interactive tool of the digital platform, screens all over the city, social media, local and community newspapers, regular community meetings, radio and television.
CITY OF KRANJ
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Learning programme and tools supported by digital education tools, demonstration actions and concrete initiatives.
Enhanced cooperation with Kranj kindergartens and primary schools to provide them with materials/work on climate topics to support existing events (Eco day, Earth Day...) and develop new climate neutrality related programmes.
Setting up a network of Kranj climate neutral partner organisations and individual supporters such as heroes or ambassadors – competent, informed and inspiring young/elderly, creating inspiring videos with them, presenting best climate mitigation practices etc.
Tailor made events and awareness rising actions in collaboration with local CCC partners (Kranj City Library, Kranj Sports Centre, museums, Health centre, Adult education and life-long learning centre, business incubator and co-working, tourism board, NGOs): e.g. workshops, experiencing actions - riding e-bikes, e-cars, signs on the roads to encourage sustainable mobility, zero waste pop-up stands and heroes on large events, education on what is P+R, webinars, café round tables, conference to engage and educate citizens, businesses and investors.

# SMART KRANJ – INTEGRATED DIGITAL PLATFORM for climate transition management and citizen services

After the adoption of Integrated Sustainable Urban Development Strategy of Kranj in 2016 and supported by Kranj Digital Strategy in 2020, the City of Kranj has been systematically building up and connecting processes, platforms, data and services into a single digital environment to support management of the smart city functions, improving the quality of life of citizens and visitors, provide better and more efficient services for the citizens as well as to support city's transition to climate neutrality. The intervention is thus centered around three main components:

Smart Kranj Digital Platform with technologies that enable connection and data usage of various utility and service providers (transport, waste, natural disasters, air quality, energy consumption, events, health, citizens participation, household and financial data, surveys) for management and monitoring of city green transition, including public carbon footprint dashboard, and introducing different policy measures and related behavioural changes and interactions in the community.
MaaS App – providing new services for citizens, primarily those easing the transition to climate neutrality for citizens (city public transport route planner, smart parking, smart waste, smart cycling etc.) or enabling incentives for behavioural changes and proactive interaction with users (benefits for one-car households, walkers and bikers etc.).
Kranj Smart City Card – top of wallet card – connecting all city services and public services with an integrated loyalty system. By using the city card and rewarding system, the city intends to influence changes in the behaviour and lifestyle of citizens.

# CLIMATE NEUTRAL AND SMART CITY DISTRICTS DEVELOPMENT AND/OR REGENERATION MODEL

One of Kranj's major challenges is the ability to promote climate neutral and smart solutions within the major developments, being the new mixed districts, business parks, residential areas or brownfield regeneration projects. In this way the energy, mobility, waste, green space and building measures can be simultaneously integrated and implemented in a concrete territory.

While a smart concept has already been piloted in one of the existing residential areas of individual houses (Smart Mlaka district), its upscale with additional emphasise of climate neutrality measures needs to be introduced in a larger scale. Prior evaluation and analyses of interest among other local districts is necessary.
CITY OF KRANJ
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

On the other hand, for larger areas there is an evident lack of technological, planning, governance, financial and operational competences and practices in Slovenia, including absence of financial schemes and cost-benefit. Thus, an appropriate and more comprehensive development models need to be prepared and agreed in close cooperation between the investors, city administration planners, financial institutions and in participation of residents/businesses, on case-by-case basis such as:

PLAN TO UP-SCALE SMART MLAKA MODEL to other residential neighbourhood’s concept following prior evaluation and improvements;
CLIMATE NEUTRAL AND SMART BUSINESS PARK DEVELOPMENT MODEL (demonstration case Business park Hrastje);
CLIMATE NEUTRAL AND SMART URBAN REGENERATION MODEL (demonstration case urban district Primskovo regeneration).

## GREENING THE PARTICIPATORY BUDGET

The City of Kranj has dedicated part of its budget to be planned and voted by citizens through an open process called **KR PREDLAGAJ/ KR SUGGEST** which proved to be well accepted mechanism among the residents. More than 100 citizens’ proposals are submitted annually, and over 30 accepted for funding. Thus, the City of Kranj will keep the mechanism, increase visibility and participation as well as to link the scheme to CCC process as to better exploit its potential to address the city’s climate neutral targets.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the CCC Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for refining the CCC Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract in future iterations.

## Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iteration

The City of Kranj 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan depicts various actions needed in the field of energy systems, sustainable mobility, waste and circular economy, green infrastructure and built environment for reaching the climate neutrality by 2030. Failure in implementation any of the action would jeopardise the set decarbonisation targets and require response of one of the following key mitigation measures:

ongoing adaptation of individual actions if the proposed approach is not feasible or new or better solutions emerge;
modification of the Action Plan (a revision is recommended after the in-depth mid-term monitoring in 2026 following the 2025 GHG inventory) and/or
continuation and strengthening of planned activities and actions after 2030.

It is off utmost importance for the City of Kranj and its Transition Team and Strategic Council to exploit the positive momentum and take the following further steps in the period 2024-2025:

Engage, instruct and coordinate all bodies responsible for implementing the individual actions.
Focus on critical actions. Increase human resources and set up operational teams (e.g. Task force) for the most critical actions with significant impact on the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$ targets, prepare necessary technical, investment documentations and permits:
District heating and 1.2 Utilisation of waste heat from industrial and commercial facilities,
Solar electricity production and 1.7 Energy co-operatives,
One car by households and 2.1. Smart multimodal transport system,
Energy-efficiency of residential buildings in urban and suburban neighbourhoods.
Assure commitment, capacities and skills of the city administration and major stakeholders to integrate climate neutral principles in their regular operation.
Accelerate citizen participation. Prepare participation strategy, set up one stop shop, engage wider partner network, launch communication and participation programme, focusing on the priority fields of action where major citizens' actions and behaviour changes are required (e.g. mobility).
Assure government support. Get on board different ministries to release funds for Cities Mission projects. Strengthen collaborative approach of the Slovenian Mission cities towards the Slovenian Government for system support.
City of Kranj Capital Budget shall integrate actions in the current budget plan.
Smart Kranj digital platform. Prepare the platform to be ready to support actions in AP, citizens participation and AP monitoring and evaluation system.
Assure annual monitoring and reporting to the Strategic Council and conduct $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ inventory based on data for 2022.
Keep interest of business sector and financial institutions for participation in the AP implementation. Further develop concrete action related working relationships.
Revise or adapt existing city strategies and sector plans to the Action plan targets, at least ISDS, spatial plan, LEC, SUMP.
NetZeroCities Programme: After the successful launch of the programme and Climate City Contract 2030 activities in the first phase, in the iterative phase of the Cities Mission process, broader connection with EU policy development will be established.

# ANNEX 2: Climate City Contract Co-creative Participatory Process of the City of Kranj

This document supports the information provided in the Commitment document, Action and Investment Plans, outlining stakeholders' and citizens' engagement in the City's climate neutrality co-creative processes. The following pages outline the structures organised for the preparation and implementation of CCC, detailed description of the past co-creative planning process, the approach to public participation and use of existing tools, a short summary of the citizen survey, existing synergies with Pilot Cities Programme UP-SCALE project as well as an indicative outlook of the envisaged steps in engaging the residents in climate actions, behaviour change and climate investment.

# GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES FOR CCC MANAGEMENT AND CONSULTATION

The City of Kranj is aware that achieving climate neutrality by 2030 requires changes in management, communication and day-to-day way of work. It was crucial from the start to understand that the success of the process heavily depends on involvement and engagement of a broad network of stakeholders and citizens who will have a pivotal role in making these changes a reality. Having that in mind, a stakeholder mapping of public and private organisations was carried out in early 2023, followed by the activation of partners in important sectors (energy, transport, green infrastructure, built environment etc.). A two-level partnership structure has been set up and relevant individuals and stakeholders have been invited into the CCC planning process. The structure and placement within the existing City governance system is given in the chart below.

CITY OF KRANJ
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

On the strategic level, the main partnership body and think thank bringing together 27 leaders and senior experts, representing stakeholders, most relevant for reducing the GHG emissions in the city in all 5 fields of action, is the Strategic Council of the City of Kranj for Climate Neutral and Smart Community (SCCNSC). Stakeholders, represented in the Council, are also signatories to the City's Climate Commitment document. The SCCNSC origins lie in the former City Strategic Council for Smart Community, the current structure representing an extended version of the original group. In this way, we can better exploit the resources and make synergies between smart and climate actions. The SCCNSC is chaired by the mayor of the City of Kranj. It is co-chaired by two persons, the best climate expert in Slovenia, also a resident of the City of Kranj, and a Head of Office for Development and Smart Community of the City of Kranj (CoK). So far, the extended SCCNSC has met three times (twice in person and once on-line). Other relevant individuals and experts were individually involved in thematic focus groups or individual consultations.

Operational level is represented by the Transition Team (TT), composed of 20 senior officers from the relevant city administration departments and coordinated by the Office for Development and Smart Community, Department for Green Transition. So far, the TT has met four times, while individual members were involved on a daily basis, especially in providing and analysing data, attending thematic workshops and individual consultations needed to close the emission gap. Further on in the implementation stage, the TT will be extended by the professionals responsible for preparation and implementation of individual actions. They are mainly employees of municipal administration departments, municipal public service providers, and utility companies and implementing agencies.

These governance structures will remain in function throughout the CCC implementation period. If necessary, the membership will be enhanced with stakeholders and professionals in the fields that might appear as a gap (representatives of the government, representatives of certain most affected communities, NGOs etc.).

# THE CCC CO-CREATION PARTICIPATIVE PROCESSES

The Climate Commitment process and document is a result of a joint effort. From the start, it has been designed as a co-creative and participatory process, running form the beginning of 2023 until recently (February 2024). As climate neutrality is rather a new topic to address among the stakeholders, citizens and CoKA, the initial activation was needed. The process was designed in a way to systematically target different groups using different approaches. The engagement started within CoKA, setting new governance structures, and was gradually extended externally in the following order:

) Firstly, stakeholders with direct impact on the reduction of GHG emissions were approached and invited to join the SCCNSC, individual interviews and thematic workshops were conducted (for those not included in the SCCNSC, in particular governmental bodies) and technical meetings with utility providers were executed.
) Secondly, stakeholders with targeted specialised competences and knowledge base in green transitions by participation were engaged in the focus group workshops and consultation meetings (e.g. institutes, university, high schools).
) Thirdly, stakeholders with greater reach to general public such as the main city library, health centre, schools, sport centre, kindergartens were engaged in tailor made workshops and presentations.
) Finally, citizens and specific target groups (the youth, businesses) were addressed through open survey, focus group workshops, communication activities, and organisation of joint public events.

The stakeholder engagement process was incorporated into the CCC planning process to enable co-creativity along each planning step. The process was managed by the Department for Green Transition in support with Local Energy Agency and team of external experts. For the process flow and the dates of key workshops and meetings see Figure 2. The intensity of participation grew gradually along with the planning and will be further extended and adjusted to specific target groups/areas during the implementation of individual actions.

# CITIZENS and ORGANISATION SURVEYS

Two surveys were conducted in the course of the process: i) a comprehensive survey among citizens of the City of Kranj and ii) a targeted thematic survey among most relevant climate neutral related business units and state institutions operating in Kranj.

Between April and May 2023 citizens survey was launched aiming to get insight into current Sustainable Strategy directions and assess and motivate citizens for taking climate actions. The survey was announced and introduced to the general public in advance news articles in local media and on website. The goal was to reach out to the general public and to engage as many citizens as possible, thus the survey was also promoted through social media and partners' institutional network. Both, digital and paper version were available.

Results of the survey were considered within the design of the decarbonisation pathway and published on the city's website. Most indicative answers are presented below.

# COMMUNICATING THE CCC

We have been communicating the EU Cities Mission goals and objectives since the selection of the City of Kranj into the elite group of Mission cities through established communication channels:

CoK website;
CoK Meta profile (FB) was used to share each step of the process about

the Mission;
signing the Commitment for cooperation with other two Slovenian Mission cities, Ljubljana and Velenje;
the Cities Mission kick-off event in Brussels;
o sending out invitation to citizens to fill in the survey in the process of the CCC preparation;
o sharing the information about the establishment of the Strategic Council for Climate Neutral and Smart Community and its meetings;
the visit of Mr. Child in Ljubljana;
CITY OF KRANJ
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

o signing the Climate Neutrality Commitments with stakeholders.

The Cities Mission and efforts of Kranj to achieve the climate neutrality goals were also a major topic at the Think Green, Go Sustainable press conference. An article about the conference was published in the news section online and in the municipal newspaper Kranjske novice.

Since Kranj became a Mission city, the Mayor of the CoK has been communicating the Cities Mission objectives and the steps the City has been taking, the goals and plans, at topic related events, round tables, congresses and conferences (Bridge for Cities, UNIDO; Smart City Expo World Congress 2023; Forum of Mayors, UNECE). The general public learns about these events through sharing the news on City's website, Meta profile, LinkedIn, Instagram.

The City has been building societal acceptance by dissemination of topical news, educational content, and advice on sustainable living in connection with the Mission.

The engagement of the citizens will also be supported by the help of digital tools, such as Smart City Card (CeKR) and Smart City Digital Platform, the first one in the phase of launching to the general public and the later already in operation (Digital transformation in Kranj can be a model; The CeKR city card will be among the most advanced in the world).

# CITIZENS' ENGAGEMENT: THE USE OF EXISTING CITY TOOLS, PLATFORMS AND PARTICIPATION PROCESSES

Participative processes and citizens' engagement are not new formats for the City of Kranj. Besides regulatory requirements for public consultation on all city acts, including the Annual Budget and Spatial Plan, the City of Kranj uses several tools and platforms that enable residents to express themselves, participate or influence the City's policies. The most innovative ones are listed below:

Digital participatory tools for active participation: a platform for suggestions, ideas, initiatives, (critical) comments etc. KR povej (KR'say) (Figure 1)
Participatory budget called KR predlagaj (KR'suggest)
Forums, committees and stakeholder groups
Existing Strategic Council for Climate Neutrality and Smart Community has been defined as the appropriate platform to address climate related topics on a strategic level.

The so far CCC preparation process exploited all of the mentioned tools and networks and taken into account citizens' initiatives which were proposed though different existing channels. In this respect, through KR povej, altogether 826 initiatives of the citizens were assessed (412 in 2022 and 414 in 2023. Approximately 90% of them were addressing the area of public lighting, roads, civil protection, open space and green areas, urbanism, communal waste, ecology, water supply and parking. KR predlagaj, the platform for participatory budget, offered an interesting insight in the various small scale needs of citizens. Out of 269 initiatives received from 2022 to 2024, 45% (122) are reflected in the proposed CCC Actions portfolio.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 4: KR'POVEJ distribution of citizens initiatives in the territory

Beyond the Strategic Council for Climate Neutral and Smart Community the existing forums were used to disseminate the information and raise the awareness on climate neutrality, in particularly during regular annual meetings with leaders and residents of local district communities.

Besides, all city strategies (e.g. Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, Tourism Strategy, Rural Development Programme) are being prepared in a way to open the process to the general public and/or focus on the stakeholder and citizen groups or territories most affected by certain policy. So, workshops, surveys, focus group meetings, forums, actions and similar participative forms are running continuously.

It was important for the CCC approach not to overlap with other processes and not to overburden the stakeholders. In parallel with the CCC process, the Department for Spatial Planning and Environment was conducting the Environment Operation Plan and revision of Spatial Plan, therefore the two departments merged efforts and synced the processes.

# SYNERGIES WITH UPSCALE PROJECT

As part of the NZC Pilot Cities Programme UP-SCALE project, which will test and promote sustainable mobility solutions in the City of Kranj, we are establishing MaaS (Mobility as a Service) application. The App will be integrated into the Smart Kranj Platform and will strive to optimize public transportation.

During the project implementation, various communication activities including raising awareness encouraging citizens to change their habits, will be used. In addition, educational campaigns and awareness initiatives involving residents in creating and testing solutions will be used. Co-creating workshops for all generations are planned engaging schools and kindergartens, the elderly, public library members, Intergenerational Centre visitors, local community groups, NGOs etc. The workshops will also be an opportunity to educate citizens about using the sustainable mobility options and their benefits.

All useful information will be available as informational brochures and through communication channels. More important, in the long term, the Smart City Digital Platform is to become the key channel for their participation as it will enable interactive communication and decision-making.

# FUTURE STRATEGY ON COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

The transition between planning and implementation requires scaling the current participatory action to broader scale. The City is aware that design and management of the transition to climate change require skills and capacities that the Transition Team is lacking. Therefore, it is envisaged to:

→ Prepare communication and participatory plan that will address the general communication, and branding of the transition process but more specifically focus on engaging citizens of actions under the Mobility and Transport and in the field of Built environment (rehabilitation and change of energy sources). The following target groups will be in focus:

Mobility &amp; Transport

# 1 Introduction

This opening section explains the city's motivation to join the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" and highlights the city's present commitments to climate action.

# Introduction

The City of Kranj is the third largest city in Slovenia with the population of 57,171 (2023) and area of 151 km2. Characterised by strategic transit location, technological and Alpine cultural background, Kranj has been committed to following the sustainable development principles and goals (SDG).

City's earliest climate action initiatives originate in successful implementation of the Local Energy Concept since 2008 in buildings and public lighting. In May 2013 the City Council adopted a decision to join the Covenant of Mayors to be a part of the group of advanced European local governments practicing measures to mitigate the impact of climate change at the local level. Consequently, the City of Kranj Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP, February 2014) set the city's first climate related targets -  $21\%$  reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 2020 as of 2006. SEAP also introduced the strategy for intensified investments into energy-efficiency of public, state and private residential buildings, introduction of renewable sources of energy, public lighting, new mobility schemes, and awareness rising.

The climate and sustainable energy goals have been included in Sustainable Urban Development Strategy Kranj 2030 (2016). Aiming to become a sustainable, progressive, and vibrant city of diverse opportunities and high life quality for all, the new city strategy focused on new cross-sectoral priorities, among them also sustainable and smart development of the city.

In the following years Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (2017) and Digital and Smart City Development Strategy (2020) were adopted, both promoting investments, demonstration projects, digital transformation, and engagement of partners, businesses and citizens to ensure the implementation of necessary changes.

The City of Kranj, as the regional centre, actively supported and adopted Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan for Gorenjska region (SECAP, 2018). The review of the SECAP showed that the measures and investments helped to reduce the emissions in the energy sector, but not yet in transport and other sectors. Based on these facts and supported by tangible smart city practices, new business models and e-services have been introduced over the last years, joining the EU Mission 100 climate-neutral and smart cities in 2022 as a logical next step. The City of Kranj is ready to respond to the needs of its citizens for active, healthy and creative lifestyles, future sustainable urban development and climate goals.

Becoming climate neutral city by 2030 is a challenging and innovative task, which requires new competences, technologies, and changes. The City of Kranj is aware that the goal can only be achieved by strong internal commitment, citizens' and other stakeholders' involvement in the planning and implementation processes, cutting-edge knowledge, and exchange of practices between participating Slovenian and European cities. In the survey in 2023, more than  $70\%$  of the citizens agreed that addressing the climate change is a joint responsibility. During the Climate City Contract (CCC) preparation workshops, it was made clear that the young generation will most likely be the driving force of city's green transition.

Kranj intends to extend its decarbonisation efforts to neighbouring municipalities in the functional and whole NUTS 3 Gorenjska region and, as an important partner, join efforts and synergies with the region in the framework of the EU Climate Change Adaptation Mission. The City of Kranj provides a sound basis for accelerating progress towards carbon neutrality in all sectors, supported by a strong local private-public partnerships, motivated institutions, non-governmental organisations (NGO), and individuals. The Strategic Council for Climate Neutral and Smart Community of the City of Kranj, chaired by the Mayor, will be a partnering body in this process. Its members are city administration employees, relevant stakeholders and individuals from the business sector, academia, and public and non-governmental sectors who have expressed interest in supporting the city's ambitious goals. 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitment expresses the joint intention of the City of Kranj and its key
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

stakeholders to act individually and collectively as a community towards the climate neutrality of the city by 2030.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

This section aims to summarise:

The city's 2030 climate neutrality target, referencing the city's Mission Expression of Interest and any further thinking since then.
The administrative territories included in the city's 2030 target.
Where applicable, any districts or emission sources, sectors or gases within these administrative boundaries that are excluded from the target of climate neutrality by 2030¹.
An overview of co-benefits² that the city will experience from increasing climate action and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.

# Goal

By joining the Mission 100 climate neutral and smart cities the City of Kranj and its stakeholders commit

→ To act proactively together towards the climate neutrality and smart city on reducing greenhouse gas emissions within the municipal administrative area for 80% by 2030 compared to the city's 2018 GHG emission inventory.

The initial baseline GHG emission inventory referred to in the Cities Mission Expression of Interest (2022) was updated with missing sectors (waste; agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU)) and revised according to the Net Zero Cities Mission Guidelines. Emissions Trading System (ETS) facilities located within the city's geographical boundary were excluded from the inventory, resulting in a new 2018 GHG baseline as of 238.832 t CO2eq.

In order to achieve the decarbonisation target, the City of Kranj aims to adjust current strategies and actions, introduce new measures, fully exploit its Smart Kranj Platform – city data digital platform, scale up the city support ecosystem, and engage multiple various stakeholders to join the effort, as envisaged in 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan. This commitment is anchored in a multi-sectoral approach that addresses the unique city's challenges and opportunities within energy sector, mobility and transport, waste and circular economy, green infrastructure including nature-based solutions, and built environment. Despite the robust strategies in place, the remaining 20% of the residual emissions require the identification of offsets and the development of additional strategies to mitigate the remaining carbon footprint.

The implementation of various projects, the introduction of new public services and resilient urban planning approaches shall bring significant environmental, economic and social benefits to the daily life and well-being of citizens. Improved energy and local food security, road safety with less traffic, better public transport, liveable urban neighbourhoods, and reduced energy costs shall all add value to the quality of life in Kranj and the preservation of the surrounding green belt. We believe that the City of Kranj's path to climate neutrality, which represents a collection of tangible actions, is beneficial for the city and its citizens, and contributes to the global climate and sustainable development goals.

This is an invitation to everyone, citizens, institutions, organisations, and businesses to contribute to our common goals, each according to their own abilities. The City of Kranj and its associated entities

¹ If existing, these exclusions are documented in the introduction to the city's 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.

² Climate policies and measures that promote co-benefits (i.e., policies and measures that tackle emissions whilst also delivering on other priorities) can increase support from local stakeholders, funders, as well as the wider public. Measurable co-benefits of working towards climate neutrality for the city could range from improved air quality and increased access to green spaces and related health benefits to increased job opportunities, local innovation, energy independence, and financial savings.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

will take the lead, set an example and provide guidance and support to others. Yet, we approach the decarbonisation process responsibly and with due diligence. The city's ambition to be climate neutral by 2030 is supported by the decision of the City of Kranj Council to join the Cities Mission and the official introduction of the Climate City Contract to the members in February 2024.

# 3 Strategic priorities

This section of the Commitments document summarises at least 3 or 4 strategic systemic priorities³ that need to be implemented in the city to become climate-neutral by 2030. The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan aims to describe in detail the expected pathways and actions (Part B) and enabling interventions (Part C) needed to achieve these priorities and how the city plans to implement them. The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Investment Plan further details the funding and financing for the expected pathways and actions. The individual commitments between the city and signatories (see Appendix 1) strive to address these key priorities and contribute to reaching them.

## Strategic priorities

Considering the existing strategic framework and the identified emission gap, the main priorities for the City of Kranj to become climate neutral by 2030 are investments in technologically innovative projects and systemic shifts in energy and mobility while the other three areas (waste management, green infrastructure and built environment) will contribute to the decarbonisation targets through upscaling and innovation of existing interventions.

City's One-Stop Shop with integrated citizen participation programme and the comprehensive Smart Kranj City Data Digital Platform are the two overarching social interventions supporting the essential behavioural and systemic changes in the City of Kranj's transition to carbon neutrality. A brief summary of the interventions by strategic priority is provided below:

→ Energy system: The interventions in district heating systems and green energy production are essential for the City of Kranj as they account for 41% of its decarbonisation targets. It is planned to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, including potential use of waste heat from industry and introduction of a cooling system in the current and extended district heating system of the city. The production and storage of solar energy on municipal, commercial and private buildings and large parking lots will be significantly intensified. The piloting of a social innovation measure – energy co-operatives – will assure equal access to green energy for people living in multi-unit residential areas. Investment in the grid capacity is a prerequisite for further investments in solarisation and green energy production.

→ Mobility and transport: Located on the X. trans-European corridor (TEN-T) and in the gravitational area of the national airport and the capital Ljubljana, the city's influence on transport emissions is very limited. Thus, the city's priority is to foster the mobility modal shift – reducing the daily volume of carbon-intensive motorised commuting and short-distance transport to using of more sustainable modes of travel. Ambitious actions combining investments in modern multimodal passenger hub, cycling infrastructure and photovoltaic/hydrogen charging hubs supported by Smart Kranj digital mobility solutions, a variety of new mobility services, improved city traffic management, and an awareness programme will motivate citizens, commuters and visitors to change their traditional patterns of traveling to, within and out of Kranj. The combined mobility and transport measures are expected to contribute to 32% of Kranj's decarbonisation targets.

→ Waste &amp; circular economy: As major technological interventions in waste and wastewater management (including cogeneration facilities) have been completed before 2018, the remaining emissions from waste are manageable. Existing approaches to reduce the scope and recycling efficiency of the communal waste, controlled closure of the landfill (methane)

³ Strategic systemic priorities are meaningful changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in the city, such as decarbonising the heating system in the city or generating 100% energy from renewables.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

and investments in water supply efficiency will continue towards a Zero Waste Strategy. Hence, the decarbonisation attention is focused on tangible circular economy solutions that will be developed by the city public utility company and innovative public-private pilot projects, while offered to citizens, local SMEs and relevant interested public. The priority area contributes 13% to the city's decarbonisation goals.

→ Green infrastructure &amp; nature based solutions: Although the city of Kranj is surrounded by agricultural land and forests, the latter are a source of GHG emissions due to ice and wind storms in the last decade (from 2014) and the consequent bark beetle infestation. Furthermore, the green belt around the city is under constant pressure from urbanization. The city, in cooperation with the respective national bodies and landowners, will designate significant areas of forests as forests with special purpose, improve their management and accelerate the maintenance and expansion of other green infrastructure. All possible mechanisms for green spatial planning and urban agriculture, promoting a partial shift from cattle to vegetable production, will be tested to reverse the trend from being the source of emissions to becoming GHG sinks. A 7% sequestration contribution to the city's decarbonisation targets is estimated.

→ Built environment: Due to long-lasting national scheme, the energy efficiency of most multi-unit residential and municipal buildings was completed before 2018. Therefore, the main focus will be on the remaining residential buildings and state owned premises, emphasising integrated renovation, replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy sources (RES) and where possible, connection to district heating. Special attention will be given to poorly insulated and fossil fuel dependent individual houses, owned by vulnerable groups. In addition, the City intends to extend the results of the pilot project Smart Mlaka to integrated regeneration projects of private developers with the aim to make them climate neutral and smart zones. The priority will directly contribute 7% to the city's overall decarbonisation target.

# 4 Process and principles

This section aims to briefly describe:

The systemic process⁴ the city will undertake to achieve its 2030 climate neutrality target.
The provisions for monitoring and joint learning⁵, including the intentions for updating the Climate City Contract.
The key principles that will guide the implementation of its Climate City Contract, such as climate justice, co-creation, multi-level governance approaches, stakeholder and citizen engagement.

# Process and principles

As stressed above, becoming climate neutral city by 2030 is a challenging and responsible task, which requires new competences, technologies, and changes. The City of Kranj is aware that the goal can only be achieved by strong internal commitment, citizens' and other stakeholders' involvement in the planning and implementation processes, cutting-edge knowledge, and exchange of practices between participating Slovenian and European cities. During the preparation of the CCC, the City of Kranj has already facilitated an effective participatory and co-creative process for the transition to climate neutral and smart city and is also determined to do so in the future, on a professional and systemic manner.

In this respect, a 21-member multi-actor partnership – Strategic Council for Climate Neutral and Smart Community representing all key strategic stakeholders from local and national policy level, major businesses, academia, NGOs and key city implementing institutions, is set up to guide the

⁴ Concrete actions to implement these processes are described in the annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (section C).

⁵ Learnings from monitoring your progress towards climate neutrality should be processed and shared with your transition team and stakeholders, in order to build a common understanding of how your Climate City Contract can be improved in future iterations.

process. The Strategic Council is led by the Mayor and co-lead by the two experts from the field of climate change and innovation management.

Orchestration of the process, operative tasks, day-to-day implementation and monitoring is assigned to the Transition Team, coordinated by the Unit for Development and Smart Community. The Transition Team consists of employees from the relevant city administration departments (green transition, digital transformation, traffic and economic affairs/activities, energy, environment, spatial planning, finance, social affairs), communication officer and professionals from the city utility companies.

Together with a wide diversity of partners such as the city library, schools, health centre, sports organisations, local media, business incubator, research and development institutions, focus groups and other Mission cities, they form a comprehensive participatory city ecosystem for climate neutrality.

Within the CCC preparation phase, from early 2023 until February 2024, the Unit for Development and Smart Community organised 3 meetings of the Strategic Council and more than 30 different workshops and focus group meetings involving different stakeholders and partners from local, regional and national level. Altogether, more than 600 persons participated in different participatory activities.

The following principles guide all bodies involved in carrying out this Climate City Contract:

→ Accountability and competences – ensuring that all parties involved are competent, committed and held responsible for meeting their commitments and achieving their actions and goals in reducing emissions.

→ Democracy – opening up the process to the public, strengthening the involvement of key stakeholders in the process and encouraging them to take ownership of the process and specific initiatives for change.

→ Co-creation, innovation, smart community and technology – engaging research &amp; development organisations, academia, innovative businesses, start-ups, social enterprises, educational sector and others in the process to help design and implement interventions that promote the progress outside the standard solutions and governance practices (business as usual).

→ Multi-sector and multi-actor approach – the involvement of different governmental and territorial levels (local, regional, national), different sectors (i.e. mobility - industry - communities) and actors (i.e. public - private - NGOs - banks) in the process is crucial to address and implement the necessary complex interventions.

→ Systemic and demand driven – ensuring that meaningful changes proposed by the Climate City Contract are reflected in the city's overall systems (operations, planning, construction, service delivery), regulations (spatial plan, budget, etc.) and sector strategies, and are driven by the needs and priorities of citizens and stakeholders.

→ Monitoring, evaluation and learning – ensuring regular monitoring and evaluation of the Climate City Contract implementation and sensemaking for future modifications and improvements.

These cross-cutting principles represent a common ground for the design and execution of the portfolio of actions as well as the governance and social innovation interventions elaborated in the Action Plan and will be further enhanced during the implementation process. The Climate City Contract, consisting of this document, the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan and the related Investment Plan, will pass through recurring phases of iteration as the City of Kranj perceives them all as living documents. Thus, periodic monitoring with in-depth inventory analysis for 2022, 2025, 2027 and 2030 will provide a framework for the Transition Team, the Strategic Council and the City
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Council to propose and adapt necessary updates and revisions, depending on the evolution of the city context, adopted national and EU directives, the global macro-economic trends, and other external risks.
