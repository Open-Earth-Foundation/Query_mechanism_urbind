# Summary

## Summary of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan of the Municipality of Guimarães

The Municipality of Guimarães developed its 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan 2030 (Action Plan) as one of three complementary elements to guide its commitment to Guimarães Vision 2030 and move closer to climate neutrality by 2030.

The Action Plan is a collaboratively created and ever-changing document that will be updated over the years to reflect the reality of the municipality and its changing environment and variables.

It has always been the municipality's goal to link its Vision 2030 for Guimarães and its governance ecosystem with the implementation of an action portfolio that also acknowledges the work of the last decades.

For the process of developing and co-designing the Action Plan, there were several interactions in the municipality with stakeholders, e.g. citizens, associations, industry and business, public and private institutions and universities, to gather inputs for the Action Plan, such as the Guimarães Climate Pact, for which more than 70 signatures were collected, the first round of Rapid Mass Engagement (REM) workshops and sectoral meetings within the Municipality of Guimarães.

In addition, the municipality was supported by experts from the Netzero Cities Consortium (NZC) to engage the industrial sector in the region and include these important actors in the process, as they are responsible for the majority of emissions in Guimarães. In addition, the municipality participated in both Summer Schools (2023) in Milan and Santander organised by the NZC consortium to gather as much knowledge as possible and to network with other municipalities.

It is important to mention that the municipality has engaged with the "capacity building programme building a strong economic case" for the development of its economic case, using the tool developed by the NZC consortium and partners to support the implementation of the planned actions in terms of investments. Meetings were also held with the financial coach appointed by the NZC consortium to refine the investment plan.

Finally, the Guimarães Transition Team met every week to discuss next steps and strategies for the Climate City Contract and met bi-weekly with the city's advisor.

The Action Plan is structured to logically follow the process of developing the Guimarães Action Plan.

It starts with Part A, which consists of the assessment of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) emissions, with 2019 as the base year to set the baseline on which the municipality will work, with a gap of 80% (baseline emissions: 592 kt CO₂e; emissions reduction target: 479 kt CO₂e) and 20% of residual emissions, for which the municipality has developed a strategy.

Secondly, the municipality lays the groundwork for the development of the actions, as it explores the current policies, plans, strategies, policies, projects at local, national, and European level that are related to climate change and the social dimension. This provides a holistic overview of what the municipality has done so far and sets the tone for identifying systemic barriers and opportunities.

In Part B, the Municipality of Guimarães developed its approach to the NZC Theory of Change, outlining the pathways that would lead to short- and long-term change, as well as direct impacts, and indirect impacts (co-benefits) associated with the implementation of climate neutrality actions in the following fields of action: energy systems, mobility and transport, built environment, waste and circular economy, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions, industry and cross-cutting actions.

Then, the Municipality of Guimarães moves on to explore the action portfolio, which builds on actions that will be tested in the pilot city of Guimarães – District C, actions that the municipality has already implemented, as well as ambitious actions needed, involving stakeholders in their implementation.
Guimarães 2030
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

For which action, the municipality developed an indicator that is best suited to measure, evaluate and draw lessons from the implementation of the action, depending on whether it is an action focused on generating a direct or indirect impact.

Finally, Part C complements the Action Plan by describing the governance, organisational and social innovation actions already implemented by the municipality, to support the achievement of the climate neutrality pathway, by engaging the complex environment of stakeholders in the transition.

Guimarães 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# 1 Introduction

Guimarães through the Climate City Contract (CCC) aims to relish a new way of working with local, regional, and national stakeholders in order to achieve the ambitious goal of climate neutrality by 2030. Having in mind the phases of the Climate Transition Map from Netzero Cities (NZC), the Municipality of Guimarães hopes to create a multi-level integration of stakeholders and emissions domains to break down the conventional silo approach, as well to challenge the business-as-usual approaches.

The 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan was developed through co-creation processes that involved the mission Transition Team, where all the partners worked closely together to shape, not only the Action Plan itself, but the Climate City Contract. This process gathered the participation and inputs from stakeholders, namely academia, universities, companies, associations, and citizens.

Guimarães Action Plan is harmonised with the other Climate City Contract components, namely the 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments and the 2030 Climate Neutrality Investment Plan:

2030 Climate Neutrality Commitment: The Action Plan embodies the climate-neutrality ambition by the municipality and all the stakeholders that embrace this challenge. The Action Plan materialises into actions how to achieve climate neutrality, honouring all the work that has been done, as stated on the 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitment.
2030 Climate Neutrality Investment Plan: The Investment Plan is intimately connected to the Action Plan since mirrors the feasibility and economic viability of the defined actions. Through the mapping of costs and capital needed to achieve the desired goal, the Investment Plan acts as an instrument to the Action Plan as a comprehensive long-term economic and financial strategy aimed at achieving climate neutrality by 2030.

The Municipality of Guimarães intends to align the existing climate actions plans, projects and strategies with the development and consequent implementation of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan. Regarding the fact that the municipality is a signatory of the EU Covenant of Mayors (EUCoM), has submitted two Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans (SECAP) in 2014 and 2016, and has regional and local climate action plans and strategies (e.g., Municipal Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change Action Plan for Energy and Climate Sustainability), Guimarães intends to integrate and blend elements from the existing sources available, as well to work on and add elements for the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.

The Municipality of Guimarães is currently pursuing strategies to tackle climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in several areas, which are also covered by the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan: Buildings, Transport, Waste, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU).

Current local policies, strategies and plans are considered as a basis to build on the Action Plan and develop a harmonious and coherent approach to climate neutrality. The aim is to fit the Action Plan into the municipality's existing climate change plans and strategies, e.g., Municipal Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change, and to complement the climate change actions measures already implemented.

In developing the actions, the municipality followed three main directions: District C a zero-carbon commitment (the Guimarães NZC pilot city programme) as a test bed for city-wide implementation; updating current actions and plans; and new actions and strategies from stakeholders. This will ensure that the action plan considers the work and commitments to climate neutrality to date, the first

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

trial of the District C pilot city activities and their expansion to the whole area, and the actions that have emerged from the interaction and co-design processes with stakeholders.

The Guimarães 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan addresses a gap of around 80% of emissions (absolute emissions 2019: 589 297 tCO₂e) that need to be reduced. It considers what has been done so far and what still needs to be done through this plan to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The plan will focus on buildings and transport sectors, as these are sectors for which the Municipality of Guimarães currently records and reports emissions according to CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project and CoM - Covenant of Mayors) and can have a more direct impact through policy, regulations, incentives, and actions. By involving industry in the process of co-designing the action portfolio, the municipality engages with the agencies responsible for this emission area to address the problem.

However, this does not mean that the Municipality of Guimarães will only take action to close the gap in the buildings and transport sectors. As mentioned above, Guimarães believes that climate neutrality should be approached holistically, encompassing several sectors such as waste, land use, industrial processes, as well citizen awareness and participation.

Knowing that alone the Municipality of Guimarães cannot achieve climate neutrality by 2030, the municipality is committed to building meaningful relationships with stakeholders, from business and industry to associations, organisations, academia, and citizens. These stakeholder groups need to be engaged as they are responsible for a significant proportion of emissions in the municipality and are the ones who will implement actions to address climate change. The municipality, in collaboration with the Landscape Laboratory of Guimarães, considering the existing capacity and the lessons learned throughout the process of involving associations and citizens, efforts have been made to develop a series of co-creation sessions with the private sector. A first series of workshops has been launched to stimulate the joint elaboration of actions to be included in the Action Plan. This is not a one-off event, but an opportunity to foster relationship building between the municipality and stakeholders, as well as synergies between stakeholders. The aim is to initiate a process that enables integrated systemic change.

Regarding the exclusion areas, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the Municipality of Guimarães are quantified in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO₂, CH₄, and NO₂), following the guidelines specified in the Expression of Interest of the Mission on 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities. However, it is important to note that the Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) sector presents challenges in terms of GHG quantification.

The lack of GHG quantifications for the IPPU sector can be attributed to various factors. Firstly, collecting accurate data on GHG emissions from industrial processes and product use is challenging due to the complexity and diverse nature of these activities. Additionally, there may be a shortage of experts and technicians with the necessary expertise in this field. The disclosure of information by industries regarding their emissions is another obstacle, as it may not be readily available or easily accessible. Lastly, the absence of comprehensive inventories specifically focused on the IPPU sector further contributes to the difficulty in quantifying emissions from this sector.

Given these challenges, it is crucial for the Municipality of Guimarães to address the gaps in data collection and inventories pertaining to the IPPU sector. This involves collaborating with industry stakeholders and implementing mechanisms to encourage industry to disclose relevant emissions information. By addressing these barriers, the municipality can improve its understanding of GHG emissions from the IPPU sector and ensure a more comprehensive approach to emission reduction strategies and climate action planning. This collaboration will be reinforced over the next year and presented in the next CCC iteration, expected to be delivered in the next year.

The Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) is another sector for which Guimarães has not yet provided specific data on its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the municipality is actively engaged in the analysis of this sector's emissions and aims to report the findings in the near future. Efforts are underway to gather and evaluate relevant data related to AFOLU activities,

including agricultural practices, forestry management, and other land use activities within the municipality.

By conducting a thorough analysis of the AFOLU sector, the Municipality of Guimarães aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of the GHG emissions associated with these activities. This data will contribute to the municipality's efforts to develop effective strategies and initiatives to address emissions and promote sustainable practices within the agricultural, forestry, and land use sectors.

It is important to mention that the Municipality of Guimarães intends to revise and update the CCC on a yearly basis.

In summary, this is the overall of the 2030 Guimarães Climate Neutrality Action Plan, which outlines the municipality current climate neutrality policies and strategies, and how, through multi-stakeholder engagement, the emissions gap will be addressed for a sustainable and greener future through systemic change.

# 2 Work Process

In this section, the Municipality of Guimarães explains the working steps towards the development of the Guimarães' Climate City Contract along the NZC Climate Transition Map.

# Work Process

The Municipality of Guimarães, when designing the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, intended to align it with the NZC Climate Transition Map (Figure 1), based on the development of a climate neutrality framework towards a just climate transition. The Action Plan fits into the first three processes of the NZC Climate Transition Map:

# 1. Build a strong mandate:

To build a strong mandate, the Municipality of Guimarães is aware that a key factor for a successful climate action is to ensure an alignment of all actors among the planned actions and investments towards the climate neutrality goal. By joining the 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, the municipality express its interest and ambition, and through the Climate City Contract re-affirms that commitment in a practical and concrete action.

To build a strong mandate within city government, the Municipality of Guimarães has an internal municipal team that combines members form different departments, e.g., Office of Energy Efficiency, Department of Smart Systems and IT, Department of Urban Services, Department of Mobility and Transport, Department of Economic Development, Department of Green Spaces, that are not only involved in the CCC development process, but also in other projects related with climate transition. Therefore, the municipality can mobilise the within resources and capacities needed to act upon the climate transition.

The Municipality of Guimarães, to build a strong mandate within the local ecosystem, developed a multi-actor Transition Team that enables the combination of several different backgrounds, expertise, and know-how, resulting on a cohesive, capable, and multifaceted team to coordinate the climate transition.

Through the 2030 Guimarães Governance Ecosystem, the municipality can build new collaborative governance structures and networks and strengthen those already in place. This means that, through this governance ecosystem, the municipality hopes to gather the entities that are all willing to collaborate with the city on the path to climate neutrality, and to gain movement to support new alliances and strengthen the ones already in place.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 2. How to build a strong mandate within city government, local ecosystem and with other government levels.

Finally, to build a strong mandate with other levels of government, the 2030 Guimarães Governance Ecosystem is also a key factor, since through this governance ecosystem, the municipality can extend the climate transition towards actors outside the city limitations, e.g., ICLEI, Adapt Local, Euro Cities, CDP, CoM, Agenda 21 Local, Energy Cities, Circular Cities Declaration, Mission Zero Academy, Circular Cities and Regions Initiative, Climate Alliance, Green City Accord, ECSA, Bio Plastics Europe, Global Footprint Network, United Nations Climate Change, as shown on the Figure 3 bellow from the Guimarães European Green Capital candidacy, cycle 2025. The Municipality of Guimarães can also engage in meaningful dialogues with stakeholders on a regional and national level, to build future partnerships that endure the political cycles. As Guimarães is part of the Intermunicipal Community of Ave (CIM do Ave - an intermunicipal community of 8 municipalities), Guimarães can take a leading role in combating climate change and has the opportunity to involve all these municipalities in the process of sustainability at a regional level, drawing inspiration from Guimarães and vice versa. It is also worth noting that the quadrilateral region (Barcelos, Braga, Famalicão and

Guimarães) has almost one million inhabitants and aims to strengthen cooperation between the four municipalities by focusing on the area as a whole and working in partnership with the community and stakeholders to improve the quality of life, with the aim of investing in digital technologies, mobility, and culture.

Transition Team: Constituted by an interdisciplinary team and three core entities (Municipality of Guimarães, Landscape Laboratory of Guimarães, and external partners), with different but complementary backgrounds. This team meet weekly to design and develop the Climate City Contract and is intended to keep a close contact and partnership during the deployment of the Climate City Contract, including the implementation of the Action Plan and Investment Plan.
Political support and endorsement: The mayor and political structure of the Municipality of Guimarães strongly support the involvement on the 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission [1] and subsequently the journey of Guimarães towards climate neutrality by 2030 through the Climate City Contract.
Guimarães Climate Pact [2]: To involve the entities that are aligned with the 2030 Guimarães vision, the municipality designed a first step towards the commitment, that consists of a climate pact that is voluntary and non-binding, representing an intention from the signatory entity to embark on this journey alongside the municipality and posteriorly to sign the Climate City Contract. Therefore, on  $5^{\text{th}}$  on June, to mark the  $50^{\text{th}}$  anniversary of the World Environment Day, more than 70 entities signed the pact, including the mayor, providing a sense of unification towards the common goal.

# 2. Understand the system:

GHG emissions baseline: The Municipality of Guimarães will consider Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for the CCC, as it reports these emissions for the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The municipality intends to start accounting for Scope 3 emissions soon, to gain a more holistic perspective on the municipality's emission sources and improve accountability for the municipality's emissions. The GHG base year, from which the municipality will measure progress, is 2019, to correspond to a scenario prior to COVID-19 that is more representative to the reality in Guimarães.
Current state assessment and gaps towards the 2030 ambition: The municipality has already taken measures to decarbonise and reduce emissions through local actions and plans, e.g., Guimarães has reduced its  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ eq emissions by  $18.40\%$  by 2020, starting from 2008. The 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan serves as a strategic plan to continue the work done so far and to set ambitious actions to be implemented in order to close the existing gap on the path to climate neutrality by 2030. The municipality intends to use this opportunity to analyse the current local, regional, and national climate policies, examine the progress made so far (what has worked, what needs to be reformulated or added), map the existing cross-sectoral strategies with stakeholders and understand what additional partnerships are needed to implement the planned actions.
Stakeholders mapping: The Transition Team conducted an exercise to map stakeholders interested on achieving climate neutrality by 2030 and be aligned with the municipality vision. Stakeholders who may hinder this path were also mapped, as well the ones that can influence
Guimarães 2030

others (for more information on this exercise, please see on Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality).

Identification of barriers: The Municipality of Guimarães proceeded to identify the key obstacles regarding the implementation of actions. These barriers are mainly related to gaps in funding and financing capacity, policy and regulation, as well as cultural and behavioural changes. The municipality is aware of these barriers through its large experience and record on climate change mitigation and adaptation actions on the municipality.
Identification of levers of change – Theory of Change: After identifying the obstacles that undermine the path to climate neutrality, the Municipality of Guimarães defined the levers of change that will enable strategies on the fields of action of energy systems; mobility and transport; waste and circular economy; green infrastructure and nature-based solutions; built environment based on the NZC Theory of Change (NZC TOC). Ideally, these levers will enable the municipality to address its emissions gap and barriers. More information about this step is mentioned on Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 7. How to understand the system through data, connections, relationships, and future scenarios

# 3. Co-creating an action portfolio:

Rapid Mass Engagement (RME) sessions: The Municipality of Guimarães together with the Landscape Laboratory of Guimarães designed layout and workflow for the RME approach to create a climate positive culture among the stakeholders that followed the official ceremonial signatory moment of the Guimarães Climate Pact (on the  $5^{\text{th}}$  of June). The RME is cyclical comprising several sets of workshops. The first series was composed by three workshops, with two main goals: to involve the interested stakeholders on the climate neutrality journey by 2030 through the CCC; and to gather a holistic set of possible actions to integrate on the Action Plan. A more detail explanation of the flow of The RME approach is presented on Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality.
Impact pathways: the Municipality of Guimarães established impact pathways according to the Netzero Cities Theory of Change (NZC TOC) based on the planned actions and its early changes, late outcomes, and direct and indirect impacts. On Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways is possible to infer how Guimarães approached the NZC TOC.
Indicators to monitor, evaluate and learn (MEL): Given the planned portfolio of actions, and having establish the impact pathways, the Municipality of Guimarães is able to select the most adequate indicators to measure the progress achieved through the implementation of
Guimarães 2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

actions on the territory. Therefore, the municipality can focus on the data that is important to collect and to measure, having an Action Plan that is traceable and can be accounted for.

Finance: The action portfolio is not completed without an investment and financial plan that can support the implementation of actions. Having this in mind, the municipality in articulation with the 2030 Climate Neutrality Investment Plan, demonstrates how the actions in the portfolio will be financed, taking advantage of rearranging existing approaches/create new ones, e.g., participatory finance, existing public investment streams and leverage private.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Part A – Current State of Climate Action

In Part A of this 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, the Municipality of Guimarães goes through the assessment of the 2019 baseline year greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory and the analysis of the business-as-usual scenario to identify the existing gap to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

It also includes the current policies, strategies, plans and projects that the municipality has already undertaken towards its Guimarães 2030 vision, as well as the implementation gaps.

Finally, the last section of Part A presents the stakeholders that will play an important role on the path to the Climate City Contract, as well as a description of the existing systemic barriers and opportunities.

# 3.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory details and describes the Guimarães' latest GHG inventory to establish the emission baseline and the gap to 2030 climate neutrality. Table A-1.1 depicts the total emissions of GHG in 2019, by sector.

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

Guimarães current monitoring system of CO2 emissions (table A-1.1)

The Guimarães GHG baseline inventory is calculated annually using the IPCC methodology (2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories) and accordingly to the European Commission Joint Research Centre guidelines.

The base inventory is calculated based on final energy use and comprises three GHGs, carbon dioxide  $(\mathrm{CO}_{2})$ , methane  $(\mathrm{CH}_{4})$ , and nitrogen oxide  $(\mathrm{N}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ . The results are presented in equivalent  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  units (sum of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ,  $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$  and  $\mathrm{N}_{2}\mathrm{O}$  emissions expressed in t  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  equivalent). The main source for obtaining the emission factors is the 2006 IPCC. Excepting electricity, where the emission factor of the national electricity system is used, since it is the one used in the National Inventory Report (NIR) submitted under the United Nations Framework convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The data for calculation is obtained from the national entity General Directorate of Energy and Geology (DGEG) that provides the data for electricity and natural gas consumption, and petroleum products sales. These data are contained within the administrative limits of the municipality and can be disaggregated by Economic Activity Code (EAC).

Only direct emissions from the use of fuels for energy are considered. This means, for instance, despite the inventory sectorial desegregation, emissions from Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), waste, Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU), are not estimated in its full methodological standard. Greenhouse gases like  $\mathrm{CH}_4$  originating from biological processes,  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  from agriculture, or PFCs, HFCs, and  $\mathrm{SF}_6$  resulting from the chemical and physical transformation of raw materials in the industrial transformation processes, have not been accounted in the inventory. The intention is to carefully improve the inventory process and start incorporating these emissions, for forthcoming updates.

# - Baseline situation

In 2019, the total emissions were 680 251 t CO $_2$  eq. These are related to the consumption of electricity (24,2%), petroleum products (38,8%), natural gas (35,7%) and non-energy use petroleum products (1,4%). Dividing petroleum products into their components is verified that diesel constitutes the largest portion, validating that its consumption is made mainly by the transport sector.
Guimarães 2030
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Disaggregating GHG emissions by sector, it is verified that the largest contributor is the transport sector (35,07%), followed by industry (28,80%), energy production (17,73%), residential (9,89%), services (7,16%), waste (0,56%), public lightning (0,41%), and agriculture, fisheries, and forestry (0,39%).

In 2019, for the first time since 2008, the transport sector recorded a higher share of emissions than industry. This fact did not go unnoticed and was subjected to investigation by the municipality with the competent authority DGEG. The return obtained was that data from years after 2018 presented errors in the reporting of fuel quantities, as anomalous fuel sales were attributed to the municipality. Even after some corrections, prudence is needed in approaching the data, as fuel consumption remains abnormally high for the consumption patterns historically verified in the municipality. Transport emissions are mainly due to the consumption of diesel (80,7%) and gasoline (18,4%).

In the industrial sector, the textile and footwear sectors are the largest emitter with 77,7% of industrial emissions, and the second with greater representativeness is the construction sector (7,2%). Regarding the type of final energy consumed, industrial emissions are mainly due to the consumption of natural gas (52,6%) and electricity (39,5%).

The energy production sector, which is directly linked and is intrinsic to the industrial sector, registers as the main source of emissions natural gas, representing 99,6% of the sector's emissions.

In the residential sector, the GHG shares are distributed in petroleum products with 18,3%, natural gas with 18,5% and electricity with 63,2%.

In the services sector, the share of electricity accounts for 77,8% of emissions, followed by natural gas with 13,0%.

The waste sector is totally dependent on electricity. There is no consumption of natural gas or petroleum products. Given that this sector has associated fleets of heavy vehicles, the associated consumption is encompassed in the transport sector.

The economic case for decarbonisation tool and the baseline emissions inventory

Guimarães, recognises the usefulness of the economic case for decarbonisation tool for the quantification of emissions and investments necessary for their mitigation. The economic case for decarbonisation tool results congruency with Guimarães baseline inventory are verified, establishing it as a very useful tool for the mission. This added value translates mainly to buildings (residential and services), transport and waste sectors. Since Guimarães has a high industrial character, these emissions are allocated in the "Others" section of the economic model. Even with this nuance, the Guimarães Climate City Contract takes due diligence in climate action for achieving neutrality in this sector.

As the "Others (Industry)" sector represents the highest GHG emissions share (41%) of the economic case for decarbonisation tool, decarbonising industry in Guimarães is not only important but also a high priority. This priority brings the necessity to provide a highly resourceful and effective Climate City Contract in steering industry toward sustainability. This brings an added challenge for Guimarães in adapting actions aimed at decarbonising the industry, going beyond what the tool proposes but measuring results through it.

The economic case for decarbonisation tool has also brought improvements in the waste sector, as it adds detail to the level of Scope 3 emissions, which in the baseline inventory were not calculated. This is already an additional value brought by the model to Guimarães GHG inventory by improving the waste sector including the scope 3 emissions.

As a city, Guimarães needs to find the means to calculate on a distance base methodology the emissions from the transport and mobility sector. The CCC appears as an opportunity to study and introduce this new approach of calculation, improving the baseline constraints mentioned above.

# A-2.2: Description and assessment of policies

Guimarães has been paving the way towards a greener and climate-neutral city over the last decades and has taken up this challenge by joining the mission of 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030.

On this path, several plans, policies, strategies, programmes, and initiatives have been and are being implemented by the Municipality of Guimarães in the areas of buildings, transport, waste, AFOLU, IPPU, and other areas (Figure 15).

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

A more detailed assessment of what the municipality has done so far towards climate neutrality is described for each sector to provide an overview of which existing plans, policies, strategies, programmes, and initiatives need to be improved and/or updated to support this goal, as well the direct and/or indirect impacts on the 2030 climate neutrality target. This forms the basis for understanding which actions can be expanded and further developed for the action portfolio, as well as the current implementation gap to achieve climate neutrality 2030.

# Buildings:

Regarding the buildings sector, the Municipality of Guimarães has undertaken a comprehensive approach to enhance energy efficiency in buildings and promote building retrofitting, aligning with its
Guimarães 2030
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

climate neutrality ambition. This entails, not only an approach to the buildings owned by the municipality, but also initiatives that promote energy efficiency and retrofitting of residential, commercial buildings, since this group of buildings make up for all the total buildings stock within the municipality area.

The Municipality of Guimarães has existing policies, strategies, programmes, and regulations concerning the buildings sector that impact directly the 2030 climate neutrality goal.

Taken the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP), where there are outlined sustainable buildings actions such as efficient lighting in buildings, air conditioning, and ventilation systems, as well efficient boilers, household appliances, office equipment and industrial equipment and processes. It also covers street lighting actions, renewable power actions as integrated renewable generation, biomass and forest residues, and thermal solar energy.

The SEAP addresses implementation models that can improve energy efficiency and complements the other plans and strategies related to efficient lighting, optimised public lighting, building certification, smart monitoring of energy consumption, heat pumps, solar energy, and biomass.

An example of a project is the District C: a zero-carbon commitment that entails pilot actions concerning the improvement of energy efficiency in historical heritage buildings at the centre of Guimarães, the development of a one-stop-shop that provides services for energy efficiency, renewable energy for the community, and the uptake of energy communities.

Also, the Intermunicipal Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change and Risk Management and Prevention (PIAAC) that approaches the urban rehabilitation of the Ave territory (in which Guimarães is a part of), aims to promote the urban regeneration of private buildings through the introduction of tax incentives and access to financial instruments linked to the existence of regeneration areas, thereby reducing the consumption of rural land for urbanisation.

The Municipality of Guimarães has already been implementing a series of actions and initiatives besides the plans and programmes mention in the previous table A-2.1, to name some of the most prominent examples:

Renovation of municipal schools: Renovation of the municipality schools to achieve thermal comfort and energy efficiency, using passive and active building solutions, natural lighting, thermal insulation, and modern HVAC systems. Until 2020, this requalification included 10 education establishments in the municipality. Amongst the primary schools and kindergartens 12% already have centralised heating systems operating by biomass boiler. Furthermore, 16 units for solar thermal systems for Domestic Hot Water (DHW) were already installed. Since 2018, the mean energy consumption reduction is 15,5% per year.

This initiative not only improves the learning environment, but also reduces energy consumption.

Renovation of social housing buildings: Improved the energy efficiency of social housing by installing thermal insulation, upgrading windows, and integrating solar panels and photovoltaic systems. This project included the implementation of more efficient domestic hot water systems in the public social housing, leading to an improvement of 61% of the dwellings intervened. Furthermore, it is expected the enhancement of the energy efficiency of 166 social housing dwellings, considering the improvement of two levels in the efficiency classes. This will be accomplished by installing thermal insulation, replacement of windows and installation of solar thermal and photovoltaic systems.

This contributes to reduce energy consumption, improve housing conditions, and reduce carbon emissions.

Guimarães 2030
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Improve public lightning: By replacing inefficient lights with energy-efficient LED technology, the municipality was able to significantly reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

The use of smart grid systems and LED technology will further increase the efficiency of public lighting.

Traffic Lights Enhancement: Update the municipality traffic lights by installing LED lights and photovoltaic panels, contributing to energy savings and sustainability across its extensive territory. The installation of LEDs (100%) and photovoltaic panels (57%) represents a great effort as Guimaraes is a 240 km² diffuse territory.

Improvement of sports facilities: Energy efficiency measures such as electronic ballasts, heat pumps, thermal insulation and intelligent energy management systems have been introduced in public sports facilities. The Gymnastics Academy of Guimarães is a sustainable reference building that uses renewable energy systems, heat recovery and environmentally friendly materials.

Sustainable Construction and Building Certification: The municipality promotes sustainable construction practices, energy audits, and building certification to ensure that new and renovated buildings meet high energy efficiency standards.

Efficient Appliances and Green Procurement: Guimarães applies green public procurement criteria to gradually replace less energy-efficient equipment with more efficient alternatives. This approach reduces energy consumption and promotes sustainability. The municipality have already established this for waste, transport, energy, public works, green spaces, goods and services, both the municipal budget and the activity plan are aligned with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) so that the distribution of public investments across the SDGs can be identified; this strategy will allow us to understand the evolution of municipal investments by SDGs and thus verify the degree of implementation of the planned agendas.

Housing Renovation and Urban Regeneration: Urban renovation at Guimarães policy promotes the revitalisation of existing urban structures, minimises resource consumption and improves social cohesion. Fiscal incentives and financial instruments are used to promote building renovations that contribute to better housing conditions and energy efficiency.

Urban regeneration is one of the most effective climate change adaptation policies. This policy aims to promote the urban renovation of private buildings through tax incentives and access to financial instruments linked to urban renewal areas (ARU), reducing the use of rural areas for urbanisation. It is expected that more than 22 ARU will be implemented in the Ave region. This policy encourages the renovation of buildings in poor condition, which affects the rental market, energy consumption and housing comfort. The project started in 2021 and will be implemented until 2024. It includes the definition and delineation of new ARUs, the promotion of public meetings to disseminate the objectives of these new areas and to promote sustainable building strategies. In addition, this project aims to develop strategic programmes to promote urban regeneration.

All the current, ongoing, and future programmes, and strategies regarding the building sector collectively contribute to enhancing energy efficiency, reducing carbon emissions, and advancing Guimarães' climate neutrality goals by embracing sustainable practices across various sectors, from housing to public infrastructure and urban development.

In a nutshell, the Municipality of Guimarães intends to close the current implementation gap (81% in the buildings sector to achieve climate neutrality by 2030) by expand the impact of these measures achieved so far. This will entail the update of current and ongoing plans to impact more households

#

and residential buildings, expand to other areas of the municipality the retrofitting of private and public buildings, and to keep improving energy efficiency and the uptake of renewable energy for the usage of such buildings.

It is also worth noting that some policy changes need to be made, such as updating the regulations for retrofitting historic buildings to allow the use of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaics, in these buildings. Such measures are being tested in the pilot city District C.

# Transport:

As the transport sector is one of the main contributors to emissions in Guimarães, the municipality has a wide range of plans, policies, and strategies to reduce its impact and make the transition to a more sustainable approach to transport modes.

In essence, the municipality zero-emission mobility plans and policies play a critical role in a community's transition to a low-carbon and sustainable future. They contribute directly to emission reduction targets, improve public health and air quality, enhance the quality of life in the territory.

In recent years, Guimarães has made great efforts to create a more environmentally friendly public transport service (PT) and to develop a public transport network that includes a fleet of electric vehicles for public transport. Some of the public bus fleet is already electric, as a result of the municipality's efforts to establish a new collaboration with the Guimabus company for the urban transport system and inter-municipal services with CIM do Ave (Figure 16). So far, the Guimabus fleet has 26 electric buses out of 83, and the goal is full electrification. In terms of charging stations and infrastructure for electric vehicles, the municipality has 18 charging stations and intends to install 500 in the coming years.

European Green Capital Candidacy, cycle 2025

In relation to current and ongoing plans, policies and strategies for the mobility and transport sector, the SECAP also outlines sustainable mobility measures to optimise the transport network, fleet distribution, commuting, electric mobility, pedestrian mobility, bicycle use and finally biofuels and alternative energy sources in transport.

Complementary to the SECAP and essential for the implementation of zero-emission mobility, the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) also sets out measures already taken by the municipality, such as the expansion of pedestrian zones, improving the walkability of the city and connectivity to pedestrian zones, coexistence zones to allow for more harmonious pedestrian traffic, "KissandRide"
Guimarães 2030
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

zones, the design of urban infrastructures to support pedestrian and rest areas, bicycle systems, e.g. public bicycles, bicycle parking zones. The project also addresses the public transport system, the interconnection of different transport modes inside and outside the city, the transition to more sustainable vehicles, the improvement of the comfort of bus stops, the development of electric vehicle charging stations and parking facilities.

The Metrominute contributes indirectly to reducing transport emissions by providing guidance to the whole community on how to move more sustainably in the city.

For the near future, the municipality intends to convert the municipal fleet to electric vehicles, achieve a 100% electric bus fleet, explore the possibility of using hydrogen buses, use biogas for waste collection and explore other applications of biofuels for mobility. As the transport sector is mainly dependent on petroleum products, which are responsible for a large share of greenhouse gas emissions, promoting the production and use of biofuels will help reduce the carbon footprint of this sector and reduce the community's energy dependence on fossil fuels.

In addition, electric car tariffs should be extended to the whole area, the acceptance of electric cars by citizens should be promoted and the use of public transport, walking and cycling as the main means of transport in the municipal area should be supported.

To conclude, in order to tackle the implementation gap of the transportation domain (77% in the buildings sector to achieve climate neutrality by 2030) the municipality intends to build on the previous work and upgrading existing plans, policies, and measures in terms of dimension, e.g., more EV charges, increase pedestrian and bicycle lanes and its accessibility, availability of public services and infrastructure, as well as ambitious plans to introduce new energy sources, such as hydrogen and biofuels.

## Waste and Circular Economy:

Waste management and the circular economy is an area which the municipality is well acquainted, as it has been working on these issues for a long time. This can be seen in the numerous projects, policies, regulations, strategies and plans that the municipality has around waste and circular economy.

Although this area is not responsible for most of the municipality's emissions, it plays an important role in the path towards climate neutrality, as the circular economy makes an important contribution to the overall goal of mitigating climate change by minimising waste, reducing energy consumption and shifting to sustainable consumption and production models. It addresses emissions associated with waste management, promotes resource efficiency, protects the environment, creates economic opportunities, engages communities, and contributes to a more sustainable and resilient future.

Regarding the existing policies, strategies, programmes, and regulations that impact the 2030 climate neutrality ambition, the waste tariff system PAYT (Pay-As-You-Throw) is the only project with this structure in Portugal. This system is implemented in the Historical Centre of Guimarães (UNESCO World Heritage). So far, PAYT comprises 34 streets, with high housing and commercial buildings density, being mandatory for all residents and retailers. Based on the polluter-pays principle, the user pays for the real waste production. In the first year after the implementation of this project, the amount of recyclable waste (paper, plastic packaging, metal, and glass) increased by 126% and the mixed waste decreased 34%. By 2022, it was expanded to 12 000 users, and 500 commercial establishments and Horeca channel. The programme successfully reduced mixed waste to 172 kg per capita/year and increase to 115 kg per capita/year packaging waste collection.

The Biowaste Plan Guimarães 2030 stresses the importance of keeping organic waste out of landfills and promoting its proper treatment through composting and other environmentally friendly methods. In this way, Guimarães aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote soil fertility, and support the circular economy.

In the same line, the Zero Waste Plan sets specific objectives and targets for each area - waste reduction, recycling, composting, and disposal - outlining the measures and strategies to achieve them. It promotes the circular economy concept, seeking to minimise waste generation and maximise resource efficiency.

Regarding the circular economy, the most prominent strategy of the municipality is the RRRCICLO that intends to switch from production and consumption linear models to circular models of sharing, reuse, repair, reintegration, and recycling, reducing waste to a minimum. It has direct and indirect contributions to the 2030 climate target, helping citizens identify, reduce, and separate the day-to-day waste. Bio-waste collection is already running, reaching the entire population by 2028.

There are, as listed on table A-2.1, several other projects and programmes that Guimarães is currently involved concerning the reduction of the different types of waste. The second life that can be attributed to them, awareness, and educational programmes, increase of the circularity of water, and innovative ways to valorise waste.

The municipality has implemented a comprehensive action based on its plans, projects, programmes, and strategies of waste management and circular economy aimed at reducing waste, promoting recycling, and harnessing the potential of waste as a resource. These measures include, for example:

Green waste recycling: The municipality collects and recycles green waste from public areas and households to make compost for green spaces. In addition, part of the green waste is used to generate energy for heating boilers in public schools, which contributes to both waste reduction and energy efficiency. This strategy started in 2016 with the purpose to use available resources, reducing the waste and avoiding deforestation. The green waste generated in public areas (cemeteries, forest, and other green areas; 1 400 ton/year) and in households (with gardens) is collected by the municipality and is mainly used to produce compost for public green areas (1 250 ton/year). Furthermore, 1% of the green waste (~100 ton/year) is submitted to energy valorisation process to heat boilers in schools. The remaining 50 ton/year is sent to a mechanical biological treatment plants measure is expected to be extended to social solidarity private institution.
Collection of construction and demolition waste: The municipality offers personalised collection services for construction and demolition waste on request to promote responsible disposal and recycling.
Selective collection in the commercial sector: The municipality has extended the separate collection of packaging waste to the commercial sector through a door-to-door system to promote recycling among businesses.
Used cooking oil collection: Guimarães promotes the collection of used cooking oil to improve waste prevention and avoid pollution.
Quality improvement of services and management systems: The municipality works to improve the quality of waste management services and systems by seeking certifications for quality management (ISO 9001) and environmental management (ISO 14001 or EMAS).
Renewal of collection vehicles: The municipality renews collection vehicles older than 12 years to ensure the efficiency of waste collection.
Civic engagement and waste awareness: Guimarães focuses on raising public awareness and promoting citizen participation in waste management policies. This includes cooperation between the municipality, academia, and private companies to improve waste management practises and public participation.
Upgrading agricultural and forestry waste: The municipality aims to reduce waste from activities, such as horticulture and agroforestry through selective collection, shredding and

reuse of green and brown waste, thereby contributing to waste reduction and fire prevention. This project is in implementation from 2020 to 2027 and includes the creation of strategies for the establishment of partnerships, the elaboration of a study for the location of the collection and eco-centres for composting, and the engagement of partners and conception of the treatment system for the forest biomass.

Improving treatment technology: The municipality is improving treatment technology to upgrade mixed waste and include bio-waste from separate collection, which will keep waste out of landfills.
Waste prevention and reduction campaigns: Guimarães carries out waste prevention and reduction campaigns based on the principles of the circular economy.
Education and awareness campaigns: The municipality is increasing education campaigns to raise citizens' awareness of environmental sustainability and promote responsible waste management practises.
Awareness-raising and control measures in the hospitality sector: Guimarães is stepping up awareness-raising and control measures in the hospitality sector to ensure compliance with waste management regulations and improve the quantity and quality of separate collection.
Expanding separate collection: The municipality plans to expand separate collection in areas with potential for bio-waste and to complement the treatment network with municipal composting facilities in less densely populated areas.

To address the implementation gap in waste and circular economy domain (73% in the buildings sector to achieve climate neutrality by 2030), the municipality intends to expand its current programmes and strategies, e.g., increase the recycling rates, cover more areas at the municipality with the biowaste collection programme, to explore the option to introduce the production of biogas and the use of biofuels by the municipal fleet waste collection, and expand the circular economic models across the community, companies and industries of the territory.

## Agricultural, Forestry, and Land Use (AFOLU):

The Municipality of Guimarães has strategically designed and implemented a series of interconnected actions concerning the Agricultural, Forestry, and Land Use domain that collectively contribute to achieving climate neutrality and enhance carbon sequestration through natural carbon sinks. These plans, strategies, policies, and initiatives reflect a holistic approach to urban planning, nature conservation and restauration, and biodiversity (fauna and flora) preservation and enhancement.

Plans and projects such as the Rio Ave Depollution Plan, the Corredor Verde da Veiga de Creixomil project and the River Green Ways aim to improve the municipality's green and blue infrastructure and its natural spaces and make the area more resilient to the effects of climate change. Depollution and restoring these areas allow for a cooling effect, carbon sequestration through enhancing existing green spaces and improving erosion control and soil health.

In terms of biodiversity, the Castro de Sabroso Invasive Flora Management Plan, the Biodiversity Action Plan, the Local Biodiversity Action Plan, the Green Gap and the Monte Latito Biodiversity Route play an important role for the area by focusing on biodiversity conservation, where measures are foreseen to identify, monitor and observe wildlife species, as well as to remove some invasive plants that threaten the harmonious functioning of natural ecosystems.

All these projects and plans aim to protect and enhance natural elements and green infrastructures, with a focus on planning that promotes biodiversity, enhances natural ecosystems and urban spaces, and supports ecosystem services. They also focus on addressing the impacts of climate change by creating a resilient landscape that can both mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

In the area of forestry and reforestation, Guimarães has a variety of strategies, including plans and projects, such as Guimarães Mais Floresta, One Tree for Every Life, the Municipal Plan for Forest Defence Against Fires and the Inter-municipal Programme to Protect the Sacro Montes, which aim to contribute to forest conservation, reforestation through the restoration of damaged forests and afforestation through the planting of trees in deforested and unused areas.

In addition, the municipality is working on the development of the future Guimarães Urban Tree Management Plan, with the aim of promoting the management and increase of green spaces and collecting data to track the results of the proposed actions.

With regard to green spaces, including those integrated into the city, projects and plans such as the BIOURB project, the Green Space Management Plan and community gardens focus on monitoring and removing invasive species to increase biodiversity, but also support the reforestation of road infrastructure, which is in line with the promotion of agroforestry and green spaces and contributes to the municipality's goal of increasing green spaces and carbon sequestration by planting 2 000 trees per year in urban areas, complementing efforts to improve urban comfort, reduce the urban heat island effect and mitigate the effects of climate change through various coordinated actions under these projects.

In summary, the municipality's strategies, policies, programmes, and plans have a direct impact on the achievement of the climate neutrality by 2030. As green spaces, biodiversity and forestry play a crucial role in mitigating climate change by sequestering carbon emissions and improving the overall resilience of ecosystems. These plans, strategies, and programmes are important components of nature-based solutions that contribute to carbon sequestration and storage while providing a range of other environmental, social, and economic benefits.

Finally, the municipality intends to enhance the green spaces areas among the city centre, e.g., development of a green belt under the pilot project District C, to launch an Urban Green Plan that is currently under development, that will allow the reinforcement of the protection of the natural heritage of Guimarães.

## Industry:

The Municipality of Guimarães has a strong industrial presence, which is responsible for a large part of the municipality's emissions.

To transform the industrial structure into a green industry, the municipality recognises that only with a close relationship and involvement of this important group of stakeholders will be able to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

It is worth noting that several businesses and industries in Guimarães have already developed plans and strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and promote circular economy within its industrial processes. In this context, some of them have also already committed to the Guimarães Climate Pact (here), demonstrating their commitment towards climate neutrality by being willing to share their efforts with the municipality and the community.

Companies such as Win-Win, a sourcing and consulting company for fashion brands in the garment industry, has already planned a public event to plant hundreds of trees in October. This type of collaboration with the municipality is essential to reach the goal of 30 000 trees planted and to support the current strategy of Guimarães Mais Floresta. This is just one of the examples of the active role that some companies have already taken towards the climate neutrality.

JF Almeida, another textile company in Guimarães, is a national landmark in the field of sustainability and has taken measures that will reduce emissions by 50% in the next two years compared to the reference year of 2021.

Companies and industries from the Guimarães territory such as Win-Win and JF Almeida are responding positively to the goal of climate neutrality by investing in PV panels, biomass heat pumps, electric fleets, and tree plantations (here).

## Others:

The municipality of Guimarães also has European, national, and local programmes and projects that link different sectors and take a holistic approach to mitigating and adapting to climate change.

As the path to climate neutrality needs to be understood as a whole and the municipality recognises the need for an integrated approach linking environmental, social and governance issues, projects such as the pilot city District C, URBACT, Digital Commercial District – “Bairro 1128” aim to test innovative solutions for a more resilient and greener city and explore the role of digitalisation in this area.

The municipality also has programmes and plans to reduce plastic pollution through the signing of the Portuguese Plastic Pact, Aquaplastic: educate, reduce, and enhance; Local Markets without Plastic; the Network of Historic Cities against Plastic Waste; and CARE, which provides incentives for the use of reusable cups instead of single-use plastic cups.

As the social component cannot be separated from the green transition, several plans such as the Municipal Plan for Gender Equality, the Plan for Social Development and Inclusive Growth, the Cultural Management Model of the Guimarães Area - Cultural Plan, the Corruption Prevention Plan and the Municipal Youth Plan ensure that the climate neutral path considers gender equality, inclusive growth, social inclusion, and the young generations.

Finally, the municipality is aware that sharing experiences and knowledge with other cities (at national and European level) is crucial to learn what other cities are doing in terms of climate solutions in the different fields of action, to share best practises and to learn from their experiences what works and what does not. Guimarães also participates in programmes, such as the city twinning programme Netzero Cities, as well as projects and platforms that also function as networks, such as ClimAdaPT.Local, Municipal Platform on Sustainable Development Goals, CApt2: National Network for Water Circular Economy, to name a few.

At last, the next tableA-2.3 exhibits Guimarães emissions gap to be overcome with this Action Plan.

# 3.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

Module A-3 “Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality” 2030* documents the expansion of the stakeholder mapping conducted in the previous section, which led to the identification of systemic barriers and opportunities.

It is imperative to emphasise that the Municipality of Guimarães is committed to regularly updating its systems and stakeholder mapping. This commitment stems from the recognition that engaging with stakeholders in the Climate City Contract (CCC) is an ongoing and dynamic process. The municipality aspires to gather as much support as possible for its ambitious goals. Notably, several stakeholders, including companies, organisations, universities, associations, and more, have already demonstrated their commitment to the 2030 Guimarães vision by endorsing the Guimarães' Climate City Pact. This signifies their interest in aligning and actively participating in the CCC, making them noteworthy additions to the stakeholder mapping. These pioneering stakeholders are working alongside with the municipality to advance towards climate neutrality.

# A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers and opportunities – textual elements

Even though Guimarães is leading efforts to achieve climate targets by 2030, the municipality recognises and acknowledges that there are still systemic barriers and challenges to overcome towards climate neutrality. By doing so, the Municipality of Guimarães lays the groundwork to identify and address key obstacles such as political constraints, limited resources, technological limitations, and cultural behaviour. Understanding these challenges enables targeted actions to effectively overcome the existing barriers. It also allows for strategic resource allocation so priority and focus can be given to the areas that need the most attention and the investment when allocating resources for action.

Overall, the municipality understands the main transversal barriers to all domains that are governance and policy, finance, technology availability, and capability to make the (behavioural) change. Part of this lack of capacity results from individual and institutional cultural patterns that are difficult to break/change.

This analysis also considered the stakeholder mapping (see Table A-3.2), as achieving climate neutrality requires stakeholder engagement and collaboration. The analysis of systemic barriers helps the municipality to foster support from key stakeholders and mobilise resources and expertise to work together towards climate neutrality.

A transversal barrier to all sectors is the complications regarding legislative requirements and legal liabilities. Every so often, in public procurement circumstances there is the likelihood to face cases of miscellaneous legal Interpretation. Such situations can cause obstruction of actions channelled to climate change mitigation. For example, contracting a company for a specific unequalled service and not comply with the presupposed competition legal requirements.

Guimarães 2030
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The following is a brief overview of some of the specific systemic obstacles Guimarães faces in each sector:

## Buildings:

Electricity generated for buildings, facilities, and infrastructure: buildings, especially households, have a considerable share in the municipality's emissions, and despite the current actions to reduce energy consumption, there is still room to improve. Regarding the residential buildings, the Municipality of Guimarães identifies financial constraints as a main barrier for citizens to improve houses' energy efficiency, as well as lack of fundamental acquaintance of energy matters. Not just the construction quality is poor and obsolete, citizens are unaware of what can be done and do not have the financial means to improve their house energy performance. Additionally, most homeowners do not heat their homes, given the inability to pay for the increase in the energy bill, makes it more difficult to find financing schemes to support the retrofit investment. Also, in multifamily buildings, condominium regulations and policy represent a barrier to hamper the change.

Non-electricity energy for thermal uses in buildings and facilities: In parallel to the previous sector, the absence of the required investment capacity, energy knowledge and construction quality were identified as the main barriers to tackle consumption of non-electricity energy for thermal uses in buildings. Until recently, fossil fuel sources were cheaper than electricity, making it the preferable choice for thermal purposes. The lack of financial capacity to change from a non-renewable energy source to renewable energy solutions, or even the knowledge to understand its importance is relevant to this domain.

## Transports:

Vehicles and transport (mobile energy): Guimarães actual planning follows a sprawl pattern, encouraging different demographic niches replying most on private automobile for daily transport. Such development pattern as proved threats to climate change mitigation, health, and life quality. The cultural behaviour of referring to individual vehicle created upon this necessity over the years, is deep-settled, and the excess of private vehicles represents a critical barrier to neutrality transition. The culture of referring to public transport is still not rooted and thus, (i) infrastructural constraints, given the sprawl and (ii) cultural behavioural habits, are key barriers to overcome. Also, the high costs of cleaner technology both for private vehicles and commercial ones, negatively impacts its adoption not just by citizens but also by enterprises. Thus, clean mobility is yet to be the common practice or to be fully implemented/adopted (at least) in Municipality of Guimarães. Policy and regulatory commitment and financing opportunities are required to boost cleaner mobility modes.

Technology uptake: The introduction of other fuels sources such as hydrogen and biofuels are being studied by the municipality, as they are also an alternative to fossil fuels.

High dependence on central government for structural investments: Investments in critical infrastructure like railways, BRT, and major roadways rely on government approval and financial backing. While the municipality acknowledges the necessity of establishing connections with high-speed trains and other pertinent mobility infrastructure to curtail individual car usage, discussions with the national government about funding availability for these initiatives are currently ongoing.

## Waste:

Multi-sector waste management and disposal domain: The main barrier identified in this domain is cultural behaviour to circularity and waste production and management problems. Business, industry, and citizens are still used to linear approaches and dependent on disposable goods, despite of the Guimarães efforts on this matter. Specific programmes and

Guimarães 2030

O

plans are undergoing (see Module A-2) regarding the implementation of circular economy approach, e.g., second-hand local market, expansion of the biowaste collection programme. The extension of the current policies could be a game changer for this domain, as well as a close collaboration with the industry stakeholders and scientific institutions. Evolving from a linear approach to a circular one is key in all industrial domain.

Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) of products: In line with the above, LCA is a crucial tool to close the loop as it enables understanding the environmental impact products throughout its life cycle, from raw material extraction to production, distribution, use and disposal, especially in the dense industrial complex of Guimarães. Failure to consider LCA is a major barrier when addressing challenges such as textile products can prevent a comprehensive and strategic approach to reduce the carbon footprint of products. Integrating LCA into strategies and policies enables informed decision-making, supports a circular economy, and creates the opportunity for synergies between companies and industries, e.g., the waste and by-products of one industry can be incorporated into the industrial processes of another.

Technology uptake: The production and use of biogas from biomass and biodegradable waste components is of interest to the municipality, especially as energy source to the waste collection vehicles. The region's waste treatment plant (Resinorte) does not currently have the necessary infrastructure for this type of action, nevertheless, investments are being made to make this possible.

## Agricultural, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU):

Land use (including agriculture, forestry, and other land uses): The distance for daily contact with nature lead to unawareness and defamiliarization with the natural environment benefits. The city's space evolution drove to more paved spaces than green ones, hampering the carbon capture and all other co-benefits from having green/natural spaces in the city. Restoring green spaces into the city requires major changes in policy and governance, as recognised and being acted upon by the municipality. Also, finance is needed to promote green spaces and nature-based solutions existence and use, while citizens awareness should be promoting outdoor lifestyles. Improving the territories' forest and agricultural areas, through agroecology practices using native species, etc. help improve the territory resilience to climate change, reduce AFOLU emissions while, supporting carbon capture.

## Industry:

The industry sector, along with the transport, is the main source of emissions in the municipality, being responsible for about one third of Guimarães emissions. It is a cornerstone of Guimarães path to climate neutrality. A challenge for the municipality is the fact that the municipality does not exercise control over industries, they are independent of the municipality's jurisdiction and have no direct responsibility for emissions from the sector. Therefore, it can be difficult for the municipality to engage these industries and companies and have a concrete impact on reducing emissions.

By involving the industrial sector in this process - the Guimarães Climate Pact is an important first step towards the final goal - is a game changer that industry and stakeholders publicly commit to aligning themselves with the municipality's 2030 vision.

At the national level, the Roadmap to Climate Neutrality 2050, industry also is a key sector. It should reduce its emissions by 73% (compared to 2005) by 2050. The temporal range to achieve neutrality varies 20 years from Guimarães commitment, imposing the significant challenge to the Municipality and its local companies.

Guimarães 2030
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

It requires an energy-efficient dynamic systems consisting of decentralised energy supply, largely made up of renewable energy sources (solar thermal, biomass, PV), electrification, innovation and new financial models, and industrial symbiosis and resources reuse and efficiency. The use of fossil fuels should be replaced by green electricity and other alternative non-carbon fuels, such as green hydrogen or biofuels.

Textile and fashion industry: Regarding the composition of Guimarães' industry, it should be noted that it has a strong tradition in the textile and fashion industry. Textile and fashion companies play an important role in the local economy, contributing to job creation and generating added value. This industry has energy-intensive spinning, weaving, dyeing, and finishing processes, many of which rely on fossil fuels, resulting in significant carbon emissions. In addition, the industry often uses a variety of chemicals in dyeing, printing, and finishing, which also contribute to carbon emissions. Water consumption also requires high amounts of energy for pumping and heating for the processes (only activities that have an impact on scope 1 and 2 of emissions were considered, as material waste in the fashion industry is one of the most pressing challenges on a global scale, as is packaging and transport).

Footwear industry: Guimarães has also a significant presence in the footwear industry, with several companies dedicated to the manufacture of quality footwear and related components. This industry is known for its craftsmanship and expertise. Even though the footwear industry is not as energy intensive as the textile and metal industries, there are challenges and obstacles on the way to decarbonisation here as well. The footwear industry relies on a variety of materials, all of which have a different carbon footprint. Finding low-carbon alternatives for each material can be very complex and require significant research and development. The chemical processes used to dye and finish leather and textiles can be energy intensive and release greenhouse gases. Identifying more sustainable chemical alternatives while maintaining product quality can be difficult.

Metalworking industry: The metalworking industry is also strongly represented in Guimarães. With companies specialising in the production of metal parts, machinery and equipment, this industry plays an important role in the local economy, providing solutions for various sectors. Metal production and processing are very energy-intensive activities. Traditional processes for extracting, refining, and shaping metals often involve high temperatures and energy-intensive processes, resulting in significant carbon emissions. In addition, many metalworking processes require high temperatures, often generated with fossil fuels. The transition to low-carbon energy sources, such as renewable electricity or hydrogen, can be technically complex and costly. The metalworking industry produces large volumes of products, often at high speeds. Implementing changes in high-volume production lines can be a logistical challenge. The industry operates in a competitive global market where cost considerations often take precedence. Shifting to low-carbon processes can initially incur higher costs.

In terms of climate neutrality, there are a number of challenges ahead for industry and business, namely available technologies such as the introduction of hydrogen or biofuels and the electrification of their processes, the conversion of entire fleets to more sustainable vehicles, industrial heat pumps and other technologies, the incorporation of circular economy practises from cradle to grave, and the creation of new partnerships with other industries in relation to bio-products and waste from other businesses. And to top it all off, the financial resources need to be made available to make the necessary changes, which particularly affects small and medium-sized enterprises that need financial support from national/local government, e.g., in the form of subsidies for decarbonisation.

The Municipality of Guimarães inquired via an online survey about the main obstacles for industry to implement energy efficiency and renewable energy. The barriers mentioned by industry were mainly related to financial constraints, technological challenges, and lack of technical knowledge.

Understand the system linked to the greenhouse gas emissions to build collaborations with the relevant stakeholders and organisations to monitor/reduce their environmental impact.

Through the CCC, the Municipality of Guimarães aims to create an understanding of how existing emissions gaps prevent the achievement of climate neutrality, as well as existing patterns, such as cultural behaviour towards circular economy and waste. To address this, the municipality has started a movement towards the vision 2030 for Guimarães and engaged stakeholders around the 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities through the Guimarães Climate Pact, the CCC itself and District C (NZC pilot programme).

The Guimarães Climate Pact is already enabling a dynamization of activities and actions by the actors who signed the pact. Two examples are the development of a tree planting campaign by a well-known textile company in the region, which invited several actors to join, and secondly, several signatories of the Guimarães Climate Pact had already requested a carbon and ecological footprint analysis from the Landscape Laboratory of Guimarães, to monitor their emissions and how to tackle them.

From the stakeholders' point of view, the main interest that binds them together is their commitment to contribute to the Guimarães climate neutrality goal by 2030. Each stakeholder group brings something different to the table - the associations and organisations can push citizens to adopt current and planned policies to drive change; businesses and industry have an interest in aligning themselves with sustainability requirements, for economic reasons, but also to reduce environmental impacts and improve public perception. Businesses are also valuable partners in implementing the measures and in promoting activities to implement the measures themselves and events.

This shows, not only the power of networking that can be achieved through stakeholder involvement, but also the replication of the co-working movement initiated by the municipality and multiplied by the stakeholders themselves.

Understand the system linked to policies and strategies to involve all relevant stakeholders, departments, and organisations.

The Municipality of Guimarães was able to delineate the current policies and strategies that have been guiding its climate transition (see Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment).

To close the existing emissions gap, the municipality through the portfolio of action (see Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design) intends to link the needed actions (upgrade of current actions, strategies, and plans; new actions; pilot actions) to the actors that should be involved on its implementation. This connection is a work in progress, having the municipality as a facilitator, e.g., though workshops sessions and dedicated spaces.

It is also important to note that the stakeholder's involvement also concerns organisations, associations, academia, citizens, and the departments of the municipality itself, since for example, the Guimarães Climate Pact can be signed by any type of entity, and the workshop sessions (the first round so far) is open as well to a diversity of entities.

Analyse of systemic barriers to 2030 climate neutrality.

From the data collected in Table A-1.3. it can be deduced that the transport and building sectors are responsible for most of the emissions on which the municipality can have a more direct influence, in addition to the emissions caused by industry.

The Municipality of Guimarães has infer the systemic barriers to climate neutrality by 2030 for the domains on buildings, transports, waste, Agricultural, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU), and industry.
Guimarães 2030
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The main identified barriers concern:
Financial constraints.
Lack of fundamental knowledge on energy matters (general community).
Regulations and policy.
Absences of the required investment capacity.
Cultural behavioural habits.
Linear approaches (instead of a circular economy approach).
Technological challenges.
Lack of technical knowledge.

Systemic barriers require a systemic approach to solving them, one that can address the obstacles holistically and consider the interconnections and interdependencies between them.

The Municipality of Guimarães will do its best to address systemic barriers by working with stakeholders to develop actions that can simultaneously bring about systemic change and close the existing emissions gap.

These actions will address the sectors responsible for the municipality's emissions, as well as governance, organisational and social sectors to holistically cover all dimensions on the path to a climate fair transition by 2030. This also allows for a closer look at systemic barriers ranging from financial constraints to cultural behaviours.

Monitoring progress on emissions reduction by actors in these sectors will be further analysed, but this is a priority for the municipality.

By understanding the challenges ahead, the Municipality of Guimarães will be able to create a comprehensive, evidence-based action plan that includes specific actions, timelines, and milestones to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

In summary, the analysis of systemic barriers and challenges is crucial for the Municipality of Guimarães to overcome barriers and achieve climate neutrality by 2030. It enables the development of tailored solutions, strategic allocation of resources, stakeholder engagement, long-term planning, and effective monitoring and evaluation. By understanding and addressing these barriers, the municipality can start on the path to a sustainable and resilient future.

A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

Guimarães has planted the seeds for the climate-neutral revolution in the community over the past decades. The participatory model for climate neutrality of Guimarães is intended to be permeable to the contributions and participation of the different stakeholders (public and private sectors, businesses, citizens, universities and colleges, and organisations) that make up the municipality of Guimarães, grounded in the Guimarães 2030 Governance Ecosystem.

The participatory model for Guimarães embraces (1) the set-up of the Transition Team, responsible for the management of all the activities and procedures embedded in the development and implementation of the CCC, as well the (2) engagement of Guimarães community and all interested parties, since Guimarães cannot achieve alone its climate neutrality ambitions by 2030.

# 1. Guimarães Transition Team

The Transition Team is the core team for the implementation of the planned actions on this 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan and to ensure the 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments are achieved. The Municipality of Guimarães brought together members that enriched the team, to bridge the municipality and the ecosystem of multiple actors across the society towards the climate neutrality by 2030. Having that in mind, Guimarães Transition Team was based on:

Diversity: Guimarães Transition Team members have different but complementary professional and scientific and technical backgrounds, which strengthens the results achieved. The Transition Team is composed of members from the Environmental and Public Space Division, the Energy Efficiency Office, and the Mobility division of Guimarães municipality, experts from the Landscape Laboratory, from the Centre for Environmental Research and Education, an association for the promotion of sustainable development, and the coordinator of Mission Structure 2030, as well experts in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.
Definition of roles, responsibilities within the team: the Transition Team holds weekly meetings to coordinate tasks, exchange feedback and share ideas and lessons learned. The Transition Team also meets with Guimarães' city advisor once a fortnight to gain key insights for the climate city contract, share ideas and absorb knowledge and feedback. Transition team members were assigned responsibilities during the drafting and development of the CCC, always with the idea in mind that Guimarães' climate ambitions can flourish through the co-design process in the region. Maintaining good communication and a cooperative team culture was a key factor in the harmonious development of the CCC.
Shared principles and values: all team members share a common ground of understanding of Guimarães vision and climate ambitions, embracing the transition challenge.

Guimarães is aware that, in addition to the transition team, transition management also involves engaging and extending to external agencies and actors. Project management is not the only factor in managing the transition to climate neutrality, but requires participatory, transdisciplinary approaches that bring together multiple perspectives and resources between different actors and stakeholders, and at different levels of government.

The Guimarães Transition Team starts as an "internal" team, but over time intends to expand "externally" by providing spaces for public interaction to bring together different actors in the Municipality of Guimarães to accelerate the transition to climate neutrality.

# 2. 2030 Guimarães Governance Ecosystem

Guimarães has its own governance ecosystem that considers the relationships between the actors and interested parties that make up the municipality of Guimarães.

Figure 4 (in Work Process section) shows the existing intertwined relationships between stakeholders, partnerships, different levels of government with the private sector, citizens, academia and research and innovation institutions – to overcome identified systemic barriers and take advantage of associated opportunities. As shown in the figure below, the seven pillars of the 2030 governance ecosystem are political consensus, research, mobilisation, communication, monitoring, consultation, and education. These lead to eco-citizen governance through integration processes, knowledge and technology, innovation, and management. The 2030 Guimarães Governance Ecosystem was also published as a scientific paper.

The Guimarães 2030 Governance Ecosystem has imbibed two different stages for sustainable development: (1) transition stage: set up procedures that allow the establishment of a strategy focused on the diagnosis and improvement of environmental indicators and raising awareness among

citizens; (2) transformative stage: related to the internalisation of the concept of sustainability in the daily basis city hall practices and how different stakeholders' groups are being involved.

# 3. Stakeholders' involvement

# 3.1. Stakeholders mapping

Guimarães within the Transition Team, engaged in a dynamic session to unveil the stakeholders that would be involved with the 2030 Climate City Contract. Some of them already work closely with the municipality, others would be an addition. Through the stakeholder analysis, it was possible to map possibles saboteurs, influencers, recommenders, end users, economic buyers, and decision makers. The stakeholders mapping and analysis session is represented on Figure 17.

Through an Ecosystem Mapping and Analysis, based on a stakeholder analysis canvas, Guimarães mapped the city assets (civic groups, NGOs, companies, associations, organisations, public and private sector), the power dynamics between them, and the role played on Guimarães transition towards climate neutrality. It is important to have in mind that this mapping process is susceptible to be refined throughout the CCC lifespan.

This stakeholder's analysis and mapping was crucial to understand how Guimarães can co-create meaningfully paths and relationships with the stakeholders identified, supporting the stakeholders mapping from A3-1 section.

# 3.2. Guimarães Climate Pact

Guimarães organised an online meeting with the industry sector, aiming at presenting the Guimarães Climate Pact and the Climate City Contract. Industry was selected given its major role in Guimaraes share of emissions. This meeting intended to inform the objectives of Guimarães' Climate City Contract and to involve businesses and industry in Guimarães' climate goals.

On 22 May 2023, the Municipality of Guimarães held a session for all the interested entities on the Guimarães Climate Pact and the Climate City Contract (Figure 19). From civic organisations, NGOs, sports associations, universities and academy, hospitals, to industry, several entities remarked their commitment and intention to sign the pact. This was an important moment for the Municipality of Guimarães, as it allowed to create awareness about the 2030 Guimarães vision, and to bring together the first people interested in signing the Guimarães Climate Pact and being part of the Climate City Contract.

To create a brand that mirrors the movement that will inspire the 2030 Guimarães vision, Guimarães Municipality also created a logotype with a message associated: Guimarães 2030 – Join the Green Transition. These logotype and image unify the municipality journey towards climate neutrality, embracing not only the Climate City Contract, but also the Pilot City Programme (District C), Guimarães Climate Pact, and the UE Cities Mission: 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030. The dedicated website can be found on: https://guimaraes2030.pt/ (Figure 23).

# 3.3. Workshop sessions for the Guimarães Climate City Contract

The Municipality of Guimarães, in collaboration with the Landscape Laboratory of Guimarães, organised a first series of workshops on energy (on 22 June 2023), mobility (on 7 July) and waste and circular economy (on 20 July). A dedicated team from the NZC consortium was assembled to assist the municipality in engaging industry stakeholders and to provide feedback on how to improve the delivery of the workshop series. This was a valuable contribution to the Transition Team as it provided inputs to act in a real context and help the Municipality of Guimarães in the complex task of actively involving industry and businesses in the implementation of the actions of this Action Plan.

These thematic areas were chosen because, for the first interaction of the Climate City Contract, these areas are crucial to Guimarães' path to climate neutrality and to building a foundation for the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan. Furthermore, energy, mobility, waste, and circular economy are areas of interest for different stakeholders, from industry to NGOs and citizens.

The three workshops followed the same framework to standardise the workshop sessions and to facilitate its delivery. The Municipality of Guimarães worked with a specialist in group dynamics that had worked with the municipality in the past.

The first workshop, dedicated to the energy sector, focused on five main themes: substitution of natural gas; renewable energy at small and community scale; renewable energy at a large scale; energy innovation; and energy efficiency.

The second workshop, on mobility and transport, focused on commuting, transport of materials/resources, and fleet management and outsourcing. These topics were previously selected based on the first workshop audience preferences, enquired through a quick online questionnaire.

Regarding the third workshop for the waste and circular economy, the themes discussed were: waste prevention; food waste; waste or by-products - circular economy and recycle more - increase recycling rates.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Each workshop started with a brief and uplifting presentation, followed by a quick group dynamic to break the ice among the participants and create the right mindset for the workshop, followed by a presentation on the topic by a key speaker, and then the canvas dynamic.

The canvas dynamic was divided in two parts:

A dynamically aligned canvas with three categories of ideas: "Down-to-earth ideas", "Heavenly ideas" and "Ideas from another planet". The aim was for the group to first think about actions that were relatively easy to implement, the so-called "down-to-earth" ideas. The second phase was to think of ideas that were ambitious but feasible, ideas that fell in between and corresponded to the "blue sky ideas". Finally, for the last category, the "ideas from another planet", participants had to come up with the most ambitious, seemingly impossible, and outlandish ideas.
The second part consisted of building on the inputs gathered in the first part, filling in the Climate City Contract canvas (Figure 24) that was specially created for the workshop sessions. There was one canvas for each theme and each group had to take one idea from each team and work out the timeline for action (2023, 2025, 2030), the partnerships and resources needed for implementation and the expected benefits and outcomes.

As for the outputs of the three workshops, in annex to this Action Plan, it can be found the most relevant outputs as, the canvas, the attendants, and the key results. Additionally, on chapter 0-

Annexes it can be found the main ideas that came from the first part dynamic, the creation of the canvas with the "Down-to-earth ideas", "Heavenly ideas" and "Ideas from another planet".

These workshops aimed to prepare stakeholders and the Municipality of Guimarães to work closely together under the Climate City Contract and to create a safe space for the joint development of possible actions to integrate the 2030 Climate Action Neutrality.

The Municipality of Guimarães is aware that, to achieve real change and address one of the greatest challenges of our time, it is necessary to create spaces where people can come together and think about solutions rather than focusing on barriers and obstacles. Therefore, the municipality has designed these workshops to involve stakeholders in a more concrete and meaningful way, in addition to the Guimarães Climate Pact.

For the successful development and implementation of this Action Plan, the municipality wanted to bring ideas and translate them into actions that come from the stakeholders (mainly industry, companies, and organisations), as they are the ones who will implement them and reaffirm their commitment to the climate neutrality of the territory.

In summary, the Municipality of Guimarães, together with the Landscape Laboratory of Guimarães, planned a second round of workshops to further nurture the bonds established between the stakeholders involved and with the municipality, as well as to promote these relationships to further develop the Climate City Contract with improved actions, outcomes, and new participants.

# 4 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030 represents the core of the Guimarães’ 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan comprising the analysis of the pathway that the municipality intends to follow having the NZC Theory of Change as a guideline, adapted to the reality of Guimarães. It also compresses the analysis of the scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, action portfolios and indicators for monitoring, evaluation, and learning.

## 4.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Module B-1 “Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways” lists the impact pathways, early and late outcomes and direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits) of the Municipality of Guimarães according to and adapted from the NZC Theory of Change, clustered by the fields of action: energy systems, mobility, and transports, built environment, waste and circular economy, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions, industry, and cross-cutting actions.

**Bellow its presented on**

Figure 25 is a summary of the approach of the municipality towards the Theory of Change (TOC) expressing its connecting with the 2030 Guimarães Governance Ecosystem.

The following schemes demonstrate in an illustrative approach the entry points (EP), early-changes (EC), later-outcomes (LO), impacts (I), and indirect impacts (co-benefits) for each action, levered by the systemic levers and the connections among them.

# B-1.2: Description of Guimarães' impact pathways

The Municipality of Guimarães has the intent to unravel its systemic levers and create a portfolio of actions, putting the citizen at the heart of change, and involving different stakeholders to implement the actions and the lead the transformative change.

Guimarães approach to the NZC TOC (NetZeroCities Theory of Change) intends to expose through the several emissions domains (energy systems; mobility and transport; waste and circular economy; green infrastructure and nature-based solutions; built environment; Industry) the early changes, later outcomes, and impacts (direct and indirect) that are expected to occur due to the implementation of the actions on the Guimarães' Climate City Contract (CCC).

It is worth noting that it was done a blend approach to the application of the NZC TOC concerning the ambition of Guimarães towards climate neutrality by 2030 through the CCC as well the ambition of the municipality with its pilot project – District C – from the NZC Pilot Cities Programme. Guimarães considers that is beneficial and it makes complete sense to integrate all the current projects and ambitions regarding the common goal, having a cohesive and harmonious strategy.

Given that, the NZC TOC diagram (Figure 26) means to be a visual representation of how Guimarães impact pathways are expected to happen, through a story-telling diagram with associated risks and assumptions.

Figure 26. NZC Theory of Change

# 1. Guimarães' approach and application of the NZC Theory of Change

Firstly, the NZC Theory of Change (TOC), as also known as "impact logic" allowed Guimarães to draw an approach to the impact pathways based on the intersections trigger by the planned actions, starting with early changes (EC), followed by later outcomes (LO), ending on direct and indirect impacts. It is important, before dive into in the Guimarães impact pathways, to briefly contextualise this set of concepts, and how Guimarães approached them:

Entry points (EP): For the Municipality of Guimarães the entry points correspond to the concrete actions based on the update of the current actions and plans (making them more ambitious to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030). In addition, the activities of the pilot city in District C will be used as a testbed for the interventions and then adapted to be expandable and replicable in time and space. Finally, new actions will be taken by the municipality and the
Guimarães 2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

different stakeholders in the region, stemming from the need to close the current emissions gap.

Early changes (EC): Consist of the pre-conditions needed to implement the planned actions for the first years (1-2 years). The ECs identified by Guimarães set the tone for the long-term impacts, focusing on the quick wins obtained from the portfolio of actions, and the necessary build up to turn possible the implementation of the actions. Guimarães can establish a relationship between the action, the outcomes, who is affected by the intervention, who needs to be engaged, and the associated impact and costs.
Later outcomes (LO): The later outcomes correspond to the emergence of the later changes that arose from the early results, the impact that the early results had at the level of the whole territory (2-3 years). The intention of the LOs is that Guimarães can learn from the successful first implementation phase of the measures and achieve an approximation of the expected impacts and co-benefits.
Direct impacts: Consists of the reduction of GHG emissions through the implementation of an action. Direct impacts include climate mitigation impacts (e.g., reduced GHG emissions; reduced energy poverty) and climate adaptation impacts (e.g., reduced risk to natural/climate disasters or hazards; increased carbon sequestration through NBS). It is worth to mention that some direct GHG emissions reduction were able to determine (kt CO₂e) with the help from the NZC economic model (here).
Indirect impacts: Refers to the co-benefits and positive effects generated by an action. Indirect impacts accommodate public health and environmental impacts; social inclusion, democracy, and cultural impacts; economic development impacts; resource efficiency impacts; and biodiversity impacts.

It is worth noting that direct and indirect impacts can be achieved through the same action, e.g., the transition from combustion buses for electric ones, increase modal shift to sustainable mobility modes and have an impact on GHG emission reductions (direct impact) as well on air quality (indirect impact).

The NZC TOC applied to Guimarães can assume two important purposes, as it can be used as a communication tool (e.g., it can be simplified and turn it visual appealing) and as a framework for tracking progress through monitoring and evaluation, to further exploit the MEL (Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning) procedures of the CCC. Since the NZC TOC consists of an on-going process, that shall be frequently updated, to mirror new initiatives developed over time, the current Guimarães approach to NZC TOC is prone to suffer changes through the interactions of the CCC.

There is also a relation between the TOC and the MEL methodology, concerning the fact that through the finding of the impact pathways, direct and indirect impacts, Guimarães is able to pin-down at an early stage the expected impacts of the measures on the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, that can feed the monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) processes.

Regarding the assumptions and risks associated with the development of Guimarães TOC, various assumptions were made to try to materialise EC and LO, as well impacts from the implementation of the planned actions. These assumptions and risks can be internal (e.g., resources available – human, capital, technological, financial, expertise; support and endorsement from the mayor and vice-presidency) or external, e.g., support and engagement from stakeholders; European and global economic context.

Therefore, some of the assumptions and risks of Guimarães are the following, having in mind that these are going to be explored in more detail on the MEL analysis (Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning):

**Assumptions:**
Coordination between the municipal departments and staff is harmonious and collaborative.

Support and guidance from the high-level and leadership members of municipality.
Guimarães citizens are aligned with 2030 climate neutrality vision.
Guimarães citizens and stakeholders will be willingly involved in the deployment of the Climate City Contract.

## Risks:

Political fluctuations and dynamics change.
Lack of human resources within the municipality and/or their technical know-how.
Guimarães ability to achieve the needed finance and funding, through the combination of municipality budget, private actors and partnerships, private leverage of public funds, national and European funding opportunities.
Duplication and overlapping of reduced energy efficiency.

To mitigate the political fluctuations and dynamics change the Guimarães Climate City Pact is a way to the municipality to show its commitment towards the CCC and its ambition no matter how the political dynamic might change overtime. Also, due to the varies local, national, and European commitments that Guimarães is already involve and the communication of its involvement allows to stabilize this mission.

Regarding the second point, the CCC also accounts for indirect actions, such as capacity building within the municipality, giving the necessary tools and expertise to deal with technical issues and a harmonious implementation and monitoring of the process.

The 2030 Climate Neutrality Investment Plan, an important piece of the CCC puzzle, helps the municipality to establish the path on how can be possible to finance the planned actions towards the 2030 Guimarães vision. Since it will require, not only investment from the municipality, but also from the stakeholders, e.g., citizens, industry, Guimarães intends to express and intensify to the national government the commitment of Guimarães and the support that the municipality needs from the government to leverage the necessary investments.

The municipality has been doing its own emissions assessments (energy efficiency cabinet/department) by some time now, and report to CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) and to Com (Covenant of Mayors), given the municipality the know-how on how to perform such process. It is important to note that Guimarães obtained the second highest classification on the evaluation scale from the CDP, entering the top 10% of the best ranked cities in the world (here).

Do No Significant Harm principles are embedded in the design and implementation of portfolio actions with mitigate/avoid negative impacts. Guimarães when designing the actions, it took on consideration the EU Taxonomy Regulation (Article 17), to guarantee that eventual side effects/negative impacts would be noticed and tackle if manifested.

## 2. Guimarães' impacts pathways

From the previous analysis, contextualisation, and explanation is possible to infer the steps that lead to the outline of the impact pathways, describing the Guimarães process to expose the existing pathways that influence the city towards climate neutrality.

Impact pathways correspond to the series of causal relationships between an action's entry points as inputs, early changes, and later outcome as outputs, and ultimately leading to the desired impact (direct and indirect).

Impact pathways are crucial to plan and evaluate the Guimarães' portfolio of actions because they allow to make informed decisions based on how an entry points evolves to an early change, later outcome, and further to the desired impact. Impact pathways for Guimarães will function as a story telling, starting from the introduction of the action, how the story evolves during time (early and later outcomes), and the ending (impacts and co-benefits).

To build an Action Plan that is achievable and aligned with the work done so far and the current projects and strategies of the Municipality of Guimarães and stakeholders, the actions will be anchored on:

District C as a testbed for a city-wide implementation.
Uptake of actions and strategies with stakeholders' collaboration.

This ensures that the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan is viable, feasible, and tangible not only for the municipality but also for all the involved stakeholders, having a solid foundation to be built upon.

Guimarães' impact pathways outline the specific steps and assumptions necessary for an action to achieve its intended impact. The impact pathways based on the Guimarães approach to the NZC TOC are the following, grouped by their correspondent field of action:

## Field of action: Energy systems

### 1. District C as a testbed for a city-wide implementation

Renewable Energy Sources (RES) acceleration framework: By establishing regulations that require a certain percentage of electricity to come from renewable energy sources, the municipality can promote the production of clean energy in Guimarães, leading to the creation of the necessary framework to make this a reality in the municipality. This impact pathway ends with positive effects on the reduction of GHG emissions, clean and affordable energy, and an improvement in air quality.
Renewable Energy Communities (REC) and digitalisation of energy: Business models and investment scenarios can create financial incentives to leverage public funds and private sector investment and encourage the adoption of sustainable and energy-efficient practises. Early change evolves through the impact pathway to a later outcome, namely market transformation through the creation of demand for energy efficiency retrofit projects and the establishment of renewable energy communities. This would ideally lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a reduction in energy poverty and indirect impacts related to the adoption of new economic models for REC and the digitalisation of energy.
Capacity building actions of municipal staff: It is expected that the training programme will improve the knowledge and skills of municipal staff in relation to energy efficiency projects, and climate change in general, leading to an improved ability to identify and meet the needs of the community, resulting in more efficient and retrofitting of buildings concerning energy related projects, which in turn will have an impact on the overall performance and effectiveness of municipal staff and on the number of projects.
Guidance for heritage energy efficiency renovation: It is expected that an increase in expertise on heritage conservation and energy efficiency will be achieved at an early stage, which will later translate into an improvement in the energy efficiency of the historic buildings of Guimarães, a challenge faced by the municipality. The impact is to improve the resilience of the historic buildings to climate change and future energy challenges, set a positive example for other cities, promote sustainable practises, and strengthen cultural identity and appreciation for heritage conservation and sustainable development.

### 2. Uptake of actions and strategies with stakeholders' collaboration.

RES self-consumption: households, industry, companies, institutions: The introduction and expansion of photovoltaic solutions among a wide range of stakeholders is essential to ensure clean and reliable access to renewable energy sources. This requires getting citizens (household owners), industry and public organisations, and institutions on board, starting with site selection and mapping of potential users. This situation will lead to an increase in

Guimarães 2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Plan

photovoltaic installations, which will result in a reduction of GHG emissions, in addition to some co-benefits such as lower energy bills and improved air quality.

## Field of action: Mobility and transport

### 1. District C as a testbed for a city-wide implementation

Alternative sustainable transportation modes: If people use private cars less frequently or choose alternative modes of transportation, such as public transport, use of bicycles, or walking, there will be a reduction in the number of private cars on the roads. As for the impacts, it is expected that the later outcome translates into an increase on physical activity and active lifestyles, improved air quality, and road safety. This would translate into a modal shift towards public transport and more clean mobility modes, as well stress relief associated with traffic, and more availability for green areas spaces.

Sustainable delivery services: As an early stage it will be idealised and designed the of the delivery services for the delivery and distribution services in Guimarães. The municipality will start to see some change in the long run through the engagement of delivery stakeholders for a carbon delivery system, expanding the results obtained on the trial on District C. It would lead eventually to a reduction of GHG emissions, and co-benefits such as improved air quality and noise pollution.

### 2. Uptake of actions and strategies with stakeholders' collaboration.

Bundling actions to uptake public transports: Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and promotion of public transports: Through the uptake of public transportation to the detriment of the private car, citizens in Guimarães will potentiate the wide spread of public transport modes, having an impact on GHG emissions reduction, as well road safety, and reduction on noise pollution.

Electric mobility shift: private passenger vehicles: The conversion of citizens in Guimarães to electric vehicles (conversion of private combustion vehicles to electric vehicles) will have a long-term impact when electric mobility is the new norm. This will lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and as side effects there will be an improvement in air quality and an increase in the acceptance of electric vehicles.

Electric mobility shift: light goods, and heavy-duty vehicles: The introduction of light and heavy-duty electric vehicles will initially be mapped by the municipality, and stakeholders with fleets of this type of vehicle will also be involved. In the long term, it is expected that the spread of electric vehicles in the municipality will lead to a reduction in GHG emissions and an improvement in air quality, as technological acceptance of this type of vehicle will increase if this is achieved.

Buses green conversion: This action is already ongoing, consisting of the fleet conversion of 32 buses by Guimabus company (public transports company of Guimarães). The outcome would be the full conversion of this fleet, aiming for a reduction of GHG emissions, improved air quality, and the widespread of the technological adoption of electric buses.

Conversion of the urban solid waste collection fleet: Is intended to explore the possibility to use alternative fuels for the urban solid waste collection fleet. After the study and feasibility analyses, is expected that the fleet will run on an alternative fuel (electricity, biomethane). The uptake of renewable energy, improvement of circular economy (biofuels), and improved waste management and efficiency, encompass a reduction of GHG emissions on mobility and transports sector.

Carpooling and car sharing: Carpooling and car sharing makes it possible to reduce the number of single-occupancy vehicles, so the introduction of carpooling and car sharing as a viable transport option in Guimarães leads to less congestion, noise and air pollution, lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved overall transport efficiency.

## Field of Action: Waste and circular economy

### 1. District C as a testbed for a city-wide implementation

Biowaste recovery: Through the biowaste recovery, Guimarães will be able to repurpose it, and to do a selective collection. This will result in GHG emissions reduction, create green jobs, as well as improve waste management and efficiency.
Undifferentiated urban waste reduction: Not only the recovery and management of waste is important to complement the GHG emission reduction of Guimarães, but it is also important to reduce the consumption to reduce the waste production itself. This results in the decrease of the overall urban waste in Guimarães, having positive impacts on public health, economic benefits, and circular economy deployment.
Waste production reduction: The municipality intends to reduce overall waste production, an action that is linked to the other waste and circular economy measures. In the long term, it is expected that the practises achieved in District C will be expanded and it should be possible to reduce the total municipal waste production.
Recycling upgrade: By increasing the rate of waste that is recycled and reused, Guimarães inputs a second life on waste, putting in practice on of the components of circular economy. It is expected along the impact pathway towards the later outcomes and impacts, to have a reduction on waste produced, GHG emissions reductions, and public and economic benefits.
New circular business models: As a first change, it is expected that local circular business models will be developed, enabling the identification of circular business opportunities based on research and citizen input, ideas and concepts for circular business models developed by citizens, partnerships between entrepreneurs, businesses, and relevant stakeholders, tested circular business models in the local community (District C) and, as a later outcome, their expansion to the whole community. This will lead to the creation of new circular businesses, and local entrepreneurship and local businesses, more green and skilled jobs, and a reduction of the ecological footprint.
Business symbiosis: The creation of a matching and marketplace for business symbiosis in the circular economy sector, initially as part of a pilot in District C, will lead as a later outcome to increased synergies and symbiotic relationships between local businesses leading to more efficient use of resources, to the growth and expansion of circular economy activities and start-ups in the local economy, to the reduction of waste and the increase of the circular economy through the exchange of secondary materials and services, and to an improved circular economy ecosystem with more opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship.

## Field of Action: Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions

### 1. District C as a testbed for a city-wide implementation

Green areas: Green areas are essential to achieve the climate neutrality goal of Guimarães. This should not be overlooked, so as an early change Guimarães intends to prototype the green spaces to be implemented and recovered, as in the long run to turn the city climate resilient and able to sequester carbon emissions.
Green belt: The green belt is an ambition of Guimarães' municipality, not only present in the CCC, but also in NZC Pilot Cities Programme – District C. It is expected as a later outcome

1
Guimarães 2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

that the green belt is implemented on Guimarães surroundings, providing a cooling effect, capture carbon emissions, as well restoring biodiversity and be an important urban greening asset.

Biodiversity conservation and restoration: Improving biodiversity in Guimarães allows for the reconciliation of flora and fauna various species on the territory, improving the resilience of the biodiversity ecosystems as a late outcome. As positive impacts, it can be named an improvement of nature restoration, and decease of non-invasive species and enhancement of pollinators.
Urban private community gardens: This action includes, in a first phase, the mapping of private communal areas for gardens where the community can grow their own vegetables and derivatives. This action links the social and environmental dimensions, as it contributes to social cohesion and creates sustainable and ecological food sources for the community. In terms of impact, urban private community gardens help with improving land use management practices have as side effects the greening of the city and an improved sense of belonging and social integration.

## Field of Action: Built environment

## 2. Uptake of actions and strategies with stakeholders' collaboration.

High efficient new buildings: Setting guidelines and standards for new buildings is a first step that the municipality intends to take, and if it works, it will translate into newly constructed buildings that follow the most efficient standards in the long run, resulting in lower GHG emissions and better overall quality and aesthetics of the buildings.

Building deep retrofit: The increase in demand for building retrofitting and energy efficiency measures will lead to an increase in requests, which will have a long-term impact on retrofitting and renovation projects. If this development occurs, it will lead to a reduction in GHG emissions, an increase in efficiency and renovation rates, and economic benefits.

Adoption of efficient lighting and appliances: Will allow a widespread adoption of energy efficient lighting systems and appliances by citizens, leading to a significant reduction in electricity consumption (share of renovations producing around 40% efficiency improvement), as well the retrofitting of street lighting through a tender launch by the municipality. These can revolve on lower energy bills, and a positive environmental impact through reduced carbon emissions. As a latter impact will improve energy efficiency, reduced strain on the power grid, and cost savings for consumers.

## Field of Action: Industry

## 2. Uptake of actions and strategies with stakeholders' collaboration.

Industrial energy efficiency initiatives: The adoption of energy efficiency initiatives by the industrial sector both on the energy production, and on thermal energy and electricity usage, allow for a reduction of energy consumption and for an enhanced overall operational performance, thus allowing economic benefits from the savings on energy bills, resulting in a reduction in GHG emissions.
Solar energy uptake: The use of solar energy for thermal energy production in the industrial sector (e.g., pre-heating processes) contribute to reduce the carbon footprint of the industries that opt for fossil fuels' substitution, increasing the use of endogenous resources, resulting in a reduction in GHG emissions.
Green hydrogen for Guimarães' industry: This is an ambitious measure consisting in the injection of green hydrogen, locally produced with renewable electricity through electrolysers,
Guimarães 2030
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
O

into the natural gas industrial pipelines. The use of this renewable gas, both for thermal needs and for energy production, will be taken up by the pioneers of industry in Guimarães (early adopters) in a first phase and leading afterwards to a wider acceptance, resulting in a reduction in GHG emissions.

Biomass uptake: The adoption of biomass as an alternative renewable energy source for thermal energy in the industrial sector, through the promotion of local-scale energy generation based on residual biomass (installation of small decentralised thermal power plants) along with the promotion for collection and storage biomass facilities, ensuring adequate management of forest, agriculture, livestock, food industry and other organic waste, providing a second life to biowaste and resulting in a reduction in GHG emissions.
Biomethane uptake: The use of biomethane in replacement of fossil fuels for thermal energy and energy production, injected into the natural gas industrial pipelines, allows a decarbonisation of the industrial processes. In an early stage, the possibility to produce biomethane (technological readiness and rate of adoption) in Guimarães, and in the long run to have a greener industry in Guimarães, resulting in a reduction in GHG emissions.
Top management engagement for sustainable industry: If the top management of industry in Guimarães starts to engage in sustainability practises, leadership and commitment to sustainability and climate action is established, leading to the application of sustainable practises in industry, which in turn leads to an increase in economic growth and new technological applications.
Promotion of sustainable industry in partnership with relevant industry associations: If industry comes together in partnership with business and industry associations and promotes sustainable practises in industry, it will be possible to see an increase in sustainable and energy efficient practises, a possible development of networks between stakeholders and ultimately an increase in entrepreneurship and economic growth.
Promotion for sustainable business hosting areas: If the industrial sector, with the support of the municipality, participates in the development of a hub focused on sustainable businesses, these actors will connect with each other and build relationships and symbioses that will have an impact on increasing the visibility of these actors, the role of the municipality in validating green businesses and the possibility of new business and economic models.

## Field of Action: Cross-cutting (energy systems and built environment)

### 1. District C as a testbed for a city-wide implementation

Expansion of a one-stop-shop (OSS): After the One-Stop-Shop (OSS) was initially introduced on a trial basis in District C, the lessons learnt from the pilot project will serve as a catalyst for introducing the OSS in other parishes in Guimarães and expanding its services to cover more users and project requests. If this happens as planned, it will lead to an increase in energy efficiency and retrofitting rates, as well as improved access to information and behavioural change.

## Field of Action: Cross-cutting (all field domains)

Digital twin: If the municipality, with the involvement of stakeholders, explores the possibility of implementing a digital twin system, this will lead to close cooperation between the smart systems department of the municipality and these stakeholders to create a digital twin to support the decision-making process in the municipality, which will ultimately increase the technological readiness of this system to support climate action.
Sustainable tourism: If the tourism industry obtains certification for sustainable practises that are linked to the specifics of the sector, this will allow for the creation of guidelines in the short

Guimarães 2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

term to obtain this certification and start implementing some sustainable practises, leading to more certified sustainable tourism businesses that contribute to the overall economic upliftment of the community.

Relating impact pathways from NZC TOC with MEL procedures, the impact pathway allows Guimarães to visualise the steps necessary to achieve an impact, and can be used to guide action planning, implementation, and evaluation.

In a nutshell, Guimarães' impact pathways help the municipality to design the portfolio of actions with a clear focus on outcomes and impacts, rather than just outputs. They enable the identification and prioritization of the most effective interventions, and to measure and track progress toward desired outcomes over time.

# 4.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

Module B-2 "Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design" contains an action description, including interventions by local businesses and industry, according to the template B-2.1, including actions targeted at enhancing carbon sinks to address residual emissions. The Municipality of Guimarães has a diverse and integrative action portfolio that covers all field domains, that build on the deployment of the 2030 Guimarães vision towards climate neutrality.

The definition of priorities for the actions (first and second priority) was defined by the Transition Team together with the policy makers and based on the results of the RME (Rapid Mass Engagement). Additionally, the available funding opportunities and the policy environment/landscape was taken into consideration.

In developing the action portfolio, the Municipality of Guimarães drew inspiration from the RME workshops to get inputs on the design of the actions, as well as from sectoral meetings with different departments of the Municipality. Actions to be tested first and then extended from District C (NZC pilot city project) were also considered, as well as actions to be taken by stakeholders, e.g., from industry.

The municipality also received the support from the consortium to develop of the NZC economic model (here), which helped building on the actions planned by the Municipality for the Guimarães 2030 vision.

B-2.1: Description of the action portfolio

|  Fields of action | Portfolio description  |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  List of actions | Descriptions  |
|  Energy systems | 1. Renewable Energy Sources (RES) acceleration framework | This action entails the development of a legislative framework and incentives schemes based on the national legislation with a set of guidelines and policies to encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources within Guimarães jurisdiction, hoping to replace the share of fossil fuels electricity production with renewable sources. Guimarães has set ambitious targets for renewable energy adoption to ensure a sustainable and low-carbon future. These targets, aligned with National and European targets, aim to create the pathway to replace the share of fossil fuel electricity production with renewables by 2030. It also implies the identification of suitable areas for renewable energy development, and how to use and upgrade the historical and heritage buildings for this purpose. To encourage renewable energy investments, the municipality can offer various incentives and subsidies, such as tax deduction, grants, and subsidies for renewable energy projects.  |

|   |  | This action will have its first trial under District C (Guimarães pilot project).  |
|  Energy systems | 2. Renewable Energy Communities (REC) and digitalisation of energy | The Municipality of Guimarães intends to implement Small Scale and Community Renewable Energy via the implementation of Renewable Energy Communities (REC) first in small scale through the District C, and then to a larger area. This action will focus first on explore the necessary business models and investment concepts for the REC application and its expansion on the municipality. This action encompasses: 1. stakeholder engagement and education toward the REC concept; 2. identification of suitable projects; 3. development of REC legal structures; 4. business model development; 5. technical assistance including funding and financial support, regulatory support, and technical support; 6. development of collaboration and partnerships and 7. monitoring and evaluation. The goal as for the other actions under the energy systems domain is to prompt the renewable energy in the territory over the non-renewable energy sources. In District C, the introduction of digital metering systems in public buildings will be a priority. The data collected by these systems will be made publicly available through various data sharing platforms described in this pilot project. In addition, the digitisation in RES will be supported through the One-Stop-Shop (OSS) initiative. This will facilitate the tracking, management, and security of energy consumption from RES. The use of modern technologies, such as information and communication technologies (ICT) together with advanced sensors, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things is in line with the European Green Deal strategy and the EU's efforts to get ready for the digital age.  |
|   |  3. RES self-consumption: households, industry, companies, institutions | This action intends to suppress the energy demand of Guimarães inhabitants (on apartments and individual), of the tertiary sector, public institution, and industry, through the of energy from photovoltaic panels and other sources of renewable energy, e.g., micro-wind turbines in self-consumption where the implementation of community projects is not viable. Like the previous measure, the digitalisation will be promoted. Guimarães will promote self-consumption in all sectors and organisations including with a tailored approach for industry given the associated demand and capacity for production. It entails the substitution of the portion of electricity generation derived from fossil fuels with renewable sources.  |
|   |  4. Capacity building actions of municipal staff | This action aims to develop and implement a tailor-made training programme for the municipal staff. The aim is to promote collaboration in the development of new regulations and governance within the municipality and related agencies, while enhancing their capacity to effectively implement clean energy policies. To achieve this, it is intended to develop the necessary educational materials and introduce different training models, such as peer meetings, workshops, and lectures. This intervention is foreseen on District C and it is expected to, after testing it internally in the municipality, scale up to other relevant organisations in the municipality.  |
|   |  5. Guidance for heritage energy | The aim of this action is to produce a comprehensive guide for improving energy efficiency in historic buildings. Using science-based innovative solutions, this action will develop guidelines based on  |

B-2.1: Description of the action portfolio

|  Fields of action | Portfolio description  |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  List of actions | Descriptions  |
|   |  efficiency renovation | research to promote energy efficiency while preserving the historic and local identity of District C and the Guimarães urban area, recognised as a World Heritage Site at UNESCO. Therefore, this action is in line with the New European Bauhaus Initiative, which promotes a link between science, technology, art, culture, and climate goals, such as circular economy, zero pollution and biodiversity. The guide will prioritise the preservation of aesthetics and ensure the involvement of all citizens in the process of sustainable development.  |
|  Energy systems | Together with these individual actions on the energy systems domain can interact with each other, leveraging synergies among them, mainly through: • Integration (technology/infrastructure lever): Promote the integration of photovoltaic systems within the different layers of the society: citizens, services and companies, public and private sector. • Local energy systems: Foster collaboration between renewable energy and communities' driven projects to create localised energy systems that optimise energy production, consumption, and storage. • Knowledge sharing (learning and capabilities lever): Facilitate knowledge exchange and collaboration among stakeholders involved in these interventions to learn from each other's experiences, share best practices, and identify opportunities for joint projects or partnerships. • Policy alignment (governance and policy lever): Ensure that regulatory frameworks and incentives support the simultaneous implementation of self-consumption, green hydrogen, or renewable energy communities, enabling a cohesive approach to emission reduction. By implementing these interventions as a portfolio of actions on the energy domain, and in relation with the other domains, and leveraging their synergies, the municipality can achieve a significant reduction in emissions across different sectors highlighting the potential to decarbonise all sectors including industrial processes, empowering communities, and facilitating a streamlined transition to sustainable energy solutions.  |   |
|  Mobility and transport | 6. Alternative sustainable transportation modes | This action intends to expand the use of alternative sustainable transportation modes, focusing on increasing use of the public transports, and sustainable modes namely walking and use of bicycle to consequently reduce the use of private cars. The Municipality of Guimarães already offers free public transport to several younger and elderly citizens. Using the District C as a testbed, the municipality plans to take a further step by testing the concept of providing free transportation for citizens visiting the local market. This initiative aims not only to promote the use of public transport but also to support and boost the local market, including local farmers. The goal is to increase the use of these alternative transportation models throughout the territory. In addition, education and awareness play a crucial role in fostering public understanding of the reasons behind these transformations. One effective approach is to provide real-life examples that demonstrate the benefits of certain policies, even those that may initially face resistance. The aim of this action is to empower citizens and municipality staff in the safe and responsible use of bicycles and scooters. These training sessions will provide practical knowledge and will be accessible through Guimarães digital platform, ensuring widespread availability of pedagogical materials. In parallel, the municipality will continue to promote sustainable mobility across the city with tailored actions such as Metrominute.  |

| --- | --- | --- |
|  Fields of action | Portfolio description  |   |
|   |  List of actions | Descriptions  |
|  Mobility and transport | 7. Bundling actions to uptake public transports: Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and promotion of public transports | Through this action, Guimarães aims to improve access routes to the national roads EN101 and EN206, due to the existing congestion at the main entry/exit points of the city. In parallel, and to promote the use of public transports, the municipality is exploring the feasibility of electric Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, which will contribute to reducing emissions compared to traditional bus transportation.The Municipality of Guimarães already conducted a Decision Support Study to assess the connectivity between the city and the future High-Speed railway station in Braga. The objective is to establish a dedicated corridor for public and collective transport, enabling residents to travel to the High-Speed station without relying on private cars.To ensure the success of this action and considering the investment volumes and the impacts of the actions, Guimarães is collaborate with regional and national stakeholders on this process, since this inter-regional effort requires coordination and cooperation among various actors involved in the project.The action also entails the reduction un car passenger due to the uptake of public transport as public buses.  |
|   |  8. Sustainable delivery services | This action aims to drive policy, governance, and regulation changes to discourage or prohibit the use of fossil-fuelled vehicles in last-mile deliveries. The goal is to exclusively promote last-mile urban logistics services using eco-friendly modes such as walking and cycling or e-cargo fleet. The action will be piloted in District C, with plans for city-wide coverage under the Climate City Contract execution.  |
|   |  9. Electric mobility shift: private passenger vehicles | This action entails the shift from combustion vehicles to electric vehicles (EV) in Guimarães concerning the private vehicles owned by the citizens. For this, the Municipality will continue a set of initiatives that include, among others, the exception from parking payment of electrical vehicles, the increase of municipal fleet to promote the electrical mobility and the increase of charging (slow and fast) stations across the municipality.  |
|   |  10. Electric mobility shift: light goods, and heavy-duty vehicles | This action is similar to the previous one, focusing on light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. The goal is to lead the path to convert around 100% of the light-duty vehicles by 2030 and 88% of the heavy-duty vehicles by 2040 to electrical. For this, the municipality will start from its own fleet reconversion and, in parallel, with the promotion of electrical mobility initiatives.  |
|   |  11. Buses green conversion | Guimabus, the company responsible for the collective passenger transport service in the municipality of Guimarães, has a fleet of 80 buses of which 22 are electric and the rest are diesel buses.This action entails the conversion of 32 diesel buses to electric ones and in parallel a work with other mobility stakeholders, such as intermunicipal operator, to promote the adoption of electrical buses. A key point to explore is the success story of Guimabus' electrical mobility as a shining example for other stakeholders.  |
|   |  12. Conversion of the urban solid waste collection fleet | According to the Guimarães 2030 Bio-Waste Management Plan, by 2030 it is expected that the emissions from the waste collection fleet drops from 17,4 kgCO2/ton to 8,97 kgCO2/ton. It is considered by the same plan that the total amount of emissions from selective collection of biowaste is below 13,0 kgCO2/ton.  |

|   |   | There is already a thermal hydrolysis of WWTP sludge project that will be executed in 2024/2026. The sludge production will have potential for agricultural use and biogas production, thus contributing to a reduction in GHG and to the climate-neutrality strategy. The investment will be € 14 million. Considering the reediness level of this solution the municipality is also studying the use of electrical vehicles for the waste collection. Thus, Guimarães is exploring several scenarios to be considered. Under this action, a 50% conversion for electric trucks and a 50% conversion for biomethane scenario is to be considered. With this action the municipality intends to explore the potential of converting sludge from wastewater treatment plants (currently disposed to landfill) to produce biogas (bio-methane). This new source of fuel for Guimarães would feed the waste collection trucks from the municipality' fleet, creating a circular economy approach: the collected waste (sludge) would be transformed into fuel that would feed the municipal fleet, ending the cycle. It is foreseen to achieve a global reduction of 1,0 kton, equivalent to a reduction of 0,4% of the transport sector emissions.  |
|   |  13. Carpooling and car sharing | This action aims to promote carpooling and car sharing to reduce the number of private passengers per vehicle, allowing for more efficient use of private vehicles. Sharing the same vehicle is expected to reduce traffic congestion and stress associated with road transport, as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For this, Guimarães intends to study alternatives and revitalise programmes, such as the Guimarães à Boleia that promotes carpooling and car sharing.  |
|  Mobility and transport | The interventions respecting the mobility and transport domain make up the portfolio of actions that will enable systemic change for the Municipality of Guimarães on a domain that is responsible for a considerable amount of the emissions. These interactions can trigger leverage synergies by: • Modal shift (governance and policy lever): By promoting alternative modes of transport, such as cycling and walking and providing a reliable and efficient BRT system, the municipality can reduce the number of single-occupancy vehicles on the roads, resulting in lower transport emissions. • Charging infrastructure (technology and infrastructure lever): The development of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles can be used for both private cars and electric delivery vehicles, facilitating the adoption of electric mobility in different sectors. • Green delivery services (technology and infrastructure lever): Sustainable delivery services, such as electric cargo bikes, can support the transition to electric mobility while reducing emissions from delivery operations. • Public transport integration (governance and policy lever): Integrating sustainable mobility options such as cycling and walking into the BRT system can provide seamless and convenient transport options for residents, encouraging more people to use public transport and reducing the use of private vehicles. • Citizen engagement (learning and capabilities lever): Engaging citizens in sustainable mobility initiatives can raise awareness, build support, and encourage  |   |

|   | behavioural changes that favour emission reduction and support the implementation of sustainable transport projects. Also, important to mention that Guimarães strategy also considers that: • Transport modes such as walking or cycling work together with BRT to reduce car use and improve accessibility to public transport reducing citizens costs on mobility. • The transition to electric mobility complements sustainable transport modes and reduces both direct and indirect emissions. • Electric buses benefit from both BRT infrastructure and the transition to electric mobility. • The conversion of the waste collection fleet using biomethane and other fuel sources provide a second life to biowaste, and improves the technology readiness, as well reduce emission associated with the collection waste routes. • Sustainable delivery services reduce congestion and emissions and increase the effectiveness of public transport improvement. • Citizen engagement creates an enabling environment for all measures and encourages participation and behaviour change, such as carpooling and car-sharing. By incorporating these interventions into a comprehensive portfolio of actions and leveraging their synergies, the Municipality of Guimarães can accelerate the transition to electric mobility, reduce emissions from transportation, improve air quality, and create a more sustainable and efficient public transport system.  |   |
|  Waste and circular economy | 14. Biowaste upgrade | This action entails the expansion of the biowaste recovery throughout the Guimarães territory, starting with a first trial on limited area (District C). The aim is to expand the collection infrastructure of biowaste, support for composting and organic, waste treatment collaboration with local institutions, monitoring and data collection, as well continuous evaluation, and improvement. From the action implementation, it is expected an increase of biowaste on the District C area and reduced GHG emissions.  |
|   |  15. Undifferentiated urban waste reduction | By implementing an action of reduction of undifferentiated urban waste, the Municipality of Guimarães can effectively promote waste separation, reduce undifferentiated waste, and contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally conscious municipality. This action entails the improvement of the waste collection infrastructure, strengthened enforcement collaboration with waste management companies (e.g., Resinorte, VITRUS) enhanced recycling infrastructure, community engagement and involvement, encouraging composting and organic waste management incentives for waste reduction, data monitoring and evaluation and finally continuous improvement and collaboration.  |
|   |  16. Waste production reduction | Waste production reduction enables the Municipality of Guimarães to effectively reduce overall urban waste production, promote sustainable waste management practices, and create a cleaner and more environmentally friendly municipality. The municipality can achieve this by doing a first test through the District C and the replicate to an extended area. This implies encouragement of source reduction (promote source reduction  |

|   |  17. Recycling upgrade | To increase recycling at the Municipality of Guimarães, this action is being considered to increase the recycling rate. It consists of improving infrastructure (more bins, easy access), promoting reuse (reuse centres, reusable packaging, reusable shopping bags, as has been done for the local market in the municipality), creating recycling facilities that can efficiently process and sort recyclable materials, working with recycling companies to build partnerships and promote the development of a circular economy, and finally monitoring and evaluating.  |
|   |  18. New circular business models | This intervention aims to extend the lifespan of products and foster circular business models in District C and its posterior expansion, while implementing a digital approach for businesses This will involve exploring concepts like the repair café, renting tools and appliances as service models, establishing second-hand and thrift shops and markets, and other relevant circular initiatives.  |
|   |  19. Business symbiosis | Under this intervention, waste generated by one company can be transformed into a valuable resource for others, thereby creating a closed-loop system that stimulates the local economy. The goal is to encourage collaboration among businesses, where they can exchange resources, develop innovative products and services, and collectively drive sustainability. To support businesses in this endeavour, matchmaking and marketplace actions will be implemented in conjunction with other engagement efforts. These actions will facilitate networking opportunities for businesses, allowing them to connect with potential partners and access financing opportunities for their circular initiatives.  |
|   |  In the domain of waste and circular economy, the planned measures represent a sectoral portfolio that interacts within the sector, but also with the mobility and transport sector, for example, the possibility of converting Guimarães' waste collection. Even if this sector is not one of those that contribute most to greenhouse gas emissions, it has a non-negligible impact, also because of its importance for the circular economy and behavioural change away from a linear economic approach. Synergy effects can be achieved through these interactions: • Waste reduction cascade (governance and policy lever): The reduction of waste production, undifferentiated urban waste, and improved recycling can complement each other, creating a waste reduction cascade that lowers the overall waste generation and its environmental impact. • Circular economy approach (financing and funding): Implementing circular business models and business symbiosis will lead to a more sustainable use of resources and minimize waste generation. By promoting circular practices, businesses can also find new revenue streams and cost savings. • Electric fleet and emissions reduction (technology and infrastructure lever): Converting the waste collection fleet to low-emission or electric vehicles not only reduces emissions from waste management but also serves as an example of sustainable transportation practices that can inspire other sectors.  |   |

|   |  Action type | Physical/ spatial interventions  |
|   |  Action description | This action encompasses the promotion of public transport (public buses) as well the deployment of the Bus Rapid Transit service, with the intention to reduce the use of private cars by up taking the use of public transport. The Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) consists of a high-quality bus transit system that offers fast, comfortable, and cost-effective urban mobility. The BRT moves through dedicated lanes and has a fast operation with high frequency. Cities in Portugal, such as Coimbra, have already implemented this type of mobility system, financed by national funds, and Braga will be on its way to have it. Guimarães intends to improve the access to the national roads EN101 and EN206 (the congestion on the main entering points of the city - EN206 and EN101 - is notorious) taking advantage of the intention to implement a BRT system close to the municipality. To this end, it is intended to study the possibility of a BRT system being electric and the reduction of emissions associated with the use of improved public transport (traditional bus versus BRT solution). In this context, Guimarães Municipality did a Decision Support Study for the interconnectivity of the city with the future railway station of High-Speed station in Braga, thereby seeking connection through a public and collective transport, in a dedicated corridor, so that its citizens can travel to the High-  |

|   |  Action description | This action is an innovative one, because it implies the conversion of the municipal waste collection fleet. Guimarães municipality can do this through a mix of different options, namely turn the municipal fleet into electric vehicles, use biogas/biomethane as fuel, and explore different combinations that better suit Guimarães.Given the current Guimarães context, the municipality considers the conversion of 11 vehicles to electricity and 11 vehicles to biomethane, of a total of 22 vehicles from the municipality' fleet. The implementation of this actions constitutes an opportunity to close the cycle of disposal and treatment of biowaste, creating a new product that can be used to fuel the municipal fleet and turn the management and collection of waste cleaner and more sustainable for the municipality. This measure has the capacity to act on circular economy and clean and renewable energy.  |

|   | Comments on implementation | The city centre of the Municipality of Guimarães is considered a heritage site of international interest by UNESCO, which includes several historic buildings. This imposes some restrictions on the retrofitting of this type of buildings, such as the installation of photovoltaic panels on the roofs and energy efficiency measures. Therefore, the action "Guidance for heritage energy efficiency renovation" is linked to this action as they complement each other in terms of retrofitting buildings and the implementation of energy efficiency measures. On the other hand, legislation, and policies for the construction of new buildings with sustainable criteria already exist at national level and should be applied. The Decree Law n.°101-D/2020 establishes the requirements to improve the energy performance of buildings and regulates the Energy Certification System for Buildings (SCE), the Order n.° 6476-E/2021 defines new minimum requirements for thermal comfort and energy performance of buildings, both for new buildings and renovations, and also the new General Building Code (GCE) is under revision. The national policy and regulations define that new buildings must have near-zero energy emissions. It is the intention of the municipality to apply, within its means, the best criteria for sustainable construction to the construction of new buildings that comply with national (and therefore European) standards.  |

Guimarães, due to its location, can take advantage of the waste biomass from the region to produce local biofuel, thus ensuring adequate management of forest, agriculture, livestock, food industry and other organic waste, and provide a second life to biowaste.
However, to ensure a secure supply, and harnessing the potential of biomass as a renewable energy source to meet the thermal energy needs of industries, long-term contracts with suppliers will be needed.
It is foreseen to reach a substitution of 50% of the remaining fossil fuels consumption for thermal energy in industrial sector, equivalent to the installation/substitution of approximately 40 MW of steam boilers.
This measure focuses on harnessing the potential of biomass as a renewable energy source to meet the thermal energy needs of industries.  |

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

Guimarães has set a  $20\%$  level of residual GHG emissions.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 27 – Adapted from Guimarães European Green Capital candidacy, cycle 2025

Guimarães Networking System: local, regional, national, and international cooperation promoting green-growth, knowledge-transfer and reinforcing innovation in public services.

Several factors contribute to the  $20\%$  residual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions expected across various sectors by 2030. These factors encompass technological limitations, a gradual transition to clean technologies, economic constrains, limited policy frameworks, infrastructure gaps, consumer behaviour, government cooperation, and financial constraints (Figure 27).

Achieving total decarbonization is ambitious and depends on the emissions balance rather than an absolute removal of emissions.
Guimarães 2030
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Natural systems, such as forests, have the potential to absorb more carbon than they emit. Currently, the management of terrestrial ecosystems, primary forests, remains the primary means to remove GHG from atmosphere and thereby balance GHG emissions.

Over a significant period, forest and agricultural soils have predominantly shaped the landscape of Guimarães. Presently, Guimarães is predominantly covered by forest (45,5%) and agricultural land (29,6%).

Guimarães actively participated in a three-year initiative to calculate the municipality's ecological footprint, led by ZERO, a prominent environmental non-governmental organization in Portugal, in collaboration with the Global Footprint Network and the University of Aveiro. The utilization of the Ecological Footprint is a pivotal component of our strategy, aiding in the mapping and comprehension of local environmental challenges while steering changes in habits and policies.

The results of Guimarães' ecological footprint analysis indicate that the greatest pressure is exerted on forest carbon sequestration capacity, accounting for nearly 57% of the footprint (Assessing the Ecological Footprint and biocapacity of Portuguese cities: Critical results for environmental awareness and local management – scientific paper). In terms of biocapacity, forests (70% of functional biocapacity) and agricultural areas (26%) emerge as the principal ecological assets of the Municipality of Guimarães. All other categories contribute less than 1%.

A separate study aimed at quantifying the carbon stored in Guimarães' living biomass concludes that the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) sector, a necessary aspect for future inclusion in the base inventory, is responsible for sequestering 120 548,129 tonCO₂ annually (approximately 18% of the total baseline inventory and roughly 19% of the total emissions in the economic model). This is predominantly facilitated by the forested areas (Contribution to the carbon neutrality of the Municipality of Guimarães – scientific paper).

While Guimarães' strategy primarily revolves around ecosystem services for carbon sequestration and has empirically established its potential, the current stage of the Action Plan adopts a conservative approach and does not yet include AFOLU-LULUCF in the emissions inventory. However, future prospects indicate that carbon sequestration in Guimarães, particularly within forested lands, could be a robust strategy for addressing residual emissions.

Furthermore, though not yet internally assessed for its carbon sequestration potential, Guimarães boasts an urban tree canopy of 1 130,8 hectares, owing in part to the annual planting of 2 000 trees. Between 2010 and 2021, the municipality expanded its green infrastructure by 195,1 hectares, approximately 20,9%.

Based on previous work outcomes, there is a firm belief that upon completion of the calculation of the total GHG emissions balance, the natural assets within the territory, encompassing both rural and urban areas, will prove capable of mitigating Guimarães' residual emissions.

# 4.3 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

The Municipality of Guimarães has defined indicators to monitor, evaluate and achieve learning outcomes for each planned action.

These indicators were selected from: (1) NZC Indicator domains for the CCC Action Plan; (2) the indicator set NZC PCP of the NZC Pilot Cities Programme; (3) the indicators that are relevant considering the proposed actions. To better reflect the reality in Guimarães, the municipality decided to compile this indicator set according to the planned actions. It also considered the desire to extend these actions to the whole territory while still using appropriate indicators.

These indicators are intended to measure direct impacts, e.g., GHG emissions, and/or indirect impacts (co-benefits), depending on the purpose of the action.

|  Indicator Unit | %  |
|  Definition | This intervention is also present on District C, having the goal to encourage the use of sustainable transportation alternatives, aiming to decrease the dependence on private cars. The focus is on promoting eco-friendly modes of travel like walking, cycling, and public transportation, to improve the community's overall sustainability and quality of life. Regarding the pilot project, the municipality defined the following indicators: Increase in use of public transports for daily commutes (Uptake of public transportation) and raise number of citizens circulating on foot on other active mobility mode in daily commutes (Increase pedestrian and cycling habits). The indicator "Modal share of green transport modes and public transporting" measures the proportion or percentage of people using environmentally friendly modes of transport such as walking, cycling and public transport compared to the total number of people using all modes of transport. It provides information on the acceptance and effectiveness of sustainable modes of transport and shows the extent to which the community is reducing its dependence on private cars in favour of greener alternatives.  |

|  Definition | This intervention is also present on the pilot city District C, and the goal is to start a carbon-free last mile delivery system, first at a small scall and then expand throughout the territory. The municipality for this intervention will involve the most representative delivery and transportation companies and businesses of the municipality to co-develop a delivery system roadmap. At District C, the municipality defined indicators for the initial pilot phase: “Framework, procedures of carbon-free delivery system roadmap developed with key stakeholders’ indicator” (Carbon-free delivery strategy) and “Implementation of carbon-free delivery with at least one stakeholder in tested area - District C” (Carbon-free delivery performance). The indicator greenhouse gas emissions from transport refers to the measurement of GHG emissions resulting from the transport of goods, especially in relation to last mile delivery within the municipality area. It assesses the environmental impact of the delivery process and focuses on the emissions generated by the vehicles used to transport goods from distribution centres to the delivery point.  |

|  Calculation | First is necessary to determine the total number of deliveries or parcels transported within the municipality (test on District C) during a given period (e.g., one year) and collect information on the vehicles used for the deliveries and the associated emission factors. Then proceed to calculate the total emissions for each type of delivery vehicle (fossil fuel vehicles, bicycles, e-delivery vehicles, by 2030 is expected that all these delivery vehicles are zero-emissions) by multiplying the total distance travelled for the deliveries by the emission factor associated with the respective vehicle type. Finally, it is necessary to compare the calculated emissions for the different delivery types to assess the emissions impact of each type.  |

|  Definition | This indicator comes from the pilot city project - District C, more specifically the District C Impact Framework, NZC Pilot Cities Programme. This intervention comes from the District C pilot project of the Municipality of Guimarães, which consists of expand the biowaste recovery that has been ongoing on the municipality. This entails the expansion of the areas at the territory where the biowaste is being collected and the use of the biowaste. To maintain coherence between the CCC and the NZC Pilot Cities Programme, the municipality decided to keep the selected indicator in this case. It assesses the progress and effectiveness of the collection of biowaste in Guimarães aimed at improving the collection of biowaste from the waste stream. As bio-waste is organic and decomposable, it can be kept out of landfills and recovered through composting or recycling processes, as well to produce biofuels.  |

|  Definition | This intervention is also from the pilot city project District C, NZC pilot city programme.

It is important to note that the Municipality of Guimarães, for the interventions under the Greenhouse Gas domain, and more specifically from the Carbon Capture and Residual Emissions sub-domain, will opt for a different indicator from the one that was selected for the pilot city project (NZC Pilot Cities Programme Indicator Set). This is because the green areas, green belt, biodiversity conservation and restoration, and urban private community gardens are interventions that fit into the definition of “negative emissions through natural sinks” indicator instead of the “amount of permanent sequestration of GHG within city boundary” (the one that was chose at the time of the refinement of the District C). At the time, it was not available this indicator (negative emissions through natural sinks) to choose from the set list.

This indicator will account for negative emissions through the enlargement and enhancement of natural sinks within the territory to address residual emission. The Municipality of Guimarães intends to recovery/implement green areas for carbon capture.  |
|  Calculation | To calculate this indicator is necessary to estimate the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by green areas such as forests, which contributes to carbon sequestration.

|  Indicator Unit | tCO2equivalent  |
|  Definition | This indicator measures the amount of GHG emissions caused by the energy consumption of buildings that have undergone a comprehensive retrofit, and energy efficiency measures. The focus is on quantifying the emissions resulting from the energy consumption of buildings after they have been upgraded to improve energy efficiency. This indicator provides information on the effectiveness of comprehensive building retrofit and energy efficiency initiatives (including public lighting) in reducing energy related GHG emissions. It is a valuable benchmark for assessing the environmental benefits of retrofitting buildings to improve energy efficiency.  |
|  Calculation | To calculate this indicator is necessary to determine the energy consumption of the buildings, then proceed to calculate the emissions by multiplying the energy consumption of each energy source, and then convert to tCO2 emissions.  |

The increase in demand for building retrofitting and energy efficiency measures will lead to an increase in requests, which will have a long-term impact on retrofitting and renovation projects. If this development occurs, it will lead to a reduction in GHG emissions, an increase in efficiency and renovation rates, and economic benefits. Will allow a widespread adoption of energy efficient lighting systems and appliances by citizens, leading to a significant reduction in electricity consumption (share of renovations producing around 40% efficiency improvement), as well the retrofitting of street lighting through a tender launch by the municipality. These can revolve on lower energy bills, and a positive environmental impact through reduced carbon emissions. As a latter impact will improve energy efficiency, reduced strain on the power grid, and cost savings for consumers (see Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways).  |

# 5 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part C "Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030" aims to outline the actions that the Municipality of Guimarães has already undertaken in terms of organisational, governance and social innovation.

This is an area of expertise of the municipality, in collaboration with the Landscape Laboratory of Guimarães, which plays an essential role in turning the commitments and portfolio actions into reality and achieving climate neutrality by 2030.

# 5.1 Module C-1 Organisational and Governance Innovation Interventions

Module C-1 "Organisational and Governance Innovation Interventions" consists of a summary table of the organisational and governance interventions that the municipality is already implementing.

The Municipality of Guimarães serves a comprehensive overview of the organisational and governance interventions that are strategically designed to shape the conditions that influence and stimulate social behaviour. They aim to reduce existing barriers and to remove potential obstacles that could hinder progress.

A key objective of these interventions is to combat the "silo mentality" that often leads to fragmentation within the governance structure of a municipality, which is not the case of the Municipality of Guimarães due to this set of interventions, e.g., 2030 Guimarães governance ecosystem. These interventions involve active collaboration with key stakeholders, and by involving them in the development, implementation and monitoring of the Climate City Contract, the municipality is working to create a more inclusive and participatory approach to tackling climate change and related challenges.

# C-1.2: Description of organisation and governance interventions – textual and visual elements

The Municipality of Guimarães has a strong cohesion within its departments, being able to formulate projects that link different divisions and disciplines. The Transition Team formed for the mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" is an example of this. It includes members from the energy efficiency department of the city administration, as well as from the transport and mobility, environmental and circular economy, intelligent systems, and the economic and territory development. The team also includes members from the Landscape Laboratory of Guimarães, a long-standing partner of the municipality with many years of experience in climate change, environmental education, and biodiversity, being the coordinator of Guimarães Mission Structure 2030. This is also the case with other projects, such as the European Green Capital Award application and other local, national, and European projects.

The Municipality of Guimarães has set targets to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-level governance for climate neutrality by maintaining and implementing action plans at the local level that are aligned with national and EU decarbonisation targets. Guimarães will continue to engage in European and national networks (e.g., Adapt.local, Climate Alliance, Energy Cities, Eurocities, Intelligent Cities Challenge) to share best practises and knowledge. Regular dialogue with national and EU decision-makers will ensure that community needs and perspectives are considered in high-level decision-making processes.

The governance measures outlined in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan include the governance initiatives from the NZC Pilot Cities Programme (District C) and the successful initiatives already implemented in the municipality of Guimarães that have demonstrated their positive impact on the local community.

The adoption of the 2030 Guimarães Governance Ecosystem allows the municipality of Guimarães to build a network of linkages between local, national, and European actors that allows for a networked and rapid response to sustainable community projects and strategies. It ensures that the municipality has a governance structure that puts sustainability at the centre of its priorities.

Through the implementation of District C, the municipality intends to establish a digital platform to keep citizens and the wider community informed about the goals achieved and progress made in the pilot city project. To keep the information related to the 100 neutral and smart cities in one place and facilitate access and management, this digital platform may also include the updates for the Guimarães Climate City Contract.

The Municipality of Guimarães intends to test the updating of regulations and measures related to energy efficiency and renewable energy in buildings by the District C project. As a new framework is

available for testing in a small area of the municipality, the intention is to transfer this measure to a larger area and extend its impact to the whole territory.

The Municipality of Guimarães also intends to further strengthen cross-sectoral cooperation between the Municipality and stakeholders (citizens, businesses, universities, organisations and associations, NGOs) in the region. The aim is to involve as many stakeholders as possible on the 2030 vision, foment new alliances, connections, and synergies between stakeholders towards climate neutrality. To achieve this, Guimarães will continue the RME sessions to maintain engagement and ongoing actions and interventions.

Innovative and sustainable financing mechanisms are a measure that the Municipality of Guimarães wants to take and that will be tested first in District C. The aim is to explore public-private partnerships, impact investing and business models to combine public investment with private investment to finance climate change.

Data-driven decision-making is another activity planned from District C, to improve linking different data sources and inputs and tracking the results achieved in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This relates to the Guimarães Climate City Contract, as the MEL (Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning) methodology which will also be implemented for monitoring, tracking, and producing lessons learned from the implementation of actions in the area.

Operational coordination and management are another governance measures at the municipal level, consisting of the operational management of the Climate City Contract, ensuring that stakeholders are promoted in a continuous process, that the planned actions are implemented smoothly and that the financial plan is consistent with the implementation of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan. District C will also follow this approach so that lessons learned from the operational coordination and management of a smaller project can be applied to the whole area.

Operational coordination and management are another governance intervention at the municipal level, that consists of the operational management of the climate city contract, ensuring that the stakeholders are nurtured on a continuous process, the planned actions are smoothly implemented, and the financial plan is accurately in line with the deployment of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan. District C will also follow this line of action, so lessons acquired from the operational coordination and management of a smaller scale project can be translate to the whole territory.

Finally, continuous impact measurement and quality optimisation ensures the evaluation of the impact of the measures implemented within the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan towards climate neutrality by 2030. For this purpose, the MEL approach will be used to identify improvements, but also obstacles and unforeseen difficulties in the implementation of the measures, as to evaluate the results achieved and, above all, to learn from the measures implementation and to determine what worked smoothly and when and what can be improved. District C will also follow this type of approach in the planned pilot activities. The municipality will continue to invest in participatory and co-creative strategies, especially through the implementation of the zero-footprint mobility plan. A new monitoring system for air quality and noise will be implemented, aiming to reduce air pollution to the levels recommended by WHO (World Health Organisation).

# 5.2 Module C-2 Social and Other Innovation Interventions

Module C-2 "Social and Other Innovation Interventions" consists of a summary table of the social interventions that the Municipality of Guimarães in partnership with the Landscape Laboratory of Guimarães.

The municipality focuses on the interventions that fit into the following categories: entrepreneurial, social economy, social awareness and mobilization, and social cohesion and solidarity.

Through the diversity of social innovation activities and interventions that the Landscape Laboratory of Guimarães has been developing and continues to innovate, it creates a deep sense of awareness on environmental, social, and sustainability issues, as well a sense to act against climate change. |   |

C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions – textual and visual elements

The social innovation interventions mentioned earlier have a crucial role on achieving climate neutrality due to its community unifying power towards a common goal, involving also different stakeholders.

The Landscape Laboratory of Guimarães apart from the Municipality of Guimarães, is the main responsible for the development and implementation of these interventions. It has several years of experience in promoting social innovation actions linked to environmental and sustainability issues, with a strong component in environmental education.

To embrace all layers of the society, the Municipality of Guimarães aims its social interventions to be opened to all citizens, despite social and economic background, to ensure a just transition, where the most vulnerable citizens are also part of the systemic change towards climate neutrality, since most often these are the citizens that suffer the most the harms of climate change.

Social innovation can play a crucial role in the transition to climate neutrality by promoting new and innovative solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address the impacts of climate change.

The Municipality of Guimarães also intends to empower the community and citizens through these actions by actively participating in the energy transition and climate neutrality, e.g., through participation in renewable energy communities, clean mobility habits, energy democracy and energy justice. As mentioned above, all citizens should be included in the processes and actions, regardless of their economic status, gender, religious beliefs, and age. To fight energy poverty, social justice must be strengthened, because a just climate transition implies also a just social transition.

The social innovation interventions for the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan encompass the social innovation interventions from the NZC pilot city programme (District C) and the ones that are already implemented in Guimarães, having a proved record on its impact on the community.

These interventions can be grouped into the following main categories (even if the interventions are assigned to one category, they can also belong to more than one):

## Entrepreneurship:

Community Climate Challenge: This is a new activity that Municipality of Guimarães intends to implement through the District C, and in 2025 expand to a larger area of the municipality. This intervention will reinforce the goals for 2030 by providing an incentive to the community based on the good practises and efforts towards a greener municipality.
Climate neutral cultural events: The Municipality of Guimarães intends to test the concept of climate-neutral cultural events first in District C. The municipality hosts numerous cultural events throughout the year, so it makes perfect sense to make them more environmentally friendly, considering the entire chain of events from preparation to follow-up. This measure will help to achieve the climate goals by ensuring that all cultural events are climate neutral by 2030.
Rural Base Incubator: This activity has been already implemented by the municipality, and the goal is to support the rural business and initiatives to deploy greener agricultural practises, and nature base-solutions. Supporting the rural areas is crucial to empower a community that sometimes is placed in a second plan for not be considered as part of a city-centre. The Rural Base Incubator helps to engage all citizens and business towards climate neutrality goals.
Community gardens: Spaces where citizens and associations can grow plants and vegetables. These gardens promote sustainable practises, strengthen the sense of community, provide access to fresh produce, and encourage outdoor activities and education. They are also a place to interact with neighbours and prevent isolation.

## Social Economy:

Participatory Budgeting (PB): This is a well-known intervention on the social intervention's domains, applied already by many cities. The Municipality of Guimarães will test the PB with the District C pilot, and then replicate it to a large audience. As the municipality has a record to engage with citizens and put them at the heart of the change, a PB is a good opportunity to change the traditional budgeting of the municipality. It provides the chance for the community to engage on how and where the public budget should be applied, putting in practice a bottom-up approach. To achieve the 2030 goals, so often are the citizens that really know their climate and environment struggles of the daily bases (e.g., public transports) so these interventions allow for a more in-depth output collection of the necessities and hardships of the community.
Co-creation process – citizens auscultation: The Municipality of Guimarães expects that this pilot activity in District C will test citizen consultation procedures that will lead to the development of a sustainability matrix. This 'bottom-up' intervention is intended to inspire and empower the local community to build on actions towards climate neutrality. Citizens' parliaments will be one of the methods to ensure that every community in Guimarães has a voice and that the co-design processes reach every single community. As mentioned earlier, climate neutrality cannot be

achieved by the municipality alone, so these types of actions are a must to the 2030 for Guimarães vision.

# Social awareness and mobilisation:

Deployment of the Citizen Pact: Guimarães has already deployed an informal, voluntary, and non-binding pact – Guimarães Climate Pact. This pact embraces all kind of entities, not only citizens, who also want to express their alignment with 2030 Guimarães vision. This intervention is defined on NZC pilot programme District C as a pact for the citizens signalling their commitment with 2030 Guimarães vision. Guimarães anticipated this intervention by developing a pact to all interested parties.
Immersive Experiences: This intervention is another example of a broader application of a pilot activity that is being tested in district C. The aim is to show how a particular planned action unfolds in a real context in Guimarães. Through lived experience, it is possible to create a sense of transparency and security before the moment of implementation. This can be particularly important when the municipality wants to implement a new and disruptive measure that may initially cause discomfort and resistance among the population due to its novelty in the region.
Memória 65+: As the population ages, it becomes imperative to find strategies that promote active ageing. The Landscape Laboratory, in collaboration with Guimarães City Council and partner institutions, offers a range of free activities focused on environmental sustainability to more than four dozen institutions in the municipality. These activities connect a part of the society that sometimes is left behind on the climate transition journey, connecting generations, promoting a healthy aging, and a more cohesive and solitary territory.

Desporto Zero: Sport is an activity that connects a community regardless of the background of the participants. Therefore, combining the environmental and sustainability component with activities that closely involve the community is a great strategy to engage people in climate transition.
PEGADAS Programme: The Municipality of Guimarães believes that to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, every layer of the community should be involved on the transition, and that the young generation is a fundamental key to mobilise towards this cause. PEGADAS is an emblematic environmental education programme on Guimarães, an example of good practise of the Blue Flag Association of Europe (ABAE) and has been recognised as a Friend of the International Year for Global Understanding (IYGU), an initiative of the International Geographical Union (IGU) that addresses the way humans reshape and shape nature and the impact of the global of their everyday behaviour.

Poliniza-te: A programme aimed at raising awareness of the importance of pollinator conservation. By highlighting the role of pollinators through theoretical and practical activities, the municipality of Guimarães expects to support the nature-based solutions envisaged in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, the restoration and maintenance of biodiversity in the region. In addition, researchers from the Landscape Laboratory assess and monitor pollinators in Guimarães, while pollinator-friendly policies and practises are implemented.

Biodiversity Go!: This intervention is led by biologists through the flora and fauna of Guimarães. Participants are invited to install the APP Biodiversity GO! developed by the Landscape Laboratory, free of charge, to photograph local biodiversity and contribute to the Guimarães biodiversity database with their observations and records. For the climate neutrality goals, this activity contributes to create awareness on the local biodiversity, enduring its preservation and conservation, and to help to provide inputs to monitoring and categorisation.

# Social cohesion and solidarity:

Placemaking: This is an intervention that is planned on the District C pilot city project, that the Guimarães City Council expects to test and then apply on a larger area. Placemaking, as the Participatory Budget, is an intervention that is well-known on the social economy domain, applied in several European cities already. For the Municipality of Guimarães, it will consist of topic-driven open discussions in public spaces for public actions. This implies engagement activities with citizens, e.g., citizen juries or citizen assemblies, as a mean to get citizens feedback and evolve from a "bottom-up" approach. Putting the Guimarães' community at the heart of a co-creative process to shape healthier, more resilient, and more equitable public spaces lasting for the future will help to achieve the 2030 climate goals.

In conclusion, the Municipality of Guimarães, together with its partner, the Landscape Laboratory of Guimarães, has a solid record of social interventions that will continue to enable the municipality to engage its community, from the young to the older generation, and from different socio-economic backgrounds.

These social interventions are hugely important for climate neutrality by 2030, as they help lay the foundations for systemic change that starts with the community and stakeholders' involvement.

# 6 Outlook and next steps

This section draws the plans of the Municipality of Guimarães for the following iterations of the Climate City Contract, focusing on the Action Plan next steps.

## Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration

The Municipality of Guimarães intends to continue to improve and refine the Climate City Contract over the years and, in next iterations to add more stakeholders and their commitments and actions towards climate neutrality. The municipality considers the CCC as a "living" document that needs to be constantly updated to reflect the reality of Guimarães and its variations in an ever-changing environment. It is also the intention of the municipality to unbright the design and layout of the Guimarães' Climate City Contract to match the design of the Guimarães Climate City Pact and the vison Guimarães 2030: Join the Green Transition.

The involvement of stakeholders in the development and design of the CCC is a very important aspect for the municipality, which has already taken the first steps to engage with them, especially through the Guimarães Climate Pact and the first round of RME (Rapid Mass Engagement) workshops.

The municipality intends to continue these types of sections, each time involving more stakeholders and diversifying the target group; it has already planned a possible bootcamp for youth level engagement in the CCC.

With this in mind, the Municipality of Guimarães has planned the second round of RME workshops, which will derive and build on the findings and feedback from the previous round.

During the development of the CCC, the municipality was also supported by experts from the NZC Consortium in formulating strategies to engage Guimarães' industry in the process, as industry is a key player in Guimarães and a major contributor to the municipality's emissions. It is the municipality's desire to work with this group of experts to deepen the relationship between the municipality and industry actors.

The municipality aims to continue to engage with stakeholders for the implementation of the actions as well as the National government. The support and advocacy of the National government is important to support some of the actions, e.g., Bus Rapid Transit, production of biogas, and introduction of hydrogen. The municipality intends to continue to work at a political level to demonstrate the leadership and efforts that Guimarães has made towards climate neutrality and to be a lighthouse for other municipalities in Portugal.

Furthermore, the Municipality of Guimarães intends to refine its approach to the NZC economic model, as the original model does not consider industry as an isolated sector/field of action (this is an
Guimarães 2030 2016 Green Transition

important sector for Guimarães), and to further improve the interactions with the model (inputs and outputs).

Finally, the municipality intends to decipher the 'citizen' as a stakeholder group and explore the different levels and dimensions that these stakeholders have on the transition pathway, as they can involve families, different socio-economic levels, and backgrounds, so it would be a next step to explore this dimension in depth and understand how the different stakeholders can be involved and influence the implementation of the CCC.

# 1 Introduction

## The Guimarães' pathway towards climate neutrality

Guimarães is known as the "birthplace of Portuguese nationality" and the city strives to honour its proud heritage by becoming Portugal's most sustainable city in the future – "be more than green". Guimarães has a long history of climate action and involves citizens in its actions, especially in relation to culture and environment.

Before being selected to be one of the EU 100 Climate Neutral Cities Mission, Guimarães was already strongly committed to reduce CO₂ emissions, as a signatory of the Covenant of Mayors for Energy and Climate, since 2013. Guimarães expects to achieve tangible results with its mission of 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 and to be an example of what the future green cities will look like - as Guimarães' slogan "Join the Green Transition" states. This is not just about decarbonising the urban area, but also about integrating a sustainable, holistic approach to tackling climate change, e.g., circular economy, reducing inequality, sustainable mobility, energy poverty and much more.

For Municipality of Guimarães, the participation in the EU's mission 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 mission allows the further development of innovative policies and projects that accommodate clean mobility, energy efficiency, renewable energy, waste management, circular economy, and green urban planning, as well as the support of a large community of experts and the opportunity to network with other cities facing the same challenges.

For the Mayor of Guimarães [1] "the fact that Guimarães is one of the three Portuguese cities selected (...) is a clear indicator that the path of environmental sustainability taken in 2014 was a clear vision that the cities of the future cannot ignore the challenges that climate change represents for sustainable development and the quality of life that goes with it".

The Municipality of Guimarães through the Pilot Cities Programme, a part of EU mission 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030, developed the District C - A zero Carbon Commitment. It consists of an integrated approach to energy, mobility, waste, and land use, focused on behavioural change, social innovation, culture, policy, green technologies, sustainable finance and new business models. All actions to be developed rely on the strong involvement of citizens, local actors, and other stakeholders, as well as innovative communication strategies and dissemination activities and the promotion of financing models.

The Municipality of Guimarães was one of the 25 applications selected from a total of 159, being the only Portuguese municipality selected. This recognition of Guimarães' strategy and pioneering spirit in decarbonisation is both a responsibility and a catalyst for the city, as decarbonisation is only possible with the participation of different actors, namely the municipality itself, businesses and industry, the public sector and, above all, the citizens.

In parallel, the Municipality of Guimarães is also a part of the Twinning Programme, a 20-month programme for knowledge sharing and transfer of good practices between Twin Cities, and the cities that were selected to join the NetZeroCities' Pilot Cities Programme. Guimarães is one of the cities that will be paired with one (or more) twin cities, and will participate in various learning activities, such as personalised online meetings, workshops, and field visits, in order to understand each other's challenges and discover joint solutions.

Figure 1 Guimarães' Climate Pact.

The Municipality of Guimarães has launched the Guimarães' Climate Pact as a first step towards the climate neutrality goal with the intention to bring alongside stakeholders that are aligned with Guimarães mission and want to be a part of the change. It is important to note that signing the Guimarães' Climate Pact is voluntary and non-binding. The pact signing does not automatically mean that stakeholders must also sign the Climate City Contract (CCC). The municipality aims to involve and work with the various stakeholders and citizens to deploy strategies and goals that can be aligned with the vision of Guimarães and poured on the CCC. Finally, it should be noted that the Climate City Contract is a living instrument that allows the municipality to revise the documents, update them and involve more stakeholders as the mission evolves.

Finally, the 2030 Governance Ecosystem (published as a scientific paper) shows how enabling connection between city's various stakeholders and the community is critical to accelerate the way to climate neutrality.

Guimarães Municipality Governance system is also based on promoting citizen participation and has of top priority the inclusion of citizens assemblies to promote sustainable development and building the city for the future. This idea of involving citizens in urban planning and transformation is a major strategy to promote a just transition towards a climate resilient city. Citizen engagement strategies (including children and young people) are driven by discussions and actions related to Climate and the Environment in the context of urban planning, policy-making, and collective action. This action started in 2013, where Guimarães made a commitment to transition towards a greener and more sustainable territory, society, and economy that is better prepared for future challenges under the building blocks of the European Green Deal.

As demonstrated in Figure 2, the governance ecosystem and climate policy of Guimarães is a key tool that allows Guimarães to strive on its sustainability journey:

Interdepartmental municipal team that gathers different backgrounds and know-how.
The Municipality of Guimarães as a boarding member of key stakeholders, such as Landscape Laboratory of Guimarães, Instituto Design Guimarães (Guimarães' Design Institute), CVR – Centro para Valorização de Resíduos (Centre For Waste Valorisation), PIEP-Pólo de Inovação em Engenharia de Polímeros, Fibrenamics, Centro de Computação Gráfica.
Relevant stakeholders, as universities and academia (Minho University, UTAD, IPCA and UNU e-GOV).
Municipal own entities, such as Vimágua (water and sanitation company of Guimarães and Vizela), Vitrus (company responsible for waste collection, urban cleaning, and parking management in Guimarães), allowing a close relationship and a faster track upon activities towards the city climate ambitions.

Guimarães includes in the governance ecosystem key players to promote citizen engagement towards a sustainable future. One of the key local stakeholders involved in this task is the Landscape Laboratory - Association for the Promotion of Sustainable Development. It is a research and environmental education institution that originated in 2014 as a result of a relationship among the Guimarães Municipality, the University of Minho, and the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro. It is a private, non-profit association that also includes a consortium of partners from civil society, aiming to contribute to sustainable development. The organization engages in research, development, innovation, and technical and scientific consulting in the fields of Biodiversity, Water Resources, Circular Economy, Green Areas, and Climate, as well as activities related to education and environmental awareness. Focused on public participation the Landscape Laboratory works in the creation of local groups such as the "Brigadas Verdes" (see below) and local projects that promote and engage local transformations towards the transition. In parallel, other stakeholders such as CVR, PIEP, Fibernamics promote knowledge and technological transfer from academia to the economic sector while local universities and academia build knowledge to be applied in the territory.

The 2030 Guimarães Governance Ecosystem is also mentioned in more detail on 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality).

# Main developments:

In 2014, the Municipality of Guimarães elaborated its first Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), with the goal to reduce by  $20\%$  its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. A new SECAP, in 2016, introduced the aim to reduce a  $40\%$  of GHG emissions by 2040. Finally, to be aligned with the European and national targets, the municipality renewed its goal to be carbon-neutral by 2030, since it successfully applied to the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030. Until 2020, the Municipality of Guimarães reduced its emissions by  $20\%$ , compared to the base year of 2008, but there is still room to improve.
The Municipality of Guimarães is also part of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), for which annually  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions are inventoried and reported. In 2022, Guimarães was awarded with the highest classification (A).
In 2017, Municipality of Guimarães joined the Network of Municipalities for Adaptation to Climate Change and created the Local Council for Monitoring Climate Change (a member of the Advisory Council on the Environment and Environmental Sustainability).
The concentrations of the three air pollutants  $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{2}, \mathrm{SO}_{2}, \text{and PM10}\right)$  when combined through the air quality index, CityAir, show that, the Municipality of Guimarães quality indexes are mostly Good and Very Good.

Currently, the municipality of Guimarães has 1377 km of water networks, which represents 98.1% service coverage, in terms of public water supply. In 2022, all analyses performed to the drinking water, complied with the European Directive with a rate of 100%. These outcomes result from implementing a water quality monitoring plan that uses continuous monitoring and a safety plan according to the recommendations of WHO $^{1}$  and IWA $^{2}$ , thus ensuring the protection of public health.

Given the excellent results so far, in 2022 the PAYT (Pay As You Throw) system is already being extended to the city, encompassing 12000 users. Since its implementation in 2016 PAYT system successfully reduced mixed waste to  $172\mathrm{kg}$  per capita/year, increasing to 115 kg per capita/year recycling packaging waste, and reduced  $17\mathrm{kg}$  per capita/year of waste production, in opposition to national projections.
Municipality of Guimarães is committed to protecting and restoring biodiversity, in alignment with the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030. The Local Action Plan for Biodiversity 2030 has facilitated the implementation of biodiversity and habitat monitoring programs that gather scientific information to support natural resource management in both urban and rural environments. In 2022, the  $16.5\mathrm{km}$  cycling network was expanded with an additional  $35\mathrm{km}$  (almost concluded), with  $0.7\mathrm{km}$  currently under construction.
Thanks to the planting of 2000 trees annually, Municipality of Guimarães has an urban tree coverage of 1130.8 ha, representing a percentage of  $18\%$  of tree canopy. In addition, the city plants an autochthonous tree for any new birth and has committed to planting three billion

trees as part of the EU Forest Strategy. Between 2010-2021 increased its green infrastructure by 195.1ha (approximately 20.9%).

The reduction in total emissions per year in Municipality of Guimarães (-23,3% from 2008 to 2017) follows the trend in the country and is in agreement with the international climate policies that Portugal has adopted.
In transport-related per capita CO₂ emissions, there is also a downward trend (-10,6% from 2008 to 2017).
In local authority buildings, the goal was to reduce energy consumption in 30% by 2020. A 10% reduction in energy-related costs has already been achieved in local authority buildings (2016-2018).

## Promoting public participation and citizen engagement:

Based on the will to create a sustainable city in the future Guimarães developed an education action plan and several actions that empower citizens knowledge and participation. Citizen engagement has been and will be key towards a sustainable and climatically neutral future in Guimarães. Some initiatives mentioned below demonstrate the effort to include different levels of participation across several major subjects addressing climate transition.

## Environmental and sustainability education:

The PEGADAS Programme: is promoted by the Landscape Laboratory and the Guimarães City Council in collaboration with a set of local, national, and European partners. It is based on the sustainable development strategy for the municipality and the promotion of environmentally friendly and inclusive policies. This is a comprehensive program dedicated to environmental education, serving as a fundamental factor in promoting community practices based on ecologically sustainable principles, aiming to initiate a paradigm shift in people's behavior and way of life. The program targets mainly educational activities for the 98 schools in the territory covering over 20,000 students, although the program by itself is open to all age classes and private and public organizations. Around 55% of the environmental and sustainability program is directed to children (under 12), 40.8% to youth (under 18). More than 500 hundred activities are performed per year.
Eco Afonsinho: is an electronic game developed to help children to test hot to generate direct and constructive effects on the city's environment. This immersive game aims to make the children of Guimarães active agents of ecological change.

## Democracy and just transition:

Eco Parliament: is the flagship activity of the PEGADAS program that promotes local youth debate on sustainable development. Teams of young participants identify environmental challenges and propose sustainable solutions through debate sessions. Eco Parliament is accompanied by various technical visits to the school environment to monitor progress. More than 200 students involved every year.
Brigadas Verdes: are volunteer groups dedicated to activities related to environmental preservation and promoting sustainability, usually in their residential parish. These brigades can perform various tasks, such as cleaning natural areas, tree planting, promoting proper waste management, conserving biodiversity, and other environmentally related activities. The main goal is to promote environmental awareness. There are 38 Brigadas Verdes across 48 parishes in the territory that were involved in 150 Actions from 2016 to 2022.
Mobility

Educabá: is an activity aimed at promoting the use of mechanical and electric bicycles as an alternative mode of transportation in the city. More than 9,354 citizens were already involved including students and general public at public events.
Metro Minuto: is an urban strategy to promote planetary health, individual health, and instill a new lifestyle. MetroMinuto's main focus is to reduce excessive car traffic in city centers and encourage walking, thereby improving air quality in the city and, consequently, the quality of life.

## Tourism

GreenTour: was a European project under the scope of Circular Economy and Sustainable Tourism that aimed to improve the management of natural and cultural heritage through the implementation of networks and joint experimentation, developing methodologies and actions to promote the circular economy in the tourism sector.

## Climate change

E-missão 0: aims to raise awareness of the urgency of adapting to climate change, as we face profound damages and losses as temperatures rise and impacts intensify. It aims to involve students in a collaborative, dynamic, and participatory analysis towards climate neutral actions. So far involved 32 actions and around 150 participants.

## Air and noise quality

Limp.Ar: is a CitiMeasure initiative, aimed to promote the improvement of air quality and noise in Urban Centre, encouraging implementation of urban forest and raise awareness of the commuting impact. Integrate education, training and awareness actions for citizens, participatory co-creation actions, interventions in urban spaces. The project includes education, capacity-building, and awareness-raising actions for citizens, participatory co-creation activities, interventions in urban spaces, and air and noise quality assessment actions in various contexts. Around 14 different actions were performed with around 205 participants.

## Biodiversity and Green areas

Miyawaki Forest: involved the creation of a new Urban Forest covering an area of approximately 800 m² that aimed to connect greenways. It was created with the help of the Guimarães community, especially students. Several dozen students from high schools, along with members of the "Brigadas verdes", local private companies' employees, and anonymous citizens, assisted in the action. In total, 300 trees and 700 shrubs of 12 different species were planted.
Biodiversity Patrollers: the goal is to engage the entire community, especially the school community, in monitoring the fauna and flora of the municipality through training actions that allow for the correct recording of different species, using a field support guide and the free Biodiversity Go! app provided by the Landscape Laboratory. It involved around 10 actions and more than 300 participants.
Guimarães + Forest: aims to raise awareness of native forests and the importance of their preservation, with a focus on thematic areas such as nature, biodiversity, green spaces, air quality, noise, climate change, landscape, and agroforestry techniques, as well as areas related to civic rights for the protection and creation of a more diverse, healthy, and harmonious natural environment. Under the scope of this project more than 10000 trees were planted in the territory including general public, schools and the private sector.

# Engagement with global and European initiatives:

Circular PSP: Guimarães was selected as a pilot city for the Circular Cities and Regions Initiative. Under the framework of the Governance Ecosystem Guimarães 2030, which links the City Hall, academia, citizens and private business, a task force was set to integrate three domains: innovation, waste and resources, citizens' awareness and mobilisation. It is Horizon Europe that aims to improve the access to innovative circular solutions, to facilitate investment and innovation through better use of available public budgets, innovative financing schemes and sourcing the local potential.

Let's Go Circular and BiodiverCity: As part of the URBACT, Municipality of Guimarães intends to develop a digital platform, or APP, to test the viability of a virtual solution to promote sustainable urban development. The project develops with the interaction between various areas of municipal intervention, namely between the Municipal Divisions of Social Action, Environmental and Economic Development and Intelligent and Information System, in 2023 Municipality of Guimarães has been selected to two Action Planning Networks: Let's Go Circular and BiodiverCity.

DISTENDER: H2020 project aims to achieve a better understanding on the links between climate change impacts and risks, mitigation, and adaptation options. It will deliver an integrated analysis of climate change impacts and risks, mitigation pathways and adaptation strategies, into a single framework helping understand and quantify their interactions. The outputs will provide further assistance in decision making towards climate neutrality. The Municipality of Guimarães is a case study where the developments of the project are to be tested in.

EUCF: grant supports the Municipality of Guimarães to create an investment concept to finance to efficient public lighting, renewable energy communities and mitigation of energy poverty in the region.

Greentour: INTERREG Sudoe project - aims to improve natural and cultural heritage management methods through the implementation of networks and joint experimentation, developing methodologies and actions to promote the circular economy in the tourism sector.

SW-UP Sport for Women in Urban Places: mission to complement the initiatives that are underway all over Europe and that promote women participation in sport and physical activity but will pay special attention to the barriers that women face, namely in the design of more accessible, safe, and friendly urban environments to sports practice.

CCRI Circular Cities Regions Initiative: In 2022, the Municipality of Guimarães joined the Circular Cities and Regions Initiative as a Pilot to inspire cities in their transition to the circular economy. Guimarães is prioritizing the implementation of circular systemic solutions, which includes promoting the Bioeconomy - an area that holds significant importance within their local context. In June 2023, the first roadmap was completed using the CCRI Methodology, providing valuable policy and decision guidance to accelerate the development and implementation of Circular Systemic Solutions at the local level.

# Relevant processes:

Guimarães Sustainable Mobility Plan: focus on soft modes, public transport, construction and qualification of intermodals, the integration of ticketing and road safety to comply with the environmental goals for reducing CO₂ emissions. The plan also focused on removal of transport infrastructure intrusive to the urban environment and a particular focus on policies beyond transport, such as health and urban regeneration. So far, attending to the baseline of 2008, the Municipality of Guimarães reduced 15% of emissions in the transportation sector in 2018.

Management Plan of Biowaste Guimarães 2030: It has a time horizon of 2030, integrating a component of the Mission Structure 2030 for Development Sustainable 2030. The plan establishes strategies to expand and optimise biowaste leading to its recovery, either through the implementation of a selective biowaste collection network, either through separation and recycling at source through the implementation of domestic or community composting. The plan foresees that in 2030 100% of the population will have all types of biowaste collection service. In 2023, 35% of the population is expected to be covered by the separate collection of biodegradable municipal waste.

Requalification of social housing buildings: Improvement of energy performance - using thermal insulation, replacement of frames, and installing solar heating equipment and photovoltaic systems.

Improve the public lightning energy efficiency: Upgrade luminaires to LEDs. 66% replaced by 2023. Reduction in GHG emissions - 30-40% per unit. Since 2017 - 12.2% less energy consumption in 2018.

European Green Capital Award: in 2017 Guimarães applied for this award. In 2023, Guimarães applied again to be the European Green Capital in 2025.

The Municipality of Guimarães also has a whole series of projects that demonstrate the city's commitment to climate action in the different dimensions of climate neutrality, avoiding a carbon tunnel vision, helping Municipality of Guimarães to move towards a sustainable and just transition. The actions and initiatives are detailed in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.

Participation in the EU City Mission is an opportunity to continue and expand the city's work to date. Participating in the mission is a great opportunity for Municipality of Guimarães to act as a beacon in Portugal, to inspire other cities (at national and European level) to follow the city's steps and be inspired by the best practices, as well as to network with like-minded cities across Europe.

It also represents an opportunity to create national visibility on the climate change action, and the eventual possibility of national investment and funding for the planned actions.

Finally, it also allows the involvement of different stakeholders, from the public to the private sector, associations, NGOs, ENGOs, schools and academia, national and regional government actors, in the commitment to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, through a comprehensive participation and co-design process.

In summary, Municipality of Guimarães expects that the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" can support the city to strengthen its ambitions and strategic priorities to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 and fulfil the commitment to climate neutrality.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

# Municipality of Guimarães goal: climate neutrality by 2030

As a signatory of the Aalborg Commitments, the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, the Basque Declaration, the Paris Agreement and Local Agenda21, and as a member of the Network of Municipalities for Climate Change, the Municipality of Guimarães is committed, among other goals, to becoming a more than "green municipality". The municipality has also applied to be one of the 112 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 and has been selected with the official support of the mayor to achieve the climate neutrality targets for 2030. The mayor has also made public statements to endorse his support for this goal.

According to the Cities Mission Expression of Interest (EoI), the Municipality of Guimarães is strengthening its goal of climate neutrality by 2030. The mayor has signed the Expression of Interest as a representative of the municipality to express the strong commitment to the goal of carbon neutrality by 2030, as defined in the mission.

The Municipality of Guimarães wants to continue working on its goals, so the CCC (Climate City Contract) refers to a climate neutrality target for the whole municipality in 2030, which is in line with the EoI target. The Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) has been revised to align it with the 2030 climate neutrality target, as in the 2014 version of the SECAP Guimarães had committed to reduce its carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 (referring to 2008 as the baseline year).

As far as exclusion sectors are concerned, GHG emissions are quantified in CO₂ equivalents (CO₂, CH₄ and NO₂), according to the Expression of Interest of the Mission for Climate Neutral and Smart Cities. The lack of other GHG quantifications is due to the Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) sector. It is pointed out that it is difficult to collect data on IPUU, due to the lack of experts and technicians, disclosure information from industry, and the lack of inventories.

Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) is another sector for which Guimarães did not provide data yet. However, the data is currently being analysed and the city hopes to be able to report it soon.

As mentioned above, the 2030 climate neutrality target is supported by the mayor and other relevant stakeholders. It is worth noting that the transport sector and industry are the largest sources of emissions (2019), so the municipality wants to include these sectors because of their importance to the climate neutrality pathway.

However, the Municipality of Guimarães is aware that a diverse group of stakeholders, including the private and public sectors, organisations, associations, and citizens, is an essential factor to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2030.

In this sense, the Municipality of Guimarães will involve different groups of stakeholders, which will be described in more detail in the 2030 Climate Action Plan, as it is a "living document" that the municipality intends to improve over time and expand the circle of signatories and allies.

Finally, regarding co-benefits, Municipality of Guimarães continues to work on a holistic approach to the transition to sustainability. There are four main categories where co-benefits are most important: economic, social, public health and environmental.

Regarding the economic aspect, job creation, operating cost reductions revenue generation through more ambitious policies are examples of expected benefits. Regarding the social dimension, it is expected that the implementation of the measures in the portfolio, revised to meet the 2030 climate neutrality target, will lead to improvements in the sense of democracy and well-being, energy poverty, mobility, and access, as well as social inclusion, and improved health. In the area of public health, improvements in air quality and mental well-being are expected.

Finally, the co-benefits related to the environmental dimension are climate change resilience, reduction of dependence on fossil fuels and external sourced, green space improvement, water and soil quality, and biodiversity and ecosystem services.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

## Guimarães' strategic priorities

Grounded on the available data (2019), the Municipality of Guimarães has analysed the state of current affairs and identified three key priorities sectors that needs to be urgently addressed to achieve 2030 climate neutrality goal: mobility and transports; industry and the built environment.

This first systemic priority related to transport will focus on electric mobility, assuming the conversion from fossil combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles across the private, municipal, and public vehicle sectors. Linked to this, there are other actions that will be explored in more detail as part of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan. These include macro-mobility solutions such as the introduction of BRT (Bus Rapid Transit), the conversion of 32 diesel buses to electric buses by the Guimabus company, and the possibility of refuelling waste collection vehicles with biogas/biomethane produced by an eventual installation of an anaerobic digestion station.

Regarding the second systemic priority, even though the Municipality of Guimarães is not directly responsible for the emissions from the industry sector, these emissions represent a significant part of the emissions in Guimarães. As the Climate City Contract (CCC) aims to involve as many different stakeholders as possible to join and engage with the vision of Guimarães, the inclusion of industry is an important step for the municipality, due to its impact on the region's emissions.

The Municipality of Guimarães intends to continue and strengthen the relationships of collaboration with the industrial sector, since a climate successful plan depends on how the industry and the municipality can work together to stimulate a dynamic, creative, and sustainable growth. It is important to mention that a set of specific actions is present in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, in order to ensure a stronger involvement of this key stakeholder.

The introduction of green hydrogen in industry as a substitute for natural gas would reduce emissions. In addition to this action, the electrification of industrial processes (to switch from natural gas to renewable energy sources) is a way to improve the carbon footprint of Guimarães' industry, accompanied by energy efficiency.

The third systemic strategic priority mentioned relates to emissions generated by energy consumption in buildings. To address this problem, the Municipality of Guimarães intends to increase the share of energy from renewable sources in all sectors and areas, e.g., households, businesses, institutions, and industry, and explore the retrofit of buildings according to the highest building renovation standards.

These significant changes are the starting point for the systemic change needed in the municipality to move closer to climate neutrality by 2030. It is possible to infer on the annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan that industry, transport, and buildings are the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in Guimarães. In this sense, it is expected that the upcoming changes will affect all the mentioned sectors and will have a significant impact.

However, it is worth mentioning that these measures alone will not bring the Municipality of Guimarães close to its neutrality target. The previously mentioned actions need to be complemented with other medium-sized measures in the portfolio (see Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan). These types of measures are very effective in combination,
Guimarães 2030

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

address emissions that are not covered by the three main measures mentioned above, and include sectors other than industry, transport, and buildings.

With the proposed systemic strategic priorities, the municipality aims to set ambitious targets that will bring real, measurable change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Although these actions appear ambitious when combined with the other actions identified in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, they are well planned and thought out, and ensure that Guimarães is committed to achieving climate neutrality, but on a path that is feasible and sustainable for the municipality and the involved stakeholders.

Another important piece of the puzzle on the road to climate neutrality is stakeholder engagement. The municipality is aware that it is impossible to successfully complete this journey alone. Therefore, during the co-creation process of the Climate City Contract, Guimarães brought together all kinds of stakeholders, from universities and colleges, associations, and organisations, NGOs, businesses, and industries to citizens.

Guimarães has carried out several activities during the development of the CCC, endure on several activities aimed to raise awareness of the city's carbon neutrality and to engage stakeholders along the way. To name a few of the activities carried out by the municipality of Guimarães:

Formal presentation of the Guimarães' Climate Pact on 5th of June. Consisted of the celebration of the signatory of the pact by the stakeholders and the Mayor of Guimarães.
Session focused on the industry and companies with the goal to present the Guimarães' Climate Pact and Climate City Contract initiative. It was an important moment to start to involve these stakeholders on the Guimarães 2030 climate neutrality vision.
First presentation of the Guimarães' Climate Pact [2] to various stakeholders on 22nd of May – with the aim to present the vision of Guimarães on the pathway towards climate neutrality by 2030, identify the possible front-runners, and create the space for stakeholders to express their interest to work alongside Guimarães.
Rapid Mass Engagement workshop sections Energy on 22nd of June; Mobility on 7th of July; Circular Economy on 20th of July, and to community in scheduling

A current statement by the municipality, is that none of these changes can have a real and practical impact unless the community and stakeholders are involved or empowered to embrace this path together with Guimarães.

With this in mind, the Municipality of Guimarães has developed information sessions, workshops and events to promote Guimarães' goal of becoming climate neutral by 2030. Given the decades of close collaboration with the community, universities, associations, and other stakeholders, the municipality is able to raise awareness of this challenge in a coherent and meaningful way. As part of this plan Guimarães aims to foster citizen engagement to co-create an inclusive methodological framework that enhances the democratic participation of citizens in environmental policy making and urban transformation. This framework aims to foster social cohesion (across gender, age, background, and cultures) in the collaborative identification, recognition and planning of climate-adaptive and climate-change-mitigating public spaces through co-creation and co-design actions with support of participatory democracy with an emphasis on just transition.

Finally, having the community and relevant stakeholders on Guimarães' side is a key factor in involving all actors in the green and social change that the Municipality of Guimarães is collectively striving for.

For a more detailed explanation of the three systemic priorities, as well as the other planned actions, the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan examines all the interventions and how the Municipality of Guimarães intends to implement them.

# 4 Principles and process

## Guimarães climate neutrality principles

Municipality of Guimarães intends to involve as many stakeholders as possible within the framework of the Climate City Contract and enable co-creation, in order to join forces to work towards the main goal - climate neutrality in 2030.

One of the key principles of the CCC is that decision-makers (collectively and individually) take responsibility for their actions. These decisions are reported, explained and open to discussion, which also ensures the dimension of transparency.

Regarding transparency, Municipality of Guimarães will publicly inform about the decisions to redesign and create actions, implementation measures and results to ensure that all citizens and stakeholders are informed and can contribute to the goal of climate neutrality 2030.

Regarding the diversity of participants, representativeness must allow all citizens to participate in the actions (age, gender, education, place of residence, socio-economic status). Inclusion should also be ensured so that all interested people can participate without restrictions. Finally, ensuring that any form of discrimination and harassment is avoided through the democratic deliberative process and that all participants can freely and safely take part in the implementation of individual and collective actions.

The process will involve various stakeholders, such as transport operators, waste management actors, universities and schools, national actors, and the industrial sector. As the transport and mobility sector, as well as industry, are the main contributors to emissions in Guimarães, the city has made sure to include them in the assessment of measures to close the existing gap between what has already been done and what still needs to be done to achieve climate neutrality in 2030. This took the form of technical meetings with sector leaders/representatives and dynamic sessions (some of which have already taken place and others are planned) where innovative approaches can be developed to inspire systemic and demand-driven actions to close the above-mentioned gap.

Guimarães has a long tradition of involving citizens in the democratic process of co-designing the city they want to live in. Based on scientific literature and research, climate goals can be achieved through the active participation of citizens, working with local government, and co-creating systemic change, rather than through technological and policy measures alone. In this sense, the Municipality of Guimarães is empowering its municipality to meet the 2030 Climate Neutrality Agenda by creating points of contact between citizens and local government actors, fostering a sense of belonging and responsibility for the climate.

The monitoring and joint learning components are essential to ensure that the actions in the portfolio are on track, although this is a complex task due to the different actors involved and some of the actions focus on individuals and companies, making monitoring difficult. In addition, the civic participation measures should also include underrepresented groups and take into account age, gender, ethnicity, religious beliefs and minorities.

In terms of joint learning, it's a way to share knowledge on important issues between stakeholders and the community. It's also a way to discuss how the CCC process is working, learn lessons from its implementation and move forward in developing and improving policies to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

Finally, the NZC Climate Transition Map helps to line the process phases of the CCC: Build a Strong Mandate:

To ensure a consistent CCC process, the transition team met weekly to coordinate work, distribute tasks and discuss next steps and actions.

Each participating city department and partner is responsible for coordinating and implementing the activities in his/her area of responsibility: Office of Energy Efficiency, Department of Smart Systems and IT, Department of Urban Services, Department of Mobility and Transport, Department of Economic Development, Department of Green Spaces. Each individual department is embedded in the sustainable transformation of Guimarães and contributes accordingly to its specifications.

Through the "Guimarães Branding" initiative, promoted by the Economic Development Department, the Municipality of Guimarães maintains a close relationship with companies that respect social, inclusive, and sustainable commitments. Regarding citizens, another important stakeholder group, the dynamic between the municipality and its citizens was previously demonstrated, reflecting Guimarães' commitment to the fight against climate change.

The Municipality of Guimarães is perfectly aligned with all the European regulation, such as the EU Green Deal, RePower-EU, Fit for 55, as well as with the national pathway of carbon neutrality: National Climate Law (Law n. 98/2021), which targets neutrality by 2050. Guimarães has an even tighter timeline, as neutrality is to be reach until 2030; and the National Low Carbon Roadmap and National Energy and Climate Plan - the proposed actions are aligned with the vision defined in these strategies, as they are expected to support the 2050 national targets for emission reduction, renewable energy, energy efficiency and security through the envisaged behavioural change. By adhering to the national decarbonisation and sustainability targets, a relationship of mutual understanding has been created between the municipality and national stakeholders. And also, between the EU actors, as Guimarães has a long experience of participation in different projects and initiatives of the European Commission (see chapter 1 of this document).

## 2. Co-design a Portfolio:

By accessing the current actions for decarbonisation and climate neutrality of Guimarães, it was possible to identify the actions that are most relevant for emission reduction and revitalisation them as needed (e.g., by introducing a wider scope, a more ambitious target or involving more actors), as well as develop new actions to complement the current ones. This process has already started and will be revised as the actions are monitored and feedback is received from the different actors involved.

There are different approaches depending on the stakeholder group. For citizens, through democratic and participatory processes, such as a digital platform or citizens' meetings. For business, hearings and meetings provide a focal point to build on interventions based on mutual feedback and expectations of what needs to be developed and created. As for other stakeholders such as organisations, associations and universities, a public hearing and questionnaires (online and/or offline) are examples of how Guimarães engages with these groups.

## 3. Take Action:

As a result of the CCC, the following measures are to be implemented (some of them can be adapted to the measures already underway in Guimarães, for more details see the Action Plan – Part B).

## 4. Learn &amp; Reflect:

In terms of the monitoring process, metrics and processes will be used to measure progress in closing the existing gap, within the municipality's capacity, as some of the reporting indicators (from the industry side, it would be an indirect assessment, as Guimarães doesn't directly control their monitoring and reporting). Guimarães will monitor the level of engagement of citizens, organisations, academia, and other stakeholders; track engagement in actions against the criteria and defined scope; set targets; assign responsibility and

accountability; track and analyse results; report on results and present new initiatives; review the metrics regularly.

The CCC will be revised as new stakeholders join the contract and periodically (once or twice a year as needed) as Guimarães evolves on its path to 2030 carbon neutrality.

Make it a New Normal:

As new approaches and innovations emerge, the municipality consults the key stakeholders involved in the CCC to share how best to integrate them into the CCC to keep it up to date, as it's a "living document". The municipality informs the stakeholders involved in the CCC and the public about the new interactions (e.g., through a newsletter, a digital platform or an online/offline session).
