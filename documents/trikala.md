# Summary

Within the framework of the Horizon Europe 2021-2027 research and innovation program, the European Missions (EU Missions) were established, aiming to address some of the major challenges currently faced by the EU. Among these missions is the Cities Mission, which aims to create 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030. These cities will serve as research and innovation hubs and will act as examples to be emulated by the rest of the EU. The city of Trikala has also taken part in this mission and the Climate City Contract is drawn up to achieve the goals of climate neutrality.

The Action plan is a very important and integral part of the Climate City Contract that Trikala has signed to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. Specifically, is a comprehensive strategic plan developed to confront the challenge of climate change, addressing the urgent issue of GHG emissions and guiding towards a climate-neutral future. To create it, first of all, the data required for the inventory of pollutants was collected. The initial step in the development of the climate contract involves the inventory of GHG emissions. An inventory estimates the quantity of GHG emissions produced by activities taking place within the city boundaries. Emissions are calculated for each activity over a specific timeframe, referred to as the reporting year. Once the inventory of pollutants was completed, the drafting of the Action plan began. Activities taking place within a city can generate GHG emissions that occur either within or outside the city boundaries. The emissions are categorised into three categories based on the location where they occur: Scope 1 emissions, Scope 2 emissions, and Scope 3 emissions.

Essentially, the Action plan analyses how to address the gap between the City's current baseline GHG inventory and all existing and planned climate actions and the 2030 climate neutrality goal. The Action Plan is designed to be a dynamic and iterative document, allowing for updates and revisions to be made periodically until 2030.

The Action plan is divided into 3 main parts. First, Part A defines and summarises the current baseline inventory of GHG emissions from the different sectors (Stationary energy (Built environment &amp; Energy system), Mobility &amp; transport, AFOLU, IPPU, Waste), the assessment of existing policies and strategies of the country and the European Commission, and the systemic barriers to implementation in the city of Trikala.

Part B is essentially the core of the detailed climate neutrality roadmap by 2030, it describes the proposed and selected action strategies to achieve the climate neutrality goal, the impact pathways that will encounter, the indicators that should be monitored, the indicators that should be evaluated and the learning indicators and, above all, detailing the actions chosen in each of the action areas and then detailing the individual action separately, the way it is proposed to be implemented, the interested parties involved in the action, the competent bodies, etc.

Part C contains guidance on the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan analysing the factors from the perspective of governance, social innovation and financing and considering them as critical conditions for the final realisation of real action. The intervention types are detailed, including the objectives, stakeholders/authorities involved, timing, results and reporting on the impact pathway selected. Finally, a description of the funding need for the implementation of the portfolio of actions and the relative impact is made.

Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# 1. Introduction

The Municipality of Trikala is a pioneering Municipality in Greece. In 2004, Trikala has been labelled as Greece's "1st digital city" and henceforth made significant effort in smart interventions by becoming a testbed for state-of-the-art solutions. That nurtured a culture within the city and its stakeholders around the necessity of digital transformation and further on provided insights for smart, socially responsible, and sustainable growth through advanced technologies, which we believe will help the city proceed toward its 2030 climate neutrality targets.

Trikala has consistently embraced commendable practices and strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing the city's environmental profile, including endeavors such as the Smart City Strategic Plan, the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan, the Local Waste Management Plan, and the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan of the Municipality of Trikala (SUMP). The incorporation of the Action Plan to attain climate neutrality represents a transformative initiative that is anticipated to garner strong support from both citizens and stakeholders. The municipality is poised to wholeheartedly commit to the success of this endeavor, demonstrating the same level of dedication that has contributed to the success of previous projects. Trikala's motivation and pledge to climate actions is further presented in the Commitments document.

The government and the Municipality of Trikala must take the initiative in implementing policies and programs to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change and provide support and resources. The Environmental Development Company of Western Thessaly (PADYTH SA), which is the inter-municipal body for Recycling &amp; Waste Management, plays an important role. In the energy sector, an equally important actor is -HEDNO S.A. (Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network Operator S.A.) which is involved in the distribution of electricity throughout the country. The work of the Technical Chamber of Greece (TEE) is extremely important and plays a major role in the implementation of the actions, as do universities, scientific bodies in general and research institutes, which must provide expertise on best practices and contribute to the development of innovative solutions.

Trikala city is committed to ensuring that the objectives and actions of Climate City Contract (CCC) are supported by a robust mandate, derived from co-creation with a diverse range of stakeholders. The city recognizes the importance of engaging with various entities, including public bodies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private actors, universities, and stakeholders at both regional and national levels.

One key mechanism through which the CCC seeks to involve stakeholders is through ad-hoc consultations. These consultations are designed to gather insights, feedback, and perspectives from a wide array of participants, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation.

In this context and during the first elaboration of the CCC, Trikala created a network of stakeholders from different sectors to co-create their strategy. In the energy sector, the University of Western Macedonia provided their expertise. In the transport sector, the contribution of the Institute of Communication and Computer Systems (ICCS) was significant, while in waste and circular economy the guidance from the Environmental Development Agency of Western Thessaly SA (PADYTH SA) was important. Finally, all the actions and especially the actions of the built environment were co-created with the cooperation of various services of the Municipality. Trikala created a first stakeholder transition team with
Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

its closest partners in order to create the CCC. The team held frequent consultations on the creation and development of the CCC, with each stakeholder adding expertise in their field. The city aims to expand its stakeholder network and simplify the co-creation processes using digital technology and platforms.

On the same note, citizen engagement plays a crucial role in the entire plan, in order for community empowerment and inclusion to be possible. The shift towards a governance model centered on citizens is a fundamental and systemic priority for Trikala, representing a significant change in the city's approach to civic engagement and public administration. This model prioritizes the needs, preferences, and aspirations of residents in decision-making processes, promoting a more inclusive and participatory style of governance. Trikala envisions a city where citizens actively contribute to shaping policies, programs, and urban development initiatives, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and community ownership. By adopting this citizen-centric model, Trikala aims to establish a transparent and accountable governance structure that not only addresses the diverse needs of its population but also nurtures a culture of trust and collaboration between local authorities and residents.

The engagement of both citizens and stakeholders is a cornerstone in directing Trikala's transition toward climate neutrality. The city is committed to ensuring that its entire community is well-informed about climate initiatives and actively participates in shaping and implementing them. Trikala plans to actively engage citizens and stakeholders through initiatives such as regular public consultations and workshops, where the city can host citizen gatherings focused on specific aspects of the CCC, seeking valuable insights and local expertise. Additionally, educational campaigns will be implemented to instill a culture of environmental responsibility among citizens and various stakeholders. These campaigns may encompass workshops, seminars, and awareness programs, aiming to educate the public on topics like climate neutrality, sustainability, and the significance of collaborative efforts among diverse stakeholders.

So far, within the framework of citizen engagement, several workshops were organized, attended by representatives of the stakeholders who were invited. Some participants in the workshops included representatives from the Municipality, PADYTH SA, various associations (medical association, commercial association, youth association), representatives from banks, representatives from the Technical Chamber of Greece (TEE), and additionally, some citizens who were interested in the initiative and responded to the open invitation. The municipality also conducted workshops in schools, including 1.200 students. Trikala has also conducted consultations and surveys in the form of a digital questionnaire, allowing citizens to participate and evaluate the significance of actions in each sector, as well as to express their thoughts, ideas, or concerns. A comprehensive overview of the workshops and all citizen engagement actions can be found in Annex 1, which includes both photos and descriptions for reference.

The city of Trikala aimed to implement a more intensive program of actions regarding citizen participation. However, due to natural disasters that occurred and affected the region, as well as the preceding municipal elections, the actions related to citizen engagement that were planned were ultimately postponed.

Nevertheless, the city plans to intensify citizen engagement in the coming years. Through the implementation of various practices, it aims to arrive at the optimal model of citizen engagement concerning the frequency of actions and the manner in which they should take place. Citizen engagement models and actions that the city of Trikala is going to implement are:

Public consultations and workshops: These gatherings provide opportunities for citizens, businesses, and organizations to express their concerns and ideas related to the city's climate strategy. As an example, the city may organize regular town hall meetings that focus on specific aspects of the CCC, aiming to gather valuable insights and local knowledge.
Co-creation of climate policies: This initiative ensures that the measures implemented align with local needs. Trikala will establish a platform for citizen participation, where individuals or organizations can collaborate and communicate to create and refine climate policies. This approach fosters a sense of commitment among participants.
Educational campaigns: Establishing a culture of environmental responsibility begins with the launch of educational campaigns targeting both citizens and stakeholders. These campaigns may encompass workshops, seminars, and awareness programs designed to educate the public about climate neutrality, sustainability, and the significance of collaboration among different stakeholders.
Feedback through digital platforms: In addition to the citizen participation platform, Trikala may utilize other channels such as social media and online forums to maintain constant and direct communication with the community.
Incentive programs: Trikala may introduce programs aimed at encouraging active participation in climate actions by citizens and businesses. This could involve recognition for sustainable practices, rewards for energy-efficient or zero-waste buildings, or funding for innovative climate projects.

The actions included in the Action Plan are categorised in six main sectors, which are Energy systems, Mobility &amp; Transport, Waste &amp; Circular economy, Built environment, Green infrastructure &amp; Nature-based solutions and Smart city actions. Some of the actions that are included in the city's climate portfolio and are going to be further explained later on are:

Electrification of cars, motorcycles and buses
Shift to public and non-motorised transport (Behavioural shift to public transport, walking and cycling, Maas, Enhancement of e-powered micro mobility, Development of DRT)
Commercial and residential buildings electrification
Decarbonising electricity generation (Development of a joined and smart RES management system, Photovoltaics, Virtual power plants)

Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Optimised logistics and electrification of trucks (Electrification of trucks, Fleet management, Improvement of logistics and urban freight transport, Eco-driving)
Building renovations
Integrated energy systems

Following the submission of the Climate City Contract, the city's primary objective is to establish a robust task force within the Municipal authority, the Trikala Climate Team. This team will play a pivotal role in facilitating the implementation of the Action Plan, overseeing its general progress, and monitoring and evaluating the implementation process.

As a next step, the Municipality aspires to establish a Climate Neutrality Hub, which will serve as the focal point for all climate neutrality actions. Managed by the Trikala Climate Team, this hub will be enriched with more experts in each domain of intervention. Initially, the hub will primarily focus on decarbonizing the stationary energy sector in the city. It will offer services such as a One-Stop shop for energy renovations, responsible for informing, educating, and facilitating the community in energy efficiency measures, a Greenhouse Gas Measurement Platform providing real-time data on GHG emissions in the city, and a Climate Neutrality Observatory serving as the main monitoring mechanism to measure the city's progress during the implementation of specific projects outlined in the Action Plan. The proposal for such a structure represents an organizational intervention outlined in Part C.

As evident in Table A-1.4a, the GHG inventory of Trikala is based on the year 2019, amounting to a total of 467,7 kt CO2e. The GHG inventory includes all five crucial emission sectors, as it is shown, and the gases that are accounted are carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O) and fluorinated gases (IPPU). During the compilation of the GHG inventory, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were documented in metric tonnes and categorized by gas types (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, Fluorinated gases) as well as by their equivalent in CO₂ (CO₂e). The determination of CO₂ equivalent involves multiplying each gas emission by its respective global warming potential (GWP100). Specifically, the GWP coefficients utilized were derived from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. So carbon dioxide's GWP is 1, methane's is 28 and nitrous oxide's is 265.

The fluorinated gases derive from the use of certain products within the city, like paraffin wax or lubricants. Unfortunately, we were unable to locate specific data regarding the utilization of such products within the city boundaries. Nonetheless, greenhouse gas emissions stemming from these sources are documented in Greece's national inventory. Our approach to procuring data in the IPPU sector involved scaling down from national to local level. Specifically, for emissions resulting from the usage of lubricants and urea catalyst, we employed the vehicle count for scaling down; for paraffin wax usage, we utilized the population figure; and for solvent and substitute usage for ODS, we relied on the number of buildings. The values derived from the national inventory were directly in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents.

Regarding the transportation sector, only Scope 1 emissions are considered. Official data indicates that until 2019, there were no electric or hybrid vehicles detected in Trikala. We attribute this primarily to the absence of adequate charging infrastructure for such vehicles. It's worth noting that Trikala, being a relatively small town, lacks a metro or tram system. However, within the city limits, there is a 4.8 km railway section that forms part of the national railway network. The trains operating on this line are still diesel-powered, hence their emissions are categorized as Scope 1. Nevertheless, it's important to acknowledge that the frequency of services is relatively low, with annual emissions estimated to be around 3 tn CO₂e.

As for the waste sector, as shown in the table, all emissions are included in Scope 3. All waste management facilities are located outside the city boundaries, as according to national environmental legislation they are required to have a certain distance from settlements. Thus it follows that there is no waste being treated/managed within the city boundaries.

For the purpose of formulating the Action Plan, a Business As Usual (BAU) approach for the year 2030 was employed. The BAU projection takes into account population growth and the natural replacement of various equipment (such as cars, buses, trucks, heating systems, etc.) over the specified period.

Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

In the context of urban development, population growth typically results in increased carbon emissions. However, this effect is mitigated to a significant extent by the ongoing replacement of older fossil fuel-based equipment with newer, more energy-efficient counterparts. This dynamic is essential for understanding the overall impact of emissions in a growing city.

It is noteworthy that Trikala has experienced a negative population growth trend, with a decrease of 6.9% during the decade from 2011 to 2021. This demographic shift is a crucial factor in the calculation of the BAU scenario for the year 2030. The Economic Model was utilized for this calculation, providing a comprehensive analysis of the city's future trajectory.

According to the BAU 2030 approach, GHG emissions in the city would amount to 463 kt CO₂e. In other words, if the city were to implement no climate action measures, its emissions would exhibit a slight decrease. This reduction is attributed to both internal and external factors, such as demographic issues. Therefore, the anticipated emissions level represents a baseline scenario, highlighting the potential impact of inaction on climate mitigation in the absence of targeted measures.

The Municipality of Trikala had an inventory for 2019 which was used at the Expression of Interest (EoI) document. That inventory was compiled using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories standard and it accounted GHG emissions for the whole municipality's administrative boundaries. It covered the sectors of Stationary Energy, Transportation and Waste and the gases carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄).

According to the Mission's Info Kit for Cities, the sectors/sources of emissions covered by the target boundary are Scope 1 and Scope 2 from Stationary Energy, Transportation, Waste (including in this case Scope 3, i.e. at point of disposal/treatment), IPPU and AFOLU. One of the acceptable methodologies for a city's accounting of GHG emissions is the Global Protocol for Community-Scale (GPC) Greenhouse Gas Inventories, which is a global standard for the calculation and reporting of city-wide GHG emissions, consistent with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

The geographic boundary that corresponds to the 2030 climate neutrality target is smaller than the city's administrative boundary, meaning the whole Municipality, and is restricted to the Trikala city boundary. Based on this and the Info Kit's directions, the city of Trikala proceeded to draft a new GHG inventory. The inventory's baseline year is still 2019 and it was selected because it is the year with the most accurate and complete data available. However, this inventory is compiled using the GPC protocol and the Info Kit's directions. In most cases, data quality for activity data is medium to high. Data quality for emission factors is considered low, because the default emission factors from 2006 IPCC Guidelines were used, as they were the only available ones. High data quality on emission factors is detected in grid-supplied electricity and waste.

The latest 2019 GHG Inventory for Trikala city shows that the total emissions (as applicable to the Mission) equal to 467.714,66 tn CO₂e. In addition, there are 165.850 tn CO₂e from the burning of biomass, which are considered biogenic emissions and are not included in emission totals. As it is evident in Table A-1.4a, there is also a small carbon sink located within the city boundary, which is the artificial pine forest of Lofon Kastrou and Ailia, removing 7,26 CO₂e.

Table A-1.1 and Figure 1 show the Energy Use in MWh/year in the Buildings and Transportation sectors. The majority of consumed energy in both sectors is included in Scope 1, meaning it is produced by fossil fuel combustion. The Buildings sector also consumes Scope 2 energy in the form of grid-supplied electricity. Figures 2 and 3 show the distribution of energy use between scopes for the above sectors. In the Waste sector, all of the disposal and treatment activities occur outside the city boundary, therefore there is no use of fuels or energy in Scope 1 and Scope 2 within the city. There is no use of fuels or energy in the IPPU and AFOLU sectors, too.

Figure 4 presents the total GHG emissions per source sector and scope. As it becomes even more obvious with Figures 5, the Stationary Energy sector is responsible for most of the GHG emissions contributing at 84,1%. Up next is the Transport sector with 9,7% while the Waste and IPPU sectors emit less than 10% of the total Trikala's GHG emissions. At the same time, 69,6% of GHG emissions are included in Scope 2, thus they are produced due to grid-supplied electricity consumption. Scope 1 accounts for 24,7% of total GHG emissions. Going back to Table A-1.1 and Figure 1 it can be noted that energy consumption (MWh) in Scope 1 is bigger than in Scope 2. Taking also into consideration the emission factors used from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and national sources, it is clear that the energy mix of electricity generation in Greece leads to considerable

Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

larger amounts of GHG emissions that the territorial combustion of fossil fuels. Last but not least, Scope 3 accounts for 5,7% of total GHG emissions. Scope 3 emissions are produced totally from solid waste disposal and wastewater treatment in plant located outside the city boundary.

The economic crisis that hit Greece, coupled with the escalation in the cost of living, particularly in terms of energy expenses, has had a profound impact on the composition of heating fuels in use. Historically, the prevalent method for heating buildings in Greece involved the utilization of diesel oil. The prevailing setup includes central boilers servicing multiple units, with the associated fuel costs shared among the respective apartments or businesses. This conventional heating model experienced a considerable setback during the financial crisis, as numerous households and businesses suddenly found themselves unable to afford the elevated costs associated with heating through expensive fuels, such as diesel oil.

Consequently, a gradual transition unfolded, with many buildings forsaking oil-based heating in favor of electricity. This shift was motivated by both the comparatively lower cost of electricity and the flexibility offered by domestic heating devices, such as air conditioners and radiators, which can be individually controlled by each household or business in terms of usage timing.

The municipality of Trikala aspires to advance the electrification of energy production, albeit in a manner distinct from the current approach. Key considerations include the fact that the electricity generation mix in Greece has yet to embrace a substantial proportion of renewable energy sources (RES). This reliance on electricity results in elevated greenhouse gas emissions, primarily stemming from the combustion of fossil fuels, notably lignite. Additionally, a significant portion of the buildings in the city dates back to the 1980s and 1990s, characterized by low energy efficiency. Moreover, the presence of outdated and inefficient electrical heating devices further exacerbates energy consumption for residential and commercial establishments. Collectively, these factors contribute to the categorization of a significant portion of emissions within the Stationary Energy and Scope 2 sectors.

Legislation, policies and strategies play a critical role in the green transition and are important tools for combating climate change and achieving climate neutrality. Laws relating to the environment and climate change set various emission reduction targets and establish penalties for violations. Compliance with all these laws is essential for achieving climate targets.

Sectors such as agriculture, energy, transport and others linked to emissions are directly affected by policy decisions and economic incentives that may be adopted by governments. Policies such as the development of and investment in renewable energy technologies, carbon taxes, etc. can help to reduce emissions. Also, to achieve climate goals, there are strategies that promote emission reductions, the use of sustainable materials and better energy efficiency.

The EU has set ambitious targets to promote sustainability and create a sustainable future. The areas covered by these objectives are climate change, environmental protection, the economy, etc. One of the European strategies for achieving climate neutrality is the European Green Deal. The European Green Deal is a package of policy initiatives that aims to put the EU on track towards a green transition, with the ultimate goal of

3
Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

achieving climate neutrality by 2050. It supports the transformation of the EU into a just and prosperous society with a modern and competitive economy. The European Green Deal holds significant importance in the pursuit of climate neutrality by 2050 by establishing key objectives and initiatives as the cornerstone for this ambitious endeavor. The European Green Deal establishes several actions and objectives, which include:

![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)

Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

Firstly, minimizing emissions across various sectors, including industry and transportation and reinforcing the concept of a Circular Economy. Also, providing financial support for the transition to a more sustainable future, developing a resilient and eco-friendly food system through the Farm to Fork strategy and preserving and safeguarding biodiversity.

The Green Deal influences Trikala in many ways, as it places significant emphasis on environmental sustainability, reducing GHG emissions, and adapting to climate change. The initiative promotes the creation of green infrastructure, parks, and recreational areas, offering the residents of Trikala an improved quality of life. It encourages sustainable transportation methods such as the use of bicycles, electric vehicles, and the improvement of transportation infrastructure. The transition to RES and increased energy efficiency in the residential and industrial sectors is also promoted. Additionally, the initiative supports innovation and the development of entrepreneurial ideas that promote green growth. It strengthens public participation in decision-making processes, encouraging active involvement of citizens in decisions affecting their environment. Many of the actions proposed within the framework of the CCC, such as integrating renewable energy sources into the grid, developing a unified and intelligent system for managing renewable energy sources, supporting remote work and online services, promoting a shift in behavior towards using public transport, walking, and cycling (including infrastructure improvements), electrifying cars, motorcycles, and buses, implementing separate collection of various waste streams, investing in green infrastructure like green walls, roofs, and pavements, as well as nature-based solutions, decarbonizing heating generation by transitioning energy sources in buildings from fossil fuels to electricity, and renovating buildings for improved energy efficiency, all align with the principles advocated by the European Green Deal.

Another one is the Covenant of Mayors/ Sustainable Energy Action Plan of Trikala Municipality (2010 - 2020). The Covenant of Mayors places its emphasis on addressing climate change by mitigating its effects and promoting the use of secure, sustainable, and cost-effective energy solutions. The initiative aligns with the European Union's broader endeavors to combat climate change and encourage sustainable energy practices. By enhancing energy efficiency and adopting RES in regions engaged in the Covenant of Mayors, it leads to a decrease in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions, aiming for a  $40\%$  reduction by 2030 compared to the 1990 baseline year. The plan promotes enhancing energy efficiency in the city by making improvements to buildings, transportation, and other infrastructures. It includes initiatives for sustainable urban planning, incorporating green spaces, eco-friendly transportation, and other aspects of urban design. The implementation of the plan involves the participation of the local community, educating and informing citizens about the importance of sustainability and the actions they can take.

The Local Waste Action Plan provides backing for the shift towards a sustainable development framework, outlining specific goals and measures to attain both the Circular Economy and climate neutrality. The objective is to assist European businesses and consumers in transitioning toward a more robust Circular Economy, where resources are employed in a sustainable manner. The suggested measures will support the idea of "closing the loop" for products, promoting increased recycling and reuse, and delivering advantages to both the environment and the economy. The plan supports initiatives to promote the Circular Economy by encouraging recycling and the reuse of resources. Its implementation includes awareness and education programs for citizens, fostering their participation in waste management. Additionally, improvements in infrastructure for the collection, processing, and recycling of waste are foreseen. Among the goals is the promotion of sustainability through practical waste management practices, providing the city with more incentives to create a sustainable urban environment. Regarding the actions concerning
Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

waste management and the circular economy included in the CCC, there is a prediction for the separate collection and sustainable management of various waste streams, a goal of municipal waste prevention (10%) and a goal for reduction in landfill under 10%.

The Circular Economy Action Plan include actions such as: Eco-design: design principles that prioritize product longevity, reusability, and recyclability. Eco-certification: Developing and promoting certification standards for environmentally friendly products and services. Industrial Symbiosis: reduce waste and collaboration between the companies. Tax Incentives: tax breaks or incentives to businesses that adopt Circular Economy practices. Green Public Procurement: Choosing of environmentally sustainable products and services by governments and public institutions. Reuse Programs: Facilitate the reuse of products and materials. Waste Reduction: Measures to reduce waste generation and promote recycling. The Circular Economy Action Plan promotes the general application of circular economy principles, such as designing products with an emphasis on reuse and recycling. It also encourages the creation of green businesses that adhere to circular economy principles and seek to reduce waste. Furthermore, the implementation of awareness and education programs for citizens becomes more accessible, aiming to increase their participation in waste management. This adoption of practices aligns with the proposed actions of the CCC.

The Paris Agreement is an agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), dealing with emission reductions, adaptation and its economic modalities. The overarching goal is to maintain the rise in global temperatures significantly below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels, and to persistently strive to limit it to below 1.5°C to prevent the severe repercussions of climate change. By limiting the temperature rise below two degrees Celsius, GHG emissions are reduced. Also, through the promotion of country programs and adaptations, adaptation to climate change is achieved and national emission reduction targets are submitted. With the Paris Agreement, clear and ambitious goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation to climate change have been established. The Agreement encourages local authorities, including the Municipality of Trikala, to take more intensive actions to achieve climate goals. This policy promotes emission reduction, prompting the Municipality to implement measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the Municipality is developing adaptation plans to protect the local community from the negative impacts of climate change. Various awareness campaigns are also being conducted to inform and sensitize residents.

The National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) is a strategic blueprint that outlines specific targets and a comprehensive plan for addressing climate and energy-related matters, with a focus on achieving particular goals by 2030. The NECP exerts a direct influence on the climate transition by advancing the endeavor to reach climate neutrality through its specified objectives and measures in areas such as GHG emissions and fossil fuel usage. By reducing the utilization of mineral resources and mitigating CO₂ emissions, we ultimately achieve a reduction in GHG emissions. This endeavor entails a concerted effort to minimize the reliance on non-renewable resources and curtail the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The goals of the NECP promoting practices that can be adopted by Trikala, while simultaneously adopting practices to address the adverse effects of climate change. By promoting and implementing all these measures proposed by the NECP, Trikala can actively contribute to the national effort to address climate challenges and more easily secure funding for achieving climate neutrality. It is important to highlight that the latest amendment of the NECP sets the generation of 80% of national electricity from RES until 2030 as a primary target.

The National Climate Law as a continuation of the European Climate Law is the first law that strengthens the targets and refers exclusively to climate independence. The National Climate Law aims to establish a unified structure for enhancing the nation's ability to adapt to climate change and bolster climate resilience. Additionally, it seeks to facilitate the gradual shift toward climate neutrality by 2050, prioritizing environmental sustainability, social equity, and cost-effectiveness. The policies and measures adopted to tackle climate change aim to reduce emissions and increase the capacity of the environment to absorb them. They also seek to ensure legal certainty for investors and citizens and to ensure a smooth transition of the economy and society towards climate neutrality. To achieve the long-term goal of climate neutrality, interim climate targets are set for the years 2030 and 2040 as follows: Reduction of net anthropogenic GHG emissions by at least 55% in 2030 and 80% in 2040 compared to 1990 levels. To achieve the targets, the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) is taken into account. It establishes clear targets and action plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change. It strengthens the commitment of the region to achieve climate neutrality goals and promotes practices that contribute to sustainable development. Furthermore, the law provides guidelines for the development of practices that encourage the circular economy, waste reduction, and the protection of biodiversity. Through the implementation of these measures, Trikala can contribute to the national effort to address climate challenges and enhance its economic and social resilience.

A key pretext of the new NWMP is the transition from the existing management system to an environmentally sustainable model, with the setting of ambitious but realistic targets. These targets must comply with the relevant EU legislation, both for total waste and for important specific waste streams. These targets must comply with the relevant EU legislation, both for total waste and for important specific waste streams. The NWMP mainly concerns the waste sector. Although the waste sector does not contribute significantly to GHG emissions compared to the stationary energy and transport sectors, it is important for Trikala to implement Circular Economy practices and comply with national waste policies. This will help to minimise waste emissions and support their efforts to achieve climate neutrality. By reducing waste and avoiding its diversion from landfill, gas and methane emissions are reduced. Climate neutrality can be achieved through the reduction of waste and its diversion from landfills, effectively lowering emissions from landfills. Transitioning towards a circular economy, where the traditional model of produce-consume-discard is replaced by recycling and reusing, plays a pivotal role. By embracing this circular model, we not only reduce the environmental impact associated with waste but also proactively prevent additional GHG emissions that would arise from adhering to a linear economic model. In this sustainable paradigm, waste management is transformed, emphasizing recycling and conscious consumption choices. By choosing to recycle and reuse materials, we contribute to a substantial decrease in GHG emissions compared to the emissions generated by adhering to a linear economic model. The shift towards a circular economy encourages responsible resource utilization, mitigates environmental degradation, and fosters a more sustainable and eco-conscious society.

Essentially, the NWMP influences Trikala by establishing clear goals and action plans for reducing GHG emissions and adapting to climate change. It strengthens the commitment of the region to achieving climate targets and promotes practices that contribute to sustainable development. Actions concerning waste management and the circular economy, as included in the CCC, focus on the separate collection and sustainable management of various waste streams, and set the objectives of achieving a 10% reduction in municipal waste and reducing landfill usage by less than 10%.

Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

Actions concerning waste management and the circular economy included in the CCC, are for the separate collection and sustainable management of various waste streams, a goal of municipal waste prevention (10%) and a goal for reduction in landfill under 10%. By implementing these measures, Trikala can actively contribute to the national effort to address climate challenges and enhance their economic and social resilience. Through the reduction of waste and the promotion of the circular economy, they contribute to lowering emissions from waste, thus advancing the goal of climate neutrality.

The New National Waste Generation Prevention Strategic Plan also plays a role in advancing the climate transition by establishing goals for organizing and coordinating initiatives aimed at decreasing the production of Waste. Establishing goals within the building sector is instrumental in diminishing emissions associated with stationary energy use, facilitating a smoother trajectory towards achieving climate neutrality. This targeted approach acknowledges the significance of the built environment in the overall carbon footprint and emphasizes the need for strategic interventions to enhance energy efficiency, promote renewable energy adoption, and ultimately contribute to the broader goal of climate neutrality. It affects Trikala by setting goals for the reduction of waste generation in specific sectors, such as excavation, construction, and demolition waste. As mentioned above, the CCC has set the objective of separate collection of waste streams (organic, paper, glass, metals, plastic, bulky, greens, WEEE, SQHW, edible fats) and the goal of municipal waste prevention by 10%.

The Fair Development Transition Plan for Lignite Areas (2020) is one of the most important action plans that are related to and can contribute to the transition to climate neutrality. The main objective is to provide support to local communities and to support economic recovery after the closure of the lignite mines. At the same time, it seeks to reduce GHG emissions and adapt to new sustainable economic activities. The transition away from lignite is a key component of broader efforts to decarbonise the economy and mitigate the impacts of climate change. To achieve climate neutrality, there is a need to shift towards RES. Specifically, this shift includes the development of a joined and smart RES management system, integrating RES energy through grid, transitioning energy sources in buildings from fossil fuels to electricity (electrification of buildings), implementing Virtual power plants (VPP), installing solar thermal power systems on buildings, and establishing photovoltaics on buildings and in municipal photovoltaics parks. The transition plan allocates resources to support the development of renewable energy projects in lignite-dependent areas. This not only contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also positions these regions as contributors to the clean energy transition. The extraction and use of lignite often have environmental consequences, including land degradation. The transition plan includes provisions for environmental rehabilitation, focusing on restoring ecosystems affected by lignite mining. This aligns with broader climate goals by promoting sustainable land use and biodiversity. The plan is designed to align with national climate objectives and strategies. By integrating regional transition plans into the broader national climate framework, there is a cohesive and coordinated effort to achieve climate neutrality at the national level. The transition plan greatly affects the national energy mix, thus the emissions occurring due to the consumption of grid-supplied energy. Trikala's Scope 2 emissions can be significantly affected by the changes in lignite areas.

By using the New Recycling Law, the protection of the natural environment is promoted and spatial, urban planning and energy regulations are implemented that will contribute to achieving climate neutrality in the future. This can be achieved by attaining a transition to a Circular Economic Model, recycling, reducing the negative impacts of waste production and management, reducing waste production, etc. Separate collection of

8
Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

paper, glass, plastics, metals and bio-waste is promoted and municipalities and citizens are encouraged to reduce waste production. As previously emphasized, the reduction in waste production and the implementation of separate waste collection divert a substantial quantity of waste from landfill disposal. Consequently, this not only diminishes emissions from landfill sites but also aligns with broader environmental objectives. The strategic emphasis on waste reduction, coupled with the implementation of comprehensive separate collection practices, significantly contributes to the overall reduction of emissions from landfill sites. By fostering a culture of waste reduction and responsible waste management, communities play a pivotal role in mitigating environmental impacts and advancing the collective pursuit of climate neutrality. Furthermore, the law provides guidelines for promoting a more sustainable approach to waste management, including practices that encourage the circular economy and reduce negative environmental impacts. The implementation of these practices in the city of Trikala can have broader economic, environmental, and social implications, enhancing the sustainability of the local community and contributing to the national goal of sustainability and climate neutrality. The CCC includes actions concerning the separate collection of recyclable waste streams such as paper, glass, plastics, metals and bio-waste.

In addition, National Action Plan for the promotion of Green Public Procurement is another step towards climate neutrality. In essence, contracting for products, services and projects that have a lower environmental impact throughout their life cycle than products, services and projects that serve the same essential function. The National Action Plan for the promotion of the Green Public Procurement is an essential step towards climate independence, as it is closely linked to the reduction of GHG emissions. This approach contributes to reducing the environmental footprint and saving resources in various sectors. Firstly, the promotion of Green Public Procurement is gearing public procurement towards the purchase of products, services and projects with a lower environmental footprint. This includes giving preference to products and services produced using sustainable materials, with low energy consumption and with processes that reduce CO2 emissions during production. The preference for these products and services in public procurement leads to support for companies and producers that incorporate sustainable practices. It thus encourages the development of the market for sustainable products and services, helping to reduce emissions associated with the production and use of these products. These measures are closely tied to efforts for climate neutrality, ensuring that local markets and the economy actively contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

The Municipality of Trikala is a pioneer in environmental issues and focuses on innovations and actions aimed at a sustainable future for the improvement of everyday activities for the citizens. The Municipality has at its disposal numerous plans and strategies, many of which have not been implemented; nevertheless, whatever is available forms the foundation for the specific undertaking of the CCC. Primarily, the plans that are at the local level have been put into practice. Additionally, many actions outlined in other plans have been integrated into the CCC and serve as steppingstones for this initiative. Specifically, the actions of the "Restart MAi City" strategy have been incorporated as smart city initiatives, with some of them further integrated into other action areas, such as the implementation of Demand-Responsive Transport (DRT) in the transportation and mobility sector. Despite the fact that numerous plans remain unrealized, the existing groundwork, coupled with the alignment of actions across various projects, contributes significantly to the overall success of the CCC. With its actions, "Restart MAi City" contributes to shaping a more sustainable and smart urban environment in Trikala. Some of the smart city actions included in the CCC are: the establishment of Smart City Executive Management Centre, Integrated service, information and citizen awareness infrastructures for a smart city ecosystem, implementation

of protection plan against physical / logical system / information breach and drafting of an open data policy for the Municipality, Installation of intelligent traffic signalling and control infrastructure, development of smart citizen wellness support infrastructure, installation of infrastructure for remote management, remote control and telemetry of distribution boards (pillars) of municipal infrastructure of public space (street lighting), installation of emergency detection and management infrastructure, installation of smart consumption and water quality meters in the water supply network, creation of a waste management platform, alternative waste management systems and information-awareness actions.

At the local level, various strategic initiatives and action plans are in place to advance sustainability objectives. Notably, the Action Plan for Sustainable Energy and Climate stands out, emphasizing the imperative of energy conservation within buildings and facilities, the promotion of energy generation from renewable sources, and the advocacy for sustainable transportation practices. These concerted efforts contribute significantly to the reduction of emissions in the building sector, aligning with the overarching goal of progressing towards climate neutrality. In addition, apart from the Local Waste Action Plan (2020-2025), which focuses on the avoidance, reduction, reuse, recycling and treatment of waste in order to avoid the disposal of waste in landfills (thus reducing methane emissions and, by extension, GHG emissions), there is also the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan of the Municipality of Trikala. The essence of the plan is that in order to achieve climate neutrality, it is vital to improve air quality, and in order to achieve this improvement, it is essential to reduce emissions of air pollutants and GHG from vehicle traffic. Some of the ways proposed in the plan are: improving road infrastructure, upgrading public transport, training drivers to drive in an environmentally friendly way, etc. Similar actions regarding the emissions reduction from transportation are included in CCC. Specifically, behavioural shift to public transport, walking and cycling, support of remote working and online services, Zero Emission Zones, Mobility as a Service (MaaS) etc

Another initiative by the Municipality of Trikala is the Strategic Plan of Trikala (2022-2027), which sets out priorities and measures to address challenges like urbanisation and climate change. Since the main pollutants affecting the atmosphere in the Municipality of Trikala come from various combustion processes for heating or cooling, from vehicle traffic, from waste disposal and from industrial activities, in order to lead the Municipality to climate neutrality it is possible to create green roofs on municipal buildings, NZEB, adopt the passive building standard for the energy upgrade of all public buildings, adopt a green policy for the management of energy consumption, etc.

The transport sector is responsible for a very large amount of GHG emissions, about a quarter of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions. In this context, the Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Plan was developed, which involves the development of a network of publicly accessible EV charging stations to serve/charge the different types of electric vehicles (passenger cars, motorcycles, bicycles, buses, etc.) expected to circulate in the Municipality, through actions such as the replacement of older vehicles with hybrid and pure electric vehicles. With these initiatives, emissions of greenhouse gases are significantly reduced, as the introduction of such vehicles, as replacements for conventional ones, substantially diminishes emissions related to transportation. Consequently, transportation ceases to constitute as substantial a percentage of emissions. This paradigm shift towards eco-friendly vehicles not only contributes to mitigating the environmental impact of transportation but also aligns with a broader commitment to sustainability and reduced GHG emissions. The transition to electric vehicles can contribute to reducing fuel costs for consumers, as the cost of charging is usually lower than the cost of gasoline or diesel. The plan encourages a more sustainable approach to mobility, thus contributing to
Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

the creation of a more environmentally friendly urban environment. In these ways, the Electric Vehicle Charging Plan contributes to the transition to a more sustainable, environmentally friendly, and energy-efficient mobility in Trikala.

Furthermore, in 2022 the city also planned the "Restart MAI City" strategy. A smart city aims to use resources more efficiently and reduce (mitigate) emissions by providing better services in various city sectors. For example, by creating smart pillars for street lighting, monitoring electricity consumption, fleet management, installing energy-saving infrastructure in municipal buildings, monitor environmental conditions in city level and inform citizens, educate citizens in environmentally friendly practices etc.

Equally important is the Energy transition strategy for Trikala city (2022), which highlights the priorities and potential of the city in terms of energy efficiency, with actions such as eliminating all fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy sources, promoting electromobility, reducing GHG emissions from waste management, reducing final energy consumption and increasing energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy, etc. By strategically implementing this approach, a tangible outcome is the notable reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The discernible shift towards such sustainable practices not only aligns with environmental stewardship but also substantiates a steadfast commitment to the overarching goal of minimizing GHG impacts.

Although, the introduction of many strategies and legislation (such as the National Climate Law) is a good start towards achieving climate neutrality, some gaps and shortcomings identified make it necessary to change, modify or strengthen some of them. For example, in the National Climate Law, in addition to the decarbonisation of lignite, no specific and binding deadlines are set for the general decarbonisation of hydrocarbons, with the exception of some more specific cases, such as the burning of fuel oil on islands and oil-fired boilers in buildings. Furthermore, there is no mention of the need for public consultation on critical elements such as sectoral budgets. There is a restriction on the online climate dialogue site.

Importantly, there is also a lack of accountability for fining non-compliers and a corresponding lack of incentives for more green investments. It is therefore obvious that the strengthening of some legislation or even its modification is necessary to achieve climate neutrality.

The city of Trikala has formulated strategic plans encompassing initiatives to address climate change, such as the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) and the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP). Nevertheless, given the non-implementation of these actions, it is deemed more practical for the Action Plan of the city to include not only new climate-related measures but also existing actions derived from current plans. For this reason, the assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction resulting from all actions is incorporated within the scope of "Emission reductions Resulting from CNAP".

As depicted in Table A-2.3, the baseline emissions for the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario in 2030 amount to 463.07 kt CO2. The cumulative impact of the Action Plan's initiatives leads to a reduction in emissions by 376.16 kt CO2e (81.24%). Consequently, the expected residual GHG emissions stand at 86.9 kt CO2e, representing a reduction of 18.76%, a percentage that aligns with the mission objectives (aiming for less than 20%).

The subsequent section provides a detailed presentation of the Action Plan's initiatives and the strategy for addressing the remaining emissions.

|  Bureaucracy - Public sector System | Municipality, Government | Bureaucracy can drive citizens away from the decision-making process. This can reduce their participation and the effectiveness of policies. The government and the municipalities usually operate with the same systems, so it is necessary to simultaneously modernize and promote the most effective actions towards climate neutrality. | Bureaucracy is characterised by a hierarchical structure, strict rules and procedures and a standardised set of procedures. It is a slow process. It is necessary to modernise the public sector system and find flexible and innovative approaches. Climate change is an urgent global challenge that requires rapid action. Bureaucracy and slow decision-making processes can hinder the timely implementation of climate policies and projects, delaying critical actions needed to mitigate the effects of climate change. | Modernising the system and working together between different stakeholders will accelerate climate action and promote a more effective response to the climate crisis.  |

|  Understaffing of municipalities-Public sector System | Municipality, Government | Understaffing in government and municipalities can negatively affect environmental policy, climate action and adaptation to climate change, with an impact on the sustainability and resilience of regions to climate challenges. The decisions for the recruitment of new executives in municipalities come from Central Government, therefore the Reduced recruitment that eventually takes place in the municipalities resulting in the inability to develop and implement new sustainable technologies has the starting point of the government. | Municipalities play a crucial role in implementing and enforcing policies, programs and initiatives that address climate change at local level. When these agencies are understaffed, their ability to respond effectively to challenges posed by climate change can be hampered. Indicatively, some problems that arise are: Difficulty in responding immediately to challenges, inability to develop and implement projects, insufficient monitoring and data collection, reduced approach and awareness of the community, etc. | When the municipality is adequately staffed, it can respond promptly and effectively to any challenges that may arise. It will now be easier to develop and implement new projects, raising awareness and approaching people will be easier as there will be no staff restrictions, there will be staff who will be able to analyze and monitor data as well as possible funding that may exist from time to time for actions to tackle climate change.  |

|  Fossil Fuel Lobbying - Economic System | Government, Market, Industry, Private sector | The limited technological support for RES and the financial constraints for the development of research in this field, cause the repeated choice to use mineral resources. The government is not investing as much as it should in RES and the market is not properly prepared for the final and imposing integration of RES. Also, the fossil fuel industry has a strong influence in many areas. One of them is politics. Political decision-making in many countries is affected, as this industry generates huge profits and thus often serves political interests and hinders the use of RES over fossil fuels. | The fossil fuel industry has significant influence over policymakers, which can hinder the implementation of climate-friendly policies and investments in renewable energy. | If RES are developed and the pressure to use fossil fuels is reduced, new paths are opened.

|  Social & Cultural Factors - Citizens, Municipality Social System | The project team within the Municipality needs to identify any social and cultural factors that pose a barrier to climate action and characterise the citizens or certain groups of them. The Municipality will have to design targeted workshops and actions in order to overcome these behaviours. | Cultural norms, values, and behaviors can influence patterns of activities, consumption and waste generation, making it challenging to shift to more sustainable lifestyles. It is obvious that people's behaviour and treatment of climate change issues are not appropriate. The transition to climate neutrality clearly also depends on the social background of citizens. In addition, many of the changes - actions required to tackle climate change are linked to the perceptions and habits of citizens that should change. For example, people who consider that the car is a sign of wealth find it difficult to use public transport, as they believe that this damages their social image. | The city is its own ecosystem where every member plays a special part in the road to climate neutrality. Overcoming social and cultural factors and changing outdated behaviours and mindsets can have crucial results in Trikala's journey towards climate neutrality.

On the path towards climate neutrality, various barriers and opportunities arise simultaneously. One significant obstacle encountered is bureaucracy, characterized by a slow, hierarchical structure with strict rules and standardized procedures. This bureaucratic setup can distance citizens from the decision-making process, posing a challenge to timely action on climate change—a pressing global issue requiring rapid responses. The slow decision-making process associated with bureaucracy can impede the timely implementation of climate policies and projects, delaying crucial actions needed to mitigate climate change impacts. Interventions like the OnevStop Shop for Energy Renovation on Buildings aim to simplify bureaucratic processes, reducing administrative burdens for property owners and streamlining energy renovation projects. Similarly, the establishment of a Municipal climate team (Trikala Climate Team) centralizes energy-related initiatives within municipalities, addressing bureaucratic hurdles and ensuring coordinated efforts with efficient resource allocation. Moreover, citizen engagement interventions such as forums and co-creation platforms offer direct engagement channels with policymakers. These platforms enable the identification and streamlining of bureaucratic processes that hinder progress towards climate goals. Through these collaborative efforts, communities can navigate bureaucratic challenges more effectively and accelerate progress towards climate neutrality.

Institutional capacity refers to the ability of organizations, institutions, or systems to effectively carry out their functions, fulfill their mandates, and achieve their objectives. It encompasses various elements, including human resources, organizational structures, policies and procedures, technical expertise, financial resources, and stakeholder relationships. In the context of climate change, institutional capacity is crucial for developing and implementing climate policies and initiatives, conducting research and analysis, managing natural resources, coordinating stakeholders, and responding to climate-related risks and impacts. A lack of resources and qualified personnel poses a significant barrier to effective environmental policy, resulting in delays in the implementation of essential programs and projects aimed at environmental protection. To effectively address climate change at the local level, it is essential for governments and municipalities to implement and enforce policies, programs, and initiatives. However, when these authorities are understaffed, their ability to respond efficiently to climate change challenges is compromised. Co-creation platforms play a crucial role in fostering collaboration among diverse stakeholders, technology experts, policymakers and authorities. By leveraging collective expertise, these platforms can help compensate for municipal understaffing and enhance institutional capacity for sustainable initiatives.

Financial constraints and the state of the economic system in general are undoubtedly a major obstacle to tackling the burning issue of climate change. The transition to sustainable technologies and practices often requires large investments. Since the city of Trikala may find it difficult to access the necessary funds for mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the financial component is too important to achieve the goal. Therefore, the government should create funding programs for municipalities that demonstrate significant climate action. At the same time, it can also create appropriate incentives for private companies, so that they can more easily invest in climate. Incentive programs encourage participation in sustainability efforts by offering financial rewards or subsidies, alleviating financial constraints and promoting the implementation of sustainable projects despite limited budgets.

The lack of public awareness is a critical issue that directly impacts efforts to address climate change. Often, there is apathy and indifference among citizens towards environmental actions, making it difficult to exert social pressure on governments to take effective measures against

Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

climate change. Citizens may lack sufficient knowledge about the short-term and long-term impacts of climate change and may abstain from participating in environmental actions. Raising awareness and educating citizens is not solely an individual responsibility but also a duty of both the government and local municipalities. Collaboration and action from both levels of government are essential to ensure that citizens understand the significance of climate change and the need for action to address it. This can be achieved through educational campaigns and programs, as well as providing information through various channels. Educational campaigns sensitize people to the systemic factors of climate change and the importance of collective action. By providing information and resources, these campaigns empower citizens to make informed choices and support policy changes that address underlying systemic obstacles such as unsustainable consumption patterns and dependence on fossil fuels. Educational campaigns could be conducted through citizen forums and digital platforms focusing on climate crisis issues, thereby increasing interest and encouraging citizen participation in sustainable initiatives.

Political instabilities, partisan disputes, and social unrest make it more challenging to implement actions to address climate change. These issues divert attention and resources away from the need to adopt and implement crucial environmental policies. To address these challenges, efforts must be made to promote political stability and dialogue among all stakeholders in governance. Transparency, cooperation, and open communication are essential for the development and implementation of effective policies against the climate crisis. In this regard, stakeholder forums and platforms for collaboration play a crucial role as spaces for constructive dialogue and commitment to sustainability goals.

Cooperation and coordination between agencies is crucial to address technological constraints and promote clean and sustainable technologies. Government can provide the framework and policies that encourage investment in research and development, while industry and the market can contribute by producing and adopting clean technologies. Research and innovation in universities, on the other hand, can promote new technologies and practices that respond to climate challenges.

Technological constraints present significant hurdles in addressing the climate crisis. Some emission reduction technologies are either still in the developmental stage or too costly, limiting their widespread adoption. This challenge is compounded by the continued affordability and accessibility of traditional carbon-based energy sources, hindering the transition to renewable energy. The fossil fuel industry wields considerable influence across various sectors, particularly in politics. Consequently, it shapes policy decisions in many countries, driven by its substantial profits and alignment with political interests. As a result, the advancement of renewable energy sources often faces obstacles and resistance in favor of fossil fuels. Moreover, the complexity of renewable energy technologies and the specialized expertise required can further hinder public adoption. To tackle these challenges, co-creation platforms facilitate collaboration among technology experts, policymakers, and stakeholders, fostering innovation and addressing technological barriers to sustainability. Additionally, citizen and stakeholder forums play a pivotal role in amplifying the voices of advocates for sustainable practices. By countering the influence of fossil fuel lobbying, these forums advocate for alternative, environmentally friendly policies and initiatives.

The project team within the Municipality must identify social and cultural factors that hinder climate action and design targeted workshops and actions to address them. Many of the changes necessary to combat climate change are intertwined with citizens' perceptions and habits, which

need to evolve. Cultural norms, values, and behaviors significantly influence activities, consumption patterns, and waste generation, making the transition to sustainable lifestyles challenging. It's evident that people's attitudes and behaviors toward climate change are inadequate. Achieving climate neutrality also hinges on citizens' social backgrounds. For example, individuals who view car ownership as a status symbol may resist switching to public transportation due to concerns about social status. In a city like Trikala, every resident plays a crucial role in moving toward climate neutrality. Overcoming social and cultural barriers and changing outdated attitudes and behaviors are essential steps in this journey. Citizen forums offer inclusive platforms where residents from diverse backgrounds can share their perspectives and contribute to decision-making. By ensuring that policies and initiatives reflect community needs and values, these forums play a vital role in Trikala's efforts to achieve climate neutrality.

Another significant obstacle is the diverse backgrounds of citizens, including differences in cognition, economics, and social status. Municipalities can better understand the economic and social groups within their jurisdiction through surveys and data collection. Universities can also play a crucial role by offering training seminars on achieving climate neutrality. However, failing to develop a climate plan that addresses social and economic disparities can undermine the effectiveness of the city's climate action efforts. In Trikala's climate planning, fundamental principles such as fairness, justice, and inclusivity are paramount. Recognizing the diverse social and economic landscape within the city is essential for integrating appropriate measures into the planning process. This ensures adherence to these principles and paves the way for climate neutrality while considering the needs of all residents. Citizen and stakeholder forums serve as inclusive platforms where individuals from various backgrounds can voice their opinions and contribute to decision-making processes. These forums play a vital role in ensuring that policies and initiatives are inclusive and representative of the community's diverse needs and perspectives

The interconnection of the HEDNO network with RES installations is pivotal for advancing the transition to a low-carbon energy system, bolstering grid flexibility, fostering energy independence, driving economic growth, and enhancing environmental sustainability.

Through stakeholder forums, initiatives promoting the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid can gain momentum, thereby reducing reliance on fossil fuels and propelling the transition toward a more sustainable energy system.

Strengthening energy and climate regulations presents a favorable chance for governments and local authorities to expedite and enhance efforts aimed at addressing the climate emergency. Enforcing robust and all-encompassing climate measures, including carbon pricing, mandates for renewable energy adoption, and goals for reducing emissions, can establish regulatory clarity and stimulate investments in clean technologies. It is a fact that pressure from legislation is a serious incentive for municipalities and citizens. Mainly with the influence of European legislation and then with their adoption in Greek legislation, tackling the climate crisis becomes more accessible.
Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The transition to RES involves not only the government and Municipalities but also markets, industry, and research. Without essential research, it is impossible to overcome technological challenges, and without necessary government funding, neither universities nor Municipalities can support professionals to implement sustainable practices. Furthermore, industry and the market heavily rely on fossil fuels, which necessitates proper preparation for the energy transition. It is evident that addressing the climate crisis requires a collective effort from all stakeholders towards a sustainable society. Greece, which has been relying on fossil fuels for many years, is taking significant strides to shift its energy mix and transition towards climate neutrality.

When it comes to Green Finance and Investment, the reasonable allocation of resources towards research and development of environmentally sound technologies can have significant implications in many areas. This approach can promote energy efficiency, carbon reduction, the practice of sustainable agriculture and other related sectors. This, for its part, can accelerate the transition towards an economy that produces less carbon dioxide emissions. It's evident that both the government and private corporations have the capacity to be significant contributors to climate-related investments. At the same time, banks can serve as funding sources. The government can boost and reinforce investments in eco-friendly ventures by offering policy incentives and financial encouragement. Industry and universities can serve as hubs for research and innovation in green technologies, with funding from financial institutions. The development of green technologies and the ability to be widely applied can make them competitive with traditional practices and the use of fossil fuels. Incentive programs can alleviate financial constraints by offering grants, subsidies, or tax incentives for sustainable initiatives, while stakeholder forums can advocate for increased funding and resource allocation to address sustainability challenge.

Citizen participation is a crucial factor in the implementation and success of environmental initiatives. Working with young groups can speed up the awareness process and positively influence the rest of the population. Engaging and empowering the younger generation can enhance creative thinking, promote activism and encourage support for ambitious policies and initiatives to tackle climate change. Young people are perhaps a little more aware of the seriousness of the problem and are willing to take action. Youth movements can easily focus on raising public awareness of climate change and its consequences. This can be achieved by organizing events, protests and campaigns, in order to promote the issue and inform the public. Also, it is possible to put more pressure on the political leaders and the government to take concrete measures to limit the emission of greenhouse gases and the general management of the climate crisis. More knowledge and exposure in the field of environment, best practices for environmental conservation and climate science are some of the possibilities that young people have and can offer. in environmental protection and emission reduction, since they have more friction with science, perhaps fresher ideas and willingness. The youth movement represents a force that struggles to deal with the crisis and can create changes for perspective and change. Citizen forums provide a platform for open dialogue and discussion on climate-related issues. By facilitating conversations among young people, forums can help identify systemic barriers and develop collaborative solutions. Additionally, forums promote transparency and accountability in decision-making processes, ensuring that the concerns and priorities of citizens are addressed.

Table B-2.2 further analyses the action portfolio presented above, explaining the action outline, the connection to impact pathways, the implementation process and the impact and cost of each action. In the "comments on implementation" section the actions connected to the six key strategic priorities are highlighted:

Citizen-centric governance model
Trikala - Restart mAI City
Decarbonising electricity and heating generation
Shift to public and non-motorised transport
Energy renovation and efficient utilisation of building stock
Sustainable management of waste &amp; promotion of circular economy

At the same time, a responsible body and the involved stakeholders are defined for each action. In some cases the responsible body already exists but is some other actions the responsible body will be an Office/Organisation created through Trikala's Climate Mission. Similarly, some of the stakeholders mentioned have already signed the Commitments document, while some others are wanted by the city but haven't signed yet. Trikala has a plan on how to attract more important stakeholders to support its effort.

Firstly, Trikala will initiate an inclusive stakeholder engagement process. This involves reaching out to various groups including local businesses, community organizations, residents, academic institutions, and governmental bodies. Hosting town hall meetings, workshops, and online forums will provide platforms for stakeholders to voice their concerns, ideas, and aspirations for the city's climate action plan. Additionally, forming advisory committees comprising representatives from diverse sectors will ensure that all voices are heard and incorporated into the planning process. The city will communicate with potential stakeholders to invite them to take part in its participatory processes.

Transparency is key to building trust and garnering support from stakeholders. Trikala will commit to transparent communication channels, providing regular updates on progress, challenges, and decision-making processes. Establishing a dedicated online portal or newsletter will keep stakeholders informed about ongoing initiatives, opportunities for involvement, and the impact of their contributions. Moreover, transparent reporting mechanisms will demonstrate accountability and help build credibility for Trikala's climate neutrality efforts.

Incentives play a crucial role in motivating stakeholders to actively participate and invest in Trikala's climate neutrality journey. The city can offer financial incentives such as grants, subsidies, or tax breaks to businesses and residents adopting sustainable practices or investing in renewable energy projects. Furthermore, non-financial incentives such as recognition programs, awards, and access to networking opportunities can incentivize stakeholders to showcase their commitment to climate action. Collaborating with financial institutions to develop innovative financing mechanisms for green projects will also attract investors and unlock funding for sustainable initiatives in Trikala.

By prioritizing stakeholder engagement, transparency, and incentives, Trikala can effectively mobilize support from diverse stakeholders and accelerate its transition towards climate neutrality. This collaborative approach will strengthen community resilience and sustainability.

Buildings mainly rely on the grid for electricity, which is typically generated from fossil fuels. The installation of PV systems in buildings can generate their own electricity, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels. This leads to a decrease in GHG emissions associated with electricity generation.
Sunshine in Greece is estimated at 1.542 hours per year. The power of the PV installation is 3,16 MWp. Therefore, the total energy produced by the installation per year amounts to 4.872,72 MWh.
During this action the potential for local production and storage of energy with batteries while disconnecting from the grid will be researched and promoted, in an effort to decongest the grid.
This is a priority action linked to decarbonising electricity and heating generation.  |

|   | Action description | Clean vehicles (such as electric) produce fewer or zero tailpipe emissions compared to conventional vehicles. Specifically, electric vehicles have zero tailpipe emissions, while hybrids and biofuel vehicles emit significantly lower levels of GHG. The replacement of fossil fuel powered vehicles with clean alternatives will contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide and other harmful emissions. In addition, clean vehicles are designed to be more energy efficient than conventional vehicles. This increased efficiency means that they require less energy to travel the same distance, reducing overall energy consumption and associated emissions. Clean vehicles can be charged using RES such as solar or wind power. By combining clean vehicles with renewable energy generation, we can create a synergistic effect that further reduces GHG emissions. This integration helps to decarbonize the transportation. These advancements not only improve the performance and range of clean vehicles but also make them more accessible and cost-effective for consumers. They provide incentives for users with older conventional cars to transition to newer more efficient cars. Promoting clean and efficient vehicles is crucial for several compelling reasons, which are primarily related to environmental, economic, and social benefits. The market penetration of low emission vehicles can be intensified by the provision of financial incentives and an integrated system of vehicle chargers’ infrastructure. The financial incentives can be tax breaks, consumer subsidies and reduced public fees.  |

|   |  Comments on implementation | This action will focus in a shift from conventional combustion engines to a more efficient/clean engines. Particularly, it aims at a conversion rate of 20% to more efficient vehicles, a rate of 40% for conversion to hybrid vehicles and 20% to electric vehicles. Conversion in this action refers to private and commercial transport. Therefore, since we are not referring at all to public transport, the implementation and success of the action is quite difficult, as it is quite challenging to adopt this change universally. The launch of the action could be made first in commercial transport and this can be implemented with the help of possible investment programs and credits that can be used to support and decarbonise the interested stakeholders. This action will be fully implemented in cooperation with other actions of the project. In particular, the city has already implemented the Electric Vehicle Charging Plan (2021) in which 94 charging stations for EVs are mentioned and thus the market for vehicles can be sufficiently profitable.  |

|   |  Comments on implementation | Many local governments have successfully adopted fleet management applications to improve the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of their transportation services. Careful planning, stakeholder engagement, and a commitment to addressing these obstacles can pave the way for successful implementation. Yet there are some obstacles that must be faced in order to have greater results by this action. At first there are some costs on developing, implementing, and maintaining a fleet management application. In addition, the existing public fleet that will remain may lack the necessary technology infrastructure (e.g., GPS, telematics) for seamless integration with the application. Upgrading or retrofitting older vehicles can be costly. On the other hand, municipal fleet must be transitioned to electric or hybrid vehicles in terms of cost-efficiency. Moreover, employees, especially those in long-established roles, may resist adopting new technology and processes. Also, drivers may lack of knowledge of these applications. Training and change management efforts may be required to address those obstacles.  |

| Action description | Demand-Responsive Transport (DRT), also known as Demand-Responsive Transit, is a type of transportation service that adapts to passengers' specific requests and needs, often using flexible routing and scheduling. It contrasts with traditional fixed-route public transportation systems like buses and subways, which follow predetermined routes and schedules. Passengers can request DRT services on-demand, often using a mobile app or a phone call. This can be extremely useful for people with disabilities, seniors or those living in areas with limited access to traditional transit. In addition, DRT services are more flexible than the traditional transit. They typically operate in areas or during times when fixed-route services may be less practical or cost-effective. Also, DRT vehicles are smaller than traditional buses, so it can serve areas with lower passenger demand more efficiently and navigate narrower streets. Overall, Demand-Responsive Transport applications provide a valuable solution for communities seeking more flexible and inclusive transportation options. They adapt to the changing needs of passengers and can complement existing public transit networks to create a more comprehensive and accessible transportation system. |

|   |  Action description | Establish legislative zone in the city center where only zero-emission vehicles are allowed to operate, meaning vehicles that produce no tailpipe emissions, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), and other harmful pollutants. ZEZs are a strategic policy tool used to combat air pollution, reduce GHG emissions, and promote the use of cleaner transportation options. The main purpose of ZEZs is to significantly reduce air pollution by restricting or prohibiting the entry of vehicles that emit pollutants, including nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), which can harm public health. This would help mitigate climate change by reducing GHG emissions. By reducing vehicular emissions, ZEZs contribute to improved air quality, which can have positive effects on public health,  |

|   |  | including reduced respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. Also, ZEZs encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and other zero-emission technologies, such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. These zones provide an incentive for individuals and businesses to transition to cleaner transportation options. Furthermore, ZEZ will promote the use of public transport, cycling and walking as sustainable alternatives to private vehicles. Finally, ZEZ can be introduced in phases, so either emission standards will be stricter or the area will be larger over time. This approach allows for a gradual transition and minimizes the impact on affected businesses and individuals.  |

It is necessary to public awareness campaigns for all citizens to learn the benefits of cycling for health, the environment, and reducing traffic congestion. The Municipality of Trikala has carried out several actions that promote bicycle usage, while the city has a satisfactory network of cycle paths. However, cycle network should be upgraded and widened in order to serve more city's areas that do not have the appropriate infrastructure. Also, new parking spaces for bicycles should be placed across the cycle network. In the same context, it is important to make zones around schools where vehicle speeds will be reduced through traffic calming measures like speed bumps and narrower roadways to enhance cyclist safety. Additionally, new policies must be implemented that will allow people to more extensively use of bicycle. For instance, the Municipality could have flexible work hours for its employees so they can go to work by bicycle. Also, the Municipality of Trikala could provide financial incentives for the purchase of bicycles, e-bikes or related accessories.  |

Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

|   | Action description | Logistics and urban freight transport can become more eco-friendly by implementing a combination of strategies and technologies that reduce environmental impacts, including emissions, congestion, and noise pollution. Companies have to adopt electric vehicles (EVs) and low-emission delivery trucks to reduce tailpipe emissions. Electric vans, cargo bikes, and e-cargo trikes are suitable for last-mile deliveries in congested urban areas. To achieve this, economic incentives must be provided by the local government. Furthermore, there are great practices of reducing delivery trips and number of vehicles on the road, such as establishing of consolidation centers on the outskirts of urban areas where goods from various suppliers are consolidated into fewer, larger shipments before entering the city. Also, partnerships among retailers or suppliers should be promoted, where they could share the same delivery infrastructure. In the same context, adoption of intracity freight is important to boost eco-friendly last mile delivery options. Intracity freight often involves the last-mile delivery segment, which is the final leg of the supply chain where goods are transported from a distribution center or warehouse to the end consumer or business. This is a critical and often challenging part of urban freight due to the need for timely and efficient deliveries to individual addresses. In this part, there are some great eco solutions such as the investment in autonomous delivery vehicles and drones for last-mile deliveries and the establishment of urban freight hubs within the city to minimize the distance goods need to travel from distribution points to the final destination.  |

Also, companies have to provide employees the necessary hardware and software for remote work. It is self-evident that the more employees an organization has the more costly providing with hardware and software will be. Therefore, economic incentives must be provided either from Municipality of Trikala and from the National Government. Further, transitioning to a remote work culture can be challenging, especially in organizations where traditional office-based work is the norm. Some employees and managers may resist the shift to remote work due to concerns about productivity, team collaboration, or traditional work habits. It may require changes in management style and mindset. That can be achieved through campaigns that will highlight the benefits of remote work. This action will focus in a 5% reduction of total transport GHG.  |

C

|   |  | to provide users with a seamless and convenient travel experience. Instead of dealing with multiple providers and separate payment systems, users can plan, book, and pay for their entire journey through a single interface. With MaaS, users are encouraged to use a mix of transportation modes for their journeys. For instance, a MaaS platform might recommend taking a bus to a train station, followed by a shared bicycle for the last mile. One of the great aspects about MaaS is that some platforms often use data analytics and algorithms to offer personalized travel recommendations based on user's preferences, schedules and budgets. Furthermore, MaaS platforms provide real-time information about the status and location of different transportation services. There are several practical examples of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) initiatives and platforms in various cities around the world. Whim is one of the first MaaS platforms. It was first launched in Helsinki, Finland. Through Whim users can plan and pay for different modes of transport, including public transport, taxis, car rentals, and bike-sharing. Further, users can pay for individual trips or subscribe to monthly plans that cover their transportation needs.  |

|   |  Comments on implementation | Despite the benefits of Mobility as a Service (MaaS), several obstacles necessitate collaborative efforts among government agencies, private sector stakeholders, technology providers, and communities. Chief among these challenges is the primary objective of MaaS: to integrate diverse transport options into a single platform. Achieving this goal demands collaboration between MaaS platforms and various stakeholders, including public transit agencies, private transportation firms, and local governments, to deliver a seamless user experience. Additionally, altering user behaviors and habits concerning transportation is crucial. In Trikala, where individual car usage predominantly dictates mobility, resistance to adopting new transportation models may arise. Furthermore, MaaS services have the potential to increase transportation costs for certain users who heavily rely on multiple modes of transportation, posing affordability and accessibility challenges across income levels. Overcoming these obstacles necessitates targeted educational campaigns designed to inform all Trikala citizens about the socio-ecological benefits of utilizing MaaS platforms. Such campaigns can play a vital role in fostering acceptance and adoption of new transportation paradigms, ultimately contributing to the city's transition towards sustainable mobility solutions. This is a priority action linked to the shift to public and non-motorised transport.  |

|   |  Action description | Organic waste is defined as biodegradable garden and park waste, food and kitchen waste from homes, offices, restaurants, wholesalers, canteens, and retail outlets, and associated waste from food processing establishments. Separate collection of organic waste has several benefits.

It has been estimated that 35-40% of organic waste can be composted. Composting is the natural process that converts organic materials into a high-quality soil amendment, called compost. Specifically, composting refers to the aerobic decomposition of organic waste with the aim of reducing its volume and producing compost. Nutrient-rich compost improves the fertility and structure of soil while sequestering carbon from atmosphere, helping to reduce GHG emission. In this manner, composting is not only a great way to recycle organic waste but also contributes to mitigating climate change.

In addition, the decomposition of organic waste in landfills produces methane emissions.  |

1
Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

|   |  | Methane is a potent GHG that contributes to climate change. To mitigate methane emissions from organic waste in landfills, it is important to reduce the amount of them going to landfills through recycling and composting.

And last but not least, separating biowaste from other waste streams prevent contamination. Organic waste can easily contaminate other recyclable materials, making them unsuitable for recycling.

Separate collection and sustainable management of organic municipal waste requires active participation of citizens and proper information and collaboration by Municipality. Public awareness campaigns and educational programs can help promote the importance of organic waste separation and encourage participation from individuals and communities.  |

|   |  | The proper preparation and implementation of separate organic waste collection require a set of resources, including equipment (containers, waste collection vehicles, weighing machines, etc.), personnel for program organization and waste collection processes, digital media, and expenses for awareness and outreach activities. The members of the project team involved in the design and operation of this waste management plan will be responsible for determining this equipment, conducting market research, finding the necessary sources of funding, etc.

Awareness and information of citizens is particularly important for achieving this goal. All actions that promote alternative waste management, beyond the existence of infrastructure and organization by the Municipality, require active participation of the majority of citizens. For this reason, an integrated communication framework should be designed to inform the residents about the system.

The MSW Treatment Plant of Western Thessaly is currently under construction. The plant includes a composting unit for the processing of the source separated organics.

|   | Action description | Recycling plastic waste contributes to climate neutrality by conserving energy and natural sources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, minimizing waste and promote Circular Economy.
A large proportion of municipal waste consists of plastics. This constantly increasing quantity and their contribution to climate change make it necessary to collect this waste stream separately.
Plastic stands out as one of the most harmful materials for the environment. The manufacturing of plastics releases GHG into the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane and requires significant mineral resources and energy consumption. So recycling not only reduces emissions but also leads to significant energy savings.
Additionally, decomposition of plastics in landfills releases methane that significantly contributes to global warming. By separating plastics and diverting them from landfills, methane emissions are reduced and climate change is combated.
The concern, awareness, and action of citizens play a crucial role in achieving this goal.  |

| Action outline | Action name | Separate collection and sustainable management of bulky municipal waste |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Action type | Organisational intervention |
| Action description | Bulk waste refers to materials which have no immediate value and are unwanted by their owner, which are produced from household activities (e.g. old or unwanted furniture, unwanted household appliances, mattresses, large toys, suitcases, bicycles, carpets, trolleys, etc.).
Minimizing the amount of bulk waste sent to landfills has a positive impact to the reduction of GHG emissions.
With separate collection of bulk waste, effective recycling becomes more feasible items are more likely to go through appropriate recycling channels, reducing needs for primary materials and energy - intensive production processes. Additionally, it reduces landfill burden, leading to reduced emissions. Another benefit is the minimized transportation.
Collecting bulky waste separately can lead to more efficient transportation, to recycling or processing facilities. This can lead to a decrease in fuel usage and emissions linked to transporting oversized items across significant distances.
Recycling, recovering materials, and reusing these items saves resources and diminish the demand for new materials as well as the production of new goods.
To carry out this, it requires a collaboration among multiple stakeholders, like government entities, citizens, and educational institutions. |

|   | Action type | Organisational intervention  |
|   | Action description | Waste prevention is the first option to minimise waste management costs and maximise environmental and quality of life benefits.
By reducing the total amount of waste generated, waste prevention leads to lower environmental impacts in terms of waste management, landfill use, emissions from transport and resource depletion.
It also helps to conserve valuable natural resources by producing and consuming fewer goods, such as recyclable materials, water and energy. This promotes sustainability and efficient use of resources.
Often, waste prevention means using products for longer through conservation, repair and reuse, increasing the life of goods and reducing the need to purchase new items.
Less waste means less energy consumed.
Savings are also significant, as waste disposal fees, purchase costs and maintenance costs of waste management infrastructure are reduced.  |

|  Comments on implementation | According to NWMP (2020-2030), the goal is to mitigate the volume of waste that is sent to sanitary landfills. The hierarchy of actions regarding the management of municipal solid waste indicates that the most preferable solution is waste prevention, followed by reuse. Next in line is material recycling, and then other types of recovery, with energy recovery being the most common. The worst option in waste management is the disposal in sanitary landfills.

The main actions to achieve this goal include strengthening existing separate collection initiatives and integrating new ones, such as the establishment of a Creative Materials Reuse Center, the implementation and operation of GPs and the installation of RCs.

The proper preparation and implementation of separate green waste collection require a set of resources, including equipment (containers, waste collection vehicles, weighing machines, etc.), personnel for program organization and waste collection processes, digital media, and expenses for awareness and outreach activities.

|   | Comments on implementation | According to NWMP (2020-2030), the goal is to establish separate collection of SQHW (85 %) and develop related infrastructure throughout the country. As SQHW are characterized small quantities of hazardous waste that can be mixed with municipal solid waste and include insect repellents, agricultural pesticides, cleaners, fluorescent lamps, inks, paints, medications, etc. The main actions to achieve this goal include strengthening existing separate collection initiatives and integrating new ones, such as the establishment of a Creative Materials Reuse Center and the implementation and operation of GPs.

Until the installation of these facilities takes place, it is recommended to place special bins, on a pilot scale, for the collection of Small Quantities of Hazardous Waste that do not fall under an alternative management system (empty containers with hazardous residues, packaging of hazardous construction materials such as paints, varnishes, adhesives, solvents, etc., packaging of chemicals such as detergents, insecticides, shampoos, etc., pressurized containers such as aerosols, non-refillable fire extinguishers). The installation of such bins can be done at points of interest or central locations in order to facilitate the citizens' access. Additionally, as for the collection of expired medicines and other household medical waste, these can be collected in special bins that will be placed in pharmacies and clinics.

Awareness and information of citizens is particularly important for achieving this goal. All actions that promote alternative waste management, beyond the existence of infrastructure and organization by the Municipality, require active participation of the majority of citizens.

|   | Action description | Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) refers to household-originated WEEE that comes from households, as well as commercial, industrial, institutional, and other sources, whose nature and quantity are similar to those of WEEE originating from households and the WEEE that may be used by both private households and users other than private households, which are considered household-originated WEEE.
Today WEEE constitute 4% of municipal waste in the EU. In our country their annual production is estimated at 80,000-115,000 tonnes per year. WEEE has been identified by the Greek legislation as a priority waste stream, due to their hazardous nature, their rapidly increasing volume and the significant impact that the production of electrical and electronic equipment has on the environment.
Separate collection of WEEE allows for the safe disposal of the hazardous materials they contain, such as toxic substances and heavy metals, with care for human health and the environment, and contributes to the development of the Circular Economy, where materials are recycled and reused instead of being discarded.
Also, reduce CO2 emissions and the amount of waste that sent to landfills.
The achievement of this goal will be the result of collaboration among the government, the Municipality, and the citizens.  |

|   |  Action description | Edible fats and oils, during their decomposition, release methane, a gas that is one of the strongest GHG. Large quantities of edible fats and oils are produced in restaurants. Proper separation and recycling of edible fats and oils prevents their disposal in landfills or sewage systems. By diverting them from other waste streams, it is possible to reduce methane emissions and their impact on climate change. Keeping edible fats and oils out of water bodies contributes to their protection and to the protection of aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, it is very important to mention that with the recycling of these materials, it is possible to produce biodiesel and other biofuels, which can be used as RES compared to fossil fuels. The recycling of edible fats and oils contributes to sustainable waste management and enhances recycling and resource recovery. Finally, the separate collection process can raise public awareness of environmental consciousness and the need to maintain sustainable practices in everyday life.  |

|   | Comments on implementation | According to NWMP (2020-2030), the goal is to establish separate collection of municipal edible fats and oils waste (85 %) and develop related infrastructure throughout the country. The main actions to achieve this goal include strengthening existing separate collection initiatives and integrating new ones, such as the implementation and operation of GPs.

The proper preparation and implementation of separate edible fats and oils waste collection require the development of collaborations with specialized waste management companies for the separate collection and management of edible oils is recommended. At a primary level, bins should be placed near large-scale producers (mass catering facilities), as well as specialized bins at selected points, so that edible oil waste generated in households within the Municipality can also be diverted. A dedicated stream for edible oils will operate within the GP.

Awareness and information of citizens is particularly important for achieving this goal. All actions that promote alternative waste management, beyond the existence of infrastructure and organization by the Municipality, require active participation of the majority of citizens. For this reason, an integrated communication framework should be designed to inform the residents about the system.

This is a priority action linked to sustainable management of waste & promotion of circular economy.  |

|  Impact & cost | Comments on implementation | According to NWMP (2020-2030), the goal is to mitigate the volume of waste that is sent to sanitary landfills. Landfilling is the worst option in waste management. Alternative waste management refers to innovative approaches for handling waste, avoiding landfilling.

The main actions to achieve this goal include strengthening existing separate collection initiatives and integrating new ones, such as the establishment of a Creative Materials Reuse Center, the implementation and operation of GPs and the installation of RCs.

The proper preparation and implementation of separate collection of various waste streams require a set of resources, including equipment (containers, waste collection vehicles, weighing machines, etc.), personnel for program organization and waste collection processes, digital media, and expenses for awareness and outreach activities. The members of the Project Team involved in the design and operation of this waste management plan will be responsible for determining this equipment, conducting market research, finding the necessary sources of funding, etc.

Awareness and information of citizens is particularly important for achieving this goal. All actions that promote alternative waste management, beyond the existence of infrastructure and organization by the Municipality, require active participation of the majority of citizens. For this reason, an integrated communication framework should be designed to inform the residents about the system.

The MSW Treatment Plant of Western Thessaly is currently under construction. The plant includes mechanical pretreatment and composting in order to achieve high landfill diversion rates. Residual streams will be converted to RDF/SRF in order to get incinerated. The operation of this plant is key to achieving the target.

This is a priority action linked to sustainable management of waste & promotion of circular economy.  |

|   |  Comments on implementation | Green roofs and walls are common practices in sustainable buildings. An important advantage of them is that their construction does not require additional space, which is difficult to find within a city, but is carried out on existing buildings. It is estimated that the action scale of green roofs and walls will reach 10% of the total surface area of the city's buildings. The installation of green roofs and walls will start on municipal buildings, serving as a good example for citizens to follow. Target areas for green roofs and walls are areas with high building density, where they can have a bigger impact.
The construction of any green roofs or walls must include eco-friendly and durable materials, reducing the project's carbon footprint during its whole life cycle. Following construction, maintenance plans need to be developed and staff trained to ensure the longevity and effectiveness of the green roofs/walls. In addition, the city will install systems to monitor the performance of said projects in areas like reduction of stormwater runoff or heat island effect, carbon sequestration, energy demand reduction and air quality improvement.
It is important that in every building where a green roof or wall is to be implemented, the necessary design and construction studies are conducted (structural stability, insulation, moisture control, selection of native plants - plants that thrive in the city's climate etc).  |

|   | Action description | Green pavements, or eco-pavements or sustainable pavements, refer to innovative and environmentally friendly approaches to designing and constructing road surfaces and walkways.

• Permeable Pavements: help manage stormwater runoff, reduce flooding, and recharge groundwater.
• Porous Asphalt and Concrete: their structure allows water to flow through them, which means that they can help in preventing surface water accumulation and runoff, reducing the risk of erosion.
• Cool Pavements: they reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat than the traditional asphalt or concrete surfaces. They help mitigate the urban heat island effect, reduce surface temperatures, and lower energy consumption for cooling buildings.
• Solar Pavements: Incorporating solar panels or materials with embedded solar capabilities into road surfaces to produce renewable energy directly from the pavement.
• Vegetated Pavements: include grass pavers or paver systems filled with vegetation. They allow for some greenery within urban areas. They can help in stormwater management.
• Bicycle and Pedestrian-Friendly Pavements: ex. wider sidewalks, bike lanes, and shared spaces. They promote alternative transportation methods and pedestrian safety.
• Recycled Materials: they can incorporate recycled materials, such as recycled asphalt or recycled concrete aggregates. In this way, the demand for virgin resources is reduced and the environmental footprint of pavement construction is getting lower.  |

Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

|   |  | The choice of the type of Green Pavements to achieve the best results will be chosen according to the requirements of the Municipality, as well as the choice of the locations where the Green Pavements will be created will be based on the climatic and morphological characteristics of the area.

Green Pavements can significantly enhance the urban design of the city, offering both environmental and aesthetic benefits.

Benefits:
• Stormwater Management: they reduce stormwater runoff and improve water quality by filtering pollutants.
• Environmental Sustainability: sustainable construction techniques and the use of recycled materials minimize the environmental impact of pavement projects.
• Reduced Heat Island Effect: they reflect more sunlight and reduce localized heating.
• Improved Air Quality: incorporation of some materials can help capture and reduce air pollutants.
• Enhanced Aesthetics: artistic designs can enhance the visual appeal of urban areas.

Green pavements play an important role in increasing the amount of green space in urban areas, as they include plants, trees and flowers. Their use improves air quality, provides shade, reduces temperature and contributes to biodiversity. They are also good for social cohesion, as they can be places for meeting, relaxation, exercise, walking, etc. and thus improve the physical and mental health of citizens and reduce stress. Green pavements help absorb carbon dioxide from the air and can act as filters for water and reduce flooding.

The creation of more resilient and eco-friendly communities is a vital issue. To accomplish this goal requires the cooperation of Municipality, citizens, government and construction industry.  |

|   |  Comments on implementation | Green pavements can be an important addition to the urban design of the city, with environmental and aesthetic advantages. Their implementation will require careful planning, both in the selection of installation areas and in construction studies. The special climatic and morphological characteristics of the city and the application area should be taken into account for the selection of the type of Green Pavement that will have the best results.

The materials used for green pavement construction are going to have a small carbon footprint, high durability and high solar reflectance. Furthermore, the plants selected will have low maintenance and water requirements, while they will thrive in the city's climatic conditions.

It is particularly important to design a maintenance plan for the pavements in question, so that their effectiveness does not decrease. The municipality staff should be trained in the maintenance of green pavements. Proper maintenance also ensures a beautiful aesthetic result, in addition to efficiency, that can have a positive effect on the awareness of citizens.

As mentioned for green roofs, the city will establish a system to monitor the performance of green sidewalks regarding stormwater runoff, heat island effects, or improvement of air quality etc. These accurate data will be used for GHG inventories, strategic climate planning and adjustments to increase efficiency.  |

|  Comments on implementation | Commercial buildings and facilities present the second largest energy consumption after residential buildings. Given that in commercial buildings the energy consumption ranges from 358,4 to 1480,9 kWh/m2, compared to residential energy consumption estimated at 406,0 kWh/m2, the need for extensive energy retrofitting of commercial buildings is evident. The Municipality, in collaboration with the Technical Chamber of Greece (Trikala department) and Trikala Climate Team that will be created, will proceed to record all the commercial buildings of the city, with detailed information about the owner, the surface area, the existing energy efficiency, etc. It is recommended that the energy upgrade starts from the oldest buildings or the buildings that show the lowest energy efficiency. In addition, large buildings such as supermarkets and hotels should be prioritised, compared to small shops and offices. Finally, the Municipality will contact large franchise companies that operate stores in the city for their energy upgrade, as these companies have the financial ability to support the action. However, the Municipality must offer technical and financial support to smaller businesses that want to proceed with an energy upgrade of their space, in order to ensure equality. One of the main goals of the One-Stop-Shop that is presented at Part C of the Action Plan, is the support of these small businesses. The materials used for commercial building energy retrofitting are going to have a small carbon footprint and be sustainable during their whole life cycle. Any construction waste produced during renovations will be sustainably managed and recycled. The secondary products from recycling will be used in the same buildings or in other projects within the city, where and when it is possible. The importance of training local engineers, builders and craftsmen in the principles of sustainable and green building is highlighted, so that they can implement such projects within their city. The energy renovation study will be carried out separately for each building, in order to take into account their distinct characteristics and design the appropriate projects to achieve the goal of reducing energy consumption.  |

Choosing to build new NZEBs is preferable and easier than converting existing buildings into NZEBs as they can choose to use environmentally friendly materials from the start and integrate energy saving systems. However, the renovation in existing buildings to NZEBs plays a crucial role in transitioning toward a sustainable and energy-efficient built environment.
NZEBs try to achieve a balance between energy consumption and renewable energy generation, so they produce as much energy as they consume over the course of a year.

|   | NZEB is a special sustainable and energy efficiency category for buildings and they are characterised by strict standards. It is estimated that existing buildings that will be renovated in order to satisfy the NZEB definition will present energy savings up to 80%, meaning their final energy consumption is going to be 81,2 kWh/m². Reaching these levels of energy savings is not easy, especially for existing buildings. In order for the action to succeed, buildings built in the last 20 years should be selected, so that their original characteristics allow the achievement of the target in terms of energy consumption. Moreover, the cost to energy upgrade a new building is comparatively less than an older building. In any case, the Municipality should select buildings whose energy upgrading will contribute to the achievement of the energy saving and emission reduction targets estimated below.

Residential buildings are usually owned by construction companies or citizens. Especially the latter may face financial difficulties that do not allow them to energy retrofit their homes. It is important for the government and the municipality to create funding schemes. The One-Stop-Shop will support residence owners that wish to renovate their properties.

The materials used during the energy retrofitting of residential buildings should be sustainable and have small carbon footprints. Construction waste from the projects will be managed according to Circular Economy principles. Recycled construction waste will be used in projects within the city or even the same buildings where they came from, if it is applicable.

It is important to include local engineers, builders and artisans in these projects in order to educate them on sustainable and environmentally friendly construction practices.

The energy renovation study will be carried out separately for each building, in order to take into account their distinct characteristics and design the appropriate projects to achieve the goal of reducing energy consumption.

|   | Action description | The production of energy at a local level us crucial for strengthening renewable energy production, promoting energy democracy, and reducing energy poverty. Saving energy and creating a network for generating electricity from renewable sources are within the hands of citizens. This can be achieved by upgrading the energy efficiency of their buildings and installing RES on available surfaces. In this way, citizens can transition from being energy consumers to energy producers, contributing excess energy they generate back to the grid, efficiently using it as a battery.

If this is done on a large scale, it can create an energy community capable of producing sufficient electricity to meet many of its own needs. As buildings become more energy-efficient, they will require less energy to create comfortable conditions for occupants.

Energy communities continue to face various obstacles to their development, including:
• Restrictive national legal framework
• Limited access to national electricity grids
• A general lack of policy support

The future of energy production should be in the hands of the citizens. The Municipality of Trikala will contribute to ensuring that local energy communities can fully participate in decentralizing and democratizing energy systems, fostering sustainable local economic and social development. Local energy production, distribution and consumption are crucial for combating energy poverty.  |

|   |  Comments on implementation | Firstly, a survey will be conducted in order to select the best city district for the pilot project. It is important that the district in question includes buildings with different types of usage. For example, the district should include at least one public building (possibly a school), commercial buildings like shops or offices and residential buildings. The difference between the usage type of the buildings is translated as a difference in their energy needs within a day. For example, a school shows increased energy needs during the morning when it operates. On the contrary, residences show greater energy needs in the evening. Such differences can contribute to the distribution of energy consumption so that the energy balance remains positive.
Responsible bodies will facilitate banks and other investment schemes in providing special financial support programs for local energy communities, particularly in the planning and establishment stages.

# Summary strategy for residual emissions

Residuals emissions refers to the GHG emissions that remain even after implementing all feasible reduction measures. These emissions are arise from various sources and may be impossible to fully eliminate. To offset residual emissions, individuals or organizations often engage in activities or mechanisms that either remove an equivalent amount of GHG from the atmosphere or prevent their release. Offset mechanisms encompass strategies or initiatives designed to counterbalance these lingering emissions, usually achieved by investing in projects that mitigate or eliminate an equivalent volume of GHG from the air. A common method to offset residual emissions is investing in carbon offset projects. These projects can include renewable energy initiatives (such as wind or solar power), reforestation projects, methane capture from landfills, endeavors promoting sustainable agriculture practices. These projects result in measurable emissions reductions.

Another method for offsetting residual emissions is the purchase of carbon credits from verified and reputable carbon offset programs. These credits represent a reduction or removal of greenhouse gas emissions, and their purchase helps funding projects that contribute to emission reduction. Carbon credits are tradable on the carbon market, with businesses often purchasing them to offset their emissions and compensate for their carbon footprint. The purchaser can use these carbon credits to offset a portion of their own emissions. This means that emissions that cannot entirely be eliminated can be offset by supporting projects that reduce or remove an equivalent amount of GHG. Thus, the concept behind carbon credits is to create a financial incentive for businesses and individuals to invest in emission reduction projects.

Apart from the compliance market, there exist a voluntary carbon market. In this voluntary carbon market, individuals, companies, and organizations engage in the buying and selling carbon credits to offset or compensate for their greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast to compliance markets, where entities are legally obligated to meet emission reduction targets, the voluntary market operates on a voluntary basis, enable participants to voluntarily offset carbon dioxide emissions. Participants in the voluntary market trade carbon credits, representing a reduction or removal of greenhouse gas emissions and measured in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). These credits are generated through various projects that either reduce emissions (e.g., renewable energy projects) or remove carbon from the atmosphere (e.g., afforestation projects).

Afforestation Sustainable management of private forests assumes a critical role in carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and overall environmental well-being. Carbon sequestration in private forests involves the process by which trees and forest ecosystems capture and store carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, contributing to climate change mitigation. Private forest owners or managers can participate in carbon offset projects, implementing practices like reforestation, afforestation, avoided deforestation, and sustainable forest management to enhance carbon sequestration and reduce emissions.

Trikala 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan

According to the GHG inventory (baseline year 2019), residual emissions for the Municipality of Trikala amount to 86,07 kt of CO2e. In order to offset these emissions, the Municipality will invest in green infrastructure through which 3,42 kt of CO2e will be absorbed. The remaining residual emissions (82,65 kt CO2e) will be offset through voluntary carbon market.

The carbon price in the voluntary market is 0.95 $ which is equivalent to 0.87 €. Based on this price, the amount 71.905,5€ is required to offset the remaining residual emissions. Therefore, and taking into account the daily price fluctuations on the market, an investment of 80.000€ is required to compensate for the residual emissions.

The utilization of Carbon Credits from external sources to offset residual emissions within our city's boundaries will be governed by specific regulations and limitations, ensuring a credible demonstration of the city's climate neutrality. This involves the use of officially recognized credits/certificates, rigorously verified and validated by certified third-party auditors, adhering to stringent standards.

These restrictions are implemented to eradicate the potential for 'double-counting' and to establish a framework that guarantees transparency and accountability. It is emphasized that the selection of Carbon Credits should prioritize nearby projects whenever feasible, ideally within our country or at least within the European Union. Additionally, these credits should offer tangible additionality and co-benefits to enhance their environmental impact.

# 3.3. Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

Smart city initiatives will play a crucial role in this monitoring process. By leveraging advanced technologies and data analytics, the city will harness real-time information from various sectors such as energy consumption, transportation, waste management, and other key areas covered by the CCC.

Specifically, through the implementation of the Restart mAI city actions, the establishment of a robust monitoring and evaluation system will enable tracking progress in climate actions across all sectors, ensuring accountability and transparency. The monitoring indicators presented in the action plan and investment plan will be assessed every two years, with progress reports made available to the public. With regular updates, the data will be adaptive, responding to new situations, evolving challenges, and opportunities.

In the renewed contracts, extensive consultations with stakeholders, citizens, and experts will be included. This approach aims to cultivate a sense of shared responsibility and commitment within the community.

The monitoring and enhancement of the CCC will be managed by a specialized team (Trikala Climate Team) as the central organization for monitoring and coordination of all aspects related to the CCC. The Trikala Climate Team will issue a yearly review about the city's progress based on the collected data. The city will establish a specific MEL plan and the frequent reporting of the CCC's progress will support the documents' revisions every 2 years. The citizen and stakeholder forum will be provided with data connected to the indicators, in order to be able to review the city's process. The co-creation and/or adjustment of existing policies will be made based on this reviews.

With the implementation of proposed organizational and governance interventions, the city of Trikala aims to transform the current governance structure into a more collective one. This implies that citizens will be able to participate in decision-making, and a common (collective) decision will be reached by all stakeholders. Essentially, the goal is to achieve a participatory governance model, where all citizens, on an equal footing, can decide and take responsibility for climate mitigation practices and the achievement of climate neutrality.

The main governance innovation is the Creation of a platform for information and citizen participation in Local Governance. This platform will necessarily bring about changes in the way the local authority works to date and will bridge the gap between citizens and government. City processes become more democratic, with respect for citizens' views, while at the same time public trust increases.

Additionally, to achieve climate neutrality, it is essential to plan for organisational and administrative innovations and to promote inclusiveness, trust and legitimacy of the necessary actions. The actions - solutions proposed are the creation of a One-stop shop for energy renovation on buildings, which is a specialised service designed to provide extensive assistance and resources to property owners or managers aiming to improve the energy efficiency and sustainability of their buildings. Also, creation of a municipal ESCO with the establishment of a business entity that provides energy-related services to the municipality, energy efficiency and sustainability solutions to public facilities and municipal infrastructure and has as main objectives the reduction of energy consumption, improvement of energy efficiency and renewable energy

generation. Another intervention is the creation of a municipal climate team (Trikala Climate Team), which provides technical assistance and coordination services to the municipality, thus contributing to the transition towards climate neutrality.

The implementation of innovative energy storage technologies for RES, is crucial to improve the reliability, efficiency and sustainability of the grid. In addition, the promotion of using recycled and recyclable, renewable and sustainable materials can reduce the need to extract and process new resources, which often require large amounts of energy and contribute to carbon emissions.

In addition, GPP's is an important action to be implemented because there are many benefits which they offer. They are defined by the European Commission as the process by which fiscal authorities seek to contract goods, services and with less environmental studies throughout their life cycle, compared to goods, services and works that perform the same primary function that would be the subject of the contract under other circumstances.

Some of the benefits which they offer are their contribution to saving resources for the public sector, in particular when the life-cycle costs of the good, service or work are taken into account rather than just the purchase price, and are directly linked to the principles of the Circular Economy.

The promotion of waste reduction, resource conservation and creative inspiration is achieved through the creation of a Centre for Creative Reuse of Materials which contributes to climate neutrality.

Furthermore, the implementation of the PAYT waste management system, where residents are charged based on the amount of waste they generate, puts in place source separation, separate collection of biowaste and recyclable materials and thus reduces the amount of green waste and consequently the final quantities sent to landfills.

Equally important is the creation of Recycling Corners (RCs) and Green Points (GPs), where a GP is defined as a public or private very small space where citizens can deposit separately collected recyclable municipal waste or used items in appropriate containers, which are collected by the local authority for reuse, preparation for reuse or recycling, and a RC is a designated and configured area with appropriate building infrastructure and equipment, organised by the Municipality, where citizens deposit separately collected recyclable materials (e.g. paper, glass, metal, plastic, textiles, edible oils or used items and equipment (such as clothes, furniture, electrical and electronic equipment) in order to be forwarded for recycling or reuse.

RCs raise public awareness of recycling and environmental responsibility by increasing the visibility and accessibility of recycling, and the development of RCs contributes substantially to the adoption of national policy on solid waste management, the promotion of waste prevention, the promotion of reuse and recycling activities, the diversion of waste from landfills, the recycling of household waste the separate collection of paper, metal, plastic and glass, etc.

Finally, the action on Near Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) is very important. NZEB are highly energy-efficient buildings that require minimal energy for heating, cooling and general operations, while the remaining energy needs are largely met by renewable sources and achieve energy cost reductions, CO2 emission reductions, energy efficiency improvements and health improvements.

During the implementation of these actions, citizens actively participate in greenhouse gas emission mitigation policies. They engage in separate waste collection, participate in the Center for Creative Reuse of Materials, and find personalized solutions for building renovation through the One-stop shop for energy renovations, aiming to reduce emission rates from their buildings. Additionally, through Climate Neutrality Hub, citizens can stay informed, receive education through educational programs, seminars, campaigns, etc., and adopt sustainable practices.

Achieving climate neutrality requires a multifaceted approach that includes enhancing citizen participation, raising awareness, educating the public, and mobilizing economic resources. Forums and participatory platforms play a crucial role in fostering open dialogue and idea exchange among citizens, stakeholders, and local government bodies. These platforms provide valuable spaces for community feedback, ensuring that the voices of citizens are heard and considered in the formulation of climate policies and initiatives. By bringing together experts, policymakers, and community members, these forums facilitate the collaborative design of solutions that promote climate neutrality and address local environmental challenges. Through this process of open communication and collaboration, stakeholders can review the current situation, collectively address challenges, identify innovative solutions, and propose ways to integrate best practices into updating Climate City Contract.

Educational campaigns play a vital role in citizen participation in climate action. Specifically, through these actions, climate challenges are deeply understood, the necessity of action is recognized, and information and resources regarding sustainable practices are provided. This promotes behavioral and mindset change regarding climate issues and enhances the environmental awareness of citizens and stakeholders. This empowerment leads to tangible contributions to climate neutrality, as individuals adopt more sustainable behaviors and practices.

Feedback through digital platforms facilitates real time communication and interaction with citizens regarding climate-related matters. By actively seeking input and suggestions from the public, these platforms help policymakers and organizations gain deeper insights into community priorities and preferences. This enhanced understanding enables more targeted and effective climate interventions to be implemented.

Incentive programs offer financial rewards or other benefits to encourage the adoption of climate-friendly practices and investments. These programs incentivize actions such as transitioning to renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency, and mitigating carbon emissions. By providing tangible rewards for such initiatives, incentive programs motivate both individuals and businesses to actively contribute to achieving climate neutrality objectives.

Overall, citizen engagement interventions play a pivotal role in advancing climate neutrality by fostering collaboration, raising awareness, empowering individuals, and incentivizing sustainable actions at both the community and individual levels. Through these collective efforts, society can move closer to achieving a more sustainable and climate-neutral future.

As part of stakeholder engagement, the Municipality of Trikala has implemented a targeted strategy to enhance participatory planning, emphasize the importance of transitioning to climate neutrality, and raise citizens' environmental awareness. Annex 1 delineates the engagement strategy and offers illustrative examples of initiatives. These examples include detailed descriptions accompanied by photographic evidence, providing a comprehensive view of the community's dedication to sustainability and citizen involvement

At the Mobility and Transport as well as the Urban Sustainability sectors, Trikala has developed the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, Electric Vehicles Charging Plan and Sustainable Urban Development Strategy. Current actions connected to these plans are Regeneration of 2 central squares, Creation of an extensive bicycle network, Repurpose of 2 municipal buildings and a former military camp and Procurement of micromobility means and promotion of electromobility. These activities have been incorporated into the CCC, as Reduced motorised passenger transportation need, Shift to public and non-motorised transport, Electrification of cars, buses and trucks and Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions.

The Local Waste Action Plan is mandatory for every Greek municipality. Based on the national waste strategy, Environmental Development Agency of Western Thessaly (PADYTH) S.A. currently constructing a new waste management plant. At the same time, Trikala in collaboration with PADYTH SA will establish a Green Point and Recycling Corners, while also implement a Pay as you Throw pilot program. All the above actions are included in the CCC, under the Waste &amp; Circular economy sector where all the actions aim at the separate collection and sustainable management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and the reduction of landfilled waste under 10%.

Last but not least, Trikala City has developed a Smart City Strategic Plan which is integrated within the CCC under Smart City solutions. Smart action include Horizontal actions, Mobility actions, Health and social actions, Energy Actions, Action of civil protection and environment, Actions related to water sources, Actions related to waste management, Actions of economic development and construction, Participation Actions and Connectivity actions.

These actions have passed the stage of approval and financing and the majority of them are already being implemented. However, because they have not been completed, they are included again as actions in the CCC, so that there is an overall road map towards climate neutrality. It is pointed out that special importance has been given to avoiding double counting of emissions reduction.

## 2. Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

The City of Trikala is steadfast in its commitment to achieving climate neutrality by 2030. To fulfill this objective, Trikala is actively implementing climate action measures, ensuring the city meets its target within the designated timeframe. Importantly, these actions are undertaken with a dedication to equity and inclusivity, ensuring that no individual or community is overlooked or left behind during the process.

The first step in developing a climate action strategy requires the creation of a greenhouse gases (GHG) inventory. The purpose of the inventory is to quantify the sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, which are responsible for climate change. A comprehensive GHG inventory allows cities to take focused action against climate change.

It's worth noting that the geographic boundary aligned with Trikala's 2030 climate neutrality target is smaller than the city's administrative boundary, focusing primarily on the Trikala municipal unit. This unit, representing the core city, accommodates 80% of the municipality's total inhabitants, making it the sole urban center within the administrative boundaries. The density of the Trikala unit is 886.6 persons/km², emphasizing its urban nature and relevance for targeted interventions.

Taking 2019 as a baseline year, Trikala has analysed the current state and classified emissions from city activities into five main sectors. The greenhouse gas inventory was

conducted according to the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories (GPC). Using the BASIC+ inventory level, the total greenhouse gas emissions amount to 467.714,66 metric tons of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ . This corresponds to 7,59 metric tons of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$  per citizen per year. Emissions per source sector for Trikala city, are:

Stationary Energy: 393.504,16 tn  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$
Transportation: 45.198,83 tn  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$
Waste: 26.599,46 tn  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$
IPPU: 2.419,46 tn  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$
AFOLU: -7,26 tn  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$

The Stationary Energy sector constitutes  $84.1\%$  of the city's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Following, the Transportation sector emerges as the second-largest source of GHG emissions, contributing  $9.7\%$  to the overall total. The Waste sector contributes  $5.7\%$  to the city's total GHG emissions, while the Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) sector makes up  $0.5\%$  of the total GHG emissions.

Implementing the action portfolio to reach climate neutrality, Trikala's remaining emissions to be offset are 86,07 kt  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ . The current situation in the city using the Business As Usual (BAU) 2030 approach and the remaining emissions after the Action Plan are shown in Figure 2.

The target of climate neutrality for Trikala involves achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily through emission reduction, investment in green technologies, and preservation/enhancement of the natural environment. Net zero cities, including Trikala, prioritize measures across various sectors like transportation, energy, waste management, and buildings. These measures focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, and sector-specific actions to achieve climate neutrality.

Specific key measures that Trikala will concentrate on to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 include energy-saving measures in all buildings, sustainable transport and mobility systems,

## 6. Sustainable management of waste &amp; promotion of circular economy

The sustainable management of waste emerges as a pivotal factor in the pursuit of climate neutrality, primarily through the attenuation of methane emissions emanating from landfills, and the advocacy for recycling and the circular economy paradigm. Landfills, renowned as substantial sources of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, are targeted for mitigation through the adoption of sustainable waste management practices, prominently including recycling and composting. These practices not only divert significant quantities of waste away from landfills but concurrently curtail the release of methane emissions, thus aligning with climate neutrality objectives.

The incorporation of a circular economy framework, exemplified by recycling initiatives, plays a dual role in fostering climate neutrality. Primarily, the recycling process diminishes the demand for raw material extraction and manufacturing, activities inherently linked to greenhouse gas emissions. Secondly, by extending the life cycle of materials through recycling, a pivotal contribution is made to resource conservation, concurrently mitigating the carbon footprint associated with the production of new commodities. This approach underscores the symbiotic relationship between sustainable waste management practices, the circular economy, and the overarching objective of climate neutrality.

The citizen-centric governance model and the Restart mAI city constitute the primary and immediate priorities set by Trikala. On one hand, active citizen participation in local governance leads to co-designing the city's strategy, while on the other, digitising city processes makes participation more accessible and allows for goal monitoring. Through these two key priorities emerge the four pillars of climate actions by and for the citizens.

The priorities of decarbonising electricity &amp; heating generation and energy renovation &amp; efficient utilization of building stock are directly interconnected and linked to the Built environment sector. As indicated by the GHG inventory, buildings represent the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Trikala, underscoring the importance of reducing their carbon footprint. Upgrading a building typically involves simultaneous energy renovation and decarbonising electricity and heating generation through the installation of residential renewable energy sources and heat pumps.

3
Simultaneously, households and businesses in the city are directly linked to waste production and management. The energy renovation and efficient utilization of building stock will promote awareness among users regarding waste management issues, fostering a more circular character for buildings.

Finally, through the citizen-centric governance model and smart city solutions, there is significant promotion of the shift to public and non-motorized transport for a more sustainable city. The comprehensive integration of these strategic priorities reflects a holistic approach to achieving climate neutrality in Trikala, emphasizing the active involvement of citizens and the incorporation of innovative technologies for a greener and more sustainable urban future.

Figure 4 presents the six strategic priorities of Trikala's journey towards climate neutrality and showcases the number of actions linked with each one of them. The citizen-centric governance model and the Restart mAI city are seen as a foundational systemic approach within the city's climate planning, enabling the realisation of other goals and the creation of an inclusive, fair and sustainable ecosystem in Trikala.

The city of Trikala is embarking on an ambitious initiative, necessitating the redesign of its urban operational model, the development of a collaborative network, and the exploration of funding sources. Within the next three years, the city aims to implement all smart city actions, creating a comprehensive and reliable database to monitor its progress toward climate neutrality.

City forums: Comprising citizens, businesses, and organizations pertinent to specific intervention domains, these committees will provide local insights, expertise, and ideas crucial for implementing key actions outlined in the CCC. Regularly organized by the Municipality, they serve as platforms for collaboration, information sharing, co-design and transparency.
Participatory Platforms: The Municipality operates a public consultation platform to ensure that proposed actions align with local needs. On this platform, individuals and organizations can collaborate and communicate to draft and refine climate policies, among other initiatives. This approach fosters a sense of commitment among participants and enhances transparency. However, the platform has not been widely utilized, prompting the creation of new participatory tools to attract a broader audience.
Educational campaigns: Creating a culture of environmental responsibility premises the continuation of educational campaigns targeting citizens and stakeholders. The campaigns include workshops, seminars and awareness programs to educate the public about climate neutrality, sustainability and the importance of collaborations between different actors.

City Media: In addition to the Municipality's social media accounts and website, dedicated platforms have been established to promote Trikala's journey towards climate neutrality. These specialized websites and social media accounts serve as central hubs for disseminating information about climate action initiatives, goals, and progress, ensuring easy access for the community. These include:

Trikala Municipality Website
Trikala Municipality Facebook Page
Trikala Municipality X (former Twitter) Account
Trikala Municipality YouTube Channel
Trikala Municipality Instagram Profile
Trikala Municipality TikTok Profile
Trikala2030 Website
Trikala2030 LinkedIn Page

All media outlets and webpages adhere to a standardized set of references, logos, and hashtags (#Trikala2030, #netzerocities, #climateneutrality, #missioncities) when discussing the Mission for "100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" and Trikala's pursuit of climate neutrality. This ensures a cohesive visual identity across platforms and reinforces our commitment to this important initiative.

Incentive programs: Through "Restart MAi City" program, the Municipality will create incentive programs and citizen engagement applications to attract citizens and businesses to actively participate in climate policies. This involves recognition for sustainable practices and rewards through a digital local currency, called Tricoin.

## 3. CCC progress monitoring

The realisation of Restart mAI city actions will allow for the implementation of a robust monitoring and evaluation system to track the progress of climate actions, ensuring accountability and transparency. The monitoring indicators presented in Action and Investment Plan will be regularly assessed and progress reports will be available to the public. This way a sense of shared responsibility and community engagement is fostered. Monitoring and progress reports can greatly support regular CCC iterations based on data-driven insights, allowing Trikala to refine strategies and reallocate resources for maximum impact.

## 4. CCC iterations

Trikala commits to a dynamic and iterative process of CCC every two years, ensuring that climate action plans remain adaptive and responsive to new situations, evolving challenges and opportunities.

# 5. Attracting funding and investors

One of the biggest challenges is funding the climate actions. Trikala will actively seek funding from various sources, including national and EU grants, private investors, banks and sustainable finance mechanisms. It is important for the city to create an attractive investment environment by highlighting the economic benefits of climate projects, emphasizing long-term results and offering incentives for green initiatives. The city will establish collaborative platforms to connect local businesses, investors and financial institutions interested in supporting Trikala's climate plan.

# 6. Trikala Climate team

In Trikala, a specialized Climate team, consisting of a dedicated team and representatives from pertinent municipal departments, will oversee and coordinate the monitoring and updating of the Climate City Contract (CCC). Serving as the focal point for all CCC-related activities, Trikala Climate Team will possess the requisite expertise to evaluate and monitor progress comprehensively. Through diligent oversight, it will play a pivotal role in ensuring that the city remains aligned with its climate neutrality objectives by 2030.

Smart city actions will play a pivotal role in this monitoring process. Implementing advanced technologies and data analytics, the city will leverage real-time information from various sectors such as energy consumption, transportation, waste management, and other key areas covered by the CCC. These smart city initiatives will provide valuable insights and enable prompt adjustments to the CCC based on the evolving needs and challenges faced by the city.

Monitoring indicators are suggested in Action and Investment Plan, to quantify and assess the city's progress toward climate neutrality. These indicators cover a range of factors, including greenhouse gas emissions reduction, energy efficiency improvements, renewable energy integration, and other relevant metrics, as well as economic and financial fields. Regular assessments and evaluations, conducted in collaboration with stakeholders and utilizing data from smart city initiatives, will inform updates to the CCC. The iterative nature of this process, combined with periodic CCC iterations every two years, ensures that the city remains adaptable and responsive to emerging opportunities and challenges in its pursuit of climate neutrality.

# Key Principles

Climate action design necessitates not only technical and environmental considerations, but also social principles to guarantee that solutions are equitable, inclusive, and responsive to community needs and ambitions. The key principles that will guide Trikala city while it implements its Climate City Contract are:

Equity and justice

By incorporating equity and justice into the design of climate action, we can develop more comprehensive and effective responses to climate change while working towards a more just and inclusive society. This approach recognizes that climate change is not merely an environmental issue, but that it intersects with social and economic factors, requiring a holistic, people-centred approach.
Community engagement

Community engagement is an important aspect of effectively addressing climate change. By engaging communities in the planning, decision-making and implementation of climate change initiatives, we can develop more inclusive, resilient and impactful solutions to climate change challenges at the local level.

Inclusivity

Inclusivity is an essential element of effective climate action. By taking into account a wide range of perspectives, involving all stakeholders, and addressing the specific needs of vulnerable communities, we can create more robust and equitable solutions to combat climate change. Climate change is a global challenge that requires a collective effort, and inclusivity is fundamental in ensuring that no one is left behind in the journey towards a sustainable and resilient future.

Capacity building

Capacity building refers to the process of strengthening the knowledge, skills and resources of individuals, organizations, and communities to effectively address the challenges and opportunities presented climate change. This includes providing training, education and support to increase the capacity of stakeholders to understand, plan, implement and monitor climate related initiatives.

Resilience and adaptation

By adopting resilience and adaptation strategies, societies can better manage the impacts of climate change, reduce vulnerability and create a more sustainable and climate-resilient future for future generations. Resilience means anticipating climate risk and preparing to adapt to changing conditions and recover from climate-related disruption. Adaptation involves the adaptation of human systems, practices and behaviors to address the current and projected impacts of climate change.

Cultural Preservation

Incorporating cultural preservation into climate action ensures that efforts to address climate change are not only environmentally focused but also socially and culturally sensitive. Climate change poses significant threats to cultural heritage and traditions, making cultural preservation an essential aspect of climate action. Cultural preservation in the context of climate change refers to safeguarding the tangible and intangible aspects of a community's culture, history, and identity from the impacts of climate change.

Affordability and accessibility

To ensure affordability and accessibility in climate action, policymakers and stakeholders must consider the needs and circumstances of diverse communities. This involves providing financial support, incentives, and subsidies where necessary, as well as designing policies that prioritize equitable outcomes.

# 1. Introduction

Climate change is the greatest global environmental challenge

Climate change refers to the long-term alteration of Earth's climate patterns, predominantly caused by human activities that release excessive greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial processes, and agriculture are major contributors to the heightened concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases, trapping heat and leading to a warming planet. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and alarming, including rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and wildlife.

Moreover, climate change exacerbates food insecurity as changing weather patterns disrupt agricultural systems and decrease crop yields. The availability of clean water is also at risk due to the alteration of precipitation patterns and increased evaporation rates. Additionally, climate change contributes to the spread of diseases as shifting temperatures create favourable conditions for disease vectors like mosquitoes.

It is imperative that we take immediate action to mitigate the impacts of climate change by transitioning to renewable energy sources, implementing sustainable land-use practices, and adopting eco-friendly policies. Furthermore, education and awareness campaigns are crucial in promoting behavioural changes that reduce carbon emissions and promote environmental stewardship.

According to the European Commission, cities occupy only 4% of the EU's land area, but gather 75% of its citizens. Moreover, cities consume over 65% of the world's energy and they are source for more than 70% of global CO₂ emissions. It is clear that cities can play an important role in the effort to tackle climate change.

Horizon Europe research and innovation programme 2021-2027 innovates by creating the Cities Mission to deliver 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030. Trikala city is one of the participants, aiming to act as a center for innovations and a role model for all European cities.

The first step in developing a climate action strategy requires the creation of a greenhouse gases (GHG) inventory. Cities can use an inventory to comprehend how different community activities contribute to emissions. A comprehensive GHG inventory allows cities to take focused action against climate change.

# 2. Trikala City

## 2.1. General information

Municipality of Trikala consists of 8 municipal geographical units. Trikala unit which is basically the city of Trikala, gathers 80% of the total municipality citizens making it the only urban center within the municipality's administrative boundary.

Trikala city has a population of 61.653 citizens (2011) and occupy a land area of 69,93 km². Trikala has a population density of more than 880 inhabitants/km², whereas the 7 remaining municipal units altogether account for approximately 100 inhabitants/km².

## 2.2. Morphology and climate data

Trikala regional unit is the most mountainous of Thessaly. Two large rivers of Greece, Acheloos and Pineos, flow through it. One of the tributaries of Pinios is the Litheos, on whose banks Trikala city is built.

The climate in Trikala, as in the whole of Thessaly, is continental with large temperature differences between winter and summer. The average annual temperature is 16-17 °C in the lowlands and lower in the mountains. Due to the river Litheos, the relative humidity in Trikala is quite high.

## 2.3. Local economy

Trikala's regional unit economy is mainly agricultural. In the lowlands, cereals and vegetables are grown using modern agricultural means. Animal breeding is also developed, especially cattle, which has created corresponding milk industries. At the same time, the forest wealth is another important economic source for the prefecture.

In recent years, a significant share of revenue has been tourism and the provision of services, as the prefecture receives a large number of visitors throughout the year, being one of the most popular tourist destinations in mainland Greece. It is estimated that about one million tourists visit the regional unit of Trikala both in the summer, but mainly in the winter months. The main tourist destinations are considered to be Meteora, the city of Trikala, the city of Pyli with its unique bridges and monasteries, the traditional settlements of the mountain mass of Pyli, as well as the Ski Center in Pertouli.

# 3. GHG Inventory

## 3.1. Overview

A GHG inventory estimates the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted as a result of the activity occurring within a city's boundary. GHG emissions are accounted for every source/activity and for a specific time span, called baseline year. GHG inventories are necessary for a city to design and realise climate actions. Data reporting is important for several reasons:

Informs about current situation and allows emissions prediction based on different scenarios
Highlights sectors/activities contributing the most to GHG emissions
Helps in goal setting
Allows progress monitoring from implemented climate actions
Improves a city's green profile and encourages climate investments

## 3.2. GPC

The Global Protocol for Community-Scale (GPC) Greenhouse Gas Inventories is a global standard for the calculation and reporting of city-wide GHG emissions, consistent with the 2006 IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

In order to use the GPC, cities must define the inventory boundary. The boundary includes the geographic area, time span, gases and emission sources covered by a GHG inventory. The GPC covers the 7 gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol:

Carbon dioxide (CO₂)
Methane (CH₄)
Nitrous oxide (N₂O)
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
Sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆)
Nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃)

GHG emissions from city activities are classified into six main sectors:

Stationary energy
Transportation
Waste
Industrial processes and product use (IPPU)
Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU)
Any other emissions occurring outside the geographic boundary as a result of city activities

Activities taking place within a city can generate GHG emissions that occur whether inside of outside the city boundary. To distinguish among them, the GPC groups emissions into three categories based on where they occur: scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions.

# 3.3. Reporting requirements

Cities can choose between two reporting levels: BASIC or BASIC+. The BASIC level covers scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from stationary energy and transportation, and also scope 1 and scope 3 emissions from waste.

BASIC+ includes in addition emissions from IPPU, emissions and removals from AFOLU and emissions from transboundary transportation.

# 3.4. Inventory boundary

Extreme environmental pressures are frequently concentrated within cities. At the same time, cities serve as the locations where remedies are being implemented first. As mentioned before, Trikala city gathers 80% of citizens and is the only urban area within the Municipality of Trikala.

Therefore, the geographic boundary of the inventory coincides with the city's boundary.

The inventory's baseline is 2019, because it is the year with the most complete and accurate data available.

The sources' sectors of GHG emissions which should be included in a city's GHG inventory for the purposes of the Cities Mission are Buildings/Stationary Energy, Transport, Waste, IPPU and AFOLU. In light of this, the inventory's reporting level chosen is BASIC+.

# 3.5. Emissions factors

The calculation of greenhouse gases emissions requires the use of standard emission factors based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. These standard factors are based on the carbon content of each fuel, as is the case in national statistical inventories of GHG emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. Where necessary, emission factors specific to the city of Trikala were used based on the methodology proposed in the GPC standard.

Table 3.2. Emission factors for different energy sources and activities.

|  Energy source | Units | CO_{2} | CH_{4} | N_{2}O | CO_{2} (b) | Source  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Electricity from the grid | tn/MWh | 0,606 |  |  |  | National emission factor  |
|  Natural gas | kg/TJ | 56.100 | 1 | 0,1 |  | 2006 IPCC Guidelines  |
|  Liquid gas | kg/TJ | 63.100 | 8,02 | 1,36 |  | 2006 IPCC Guidelines  |
|  Diesel oil | kg/TJ | 74.100 | 0,7 | 0,4 |  | 2006 IPCC Guidelines  |
|  Biomass | tn/MWh |  |  |  | 0,3 | National emission factor  |
|  Motor gasoline | kg/TJ | 69.300 | 22,43 | 1,72 |  | 2006 IPCC Guidelines  |

# 3.6. Emissions units

The unit of measurement for greenhouse gas emissions is defined as a metric ton of each gas (t or tn) and the ton (tn) of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), according to the international system of units (SI).

Carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) enables the comparison between various greenhouse gases, as each of them has a different impact on global warming. The carbon dioxide equivalent is calculated by multiplying the emissions of each of the greenhouse gases by the Global Warming Potential (GWP) over a period of 100 years.

The GWP used for the purpose of this inventory are according to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, which is the most recent one (2013).

Table 3.3. GWP (100 years) of major GHGs.

|  Name | Formula | GWP value in IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (CO₂e)  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Carbon dioxide | CO₂ | 1  |
|  Methane | CH₄ | 28  |
|  Nitrous oxide | N₂O | 265  |

# 3.7. Notation keys

Collecting data is a crucial aspect of developing and regularly updating a GHG inventory. The data will likely originate from diverse sources and will vary in terms of quality, format, and completeness. Often, it will require adjustments to suit the inventory's specific requirements.

Since data availability and emission sources can differ significantly between cities, the GPC mandates the use of notation keys, following the recommendation of the IPCC Guidelines. Notation keys are employed to handle limitations in data availability and to accommodate variations in emission sources. Cities using notation keys must provide an accompanying explanation, justifying any exclusions or partial accounting of GHG emission source categories in their inventory.

Table 3.4. Notation keys (Source: GPC).

|  Notation key | Definition | Explanation  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  IE | Included Elsewhere | GHG emissions for this activity are estimated and presented in another category of the inventory. That category shall be noted in the explanation.  |
|  NE | Not Estimated | Emissions occur but have not been estimated or reported; justification for exclusion shall be noted in the explanation.  |
|  NO | Not Occurring | An activity or process does not occur or exist within the city.  |
|  C | Confidential | GHG emissions which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information and can therefore not be reported.  |

# 3.8. Data quality and uncertainty

To ensure complete transparency in estimating GHG emissions, all data sources and assumptions used, whether obtained through scaling, extrapolation, interpolation, or models, must be properly referenced.

Furthermore, cities must not only identify the method employed for calculating emissions but also evaluate the quality of the activity data and emission factors used. These evaluations should categorize each data aspect as high, medium, or low quality based on various factors. These factors include how well the data represent the geographical location, time or age, and technologies used in the activity, as well as the assessment boundary and emission source. The reliability and verifiability of the data sources are also taken into account during the evaluation process.

Table 3.5. Data quality assessment (Source: GPC).

|  Data quality | Activity data | Emission factor  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  High (H) | Detailed activity data | Specific emission factors  |
|  Medium (M) | Modeled activity data using robust assumptions | More general emission factors  |
|  Low (L) | Highly-modeled or uncertain activity data | Default emission factors  |

# 4. Stationary Energy

## 4.1. Stationary Energy subsectors

The Stationary Energy sector includes emissions from:

Residential buildings
Commercial and institutional buildings and facilities
Manufacturing industries and construction
Energy industries
Agriculture, forestry and fishing activities
Non-specified sources
Fugitive emissions

Some of the above emissions do not occur within the city of Trikala boundary. The existing emissions sectors are analysed below.

## 4.2. Residential buildings

Residential buildings are one of the most important sources of GHG emissions in a city. According to the Energy Efficiency Certificates (EECs) of the Municipality of Trikala for the years 2018-2019 (a total of 6,109 EECs), the need for primary energy for heating in the Municipality's residences is on average 285,6 kWh/m². Considering the total area of residential buildings, the theoretical primary consumptions of the

domestic sector are calculated, which amount to 974.830,8 MWh of thermal energy and 502.328,9 MWh of electrical energy.

Using the appropriate conversion factors and, in the case of thermal energy, the percentage distribution of fuels as well as the 20% reduction due to energy poverty, we have the final consumptions of the household sector.

Table 4.1. Energy consumption in residential buildings.

|  Fuel | Consumption (MWh)  |
| --- | --- |
|  Electricity | 231.488,0  |

|  Biomass | 542.750,6  |
|  Total | 937.573,1  |

## 4.3. Commercial buildings and facilities

The energy consumption in commercial buildings and facilities was calculated with the same method as in residential buildings. The natural gas consumption is an exemption, because there are recorded data from the gas distribution company regarding commercial customers. The theoretical primary consumptions of the commercial sector are 168.028,0 MWh of thermal energy and 567.737,3 MWh of electrical energy.

## 4.4. Institutional buildings and facilities

This category includes energy consumption in buildings of the public sector, such as schools, municipal office buildings, hospitals, street lighting etc. It also includes the city's water supply and drainage system energy consumption. The fact that institutional buildings are public gives an advantage in terms of data accuracy, because there are bills and invoices for the fuels and electricity consumed.

|  Diesel oil | 84.014,0  |
|  Biomass | 10.081,7  |
|  Total | 384.754,4  |

# 4.5. Fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas systems

To calculate the fugitive emissions, which are essentially due to the distribution of natural gas within the city of Trikala, the Greenhouse Gas

Emssions Inventory Report for the Municipality ofAthens was used, as well as data on the length of the natural gas network within the Prefecture of Trikala and in particular the city of Trikala. Specifically, the pipeline length of natural gas systems in Athens is  $762,9\mathrm{km}$ , whereas in Trikala it is  $87,7\mathrm{km}$ .

# 4.6. GHG Emissions from Stationary Energy sources

As it is shown on Table 4.5 the total greenhouse gases emissions from Stationary Energy sources reaches a total of 393.504,16 tn  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ . More specifically, the residential buildings subsector accounts for 176.715,67 tn  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ , the commercial buildings and facilities subsector for 187.212,55 tn  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ , the institutional buildings and facilities subsector for 29.528,96 tn  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$  and the fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas systems for

,99 tn  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ . It is obvious that commercial buildings and facilities energy consumption is responsible for almost half (47,5%) of the Stationary Energy sector's GHG emissions, while residential buildings come close second with 44,9% of the emissions.

In addition to total GHG emissions by city-induced reporting (BASIC+) level, there are 165.850,18 tn

$\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$  of biogenic  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . Biogenic emissions encompass the release of carbon dioxide that arises from burning biomass materials that store and trap  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ , which includes the materials utilized in the production of biofuels. These emissions are reported separately, under the column  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{b})$  and they are not counted in emissions totals according to the GPC protocol.

# 5. Transportation

## 5.1. Transportation sub-sectors

Transport in urban areas contribute significantly in a city's GHG emissions. The Transportation sector includes emissions from:

On-road transportation
Railways
Water-borne transportation
Aviation
Off-road transportation

Some of the above emissions do not occur within the city of Trikala boundary. The existing emissions sectors are analysed below.

## 5.2. On-road transportation

On-road transportation includes vehicles such as buses, trucks, motorcycles, on-road waste collection and transportation vehicles. All the vehicles in Trikala city burn liquid or gaseous fuel in internal combustion engines and currently there are not any electric or hybrid vehicles in the city. The on-road transportation in Trikala includes the municipal fleet and public, private and commercial transport.

The municipal fleet of Trikala consists of vehicles of different types and characteristics which are utilized for the needs of municipal services.

The total annual fuel consumption has been recorded by the Municipality (in liters) and these data were used for the estimation of energy correspondence. All municipal fleet vehicles consume diesel oil. The municipal fleet's energy consumption equals to 2.748 MWh.

In addition, the Municipality of Trikala had recorded data for public transport. All public transport vehicles are also fuelled with diesel oil. The public transport's energy consumption for the baseline year was 23.110,4 MWh.

Regarding private and commercial transport, the monitoring of vehicle movement cannot be based on real data and it is usually based on models suggested by the GPC or other standars. The difficulty in the models lies practically in the accurate calculation of the moving vehicles, the kilometers traveled within a city, the use of different motor fuels by the multiple types of vehicles in circulation, etc.

The total fuel consumption of on-road private and commercial transportation for Trikala city was estimated with the following method:

The Hellenic Statistical Authority records fuel consumption for the Prefecture of Trikala. Using population as a scaling factor, the consumption for Trikala city was estimated.

The municipal fleet and public transport consumptions which are known are then abstracted from the total estimated consumption.
The remaining fuel quantities are considered to roughly correspond to the consumption by the private and commercial transport of the city.

Transboundary journeys are assumed to account for 10% of private and commercial transport journeys.

Table 5.1. Energy consumption in on-road transportation.

|  Fuel | Consumption (MWh)  |
| --- | --- |
|  Liquid gas | 90.132,2  |
|  Diesel oil | 257.568,5  |
|  Motor gasoline | 155.831,2  |
|  Total | 503.531,9  |

# 5.3. Railways

Railways are a widespread means of transport for both people and cargo. Trains are powered by a locomotive, typically using energy through combustion of diesel fuels or electricity.

All railways in Greece are managed by Hellenic Train. Hellenic Train currently owns 13 different types of locomotives, with most of them being diesel powered and only a small portion electric powered.

The railway network of the Trikala region includes the axis of the Trikala-Kalambaka line which, as part of the Paleofarsala-Kalambaka line, has a line of normal gauge (1,44m) and a speed of 120km/h. The railway line passes through the city of Trikala, where the Railway Station of the same name is located. The railway length inside the city boundary is 4,82 km. Daily itineraries run to and from Athens, Thessaloniki, Karditsa and Kalambaka.

The trains that serve this line are diesel powered. Electrification projects in the Palaiofarsalos-Kalambaka section are expected to be tendered and implemented in the next years, contributing significantly to the reduction of emissions.

Scope 1 emissions from railways are estimated based on the total distance travelled within the city boundary for the baseline year and emission factors from a study conducted in Technical University of Thessaly (2018). These emission factors refer to diesel powered locomotives moving within an urban area and they are:

3,35 g CO₂/km
0,16 g CH₄/km
1,12 g N₂O/km

Scope 3 emissions from transboundary railway journeys are estimated based on Greece's 2019 National Inventory Report (NIR), using population as a scaling factor.

# 5.4. GHG Emissions from Transportation sources

As it is shown on Table 5.3 the total greenhouse gases emissions from Transportation sources reaches a total of 45.195,62 tn  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ . GHG emissions from on-road transportation account for almost  $100\%$  of these emissions. It is important to highlight that all GHG emissions from the Transportation sector are included in scope 1.

# 6. Waste

## 6.1. Waste sub-sectors

The consumption of goods leads to the production of large waste amounts. Waste treatment and disposal activities emit greenhouse gases, especially if the disposal sites are illegal. The Waste sector includes emissions from:

Solid waste disposal in landfills or dump sites, including disposal in an unmanaged site, disposal in a managed dump or disposal in a sanitary landfill
Biological treatment of solid waste
Incineration and open burning of waste
Wastewater treatment and discharge

Some of the above emissions do not occur within the city of Trikala boundary. The existing emissions sectors are analysed below.

## 6.2. Solid waste disposal

The total amount of Municipal Solid Waste that was landfilled in Trikala sanitary landfill and were produced from Trikala Municipality for the baseline year equals to 25.275,73 tn. Trikala's sanitary landfill is located outside the city boundary. The landfill uses the software LandGEM - Landfill Gas Emissions Model, Version 3.03 that is created from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

This software provides a relatively simple approach to estimating landfill gas emissions. According to LandGEM, total emissions from the Municipality of Trikala MSW landfilling is 35.082,56 tn CO₂e.

However, this inventory's boundary is Trikala city and not the whole Municipality. For this reason, the Municipality's and the city's populations are used as scaling factors, in order to estimate the emissions attributed to the city's activities. The GHG emissions from waste produced in Trikala city and landfilled are 26.586,50 tn CO₂e. The emissions are scope 3.

## 6.3. Wastewater treatment

Trikala's Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is designed for 75.000 population equivalents (PE) and serves 51.800 citizens. For the baseline year, 3.781.400 m³ of wastewater were treated. The organic content of the wastewater was 945.350 kg BOD₅/yr, while 1.440,56 tn are produced annually.

The GPC protocol introduces special equations for the calculation of methane emissions from wastewater treatment and handling.

### Equation 6.1. CH₄ generation from wastewater treatment

$$
\mathrm{CH_4} \text{ emissions} = \sum_{i} \left[ \left(\mathrm{TOW_i} - S_i\right) \mathrm{EF_i} - R_i \right] \times 10^{-3}
$$

TOWᵢ = organic content in the wastewater (kg BOD₅/yr)

EFᵢ = Emission factor (kg CH₄/kg BOD₅, eq. 6.2)

Sᵢ = Organic component removed as sludge in inventory year (kg BOD₅/yr)

Rᵢ = Amount of CH₄ recovered in inventory year (kg CH₄/yr)

### Equation 6.2. Emission factor in domestic wastewater

$$
\mathrm{EF_j} = B_0 \times \mathrm{MCF_j} \times U_i \times T_{i,j}
$$

B₀ = Maximum CH₄ producing capacity

MCFⱼ = Methane correction factor

Uᵢ = Fraction of population in income group i in inventory year

Tᵢ,j = Degree of utilisation (ratio) of treatment/discharge pathway or system, j. for each income group fraction i in inventory year

# 6.4. GHG Emissions from Waste sources

As it is shown on Table 6.2 the total greenhouse gases emissions from Waste sources reaches a total of 26.599,46 tn  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ . It is rather obvious that the majority of GHG emissions in this sector can be attributed to solid waste disposal in sanitary landfills. In addition, the total of Waste sector GHG emissions are included in scope 3, because both Trikala's landfill and WWTP are located outside the city boundary.

# 7. IPPU

## 7.1. IPPU sub-sectors

The IPPU sector is separated between industrial processes and product use. There is a wide variety of industrial activities that produce GHG emissions. To avoid confusion, the emissions accounted to industrial processes are released from chemical or physical material transformation and they are not relevant to fuel combustion. At the same time, there are some product categories such as refrigerants or aerosol cans the use of which can release potent GHG emissions. Some examples for industrial processes and product use that are included in IPPU are:

Industrial processes
Production and use of mineral products
Production and use of chemicals
Production of metals

Product use
Lubricants and paraffin waxes used in non-energy products
FC gases used in electronics production
Fluorinated gases used as substitutes for Ozone depleting substances

Industrial processes do not occur within the city of Trikala boundary. The existing emissions from product use are analysed below.

## 7.2. Lubricant use

Lubricants are commonly used in transportation applications. Lubricants are manufactured in two main ways: either by separating them from crude oil at refineries or producing them at petrochemical facilities. They can be categorized into two groups: (a) motor oils and industrial oils, and (b) greases. These categories vary in their physical attributes such as viscosity, as well as their commercial applications and how they interact with the environment. When lubricants are used in engines, their primary purpose is to provide lubrication. Any emissions resulting from this use are regarded as non-combustion emissions and are included in the IPPU sector.

There are no specific activity data for lubricant use in Trikala city. The estimation of lubricant use emissions is based on the 2019 National Inventory Report, using vehicle number in national and city level as a scaling factor.

## 7.3. Paraffin wax use

The paraffin waxes falling into this category are obtained by separating them from crude oil during the production of light lubricating oils. These paraffin waxes find various applications, including candles, corrugated boxes, paper coating, board sizing, food production, wax polishes, surfactants used in detergents, and more. Emissions from the usage of these waxes primarily occur when they are combusted directly (for instance, in candles) or when they are incinerated, either with or without heat recovery, or during wastewater treatment (in the case of surfactants).

There are no specific activity data for paraffin wax use in Trikala city. The estimation of paraffin wax use emissions is based on the 2019 National Inventory Report, using national and city population as a scaling factor.

## 7.4. Urea use as catalyst

This sub-sector includes greenhouse gases emissions from the use of urea-based additives in catalytic converters (non-combustive emissions). The lack of accurate activity data in Trikala is surpassed using the corresponding emissions in 2019 National Inventory Report, using vehicle number in national and city level as a scaling factor.

# 7.5. Solvent use

The majority of solvents are components within end products, such as paint, and eventually, they will evaporate into the atmosphere. This evaporation of solvents, along with other products containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is a significant contributor to non-methane volatile organic compound (NMVOC) emissions. Once these emissions are released into the atmosphere, they react with reactive molecules, primarily HO-radicals, or high-energy light, eventually forming $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. As per the IPCC Guidelines, the source category for these emissions includes the following applications:

Paint application
Degreasing
Dry cleaning

The estimation of solvent use emissions is based on the 2019 National Inventory Report, using buildings number in national and city level as a scaling factor.

# 7.6. Substitutes for ODS

As per the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, there are six distinct categories responsible for emissions resulting from the use of ODS (ozone-depleting substances) substitutes. These categories encompass emissions of f-gases and occur during the manufacturing, operation/maintenance, and final disposal of various materials and equipment, which are as follows:

Refrigerating and air conditioning equipment
Foam Blowing Agents
Fire Protection
Aerosols
Solvent uses
Other applications

The estimation of substitutes for ODS use emissions is based on the 2019 National Inventory Report, using buildings number in national and city level as a scaling factor. Most of the emissions are attributed to refrigerating and air condition equipment and this is the reason that buildings are selected for the scaling.

The total greenhouse gases emissions from IPPU sector is 2.419,46 tn  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ . From the total emissions,  $88.1\%$  is attributed to substitutes use for ODS. Greece is a country with very hot summers, meaning air conditioning is widely used and frequently maintained, leading to GHG emissions.

## 8.1. AFOLU sub-sectors

Certain cities may lack measurable agricultural activities or have limited woody vegetation within their boundaries, resulting in negligible AFOLU emissions. On the other hand, some cities might have substantial agricultural activities with significant cropland, forests, grasslands, wetlands, or urban tree canopy that contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or removals. To indicate the absence of sources or data gaps, notation keys are employed. The IPCC Guidelines classify AFOLU activities into three distinct categories:

Livestock
Land
Aggregate sources and non-CO₂ emissions sources on land

Livestock emissions are produced due to enteric fermentation and manure management. Land emissions may be attributed to the type of land use, the change of land use or forestry. Last but not least, aggregate sources and non-CO₂ emissions sources on land include GHG emissions from biomass burning, liming, urea application, direct and indirect N₂O from managed soils, indirect N₂O from manure management, rice cultivation and harvested wood products.

## 8.2. Forest land

Taking into consideration that the inventory boundaries are Trikala city's boundaries, there are no significant sources of AFOLU emissions. The only activity included in an AFOLU sub-sector that is occurring within the city boundary is forest land remaining forest land.

The definition of forest land under the Kyoto Protocol is:

minimum area of 0,3 hectares
tree crown cover larger than 25%
minimum height of 2 m, or the potential to achieve it

Forest land can act as a carbon sink and lead to GHG removals.

The forest of Lofon Kastrou and Ailia (Castle hills and Saint Ilias) is located within the city boundary. The artificial pine and cypress forest has a total area of 35,29 hectares.

The GHG removals from the forest land remaining forest land are estimated based on 2019 National Inventory Report, using the national and city forest area as a scaling factor.

# 9. Summary

## 9.1. GHG Inventory results

A greenhouse gas inventory is a comprehensive assessment of greenhouse gas emissions and removals within a specified region, such as a country, city, or industrial facility. The purpose of the inventory is to quantify the sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, which are responsible for climate change.

This inventory was performed according to the GPC protocol. Using the city-induced reporting BASIC+ level, the total greenhouse gases emissions are 467.714,66 tn CO₂e. This translates as 7,59 tn CO₂e/citizen/yr. The emissions per source sector are:

Stationary Energy: 393.504,16 tn CO₂e
Transportation: 45.198,83 tn CO₂e
Waste: 26.599,46 tn CO₂e
IPPU: 2.419,46 tn CO₂e
AFOLU: -7,26 tn CO₂e

The emissions per scope are:

Scope 1: 115.569,02 tn CO₂e
Scope 2: 325.546,17 tn CO₂e
Scope 3: 26.599,46 tn CO₂e

Apart from the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported at the city-induced reporting (BASIC+) level, there is an additional 165,850.18 tn of biogenic CO₂ emissions. Biogenic emissions refer to the release of carbon dioxide resulting from the combustion of biomass materials that store and sequester CO₂, including those used in producing biofuels. These specific emissions are recorded separately under the column CO₂(b) and are not included in the emissions totals following the GPC protocol.

The Stationary Energy sector accounts for 84% of the total city's GHG emissions. At the same time, the majority (83%) of Stationary Energy GHG emissions are included in Scope 2, meaning they occur as a result of grid-supplied electricity consumption.

The Transportation sector is the second largest GHG emissions source, accounting for 9,7% of total GHG emissions. It is prominent that there is a big gap between the Stationary Energy and the Transportation emissions. The 100% of Transportation emissions are included in Scope 1, due to fossil fuel combustion within the city boundary.

The Waste sector accounts for 5,7% of total GHG emissions. All emissions from the Waste sector are included in Scope 3, because Trikala's landfill and WWTP are located outside the city boundary.

The IPPU sector accounts for 0,5% of total GHG emissions.

The GHG inventory is a supporting tool for the city of Trikala on its path to identify GHG emission sources and take action to tackle climate change. An effective and sustainable climate action plan can only be designed based on an accurate and completed inventory.

The GHG inventory must be updated on regular bases and according to the city's needs. Regular updates and reviews of the GHG inventory are crucial to track progress towards emission reduction goals and to assess the effectiveness of climate policies and measures.
