# Summary

This first version of the Action Plan, a living document that we intend to amend and enrich along the way, is the product of engagement with a broad set of collaborators, both within and beyond city hall. The process by which it came to life was orchestrated by the city and Leuven 2030 (Box 1). Five highlights from the Action Plan are presented below:

Baseline emissions are estimated at 457.000 tons. The vast majority of these emissions stem from energy use in buildings. Subtracting emissions reduced through offsetting (approx. 15 per cent) and emissions reductions embedded in existing strategies (approx. 6 per cent) yields an emissions gap of approx. 336.000 tons;
The pathways to climate neutrality presented in Module B-1 describe how this emissions gap could be closed. They are described both quantitatively, through estimates of the emissions impact of different action clusters, and qualitatively, by connecting interventions to a sequence of early and later outcomes. The pathways form the backbone of the portfolio of actions presented in Module B-2;
The portfolio is the heart of the Action Plan. It is composed of 71 actions designed to break through systemic barriers and catalyze action aligned to the pathways laid out in Module B-1. This first iteration of the portfolio has the potential to deliver at least 30.000 tons of emissions reductions and likely far more, as not all portfolio actions have yet been quantified. While this falls short of full climate neutrality, scaling the portfolio up is expected to bridge the gap. The portfolio includes eight actions that explore how such upscaling could be achieved;
Complementing the portfolio are 16 enabling actions designed to help enable implementation of the portfolio. These are presented in Modules C-1 and C-2 and chiefly aimed at improving collaboration both within and beyond city hall (organizational and governance innovations) and at fostering a more inclusive, just transition (social and other innovations);
Implementation of the Action Plan will be supported by a process of portfolio management. This will enable the iterative development of the portfolio in response to new insights and circumstances. Progress will be tracked and documented, and presented in an updated version of the Action Plan every two years.

# Box 1: Leuven 2030

Leuven 2030 is a platform established in 2013 by the city and more than 50 other founding members to support and enable stakeholders to take climate action. Six stakeholder groups (citizens, civil society, companies, knowledge institutions, the city and its agencies, and public and semi-public institutions) are formally represented in Leuven 2030's decision-making bodies and periodically convened to develop and align strategy.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# 1 Introduction

The Action Plan is one of three parts that together form the Climate City Contract (CCC). It sits alongside the Investment Plan and the Commitments, and is closely interlinked with both: The cost scenarios outlined in the Investment Plan build on top of the portfolio of actions presented in the Action Plan, and those same actions provide the basis for the city and stakeholder commitments collected in the CCC. All three components of the CCC are thus aligned and oriented in the same direction.

Leuven dedicated itself to the creation of the CCC, and is dedicated to the Mission as a whole, because it believes that the Mission has the potential to catalyze action at a pace and scale as yet unseen in Leuven. This potential resides in a number of features of the CCC:

The portfolio of actions, which sets out in greater detail than before the interventions needed to achieve systemic change, and further clarifies roles and responsibilities;
The Investment Plan, which opens up novel pathways towards unlocking investment at scale and creates an opportunity to engage more deeply with the financial sector;
The formalization of commitments, which creates greater transparency and accountability.

Taken together, these components could usher in a new phase in Leuven's climate efforts, and begin to deliver deep and abiding emissions cuts.

In charting this path forward, the CCC builds on what has come before. Leuven's history of climate action reaches back more than two decades, and is defined by an ongoing commitment to collaboration. This commitment is expressed in Leuven 2030, a platform created to enable structural cooperation towards climate neutrality. A key milestone was achieved in 2019, when Leuven 2030 presented the Roadmap, a document co-designed with stakeholders that lays out a path to a climate-neutral and resilient Leuven. This was followed by a process of moving the Roadmap into implementation.

The CCC draws on this earlier work in several ways:

The process of implementing the Roadmap gave rise to a set of breakthrough projects – a loose portfolio managed by Leuven 2030 and aimed at catalyzing action across a wide range of stakeholders. This collection of projects went through several iterations and provided content and inspiration for the portfolio developed for the Action Plan;
Roadmap activity deepened stakeholder engagement. This helped strengthen relationships and set the stage for engagement with stakeholders within the Mission;
The Roadmap helped form a broad consensus around the need for an ambitious transition. The cover page bears the signatures of 15 key stakeholders, lending their support to the Roadmap. The CCC aims to move a step further, and match this broad commitment to commitments at the level of individual actions.

The impact of developing the CCC has been profound: the Mission has become a focal point – a frame around which we have organized and that has recontextualized many of our ongoing and planned actions. While the work that accompanied the development of the CCC (further mobilizing stakeholders, building commitment, developing an investment plan) was work that we believe we needed to do in any case, the Mission provided a coherent framework, a timeline, and a powerful momentum for us to align to.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

There is a tension at the heart of the Mission. On the one hand, there's its towering ambition: climate neutrality by 2030. On the other hand, the realization that such a goal is, for most cities, out of reach. It is a tension we have sought to navigate as best we could, both accepting that we are unlikely to achieve the Mission's full ambition and not letting that undercut or hollow out its spirit and imagination. "We reach for the moon but are happy to land among the stars."

# 2 Work Process

The process of developing the Action Plan is presented along the stages of the Climate Transition Map.

## Building a Strong Mandate

## Governing the Mission

A first step in the CCC process consisted of setting up a governance structure to steward the development and delivery of the CCC. This developed organically at first and then solidified around three components:

**Mission Control**: A recurring high-level meeting to track Mission progress and develop overall Mission strategy, presided over by the Mission Manager and attended by the mayor, two deputy mayors, high-ranking administrative staff, and the director of Leuven 2030;
**Mission Cockpit**: A team composed of the Mission Manager, department heads, and staff from Leuven 2030, entrusted with supervising the CCC process and orienting to implementation;
**Subteams**: A set of teams dedicated to the operational development of the CCC:

**Subteam Portfolio**: Entrusted with developing the portfolio and the other components of the Action Plan
**Subteam Data &amp; Monitoring**: Entrusted with collecting, interpreting, and presenting the data for the emissions baseline and gap
**Subteam Investment Plan**
**Subteam Commitments**
**Subteam Communication**

As depicted in Figure 1, these new structures remained closely aligned to existing governance structures: on the city side, to the city board (the city's executive body) and to formal and informal structures within the administration (including the city's cross-departmental climate team), and on the ecosystem side, to Leuven 2030's General Assembly and Board of Directors (the former includes all members of Leuven 2030, the latter is a set of representatives elected by the General Assembly).

## Developing a Shared Understanding

In parallel with building out a suitable governance structure, a core team of city and Leuven 2030 staff, which would later become Subteam Portfolio, invested in developing a common understanding of the Mission and its implementation in Leuven. This resulted in a set of principles collectively referred to as the Mission Compass:

The Mission is a means to an end, not an end in itself. For the Mission to be successful in Leuven, it must be adapted to the local context;
We embrace the Mission's spirit of innovation and experimentation and are open to engaging in new and potentially challenging ways of thinking and acting;
leuven

“We reach for the moon but are happy to land among the stars.” We acknowledge the need for ambition but are mindful of capacity;
The city of Leuven and Leuven 2030 take part in the Mission as equal partners, each from its unique vantage point.

Also emerging out of these discussions was a sense that the most important part of the “Leuven version” of the Climate City Contract was the portfolio of actions. Sitting at the heart of the Action Plan, the portfolio was seen as having the greatest potential to act as a catalyst and as being most aligned to the appetite for implementation and tangible, short-term impact in Leuven. Consequently, much of our capacity over the yearlong process to develop the CCC was dedicated to the design and composition of the portfolio.

## Building Broad Support

Early on, the Leuven team began a concerted and sustained effort to build support for the Mission, both within city government and beyond. This work proceeded along three tracks:

Within city government, we pursued engagement at all levels:
At the political level, we engaged with city leadership through the periodic Mission Control meetings attended by the mayor and two deputy mayors;
At the administrative level, we engaged with senior management through the Mission Control and Mission Cockpit and through pre-existing venues for discussion such as the periodic meeting of directors (DOL);
Also at the administrative level, we engaged with city staff more broadly, for example through the widely attended meetings of the city’s cross-departmental climate team, convened roughly every six months, and through a special half-day workshop dedicated to the Mission.

Within the local ecosystem, we engaged with stakeholders through the decision-making bodies of Leuven 2030 and through a series of collective and bilateral co-design sessions:
We engaged with Leuven 2030’s Board of Directors on a monthly basis. The board seats representatives from all six stakeholder groups represented in Leuven 2030 (citizens, civil society, companies, knowledge institutions, the city and its agencies, and other public institutions) and provided strategic direction along every step of the CCC process;
We engaged with Leuven 2030’s General Assembly every six months, the rhythm at which it is convened. These meetings enabled a fuller range of Leuven 2030’s members to track Mission activities and offer input;
Beyond Leuven 2030’s formal structures, we engaged with stakeholders through collective co-design sessions, the purpose of which was to surface and develop potential portfolio actions. One example is the event hosted by Leuven 2030 in the fall of 2022, which convened stakeholders across the public and private sector around a range of topics, including energy, built environment, mobility, circular economy, finance, and social justice;
We also engaged with stakeholders through bilateral sessions aimed at surfacing portfolio actions and securing commitments. These stakeholders include, but are not limited to, KU Leuven, UZ Leuven, imec, AB InBev, BENEO-Remy, AGSL, Zorg Leuven, Fluvius, the Province of Flemish Brabant, C-Valley, EcoWerf, Dijledal, ION, and Wienerberger;

With regards to other governments, we engaged with policymakers at multiple levels:
We spoke at a hearing hosted by a commission of the Flemish Parliament on the topic of local climate policy. We shared our experience and offered thoughts on how Flemish policy could further support and enable local action;
We participated in a panel at a symposium co-hosted by the Flemish Department of Economy, Science, and Innovation on EU Missions and mission-driven policy in Flanders;
We partnered with other Flemish cities and the platform for Flemish cities to draft a joint climate memorandum addressed to the Flemish Government for the upcoming elections;
We hosted Federal Minister of Climate, the Environment, Sustainable Development and Green Deal Zakia Khattabi and Federal Minister of Development Cooperation and Major Cities Caroline Gennez and spoke with them about the EU Mission and the potential role of the national government;
We hosted a delegation of EU policymakers for an exchange on strengthening synergies within EU institutions and aligning EU services to cities' needs, against the background of Leuven's experience with EU initiatives.

# Understanding the System

This section summarizes the approach taken in each of the modules associated with this phase of the Climate Transition Map:

Module A-1: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory
The scope of our emissions inventory was set in consultation with Mission Control, the Mission Cockpit, and emissions experts (see Annex I, Scoping Note). Scope 3 emissions are partially included (waste and construction materials) and our intention is to more fully map and include Scope 3 emissions in future iterations of the CCC;
Emissions data were drawn from a variety of sources, with most data coming from the inventories published annually by the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO).

Module A-2: Current Policies and Strategies Assessment
The list and description of policies was completed through desk research and input from city staff;
The assessment was crafted with input from experts and practitioners, predominantly within the city administration, and with input from city leadership.

Module A-3: Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality
Our understanding of systemic barriers was shaped by a combination of pre-existing knowledge and insights surfaced over the course of the CCC process:
A key source of information was the knowledge base built up over three years by the program facilitators enlisted by Leuven 2030 to support implementation of the Roadmap;
Additional insights came from discussions with practitioners and experts held as part of the CCC process. These informed the design of our portfolio of actions and were incorporated into the overview of systemic barriers presented in Module A-3;
EIT Climate-KIC’s Deep Demonstration of Healthy, Clean Cities immersed us in the practice of systems innovation. This is described in greater detail in Module A-3.3.

Module B-1: Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways
A first step in building our pathway to climate neutrality consisted of mapping actions contained within existing plans and strategies, including the Roadmap and the Sustainable Energy &amp; Climate Action Plan (SECAP). We compiled these actions in a unifying framework, organized them in clusters, and within each cluster estimated the potential for emissions reduction. This enabled us to determine the relative weight of actions and grasp the scale of reduction needed to achieve climate neutrality by 2030;
Alongside this quantitative approach we built out our impact framework by articulating our interventions and identifying associated levers of change and early and late outcomes. This occurred in close interaction with the portfolio-design process and in consultation with experts and practitioners active in each emissions domain, both within and beyond city hall. As part of this process, we selected suitable indicators to go along with the outcomes and impacts identified, drawing on both the indicator set provided by NetZeroCities and independently defined indicators.

# Co-Designing a Portfolio

Given the central importance attached by the Leuven team to the portfolio of actions, developing the portfolio occupied the largest part of our time. We operated along two tracks:

Along a **bottom-up** track we focused on mapping existing activities within both the city and the wider ecosystem. On the city side, this entailed convening experts in each of the Mission's five emissions domains and reviewing ongoing and planned actions. On the ecosystem side, we drew on material produced by Leuven 2030's program facilitators; we also gathered information through new and mostly bilateral conversations with key stakeholders.

Using existing efforts as a point of departure for our portfolio was a deliberate choice, premised on the idea that meeting people where they are and acknowledging the value of their day-to-day activities would be an effective way of building a mandate for more far-reaching, Mission-aligned work. We were also intentional about framing the Mission not as an external workstream further stretching capacity but rather as something to be woven into and enriching ongoing work.

Along a **top-down** track we approached the portfolio from a more outcome-oriented perspective, using the emissions reductions established in our pathway to climate neutrality as a guide to portfolio composition. This approach enabled us to assess potential portfolio actions against the larger emissions cuts required in each domain and subset of actions, as well as to identify gaps in the landscape of our current activity.

The interaction between these two tracks gradually gave rise to the portfolio of actions as presented in Module B-2.

To assess the portfolio potential of actions we used the notion of a **breakthrough project**: in order to qualify for the portfolio, an action had to address (and have the potential to break through) at least one systemic barrier. It also needed to connect into the impact pathways outlined in Module B-1 (and thus contribute to creating a large direct or indirect impact) and come on top of existing action. While we strove to stay true to these principles, we sometimes adopted a more pragmatic posture to create buy-in or traction with stakeholders.

At the portfolio level, we sought to arrive at a representative set of actions. The idea of representativity emerged out of our struggle early on to reconcile two seemingly conflicting logics contained within the portfolio concept: on the one hand, a need to cover the full range of emissions associated with climate neutrality by 2030; on the other hand, an understanding of the portfolio as a strategic and thus more narrow set of actions.

We resolved this tension by framing the portfolio as a set of strategically chosen pilot actions that could, if scaled, deliver full climate neutrality. This approach has the benefit of limiting our portfolio to a manageable number of actions while still connecting it to a long-term perspective. It also acknowledges the fact that much of the challenge that lies ahead cannot yet be captured in individual action outlines but will instead surface over time in a process of discovery and experimentation.

The idea of representativity extended into other dimensions of our portfolio. In addition to wanting to design a portfolio that reflected the distribution of emissions, we strove to build a portfolio that was balanced in terms of geography, ecosystem involvement, and the systemic levers that it sought to activate. These were some of the design principles that guided our work, and will continue to guide our work as we move into portfolio management.

# Applying to the Pilot Cities Call

Early on in the CCC process, part of the Leuven team was entrusted with developing a proposal for the Call for Pilot Cities. The process of crafting the proposal served as a microcosm of the broader CCC process and contributed to each of the three stages of the Climate Transition Map detailed above:

Building a Strong Mandate: Developing the proposal familiarized us with some of the principles of the Mission (the focus on systemic barriers, the logic of the impact framework) and gave us confidence that we could apply them in a way that was practical and tailored to our local needs;
Understanding the System: The process gave us an opportunity to comprehensively map the barriers associated with decarbonizing Leuven's energy systems (the topic of our proposal);
Co-Designing a Portfolio: That analysis of barriers led directly into the design of the pilot activities. These activities include both activities specific to the domain of energy systems and more general activities with relevance across all emissions domains, and provided early content for our portfolio of actions.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

As both future heat production and future modes of transportation will be based more and more on electricity as the main energy carrier (for example with heat pumps and electric vehicles), it is important to reduce its emissions factor to zero as much as possible. This can be done by encouraging more households and organizations to purchase green electricity with guarantees of origin. An even more important lever is to dramatically increase local production of electricity.

# A-1.5: Graphics and Charts

This section presents five charts to illustrate the state of play of Leuven's emissions reduction challenge.

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
Figure 2: Total Energy Consumption (2019, MWh, %)
Figure 2 illustrates how the built environment accounts for over 60 per cent of total energy consumption in Leuven. Within this built environment, non-households (in blue) represent a little over half of all consumption, while households (in orange) account for the remainder.

In third position sits personal and commercial transport (in grey), accounting for a little under a quarter of total energy consumption. (Note: Approximately half of the distance traveled on Leuven territory is traveled on supralocal roads, and thus out of the circle of control of the local level. As noted further below, these emissions are excluded from our scope.)

More modestly, in fourth position, sits (non-ETS) industry (in yellow).

Rounding out the chart are public transport, public lighting, and agriculture – modest consumers compared to the first four highlighted sectors. A small part of our energy consumption remains unattributed for now.

Figure 3: Total Energy Consumption by Energy Source (2019, MWh)

Figure 3 highlights the types of energy sources represented in each of the sectors noted above.

The dominant fuel for the built environment in the tertiary sector is natural gas (in yellow, first bar from the left), followed closely by electricity, of which a strikingly large share is delivered through 'green electricity contracts' (in green, same bar). The emissions reduction challenge within this sector is undeniably the rapid phasing out of gas. The opportunity is to accelerate the already encouraging electrification of this sector's energy needs.

Also for the built environment of households, the dominant fuel is gas (in yellow, second bar from the left), this time closely followed by fuel oil, a more aggressive fuel than gas when it comes to climate-disturbing emissions. The potential for electrification of the residential building stock is huge, as is the challenge to get this done.

As for individual and commercial transport, the dominant energy fuel is diesel (in orange, third bar from the left), followed by gasoline. The electrification of fleets urgently requires acceleration.

Non-ETS industry (fourth bar from the left) will need to further focus on phasing out gas through electrification, and switching from grey to green electricity.

Figure 4: Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Scope 1 and 2, 2019, Ton $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ -eq)

Figure 4 translates the energy consumption per sector into their respective shares in Leuven's total emissions (Scope 1 and 2).

Not surprisingly, the relative shares depicted here are similar to those in the charts presenting energy consumption patterns.

Within Scope 1 and 2 emissions, the energy consumption of the built environment accounts for by far the largest contribution to Leuven's emissions (first two bars from the left).

In the third bar from the left, depicting transport emissions, the emissions originating from the two highways passing through Leuven (E40 and E314) are excluded, as these fall outside of local jurisdiction.

Figure 5: Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3, 2019, Ton $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ -eq)

Emissions associated with materials use in our built environment (both new construction and renovation) are estimated to be roughly equal in size to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions combined. This highlights the striking impact of Scope 3 emissions, and the need to increasingly fold these emissions into our climate efforts. This is further demonstrated by the fact that Scope 3 emissions associated with food consumption, not depicted here, are estimated to match those associated with materials use, placing them in pole position for inclusion in future versions of the Climate City Contract.

Figure 6: Evolution in Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Scope 1 and 2, 2011-2021, Ton $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ -eq)
Figure 6 presents the overall evolution of per-capita emissions in Leuven between 2011 and 2021.

Although the chart shows a steady reduction in these emissions, a radical shift towards net-zero, away from fossil fuels, has yet to emerge. We believe the Mission, and its cohort of climate-ambitious cities, could prove to be a strong lever for this urgent acceleration to materialize in the coming years.

Note: The CCC updates our reference year from 2011 to 2019, the most recent pre-corona year.

Figure 7: Evolution in Total Energy Consumption (MWh, 2011-2021)

Figure 6 reprises the bars from Figure 3 and places them in time.

At the top, in brown, we find the use of biomass. This bar represents how much heating is done with wood and pellets in Leuven, partly coming from old installations, partly related to conversions of gas installations to biomass installations.

Below that, we find the two main fuel types for mobility, namely gasoline and diesel. In recent years, the Flemish car fleet has started to move away from diesel in favor of gasoline and electricity. This trend will undoubtedly continue and accelerate in the coming years.

As noted under Figure 4, emissions originating from the two highways traversing Leuven are excluded from our scope. Therefore approximately half of all energy consumption presented here in light and dark purple is not factored into this Climate City Contract.

The use of fuel oil, shown in orange, is noticeably smaller than that of natural gas (in yellow). Nevertheless, it remains substantial enough to add focus on accelerating its phase-out. After all, fuel oil has a higher emissions factor $(\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions/kWh) than the other energy forms.

A small light blue stream shows how much liquid gas is still used for heating in Leuven. Better known as an LPG tank in the front- or backyard. The minor share of this energy form in total energy consumption over the past 10 years makes its phasing out less of a priority.

The large yellow fuel stream in the middle immediately catches the eye. It shows the consumption of natural gas in households, along with all large buildings and in industrial applications, excluding the energy consumption of our (limited) ETS industry $(^{*})$ . Given its size, this should remain one of the main focus areas of current and future climate action. As demonstrated under A-1.5, the consumption of natural gas in Leuven is predominantly related to our built environment. If we were to add the energy consumption impact of our materials use linked to our built environment (new

construction and renovation), this share of energy consumption would increase dramatically. All the more reason to add this part of Scope 3 impact to the Scope 1 and 2 approach of our CCC.

Below that in light green, we see the purchase of electricity that took place in Leuven within a "green electricity" contract. This has increased sharply over the years and Leuven performs particularly well here compared to other Flemish municipalities. This awareness supported our choice to work with a local emissions factor for our electricity consumption, instead of with a regional, national, or European parameter. This more accurately reflects our local situation and provides the right triggers for further conversions towards green electricity contracts, alongside investments in local production of renewable energy (the dark green line).

Below in grey we see the purchase of "grey electricity."

Between the light green and the grey lines, a thin line of dark green is noticeable. This is the amount of electricity generated locally. That is, on the territory of Leuven by means of solar panels. This small amount represented less than 1 per cent of Leuven's total energy consumption in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, however, we know that plenty of solar panels were added, so we can expect this share to increase in future versions of this chart.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

A-2.2: Description and Assessment of Policies

# DESCRIPTION OF POLICIES

## Local Policy

A key document guiding local policy is the city's Policy Plan 2020-2025. Drafted at the outset of the city board's current term, the plan sets priorities and defines actions across 10 themes, several of which relate directly to the city's climate policy. It is best understood as a framework that provides an overall direction and is developed in more detail in separate, domain-specific plans.

The city's main climate plan is its Climate Action Plan 2020-2025. This plan defines actions across 10 domains and links them to action owners. It also defines ambition levels, time frames, and progress indicators. It is an important touchstone for the city's climate efforts and is fully aligned with the city's Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP). The difference between the two plans is that the city's Climate Action Plan goes into greater detail than the SECAP and is more implementation-forward.

Complementing these plans is the Roadmap to a Climate-Neutral Leuven. Drawn up by Leuven 2030 and some 60 local experts and practitioners (including city and university staff), the Roadmap lays out a path to climate neutrality across 10 thematic and three cross-cutting programs. Unlike the city's plans, the Roadmap is explicitly conceived from the perspective of the city's entire ecosystem of actors. It recognizes that the city's actions alone will not be enough to reach climate neutrality and that action across the full spectrum of stakeholders is needed.

The Roadmap, like the city's climate plans, was written with a view towards climate neutrality by 2050. Leuven's selection to the Mission moves this target up by two decades, necessitating the accelerated implementation of existing plans and the formulation of new actions, an effort that the Action Plan initiates.

In addition to these overarching plans, the city has several sectoral plans and strategies in place that contribute to its net-zero ambition. Spanning energy, built environment, mobility, spatial planning, adaptation, and circular economy, these plans are too numerous to discuss here, but they are listed in Module A-2.1 and touched on, in some cases, in the assessment that follows below.

## Regional Policy

Belgium is a federal state. Many of the powers associated with climate action sit at the Flemish level, making the Flemish Government a key player in the climate landscape. The Flemish Government has set a target of reducing emissions by 40 per cent by 2030, with a long-term goal of reducing emissions by 85 per cent by 2050. As at the local level, it has translated its overarching goals into multiple sectoral strategies and plans, spanning the usual domains: energy, industry, transport, built environment, agriculture, adaptation, and circular economy.

A notable initiative is the Local Energy and Climate Pact, a partnership between Flanders and local authorities that offers cities and municipalities technical and financial support in exchange for committing to concrete goals. Examples of such goals include achieving a 40 per cent reduction in emissions from municipal buildings by 2030, building 1,5 charging stations for every 100 inhabitants by 2030, and planting one extra tree per inhabitant by 2030. The Local Energy and Climate Pact is a framework that structures much of the interaction between the Flemish Government and the city.

# National Policy

Climate policy at the federal level is guided by the National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030. Prompted by the EU's Governance Regulation, which requires Member States to develop and submit integrated climate and energy plans, the plan outlines a strategy along the five dimensions of the Energy Union: decarbonization, energy security, energy efficiency, the internal energy market, and research, innovation, and competitiveness. Long-term strategy is set by the Belgian Long-Term Strategy, which aims for a climate-neutral Belgium by 2050, in line with the EU's climate goals.

The Federal Government has comparatively few powers in the realm of climate action, although this should not be overstated. The Federal Government is responsible for the security of energy supply, nuclear power, offshore wind energy, and parts of the fiscal policy pertaining to energy. It is also responsible for the national railways and sets emissions standards for vehicles (largely adapted from EU standards) and some of the fiscal policy relating to transport, including fuel taxes and taxes on company cars. Recent reforms provide for the elimination of the tax benefit for non-electric company cars starting from 2027, from which point forward only electric company cars will be tax-deductible.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# EU Policy

The European Union is an active and influential policy actor in the field of climate action. The European Green Deal helped forge a strong consensus around the target of net-zero by 2050, and the suite of legislative and regulatory proposals adopted to bring the Green Deal to life are affecting national and regional policy on multiple fronts. EU ambition has filtered through to the local level, most notably via the Covenant of Mayors, which has motivated the city to set a target of reducing emissions by 55 per cent by 2030, and the Mission for Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities, which has moved that target up to full climate neutrality (an emissions reduction of at least 80 per cent) by 2030. EU policy also affects local action via the Emissions Trading System, which caps emissions from two operators in Leuven (AB InBev and UZ Leuven), and the diverse set of funding programs from which Leuven has benefited (including Horizon Europe, Interreg, and LIFE).

# ASSESSMENT OF POLICIES

## Local Policy: Overall Assessment

Reviewing the local policy landscape and the state of climate action in Leuven, several observations can be made.

First, emissions have come down, but they have not come down fast enough. Between 2011 and 2020, emissions fell by an estimated 8 per cent. This places Leuven level with other Flemish cities, which have all followed a similar trajectory. While it is true that Leuven's emissions have not risen despite continued economic and demographic growth, much remains to be done for us to start truly bending the curve.

A second observation is that the city has set high ambitions, but that so far implementation has lagged behind. This is the result of a combination of factors. One is the lack of a sufficiently supportive policy environment. Here the Flemish Government, in particular, could do more to adopt policies and regulations that move the net-zero transition forward. Another factor is a lack of resources. Resource constraints mean that an increase in ambition cannot always be met with an increase in personnel or investment, a reality that has been exacerbated by inflation and the energy crisis. Several other factors, including political constraints, likely contribute to the implementation gap.

A third and final observation is that there is a growing awareness of the need to further engage in far-reaching cross-silo cooperation, both within city hall and beyond. To help close the implementation gap, climate must – and can – be woven into a wide range of policy domains. Within the city administration, this would mean further mainstreaming climate action across departments and supporting and enabling cross-departmental collaboration, a goal that the city will pursue as part of its activities in the Pilot Cities Programme.

Within the wider city ecosystem, too, there is a need to further align actors and catalyze collective action. While Leuven already has a relatively mature governance model in place, as reflected in Leuven 2030, a platform for structural cooperation established to accelerate the net-zero transition, there is a growing sense that the time has come for stakeholders to move beyond broad promises and towards concrete commitments and implementation. Leuven's Climate City Contract is intended to be a meaningful step in this direction, and the start of an iterative approach that progressively ratchets up ambition and accountability.

Insights into the city's climate policy can also be found in an external audit carried out as part of the European Energy Award (EEA), a certification scheme that evaluates and grades local authorities on their energy and climate efforts. The report, issued in 2021, awards Leuven 306 out of a possible 476 points. It notes as Leuven's strengths:

The quality of the city's Climate Action Plan 2020-2025, and the cross-departmental approach to its development and execution;
The city's spatial policy and its vision of urban development;
The city's steps towards sustainable urban mobility, including implementation of its plan to curb car travel in the city center;
The city's efforts to engage with its community of stakeholders, in particular through Leuven 2030.

The report identifies three actions to further elevate the city's climate efforts:

Matching the city's high ambitions with increased capacity and training of personnel;
Expanding efforts to decarbonize municipal buildings;
Improving monitoring and evaluation systems.

# Local Policy: Assessment by Emissions Domain

## Energy Systems

A major focus in this domain is the decarbonization of heating systems. Green heat is a relatively new policy domain, and one in which the city's knowledge base is still being developed. A strong foundation has been laid by the city's energy strategy, which maps and assesses the potential of collective green heat across Leuven, and attention is now shifting to the operationalization and implementation of the strategy at a district level. This is the focus of Leuven's activities in the Pilot Cities Programme.

More established is the city's work on renewable electricity, the other major component of this emissions domain. Progress here has been made through the city-supported energy cooperative ECoOB, which has so far installed roughly 1.000 kWp of solar capacity, much of it on municipal buildings. The city also has a long-standing advisory service in place that offers financial and technical support to citizens looking to install solar panels or carry out other climate-friendly measures in their homes.

Despite these efforts, the potential for renewable energy in Leuven remains vast: solar capacity in Leuven currently tops out at 41 MW, less than 10 per cent of a total potential of 505 MW. Wind power is not (yet) a viable option: regulation associated with the proximity of Brussels Airport prohibits the placing of wind turbines.

## Built Environment

This domain comprises two main dimensions: the renovation of existing buildings and the construction of new (climate-neutral) buildings.

Accelerating the rate of renovation has proven exceptionally difficult. Less than 1 per cent of homes are renovated every year, a rate that needs to triple in order to achieve a net-zero housing stock by 2050. While the city offers technical and financial support to help residents renovate, a service it is in the process of scaling up, it holds too few levers to deliver the impact that is needed. As a result, the city is focusing increasing attention on the shift to renewable sources of energy. This is a departure from the Trias Energetica, an approach that holds that efficiency should come before action on the source, and reflects a larger recalibration in the energy field.

Efforts in the non-residential sector have fared better. In 2020, Leuven successfully completed a three-year ELENA project delivering annual emissions savings of four kilotons. The project was set up and led by Leuven 2030, and stimulated over 50 million euro in investment across 24 partners, including the city. Emissions from municipal buildings have steadily declined, yet ramping up the pace of renovation has proven difficult. This is partly the result of a steady flow of projects requiring the city's short-term attention (for example projects to restore building safety), delaying action on renovation, and partly the result of a shortage in qualified technical personnel.

In addition to reducing emissions from existing buildings, it is critical to avoid an uptick in emissions from new buildings. Several major urban developments are expected to be completed over the coming years, including the construction of a new arts venue and adjoining park in the city center and the development of a new science park. While the level of ambition in terms of sustainability has typically been set on a per-project basis, a formal framework to provide for a more uniform approach is in the works and forms part of the portfolio of actions presented in Module B-2.

# Mobility &amp; Transport

The city has taken several steps towards sustainable urban mobility. A recent milestone is the introduction of a mobility plan for the city center, which sought to reduce car travel and encourage sustainable modes of transportation. Changes in travel behavior indicate that the plan was successful: following implementation, the number of cyclists in the city center rose by 44 per cent, while the number of cars declined by 19 per cent. Similar plans are now being prepared and rolled out in the city's other boroughs. First in line was Wilsele-Dorp, followed by Kessel-Lo, where a comprehensive participatory process was put in place to solicit input from residents.

Mobility in Leuven is influenced by travel into and out of the city. It therefore has a strong regional component. Regionet Leuven, a project outlining a sweeping vision for the Leuven region, has been active since 2015, advocating for greater density, reduced car dependency, and improved infrastructure for cycling and public transport, yet implementation has lagged behind. A major reason is a dependence on Flemish funds, which are limited and difficult to secure. Tapping into alternative forms of finance is likely needed for this project to gain new traction. Even so, progress continues to be made: The redesign of the ring road, a key component of Regionet, is moving towards implementation. And a redesign of the wider public-transport network, part of the mobility plan for the Leuven transport region, has been decided upon and is set for implementation in 2024-2025.

Perhaps more so than other domains, mobility is an exceptionally sensitive issue, placing constraints on how far, and how fast, policymakers can go.

# Nature-Based Solutions &amp; Green Infrastructure

A key dimension in this domain is the preservation and expansion of large natural infrastructure such as parks, forests, and nature reserves. The city has developed several policy plans in this area, including the Municipal Nature Development Plan (GNOP) and the Spatial Structure Plan (RSP). These plans, and the actions they have prompted, have contributed to enhancing water quality, biodiversity, and overall ecological conditions. As of 2018, the city is the owner and caretaker of 315 hectares of public green spaces, a figure that has since risen as a result of targeted land purchases.

Another dimension is the greening of the built environment. This is achieved through interventions such as the removal of impermeable surfaces, the planting of trees, and the introduction of green walls and green roofs. Such actions have become a prominent feature of public works in Leuven, and are promoted through a campaign called 'Let It Sink In,' which seeks to inform and actively involve citizens. Two European projects, PACT and JUSTNATURE, the former of which is coordinated by the city, have helped elevate the city's efforts, bringing in extra capacity and resources for investment. While the city's focus has traditionally been on public spaces, this is gradually changing to include private spaces, which make up a large percentage of sealed surfaces in Leuven. The city's campaigns and projects have helped improve public awareness and support of NBS, an important condition for continued action.

A notable challenge in this domain is that nature-based solutions can be in tension with other spatial needs, such as mobility infrastructure and urban development. Striking the right balance between such competing claims is a delicate matter, and an intrinsically political one. A closely related challenge is that there is a need for greater strategic direction: the implementation of nature-based solutions should be more firmly embedded in a long-term strategy, guided by clear ambitions. This would enable a more goal-oriented approach and help to resolve conflicts that may arise with other policy goals.

# Waste &amp; Circularity

**Waste management** is a well-established area of activity for local government. Leuven performs well here, producing significantly less waste per person per year than Flanders as a whole. While local waste policy focuses on household waste, there is a growing awareness of the need to also tackle waste from businesses. This is an area where local policymakers have fewer levers at their disposal.

**Circular economy** is a newer policy domain. It is also a more complex one, owing to its more wide-ranging and systemic approach. In relatively short order, Leuven has established a robust practice around circularity, helped along by two European projects, Pop-Machina and SHAREPAIR. A key focus area identified in the ‘Circular Leuven’ strategy is circular construction. The city has helped set up a ‘materials bank’ that recovers and redistributes used construction materials, and that is in the process of developing a strategy to begin delivering impact at scale. Here, as in its overall approach to circularity, the city has opted for a multi-stakeholder approach, partnering with such actors as the university, the hospital, and waste manager EcoWerf to achieve a greater impact.

# Local Policy: Assessment by Systemic Lever

## Technology &amp; Infrastructure

Infrastructure is a natural part of action in all emissions domains; as the owner and steward of much of the city's public infrastructure, the city is uniquely positioned to either itself execute or contract out changes to its physical structures. Similarly, the university, KU Leuven, owns large swaths of the city's building stock, creating opportunities for action at scale;
Leuven is home to a vibrant high-tech community; there is some overlap with climate goals (see, for example, the university's work on solar hydrogen panels or the activities of university-linked start-ups such as EXTRAQT, which develops aquathermal energy solutions) and there is potential for further alignment;
Leuven has a strong track record in climate-linked citizen science; it is one of the ways in which the city seeks to involve citizens in its net-zero efforts.

## Governance &amp; Policy

A strong practice of collaborative governance has been established through Leuven 2030;
Engagement with stakeholders has not yet catalyzed the kind of collective action needed to achieve climate neutrality;
Working with stakeholders to help them define concrete commitments and report publicly on progress offers an opportunity to increase accountability and scale up action. The Mission and the Climate City Contract create a promising context for this work;
Engagement with higher policy levels is sporadic; a structural dialogue, framed within the Mission, is intended to be established as part of the city's activities in the Pilot Cities Programme.

## Social Innovation

School 2030 is a citywide initiative that offers tailored support and uses a whole-school approach to help Leuven's schools take action towards climate neutrality;
The city is in the process of setting up a youth climate council to support and enable young citizens to structurally engage with the city and other stakeholders on climate policy;
Citizens can contribute directly to Leuven's energy transition by investing in ECoOB, a local energy cooperative that deploys solar power and green heat;
The city partnered with a range of local and non-local organizations to establish a Community Land Trust, an innovative ownership model designed to improve access to affordable housing.

## Democracy &amp; Participation

Participation is a feature of nearly all city-led activities with an impact on citizens and life in the city;
In addition to long-running programs such as Kom op voor je wijk (Stand Up for Your Neighborhood), which supports residents to take joint action in various ways, the city is experimenting with novel forms of participation, including citizens' assemblies;
The city and Leuven 2030 are dedicated to fostering a just transition, and have sought to weave this dimension into the Action Plan. An overview of just-transition actions is presented in Module A-3.3.

## Finance &amp; Funding

Partnerships with Material Economics, Bankers Without Boundaries, and Bright Wolves have increased the city's knowledge on climate finance over the past few years;
Mobilizing (private) finance at scale remains a challenge; success has come more easily in the realms of grant funding and cooperative funding;
As part of its participation in the Pilot Cities Programme, the city will investigate the feasibility of setting up a municipal energy company to help catalyze investment;
The city and Leuven 2030 are exploring the possibility of creating a blended-finance fund linked to the portfolio of actions presented in Module B-2. This is discussed in greater detail in the Investment Note attached to the Investment Plan.

## Learning &amp; Capabilities

While learning occurs organically throughout the city's climate activities, the city does not yet have a structured learning process in place;
The city will engage in a structured learning process as part of its activities in the Pilot Cities Programme, potentially marking the start of a wider practice of learning;
Improved monitoring systems are being put in place, strengthening the foundation for evaluation and learning;
The Leuven 2030 Urban Lab, a structural partnership with the city's knowledge institutions, creates opportunities for learning by connecting practitioners to researchers.

# Regional Policy

As noted in the section describing the work process, the Leuven team is preparing, together with other Flemish cities, a climate memorandum addressed to the Flemish Government. This memorandum includes an assessment of regional policy as well as policy recommendations and is expected to be finalized in the latter half of 2023.

Given the importance of the Flemish policy level, a deliberate effort was made over the course of the CCC process to develop a dialogue. The Leuven team engaged with platforms that could act as an intermediary for such a dialogue (including VVSG, the association of Flemish cities and municipalities, and Kenniscentrum Vlaamse Steden) and interacted with the cabinets of the Flemish Minister for Home Affairs, the Flemish Minister for Environment and Energy, and the Flemish Minister for Mobility and Public Works. This process is ongoing and will be carried over into the phase following submission of the CCC.

# Federal Policy

The Leuven team is in contact with the Federal Government and has identified several actions that the federal level could take to support Leuven and the other Belgian Mission cities:

Involve the Belgian Mission cities in the update of the National Energy and Climate Plan, and seek to increase the plan's ambition and synergies with the Mission;
Utilize the upcoming EU presidency to advance national and sub-national climate action, and shine a light on the importance of achieving a just transition;
Pursue finance innovation, with a possible focus on greening investment at the federal level, supporting pension funds to move to more sustainable investment, unlocking citizens' savings, and exploring finance models beyond existing paradigms (e.g., stewardship).

# EU Policy

There are a number of areas where increased efforts at the EU level could boost action at the local level, and help cities deliver on the promise of the Mission:

Supporting cities to catalyze investment – a top priority;
Direct financial support, as engaging in the experimental and pioneering work of the Mission requires sustained, long-term funding apart from traditional, competitive calls for proposals;
Active outreach to the regional and national level, where many of the most impactful levers of action sit;
Convening cities for targeted and structural exchanges, and actively exploring the creation of a multi-city renovation fund and other potential supralocal solutions;
Placing the cost of inaction far closer to the center of the climate debate, and supporting cities to express and monetize the value of co-benefits;

| 1Residual emissions represent the emissions that cannot be reduced through climate action and are being offset. Residual emission may amount to a maximum of 20 % of all emissions, as stated in the Mission Info Kit.2Baseline reduction target = Baseline emissions – residual emissions.3Emission reductions planned for in existing action planning and strategies should be quantified per sector.4Emissions gap = Baseline emission reduction target – Emissions reduction in existing scenarios. |                    |     |                                  |     |                                      |     |                                              |     |                                                 |     |

| Silos and a fragmentation of responsibilities                                    | Implementing the city’s energy strategy requires efforts across a range of city departments. The city has a cross-departmental climate team in place but opportunities remain to increase its mandate and effectiveness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| A knowledge gap                                                                  | Decarbonizing heating is a relatively new policy domain. There are few established practices or processes to guide policymaking here, and there is, both within city hall and more generally, a knowledge gap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| A disconnect between strategy and implementation                                 | The city has so far struggled to move its energy strategy into implementation. Among other factors, this can be attributed to the knowledge gap, a lack of operational capacity, and the technical complexity associated with sustainable energy systems.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| A lack of enabling policy                                                        | There is a lack of higher-level enabling policy. Fiscal and pricing policy continues to work against a shift away from fossil fuels. There is no regulatory framework in place for green heat, resulting in a vacuum that creates uncertainty and delays action. Regulation associated with the proximity of Brussels Airport impedes the deployment of wind power in Leuven.                                                                  |
| A lack of distributed leadership                                                 | The success of the city’s energy strategy depends in part on the efforts of large energy consumers. Large consumers can contribute by transitioning their buildings away from natural gas at an accelerated pace or by oversizing their green heating systems to supply excess heat to the surrounding areas. So far, this has not happened at the scale that is needed to meet the city’s ambition.                                           |
| High upfront costs and a lack of experience with capital and investment planning | Decarbonizing Leuven’s heating systems requires significant upfront investment, potentially as much as €500 million. Meeting this capital need will likely require a blend of public and private capital. The city has no vehicle in place with which to prepare and deliver such large-scale blended finance and has limited experience with capital and investment planning. Another complication is that there is no strong business model. |
| Scale and complexity                                                             | Moving the city’s centuries-old building stock from natural gas to green heat at the pace and scale required to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030 calls for the initiation and implementation of 20 to 30 place-based transition projects in a span of less than eight years. Moreover, those projects will intersect with activity in other domains, adding complexity.                                                                      |
| Access to data                                                                   | The city’s energy strategy relies exclusively on public data. This has produced a clear picture of household consumption but a fuzzy one for large consumers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Barrier                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Individual/fragmented ownership | The pace of renovation depends on the decisions of thousands of individual residents/households. This presents a barrier to scalability.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Willingness to renovate         | The prospect of a lengthy and complicated process involving multiple contractors and potentially requiring temporary relocation decreases people's willingness to renovate.                                                                                                                                   |
| Finance                         | There is little return on investment for renovation. Energy savings are typically insufficient to recoup the initial investment. Half of all homeowners cannot afford a deep renovation. In the rental market, split incentive presents a barrier.                                                            |
| A labor and materials shortage  | Action is delayed as a result of a labor shortage in the construction sector and the rising cost and scarcity of materials.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| A lack of enabling policy       | Higher-level policy is insufficiently supportive. There is little appetite to explore novel approaches in finance (e.g., on-tax or on-bill financing) and regulation (e.g., regulatory sandboxes). There are few legal/regulatory requirements to renovate. Fiscal incentives continue to favor fossil fuels. |
| Need for a tailored approach    | Not all interventions are possible in every type of building. There is often a need to balance renovation with other aspects (e.g., architectural heritage), necessitating a customized approach.                                                                                                             |
| Capacity                        | There is a lack of capacity to renovate municipal buildings at the pace and scale needed to meet Mission objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Barrier                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Capacity                          | There is a lack of capacity both to develop new infrastructure and to maintain and operate mobility systems. With advances in technology and data-driven approaches, there is also a need to continue to invest in capabilities and know-how.                |
| Inter-municipal cooperation       | Approaches to mobility and transport diverge across municipalities in the Leuven region.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Car culture                       | Private car ownership occupies a prominent place in society. Among other things, this is reflected in the large volume of available parking spaces. Turning this around will require a significant mindshift.                                                |
| A lack of enabling policy         | Higher-level fiscal policy favors car use and long-distance travel (e.g., company cars as a weapon in the war for talent).                                                                                                                                   |
| Regulation                        | The local parking regulation sets high parking minimums and is due for an update.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Effectiveness of public transport | There is lack of passenger capacity in public transport. Travel times are long and punctuality is an issue. Higher-level policy choices have not demonstrated the level of ambition that is needed to elevate public transport.                              |
| Finance                           | Transport agencies (e.g., De Lijn, NMBS) lack the resources to deliver needed improvements in public transport.                                                                                                                                              |
| Public support                    | Interventions to advance the modal shift, such as the elimination of parking spaces, can provoke resistance.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Sprawl                            | Inaction at the regulatory level, coupled with the widespread availability of land for new construction outside of urban areas, has continued the trend of sprawl, increasing car dependency.                                                                |
| Urban freight distribution        | City logistics are highly fragmented and vehicles use only part of their load factor when delivering goods. There is a need to consolidate deliveries and shift to sustainable modes of transportation.                                                      |
| Accessibility and inclusion       | Sustainable modes of transportation may present physical and financial barriers as well as barriers relating to digitalization. There is a need for closer study and a dedicated effort to address such issues and ensure that the modal shift is inclusive. |

| Competing spatial needs                       | There is a need to assess and balance competing spatial needs (nature, agriculture, built environment) to deliver maximum climate benefits. One important principle is the preservation of open spaces.                                                                           |
| Public support                                | Ambitious interventions such as the elimination of parking spaces in favor of natural infrastructure can meet with resistance from the public.                                                                                                                                    |
| Finance                                       | Implementing and maintaining NBS at scale requires resources that transcend municipal budgets. Stakeholders also lack (or do not allocate) the resources to implement NBS. There is a need to explore alternative sources of finance and novel solutions such as blended finance. |
| Silos and a fragmentation of responsibilities | Both within and beyond city hall, there is a need for a more integrated approach to NBS. Opportunities for NBS in both public and private spaces should be systematically detected and incorporated into actions.                                                                 |
| Policy                                        | The city does not yet have an integrated strategy for adaptation in place. Such a strategy could help guide policymaking by setting a consistent level of ambition and defining clear objectives.                                                                                 |

# A-3.3: Description or Visualisation of Participatory Model for the City Climate Neutrality – Textual and Visual Elements

Leuven has dedicated itself to placing cooperation and participation at the heart of its climate approach. This reflects a commitment to shared governance that the city strives to apply more broadly, including in such policy domains as education (Samen Onderwijs Maken), health care (Zorg Leuven), and economic development (Leuven MindGate). In climate, it is a commitment that has inspired the creation of Leuven 2030, a platform for structural cooperation tasked with accelerating the transition to climate neutrality.

# LEUVEN 2030

Leuven 2030's origins trace back to the beginning of 2013, when the city partnered with the university to produce a scientific report charting a path to a climate-neutral Leuven. Among other things, the report recommended the set-up of a multi-stakeholder initiative to support and enable the transition. By the fall of 2013, such an initiative had been created, co-founded by the city and more than 50 other stakeholders.

Leuven 2030's model is intrinsically participatory. Six stakeholder groups are represented in its decision-making bodies: citizens, civil society, companies, knowledge institutions, the city and its agencies, and public and semi-public institutions. Each category is given formal representation and holds the same amount of votes. As such, when stakeholders meet to develop strategy and define actions, they do so on equal footing. Funding for Leuven 2030 comes mainly from its members and supports a team of approx. eight people to oversee daily operations.

A major milestone achieved by Leuven 2030 and its community of stakeholders is the Roadmap. Completed in 2019 and building on the insights presented in the scientific report, the Roadmap sets out, in greater detail than before, what it will take for Leuven to become climate-neutral. It is a comprehensive document structured into 13 programs and 80 action clusters, and the product of co-creation with 60 local experts and practitioners. The Roadmap represents a shared vision for climate neutrality and was formally signed by 15 key stakeholders.

Four years on, the Roadmap remains a leading framework for climate action in Leuven. In the intervening period, Leuven 2030 supported implementation of the Roadmap by recruiting a team of 17 'program facilitators' drawn from different organizations and entrusted with mobilizing action within each of the Roadmap's 13 programs. The diverse make-up of this team, with members coming from the public and the private sector alike, again reflects Leuven's commitment to participatory governance.

The program facilitators, working closely with key stakeholders, focused on defining and helping to initiate 'breakthrough projects': projects that could break through structural barriers and deliver a significant impact towards climate neutrality. This work helped set the agenda and provided strategic entry points into Roadmap implementation. As detailed in a previous section, the concept of breakthrough projects was carried over into the Mission and the design of the portfolio of actions.

The work of the program facilitators coincided and intersected with Leuven's participation in EIT Climate-KIC's Deep Demonstration of Healthy, Clean Cities. Leuven joined the program in the fall of 2019 and worked with EIT Climate-KIC and its partners to design and execute a set of strategic experiments aimed at unlocking systems transformation. This experience, and the broader process of

program facilitation, served as an important precursor to the Mission: it gave the Leuven team a greater understanding of systems innovation, introduced the concept of designing and managing a portfolio, and further aligned stakeholders to the goal of climate neutrality.

While the team of program facilitators was disbanded at the start of 2023, chiefly due to a lack of resources, stakeholder engagement remains at the very center of Leuven 2030. Future efforts will focus on continuing to build trust and a sense of collective purpose and on using public commitments to create greater transparency and accountability. This is described in more detail in the Commitments section of the CCC.

# CITY OF LEUVEN

Beyond engagement through Leuven 2030, the city engages with stakeholders, particularly citizens, as part of its own activities. The city has a department devoted to citizen engagement, and its activities range from participation at the street or neighborhood level to participation citywide. Many of these activities are climate-connected, and thus form part of the fabric of climate governance in Leuven:

Kom op voor je wijk ('Stand Up for Your Neighborhood'): A long-running program that offers grants to neighborhoods for a range of activities, including climate actions such as the implementation of nature-based solutions or shared-mobility services;
Hier dringt het door ('Let It Sink In'): A call inviting the public to submit locations fit for depaving. A total of 143 locations were submitted, eight of which were selected for implementation;
Leuven, maak het mee ('Leuven, Co-Create'): A public call for ideas launched at the start of the city board's current term of office. Of the more than 2.200 ideas submitted, many revolved around climate-related topics such as mobility or greening and were adapted into the city's plans;
Vorm 3010 ('Form 3010'): A large-scale participation and co-creation campaign to shape a new mobility plan for the borough of Kessel-Lo, undertaken as part of Leuven's participation in EIT Climate-KIC's Deep Demonstration of Healthy, Clean Cities;
...

# JUST TRANSITION

The city of Leuven and Leuven 2030 are firmly committed to fostering an inclusive transition. Social justice is one of the core principles articulated in Leuven 2030's three-year strategy and it is one of the 10 guiding principles presented to stakeholders as part of the CCC process. While considered vital to Leuven's climate approach from the start, it is a topic that has recently gained new traction, in part thanks to renewed attention from within Leuven 2030's Board of Directors.

There are several dimensions to just-transition activity in Leuven:

Within Leuven 2030, the just-transition perspective is represented by two members of the Board of Directors who work directly with marginalized communities. They bring this perspective into the boardroom and have been active in engaging with and educating the wider network. One example is the event hosted by Leuven 2030 in early 2023 to share and discuss established and emerging practices at the intersection of climate action and social justice. Social justice is one of 80 project clusters defined in Leuven 2030's Roadmap and, as previously noted, a core principle of Leuven 2030's 2023-2025 strategy;
Within the ecosystem itself, there are several ongoing just-transition initiatives, including:
Minder Is Meer, a nonprofit spun out of Leuven 2030 dedicated to supporting and enabling low-income and vulnerable residents to renovate their homes;
Energiesnoeiers, a team of advisors who help low-income residents cut energy costs;
Fietstaxi, a 'bicycle cab' that offers free and sustainable transportation to residents with reduced access to mobility services;
Within the Climate City Contract, just transition recurs throughout the CCC's three components:

Several actions included in the Action Plan relate directly to social justice. An overview is presented in the table below. As part of the portfolio-design process, Leuven 2030 convened a set of experts to assess the portfolio through a just-transition lens. This served to further solidify the social-justice dimension of the portfolio;
Social justice is one of the 10 guiding principles presented to and endorsed by stakeholders as part of the Commitments pillar of the CCC. The principle states that social justice is an indispensable part of the net-zero transition and that portfolio actions should strive to deliver at least 15 per cent of their benefits (e.g., access to green heat, access to shared-mobility services) to people belonging to marginalized communities;
As part of the Investment Plan, we are investigating the feasibility of setting up a fund that draws investment to a combination of profitable and non-profitable actions, thereby avoiding cherry picking and creating funding opportunities for just-transition activities.

# 4 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

## Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Module B-1 outlines the major strategic pathways towards climate neutrality that have been identified for Leuven. The goal is not to encompass every feasible route but to zero in on the primary pathways that a city with a high level of ambition and finite resources can adopt. Preserving focus and clarity was a guiding principle in the development of all modules included in Part B.

The pathways explore the main strategic directions in each of the five emissions domains where rapid progress could and should be achieved to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions. The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ impact of the different pathways was established in a high-level calculation, which proved helpful in determining priorities and focal points. This top-down $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ calculation also provided the structural basis for the portfolio of actions presented in Module B-2.

As noted in a previous section, the portfolio brings together two compatible logics. There's the top-down approach, which identified the major avenues of action and provided the portfolio structure of 'clusters' and 'programs,' with associated $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ impacts. And there's the bottom-up approach, which populated this structure with 'breakthrough projects' sourced from the Leuven ecosystem or newly conceived based on the strategic needs established in the top-down analysis.

A breakthrough project is a project that achieves a significant impact on $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions or delivers substantial indirect impacts. They are projects that can often achieve sustainability gains across different emissions domains. Many of them also have the advantage of a positive momentum and committed key stakeholders, therefore a breakthrough seems achievable in the relatively short term. The projects can be place-based or thematic and always tackle (multiple) systemic barriers or push (multiple) systemic levers. This results in the activation of a diverse set of stakeholders within the ecosystem.

For many of the approx. 70 breakthrough projects, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ impact has been calculated. However, it is virtually impossible to define every single concrete action or project needed to bridge the emissions gap at the city level. Adding up all the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reductions of the individual actions in the portfolio would fall short of achieving the full $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reduction established in the top-down assessment. Therefore, an upscaling logic was constructed to complement the set of breakthrough projects by devising a strategy to scale the impact from these projects.

To firmly establish this logic, upscaling strategies were drafted and added to the portfolio as separate action outlines. These strategies were introduced where the need was most apparent, particularly in cases where promising and impactful projects represent merely the initial steps, necessitating swift and substantial expansion in the short term. This approach aims to harness the full breakthrough potential arising from these projects while reflecting on the most persistent barriers and uncertainties that could hinder swift upscaling. Often, identified barriers are of a financial nature and are therefore further elucidated in the Investment Plan.

In the years ahead, additional breakthrough projects are expected to be incorporated into the portfolio. By pursuing upscaling strategies and tracking the effectiveness of this current set of breakthrough projects, new interventions can be identified, initiated, and carried through in a deliberate and focused manner.

# B-1.2: Description of Impact Pathways – Textual and Visual Elements

## ENERGY SYSTEMS

### 1. Green Electricity

ES – 1.1: To meet the tightened climate targets, a rapid scale-up of local PV production is needed from about 21 GWh/y to about 100 GWh/y. Small-scale PV on individual houses is already being rapidly deployed but action is needed to activate the large Leuven rooftops as well. Through a series of pilot projects, barriers are being identified (electricity distribution network limitations, structural condition of the roof, investment cost, insurance issues due to fire risk, ...). These barriers will be addressed, for instance by further exploring and developing the possibilities of third-party financing, in order to activate all large roofs for PV as soon as possible. The Leuven Climate House can play an accelerating role here by providing targeted advice. Besides tackling these barriers, a tightened legal framework for new buildings (e.g. via local building regulations) will be established to ensure that the full PV potential of new buildings is used. In the rapid upscaling of Leuven PV, maximum efforts are made to open up investment opportunities to citizens. Disadvantaged groups are not forgotten in this process either. Various possible formats to allow these groups to reap the benefits of the transition are being examined for this purpose, in consultation with local energy cooperative ECoOB.

ES – 1.2: Construction of wind turbines has traditionally not been possible on Leuven territory because of the potential interference with air traffic radars near Zaventem and Beauvechain airports. However, due to technological improvements in radar systems on the market, it is believed that it should be possible to relax this legislation in a controlled way to allow for wind turbines on Leuven soil in a completely safe way. This decision has to be made at the Flemish level, so the initial focus here is on lobbying and further analysis to establish the most suitable locations for wind turbines. This way, after adapting the legislation in question, the construction of at least five large wind turbines can be started in the short term. If this route does remain legally unfeasible in the future, the city will look into the feasibility of wind turbines on city-owned land outside the territory.

ES – 1.3: A relatively densely populated area like Leuven will never be able to fully meet its own electricity demand through local production of renewable energy. The share of green power contracts is already very high today and will increase further in the future through information and awareness campaigns. Additionally, where large-scale collective green heat is applied, or large-scale charging infrastructure is constructed, the city will investigate with the players involved how this large, new electricity demand can be met with entirely green electricity. To help ensure a sufficient supply of green power contracts, the city is actively seeking participation in renewable energy projects outside the territory, for example in offshore wind.

### 2. Large-Scale Collective Green Heat

ES – 2.1: The deployment of large-scale collective green heat has a very large $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reduction potential and is therefore an extremely important pillar within this CCC. Large-scale collective green heat is an interesting solution in very large parts of the Leuven territory, where the heat demand density is high, and where sources such as aquathermia, geothermia or riothermia are accessible in certain locations

O

only, and therefore have to be distributed to the surrounding area. In those locations, there is a choice between individual heating solutions (e.g., individual air-sourced heat pumps) or distributing green heat from soil or water from the locations where it is accessible, for example within a distance of a few hundred meters from the Dijle river. Deploying these large-scale collective green heat projects can be driven by a few types of "momentum". Large-scale urban development projects where a sustainable heat source is tapped into provide a first possibility. These projects offer an opportunity to oversize the local heat system and distribute the extra green heat and cold to the surrounding area. Large-scale (collective) renovation projects can have a similar leverage effect. Furthermore, public works such as road reconstruction offer opportunities to simultaneously build heat networks with limited additional costs. Finally, the presence of waste heat can also carry significant momentum. After all, waste heat that can readily be harvested can lead to a very favorable business case.

To deploy large-scale collective green heat at the required scale and pace, well-documented and streamlined processes are needed. The city is working on a tightened legal framework for new buildings that very clearly sets out expectations to developers, including guidelines for (mandatory) feasibility studies and a smooth bridge to potential parties for third-party financing (TPF) and management of the (oversized) collective heat systems. Within the city's internal operations, work is in full swing to further integrate different services, in order to, for example, smoothly detect opportunities for the construction of district heating networks in public works, or to address potential conflicts between heat-infrastructure construction and conservation of heritage. This will also streamline permitting for such projects.

To smoothly detect and capitalize on the aforementioned momentum, a number of overarching actions are needed. The Leuven heat strategy will be refined into so-called "Neighborhood Heating Plans." These provide a clear strategic vision of the optimal heat solution per neighborhood and are regularly updated. To include the very significant impact of larger consumers, a city-wide "dynamic opportunity map" will also be created and maintained. Combined with the vibrant learning network of major players formed around renovation and green heat, this will be used to initiate collaborations. The financial feasibility of collective green heat projects is strongly linked to how quickly all affected homes and buildings are connected. A thorough communication campaign on heat networks and green heat is therefore needed to make citizens and companies aware of the advantages (complete service provided, stable energy bills) and thus give them enough confidence to join. The Climate House supports these efforts through targeted campaigns and advisory services to make the buildings in question connection-ready through renovation.

A number of large-scale collective green heat projects will be readily picked up by existing market players, such as ESCOs, due to a clear, positive business case. Yet a lot of projects that are badly needed from a sustainability point of view will be too technically or financially uncertain to get off the ground via this traditional route. In these cases, the city is exploring the possible role of a Leuven Energy Company that can help coordinate and even co-finance these projects. The precise role of the Leuven Energy Company can vary from project to project depending on the needs (analysis, coordination, advice, financing, management, ...). This energy company should not be limited to the less profitable projects but is an important lever to ensure a sufficiently fast and, above all, sufficiently inclusive heat transition. The role this energy company could play in a broader steward-owned climate fund, as discussed in the Investment Plan, is being explored.

## 3. Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in Industrial Processes and Buildings

ES – 3.1: As a network organization, Leuven 2030 plays a crucial role in bringing together all major Leuven players, including quite a few industrial parties. Not only does Leuven 2030 provide a platform to communicate and inspire each other, it is also the starting point for more concrete networks, such as the collective renovation and green heat program proposed in this CCC. Through the Leuven Climate Contract, the very numerous sustainable projects in the industrial sector are given extra visibility, and commitments and support for accelerated action in the sector are consolidated.

A significant part of Leuven's industry is concentrated in the Research Park in Haasrode. In the short term, an integrated heat vision for the entire area will be drawn up via a heat-potential screening. This will bring the players involved closer together and consolidate the potential of collective green heat or exchange of residual heat. By providing more clarity on opportunities for possible collaborations, spurring exchanges of data, and increasing general stakeholder support, the climate transition can be accelerated not only with regards to heat and cold, but also with regards to climate adaptation, green mobility, circular material flows, etc. The insights gained and innovations rolled out in this project will be extrapolated to other industrial players.

# BUILT ENVIRONMENT

# 1. Renovation and Retrofitting of Residential Buildings

BE - 1.1: The main pillar of the Trias Energetica is reducing energy consumption. Changing behavior and switching to more economical appliances can achieve a considerable $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reduction in both Scope 1 (less heating and cooling) and Scope 2 (lower electricity consumption of appliances, lighting, etc.). This reduction will be driven by the Climate House, a subsidiary of the city of Leuven, which within its remit initiates and supports information and awareness-raising campaigns to make citizens more energy-conscious.

BE - 1.2: A crucial task of the Leuven Climate House is to provide targeted renovation advice to citizens. Particular attention is paid to developing an appropriate offer for disadvantaged groups, who may not be activated with advice alone. A rapid scale-up of operations should show a rapidly growing number of citizens the way to the right renovation interventions, available subsidies, a reliable network in the building sector, and smooth applications for the necessary permits. Besides including vulnerable groups in the transition, efforts are also made to remove barriers for tenants and landlords, who are traditionally less inclined to renovate due to a "split incentive."

To further boost the renovation rate of (individual) homes, we are investigating under what preconditions and on what scale collective renovation can be an accelerator. This is being explored in pilot neighborhood Ter Elst, where a transition towards a fossil-free neighborhood has already been initiated. The conclusions regarding the appropriate scale level, respect for heritage, optimal heating solution in terms of heat demand density, participation, opportunities for linking with mobility, circularity, climate adaptation, etc., will be meticulously documented and used to start up similar trajectories in other neighborhoods, supported by the Climate House.

BE - 1.3: Collective housing such as apartment buildings offers opportunities to make large sustainability gains with a more limited number of interventions. Because they represent a large heat demand in one location, apartment buildings are hotspots around which collective green heating and cooling solutions often provide a sensible course of action. However, the accelerated renovation of flats is no sinecure, as the residents must jointly make the decision to renovate, a decision that comes with technical complexity and large financial investments. Therefore, a pilot project on renovation will be set up with a number of enthusiastic syndicates and homeowners associations. This aims to be a test trajectory that further focuses on the needs and barriers in this context, so that they can be addressed in a tailor-made renovation guidance offer for apartment buildings. This will be strongly pursued within the Pilot Cities Programme in which Leuven participates. In that context, an energy orchestrator will be appointed who will bring together all stakeholders involved, as well as an energy consultant who will help develop the renovation offer specifically for flats on a detailed technical level. In this way, within a few years, the majority of Leuven's collective housing stock will be renovated in an accelerated manner, with residents receiving maximum care and guidance via the developed renovation path for apartment buildings.

BE - 1.4: One part of the residential building stock that deserves special attention is social housing, where residents usually belong to disadvantaged groups. It is essential that they too can benefit from the lower energy bills and improved living and housing quality that come with renovation. As the budgets for renovation at SHM Dijledal are not sufficient to accelerate thorough energy renovation of the entire building stock, a targeted innovation trajectory towards more innovative financing will be set up. Besides the financial aspect, solutions are also being explored for practical problems such as the complexity of moving residents when renovating and the challenge to continuously provide
leuven

#

sufficient (growing) housing capacity. The solutions to these challenges are not clear today, but are being investigated with priority, as accelerating the renovation of social housing offers a great opportunity to make the Leuven climate transition more inclusive.

# 2. Renovation and Retrofitting of Non-Residential Buildings

BE - 2.1: The most significant lever being tapped to accelerate renovation within the non-residential building stock is the vibrant and engaged ecosystem of Leuven stakeholders, brought together and represented by Leuven 2030. From this solid foundation, a collective renovation and green heat program is initiated. Starting with a pilot group of major Leuven stakeholders, this program will be gradually expanded. Participants in the program explicitly express the ambition to make their own building stock fossil-free as soon as possible. The aim of the program is not only to exchange expertise and knowledge and inspire each other, but also to work together where it adds value for the parties involved. An additional and potentially interesting avenue explored within the Investment Plan is the aggregation of multiple projects when seeking financing. In this context, the city is looking at the possible role of a Leuven steward-owned climate fund. Through such a vehicle, more profitable projects or low-risk projects can be leveraged to get projects with greater complexity or risk, or without guaranteed (high) returns funded.

As the concrete barriers and levers with regard to renovation can still vary greatly per subsector, the program can gradually develop tailored guidance for, for instance, public buildings such as schools, for the hospitality industry, for retail, etc.

While the focus of the collective program is to activate the entire Leuven ecosystem, the city of Leuven itself leads by example here. In the short term, the city is working out an ambitious plan to accelerate the renovation and fossil-free heating of its own building stock. For each building or cluster of buildings, an ambitious trajectory will be mapped out, in which many relevant challenges in the Leuven context will be addressed. These challenges include green heat for heritage buildings, buildings with limited availability of green heat sources in the vicinity, complex relocation movements, etc. Working on these challenges also offers an opportunity to further improve the interaction between the various city services involved.

BE - 2.2: Significant $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reductions can also be achieved in the non-residential sector by focusing on behavioral changes and more fuel-efficient appliances. Campaigns on this topic will also be shaped through the same learning network that is being set up for renovation. Here, too, knowledge and inspiration will be actively exchanged, and cooperation will take place where there is added value, e.g. to use economies of scale from group purchasing.

# 3. Climate-Neutral or Climate-Positive New Buildings

BE - 3.1: New construction projects and urban developments are leveraged as catalysts to provide the surrounding urban fabric with green heating and cooling. To enable urban development projects to adopt this climate-positive catalytic role, the right pilot projects are initiated, in collaboration with engaged key stakeholders. Some of these are already described and elaborated upon in this action plan, such as Wakkerzeelsebaan, Redingensite, and Ruelenspark. When working on these projects, crucial prerequisites for climate-positive new construction are examined together with all involved stakeholders. If nearby residences need to be connected, support and technical renovation assistance must be provided to residents, and public support must be garnered. Additionally, the larger heating/cooling system must be managed and financed, likely by a third party rather than the developer themselves. In the short term, the lessons and successes from these pilot projects will be utilized to initiate similar trajectories.

In addition to the technical and financial research into climate-positive new construction conducted through the pilot projects, this principle is also comprehensively framed and anchored in policy. Further integration of the Leuven heat strategy into detailed Neighborhood Heat Plans will indicate in which neighborhoods climate-positive new construction projects are meaningful. This will be further established in guidelines and legislation for the Leuven area, such as building regulations. This way, the heat strategy is spatially detailed and clearly outlined, and the expectations towards developers are legally well-defined.

# MOBILITY &amp; TRANSPORT

MOB – 1.1: A primary pillar of the climate transition within mobility and transport is the encouragement of a sustainable modal shift. Numerous interventions directly or indirectly address this endeavor.

Through a well-considered parking policy, both by the city (public space) and the main key players within the Leuven ecosystem, such as KU Leuven, the number of parking spaces is gradually reduced in line with the pace of the modal shift, and parking is transitioned from on-street to off-street. A direct benefit of this intervention is the availability of space that can be repurposed for climate adaptation, urban greenery, recreation, social interactions, and more. However, this intervention also leads to lower car ownership and usage, prompting people to seek sustainable alternatives. Developing the necessary infrastructure to support these more sustainable modes of transport is described in other pathways but is inherently connected to reducing private car ownership and usage.

In addition to addressing parking policies, efforts are maximized in promoting a shift towards sustainable modes for commuting specifically. Within the Leuven ecosystem, the city collaborates with Leuven 2030 to engage as many major players as possible who are willing to make their mobility policies more sustainable. This can be achieved through awareness campaigns and the offering of a mobility budget as a fiscally appealing alternative to a salary car, for example. This way, employees become sufficiently aware of available alternatives to cars, which will also accelerate the sustainable modal shift on this front.

Finally, the short-term development of shared mobility options is being greatly pushed. Discussions with the relevant players are already ongoing. By providing both station-based and free-floating shared cars and bikes, a balance is sought between providing enough flexibility for citizens (always having a shared vehicle nearby) and sufficient coverage across the entire territory (through proper distribution of station-based shared vehicles) so that certain neighborhoods, such as less densely populated areas or areas with a significant representation of disadvantaged groups, are not left behind.

MOB – 1.2: As described in MOB – 1.1, an efficient parking policy and a shift towards more off-street parking will lead to the liberation of space. In addition to the previously mentioned possibilities that this space offers for climate adaptation, urban greenery to enhance biodiversity and related ecosystem services, recreation, and social interactions, significant economic benefits can also be associated with the additional liberated space. For instance, in locations such as Research Park Haasrode or Science Park Arenberg, freed-up space could be utilized for expanding economic activities or research infrastructure (labs, bio-incubators, office space, etc.).

MOB – 2.1: In conjunction with the sustainable modal shift, the various modes of transportation are being shifted towards green, fossil-free vehicles. This way, the emissions from future mobility in Leuven are further reduced. Alongside the above efforts, there is a strong focus on commitments from major Leuven-based entities to accelerate the electrification of their company car fleets, in addition to offering a mobility budget. The current policy approach is that the deployment of charging infrastructure follows demand (the "pole follows car" principle). In the short term, active discussions are underway with the electricity distribution grid operator Fluvius to align future investments in the distribution grid with Leuven's ambitious climate goals. By mainly providing charging infrastructure where spatially desired parking is available (off-street), this infrastructure deployment can also guide the sustainable modal shift described in pathway MOB – 1.1.

MOB – 2.2: A crucial role is assigned to the rapid and structured deployment and strengthening of bicycle infrastructure and the establishment of a high-quality network of public transport (HQPT-network) in the Leuven region. The ring road around Leuven serves as a multimodal hub that maximally facilitates the movements of cyclists and public-transport users. The necessary projects are expected to be highly challenging in technical, financial, and spatial aspects. Possible and necessary collaborations with neighboring municipalities should not be overlooked. Therefore, a coordinator will be crucial, combined with guaranteed capacity within the city or a subsidiary entity focusing specifically on executing these projects. Within this important strategic pathway, in the initial phase the existing Regionet Leuven, an initiative of the city of Leuven, the province of Flemish Brabant, and Interleuven, is further strengthened in its coordinating role for mobility in the Leuven region. Within this framework, capacity and resources are freed up to execute projects, including associated studies and stakeholder management. After several successfully completed projects, this pathway can gain momentum, leading to increasing interest from neighboring municipalities to build up a structural collaboration on mobility/spatial planning/... This way, the support and visibility of the Leuven climate transition are further enhanced. An important secondary challenge within the further upscaling of public transport is the shortage of depot space and the accelerated electrification, which demands significant investment in charging infrastructure. Regarding the latter, the future charging hubs of public transportation can play a crucial role as energy hubs for a diverse range of charging and energy needs.

MOB – 3.1: As discussed, the deployment of charging infrastructure is a key factor in the electrification of motorized vehicles in Leuven. Charging-infrastructure deployment speed is determined by the market, although the exact locations are strategically chosen as part of Leuven's parking policy. Through coordination with the distribution grid operator Fluvius, it is ensured that the local distribution network is adequately reinforced at strategic locations in a timely manner to facilitate the rollout of charging infrastructure.

MOB – 4.1: Leuven's urban logistics are also being rapidly transitioned to sustainability. Significant progress is already being made towards emission-free urban logistics through individual projects by stakeholders within the Leuven ecosystem. This is apparent in the shift from fossil to fossil-free inland shipping (Beneo-Remy), the electrification of vehicles for waste collection (EcoWerf), and the increasingly wider utilization of bicycle logistics. These pilot projects are gathering knowledge and insights into the main challenges associated with such a transition. Ensuring affordable logistics solutions, operational continuity, compliance with regulations, etc., are important prerequisites here.

The insights acquired are actively shared through the robust network initiated and maintained by Leuven 2030 within the Leuven ecosystem. This network also feeds into the Flemish framework agreement for emission-free urban distribution in which Leuven participates as a research city. More than just knowledge exchange, this network actively seeks potential collaborations. Pooling logistics flows offers opportunities not only for significant sustainability gains but also for financial savings. Additionally, it reduces traffic intensity on the local road network, potentially leading to improved quality of life for the people of Leuven.

Cautious coordination towards pooling logistics flows and establishing city-wide logistics hubs is already underway. The complexity lies in the diverse requirements and practical conditions inherent to certain players or logistics flows (timing, freshness, hygiene, flexibility). In the case of potential collaborations, setting up transparent and consistent consultation moments between stakeholders is a logical initial step to foster mutual trust. Based on this foundation, the first successful practical examples of collaboration will emerge in the short term. These, in turn, will be scaled up to projects

involving other stakeholders and different logistics flows, ultimately resulting in a city-wide sustainable logistics system.

MOB – 5.1: One of the fundamental principles of the Leuven climate transition is that sufficient attention must be given to inclusivity and social justice. Vulnerable groups must be able to fully benefit from the transition and cannot be left behind in (mobility) poverty. Hence, it is crucial to consistently assess new (mobility) policies with a social lens, asking "Who does this measure benefit?" Additionally, efforts are directed toward providing sustainable mobility alternatives for those in vulnerable circumstances.

An important intervention to ensure a successful transition in this aspect as well is the "Everyone Mobile" program. Within this program, the possibility of a mobility budget for vulnerable groups is being explored in the short term. This will be financed through a restructuring of the current third-party payer scheme, supplemented with additional financial resources. This way, the mobility of vulnerable groups is maximally safeguarded during the transition, or even improved through a diverse and effective mobility offering, where vulnerable groups also have sufficient freedom of choice.

# NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS &amp; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE

Within this emissions domain, the strategic pathways not only focus on reducing Leuven's net $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions (mitigation) but also on adapting the territory to a changing climate (adaptation). What is labeled as "co-benefits" in other emissions domains (addressing flood hazards and heat stress, increasing urban greenery and biodiversity, etc.) constitutes an equally important strategic goal here to ensure the quality of life in Leuven.

NBS – 1.1 to NBS – 1.7: To make the entire territory climate-resilient, an integrated approach is needed. This approach is built upon a number of interventions, all of which are essential to achieve the necessary level of adaptation at the right scale and pace. Only if climate adaptation measures are carried out on a sufficiently large scale, while remaining mutually consistent, well-coordinated, and complementary, can the city and its residents fully reap the benefits.

A first important intervention is the development of a Leuven Climate Adaptation Strategy. This will lead to a strong policy anchoring of climate adaptation and Nature-Based Solutions (NBS), clearly identifying priority interventions and areas. The strategy pays adequate attention to the link with the city's spatial characteristics at macro and micro levels. The location of vulnerable institutions, as well as the existing green-blue network at the city level (and gaps that can be addressed), are taken into account. For example, efforts are made to create ventilation corridors and cool, sheltered islands around residential care centers, childcare facilities, schools, etc. The development of this clear, well-founded vision leads to greater support by the public and the city administration and the development of a stronger knowledge base on climate resilience within city services.

To effectively implement the Leuven Climate Adaptation Strategy, a Climate Adaptation Taskforce is established within the city. This taskforce primarily ensures dedicated implementation capacity and resources to select, design, and execute projects related to NBS and climate adaptation. By streamlining operations, certain quick wins can be accelerated in the short term, while more impactful measures, e.g. larger desealing projects, are also realized. Furthermore, the taskforce supports the establishment and strengthening of a learning network on climate adaptation and NBS. By providing design capacity to Leuven partners in this network or directing them to contractors, the threshold for taking action is lowered. Within this network, the taskforce thoroughly documents processes and centrally collects acquired knowledge.

The result of the taskforce in the medium term is the rapid implementation of deliberately selected interventions, e.g. for flood prevention along all Leuven waterways, addressing heat islands, supporting the realization of the water battery to fight drought, as envisaged in the operations of the National Park Brabantse Wouden initiative, further strengthening the urban-regional green-blue network with a focus on planting "future trees" (trees specifically planted to fulfill an important long-term role in improving the city's climate resilience, therefore receiving sufficient space and care to grow to full maturity and size) and additional greenery, providing special care to preservation of existing trees, ... In addition to the establishment of green-blue infrastructure, the taskforce increases support among major players within the Leuven ecosystem, who are structurally involved in its operations.

Citizens can also contribute significantly to a climate-resilient city. For this purpose, a climate adaptation toolkit is created to support and enable citizen engagement. This toolkit informs citizens about the importance of climate adaptation and the possibilities for engaging in NBS, as well as ongoing initiatives that can help them (e.g., Garden Rangers). This not only increases understanding and support for NBS but also activates and empowers citizens to engage in bottom-up efforts on their
leuven

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

own properties. Additionally, the toolkit provides information about synergies with sustainable energy (e.g., solar panels, heat pumps) and rainwater harvesting, thereby spurring sustainability gains across domains in new construction as well as renovation projects. The toolkit also specifies which city services citizens can approach for support on specific climate resilience questions or initiatives. This toolkit becomes a handy guide for internal city services as well, clarifying task allocation and internal processes.

This policy and strategic framework will be especially leveraged to increase ambition in several promising geographical areas, such as the Molenbeek Valley and the inner city of Leuven. These areas hold great potential to engage in NBS, addressing flood risk reduction, drought mitigation, heat stress, biodiversity, and more. An integrated approach is required, in which all stakeholders can participate sufficiently and projects within this area, like the redevelopment of Ruelenspark, strive for synergies as much as possible. These areas represent an opportunity to achieve a significant impact in the short term and also allow room for experimenting with innovative techniques, thus providing valuable feedback to optimize the operations of the taskforce and toolkit.

At a supra-local level, efforts are underway to officially ratify the Brabantse Wouden National Park, of which the Leuven territory is a part. If this recognition is achieved, the city has a role to play in facilitating and supporting the goals set by the Park, such as further developing and integrating the urban-regional green-blue network, promoting nature-inclusive agriculture, and establishing a water battery to counteract drought stress. Leuven itself will reap significant benefits if these goals are achieved. A better water management system upstream of the city will help mitigate the risk of severe flood damage, even though many of the actual interventions occur outside Leuven's territory. In the long term, the National Park can thus become a catalyst for supra-local collaboration on NBS.

To actively monitor and measure the effectiveness of the above interventions, the existing monitoring network is utilized and expanded. Initiatives by external partners, such as Leuven.cool from KU Leuven, go hand in hand with citizen science projects like Curieuzeneuzen. Where necessary, monitoring is reinforced. The taskforce plays a crucial role in identifying monitoring gaps, while at the same time implementing the feedback that the system provides. The toolkit guides citizens to participate in a robust monitoring system through citizen science.

NBS – 2.1: As more and more Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) are implemented in practice and the associated monitoring system is further developed, the city is focusing on the development of a digital twin. This digital twin is initially developed conceptually to define which indicators are most relevant and how the necessary data can be collected at the right spatial and temporal resolution. In the short term, the existing monitoring network will be integrated into the digital twin, and data analysis will evolve from retrospective to predictive, shaping policy choices and clarifying priorities for implementation by the taskforce. In the longer term, the platform can be expanded to incorporate insights from other domains (such as heat demand and potential for district heating networks) to easily detect opportunities for cross-domain integration.

NBS – 3.1: While the primary focus within Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) is on climate resilience rather than climate mitigation, this emission domain can still make a significant contribution to Leuven's transition towards net-zero. Currently, the largest carbon sink on Leuven's territory is Heverleebos. There is considerable potential to enhance the existing green structure in other parts of the territory. By developing a strategic tree plan with a focus on the built environment, existing veteran trees are inventoried alongside candidate future trees. Existing trees will be cherished and protected, as key assets towards more urban biodiversity and climate resilience. Furthermore, interesting locations for planting additional trees are also identified. Over the long term, the

implementation of the plan will result in a robust green network throughout the entire territory. This primarily contributes to higher biodiversity and a more climate-resilient city (cf. above), but limited gains are also expected in terms of additional $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ sequestration.

Another interesting avenue that will be explored to increase $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ sequestration on Leuven's territory is initiating processes related to carbon farming. Through targeted interventions such as cover crops, reduced tilling, conversion of crop fields to permanent grassland, and agroforestry, carbon farmers can store additional carbon on their land. This approach simultaneously promotes nature-inclusive agriculture that benefits biodiversity, climate adaptation, erosion control, and more.

# WASTE &amp; CIRCULARITY

CE – 1.1: Various aspects of a new circular chain for stony fractions within building materials are being explored and fine-tuned. The recovery of these fractions (ceramic fraction, concrete, gypsum) during demolition is first investigated in several pilot projects, while the processing step is being refined through an intensive sorting trial in collaboration with EcoWerf, Vites, and Urban Lab. The intermunicipal environmental company EcoWerf plays a significant role in the pilot phase, contributing to building expertise and exploring the establishment of an Urban Resource Center (URC).

In the subsequent upscaling phase, other players like the Materials Bank will take over the management of the stone-like fractions. An initial recovery on the order of a few hundred tons per year can gradually expand to several thousand to tens of thousands of tons per year based on the knowledge gained from these pilots. Over time, the recovery of these fractions will become more established as a standard practice in demolition, thereby significantly reducing the Scope 3 emissions of buildings. Additionally, this approach leads to decreased reliance on raw materials, job creation, and, after thorough streamlining and professionalization of processes, could potentially result in financial savings.

CE – 1.2: A portion of the reclaimed construction materials will be available for reuse, while the rest will be recycled. Reuse is a higher-level R-strategy with potentially greater sustainability benefits, but it also requires specific and well-optimized processes to control costs and provide sufficient quality assurances. These prerequisites are essential to address the major barrier, which is establishing a market for these products. In the short term, the goal is to achieve reuse of approximately 1.000 tons per year, with a perspective to scale this up to around 8.000 tons per year by 2030.

A key hub for developing these and other material flows is the Leuven Materials Bank. This will be strengthened in the short term with multiple satellite hubs, improving accessibility and capacity for rapid growth. These hubs will be supplied by a collection system that will be scaled up over the coming years to cover the entire city. Although this collection system is currently being developed for a limited number of materials, the structure and accompanying processes can later be applied to other materials as well. The process of conceptualizing, testing, and refining this broad, adaptable framework is explicitly part of the growth trajectory of circularity within the Leuven ecosystem.

CE – 2.1: In addition to the pilot project focused on construction materials, a second pilot trajectory is underway involving approximately 10 identified plastic streams from the UZ Leuven hospital. In the short term, about 200 tons per year are being reclaimed and subjected to quality control measures to enable maximum reuse. This pilot project explores the business case for reclamation and investigates the necessary scale, processing costs, and other factors required to establish a feasible economic model. The project is being further scaled up towards 1.000 tons per year. This expansion involves not only extending the existing streams within Leuven by involving other hospitals and healthcare institutions but also exploring how to increase the scale beyond Leuven and understanding the impact on the business case.

CE – 3.1: Several major innovative players in Leuven have the willingness and potential to act as drivers of circular acceleration. Close collaboration is underway with these players, including UZ Leuven, KU Leuven, the city of Leuven, and imec, in pilot projects within their own building stock. This approach allows the insights gained to be progressively integrated into the asset management of these players. They can not only recover materials through the demolition of existing buildings,

feeding the circular market, but also potentially become significant buyers of circular materials through their renovation or new construction projects.

The involvement of the city also entails embedding circular principles in permitting policies and sustainability frameworks for new construction, in consultation with these players and based on the insights gained.

These major stakeholders in Leuven are also engaged in the collective renovation program, as explained under Built Environment. The learning network established there is well-suited for sharing insights from circular projects and exploring opportunities for collaboration through complementary material flows.

CE – 3.2: In addition to the collective renovation program, which mainly involves major Leuven stakeholders, several existing initiatives aimed primarily at citizens are being tapped into. It is essential to bring circular thinking onto the radar of citizens, so they can incorporate it into their own construction projects. Alongside the Materials Bank, also the Leuven Climate House, maakleerplek, and the city of Leuven itself play an informative and activating role here. Barriers and uncertainties that citizens encounter are identified and addressed through campaigns, advice, and technical support. This way, residents become more familiar with circular construction principles over time and put them into practice. Finally, Leuven entrepreneurs are engaged through the Circular Desk, where the city collaborates with them to explore opportunities, partnerships, and pilot projects related to circularity.

# B-2.2: Individual Action Outlines

Collected in Annex III.

# B-2.3: Summary Strategy for Residual Emissions

In Module A-2.3, we initially set the residual emissions target at an ambitious level of 15 per cent relative to baseline emissions. This served as our initial benchmark for assessing the required emissions reductions. Once we constructed and thoroughly analyzed our portfolio of actions, we conducted a more precise calculation of potential emissions reductions for each sector individually. The resulting estimates for residual emissions per sector can be found in the table below. For the waste sector, no estimates are available as of yet, so the target values specified in Module A-2.3 were copied. Overall, our estimated total residual emissions, amounting to 17 per cent of total baseline emissions, remain well below the general target of 20 per cent.

Our primary approach for addressing these residual emissions in the short term is carbon offsetting. This can be achieved directly on Leuven territory by protecting and reinforcing existing carbon sinks like Heverleebos. Alternatively, we can opt for indirect offsetting by obtaining carbon credits that signify carbon capture or emission reductions achieved elsewhere. A platform like Claire provides the opportunity of purchasing credits locally, using reliable and conservative calculation methods.

When looking beyond 2030, other possibilities to deal with residual emissions (must) enter the scene.

Addressing residual emissions within the buildings sector presents a complex challenge. Offsetting solutions are less than ideal for residential properties, primarily because making offsetting mandatory lacks public support and is legally challenging to enforce. Voluntary offsetting, while an option, is unlikely to cover a substantial portion of these emissions, even when accompanied by intensive campaigning efforts. For buildings in the tertiary sector, offsetting may be a more viable solution, especially with upcoming EU legislation, such as the CSRD, targeting smaller players in the near future.

In the somewhat longer term, a key strategy to deal with these residual emissions involves maintaining a high pace of home and tertiary-building renovations. To achieve this, the Leuven Climate House will undoubtedly continue its efforts beyond 2030, with a focus on those (clusters of) buildings that have not yet undergone renovation. Simultaneously, the gradual phase-out of the gas distribution grid will take place, with district heating and individual heat pumps stepping in. The implementation of Neighborhood Heat Plans will guide the adoption of the most optimal heating strategies for each district.

Within the industry sector, the table above demonstrates that we anticipate that residual emissions will be proportionally notably higher compared to other sectors. This is primarily due to the challenge posed by process emissions and process heat, especially at high temperatures, which today remains difficult to generate in a fossil-free manner at an acceptable cost. This sector, however, will also be targeted by upcoming EU legislation, and a higher level of offsetting seems achievable here, compensating for this higher share of residual emissions in the short term. In the medium term, innovative solutions concerning further electrification, green hydrogen, and green synthetic fuels will be implemented when ready. Strong ties to the KU Leuven university can catalyze the early adoption of these technologies as the university is a frontrunner in many related fields, e.g. solar hydrogen panels, lignin-derived chemicals, and LCA.

In mobility and transport, the realization of the proposed breakthrough projects will provide the basis for further emissions cuts in this field, as high-quality bicycle infrastructure and public transport

networks are deployed. As the market is conquered further by fossil-free vehicles and key players in Leuven increasingly couple their logistics streams, a sustained decline in emissions in this field is anticipated. Moreover, the impact of higher-level legislation, including regulations at the EU level, is poised to serve as a significant driver in promoting green mobility and will significantly influence the pace of this transition. At the same time, carbon offsetting is likely to play a role in logistics and public transport, where decision-making authority is concentrated among a few key players, and where public demand for green product chains is increasing.

The Scope 2 emissions through use of electricity from the grid will be reduced further by improving energy efficiency wherever possible, for instance through more efficient household appliances, relighting campaigns, ... Pushing PV production even higher, as well as the possibility of realizing wind turbines on the Leuven territory or participating in wind projects beyond Leuven, will continue to elevate the share of renewable electricity through local production or green power contracts.

Currently, our portfolio contains several promising breakthrough projects aimed at addressing Scope 3 emissions, particularly within the plastics and building materials sectors. To achieve the necessary comprehensive reduction in Scope 3 emissions, it is imperative to gain a deeper understanding of these emissions, extending beyond the figures provided for the waste sector. The insights obtained from the presented pilot projects are actively being incorporated into a strategic framework that is currently under development. This framework is designed to facilitate the expansion of our efforts in reducing emissions and promoting circularity, with the R-ladder serving as the guiding principle. This integration of the R-ladder approach will extend to multiple materials streams and various target groups. As a result, the R-ladder concept will become more deeply ingrained at the policy level. This includes its incorporation into legislation governing urban development projects, but also influencing decisions at the business and household levels, e.g. encouraging the use of circular materials in small-scale renovation projects.

# Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

The indicator set outlined above was selected based on both relevance and workability. An indicator was considered most relevant if it directly measures the outcome of one of the impact pathways outlined in Module B-1. This explains the current focus on so-called output and outcome indicators, rather than input or process indicators. Some indicators, for instance concerning annual rain, annual heatwave days (determined at the national level), etc., were omitted in this overview because they cannot be influenced significantly by policymaking at the city level. However, these metrics are still readily available and will therefore be used to find correlations in the data or to investigate certain trends. To ensure a sufficiently workable set of indicators, existing measurement networks and initiatives were tapped into wherever possible.

The criterium to distinguish patches of natural land is suggested in the NZC reference material to be 100 m, with additional identification of large barriers like roads. Due to time constraints and the nature of the Leuven data (which also takes into account solitary trees and very small patches of green (BBK 2018)), a suitable distance was found to be 2 m, without doing a manual correction for roads etc. When investigating the resulting distinguished green areas, this criterium seems to provide a reasonable metric for structural connectivity of green in the Leuven area. |

The transport modes walking, biking and public transport are summarized as « green transport modes », because they cause no (walking and biking) greenhouse gas emissions, or at least significantly less (public transport) greenhouse gas emissions than the transport modes private motor cars or motorbikes. The indicator can be defined as the average number of trips per day that an inhabitant of the city does walking, biking or going by public transport, expressed as a percentage of the average total number of trips per inhabitant and day |

|                                                    | Description Climate policy is a transversal policy area. It touches directly on the work of different city departments: sustainability, mobility, public domain, spatial planning, heritage, economy, housing, education, area-oriented operation, and so on. In addition, it is crucial that all the departments, including those which are less obvious, such as culture, communication, sport, finance, etc., become involved in the climate objectives and help to achieve or propagate them in their own field of work. An effective policy requires an integrated and holistic approach and close cooperation between departments and administrators across policy areas. This is not new for city administration. There is already close and good cooperation in many areas, often from an area-oriented approach or from strategic project work. The area coordinators and services as area-oriented operation are crucial in this approach. The drawing up of a number of policy plans, such as the structure plan, climate action plan (made within the scope of the climate team), or youth space plan also took place through transversal processes in which a broad support was sought within the organization. A number of citywide innovative processes have been launched from the chief executive officer's staff. They are building the government of tomorrow, with an eye toward providing efficient services to residents. Such an innovative governance approach is also appropriate for the climate theme. Climate must be integrated in a thorough, thoughtful, smart and efficient way as a common thread in our internal processes, both substantive and operational. |                                                                                                                                                        |

|     | Commitments     | City of Leuven integrates climate objectives within the entire city policy. If choices have to be made, it is important to focus on and prioritize "win-win" projects, which add value to both climate objectives and other policy areas.City of Leuven focuses on generating impact and rolling out motivating and stimulating actions:An accelerated transition, together with the pioneering role of Leuven, requires the city to focus on those projects and processes that - sometimes only after upscaling them or within the policy framework - have the largest impact and thus contribute in the first place, directly or indirectly, to an accelerated emission reduction.City of Leuven provides the necessary capacity (grant management) to find financing for climate projects:Achieving the climate goals and realizing the portfolio of breakthrough projects requires targeted funding. The additional capacity will be used to search for grants, write project proposals with internal and external partners.City of Leuven commits to monitor climate goals:The CCC outlines a clear path towards climate neutrality, indicating how much reduction we plan to achieve in which year and with which measures. Targets, linked to concrete, calculated measures, clearly show how the city is going to achieve the proposed reduction.Monitoring is crucial for adjusting policy and making sure the planned measures are not falling short in reaching the climate objectives. |

|     | **Description**                                    | Leuven is not an island; it is connected to the region by stone roads and stream valleys. The challenge of climate change does not stop at the municipal border; the levers for solutions may lie in neighboring municipalities. City-regional cooperation allows to capitalize on economies of scale, and is a prerequisite to realize breakthrough projects, such as the bicycle route network. The Leuven City Region is an attractive, dynamic region in full bloom. The number of inhabitants is rising, economic activity and the knowledge economy are growing. The downside of this is that the livability and accessibility of the region are under high pressure. Moreover, a large part of the population lives in car-dependent locations outside the cities and village centers. This causes congested roads, encroachment on open space and difficult to access facilities. Climate change and urbanization pressures threaten the unique landscapes and biodiversity of the forests on the province's southern border. We want to meet these challenges by making both mobility and spatial planning more sustainable. We make residents less dependent on the car by developing both a network for high-quality public transportation and a high-quality bicycle network. At the same time, we concentrate most of the new housing, workplaces and facilities at the nodes of that network. We are working toward a 15-minute region. Inappropriate developments outside the cores we counteract. Already today, the City of Leuven is working intensively with neighboring municipalities and supra-local partners on projects such as Regionet Leuven, Walden and the Brabantse Wouden. By strengthening this cooperation, we can better meet the challenges. |

|     | Description In climate policy, the city is often the initiator or leader of projects or measures but, to generate impact, a city also relies on close collaborations with others. An effective policy requires an integrated and holistic approach and close cooperation between departments and other authorities, organizations, associations, companies, ... across policy domains. An important external effect has already been developed in many policy areas and in different city departments (e.g., sustainability, mobility, public domain, economy, housing, area-oriented operation, etc.). In the future, this external effect will be further developed. Climate must be integrated in a thorough, thoughtful, smart and efficient way as a common thread in our external processes, both substantive and operational. The urban climate policy is partly realized by organizations in which the city participates (intermunicipal companies, social housing companies, non-profit organizations, the water group, etc.) and by government agencies active in Leuven (AWV, De Lijn, Vlaamse Waterweg, infrabel, ANB, etc.). All these actors should be maximally involved in order to formulate and realize the same ambitions. Important elements of the integrated climate policy are realized by other organizations, associations or companies. Therefore, the city is increasingly working together in networks (e.g. around nature policy, food strategy, water, circular economy, etc.) in order to engage and support these partners in the realization of the urban objectives. If we want to guide our cities together faster towards a climate-neutral future, further coordination with our supra-local governments is crucial. In light of the next Flemish elections, we are therefore reaching out from Leuven to other climate-ambitious Flemish central cities to come up with a supported memorandum together, addressed to the full Flemish government and the party chairmen. In it, we want to make a plea to maximally further activate the Flemish levers to accelerate urban climate transitions, and this against the background of the acceleration initiated at the European level. The memorandum aims to formulate recommendations in five emission domains: energy, built environment, mobility, climate adaptation and circular economy. Finally, Leuven depends on other governments and it is desirable to cooperate with neighboring municipalities and other municipalities. To this end, city administrations together with the administration must set up an active operation that directs and supports where necessary but also provides support in the city. This will be further included in the breakthrough project on city-regional cooperation. This external leg of climate policy is very important and different from the role and tasks of the Leuven 2030 non-profit organization. |

Moreover, economies of scale are possible if we involve enough external stakeholder.                                                                                                                             |

# EXTENDING THE NEURAL NETWORK

|     | ### Description                                    | A successful climate transition requires intense and coordinated cooperation among actors in the societal pentagon. Leuven 2030's network approach follows a 'neural network' model that strengthens key nodes and connections to accelerate a socially just climate transition. The strategy focuses on activating a critical 20% of frontrunners and key actors across the social pentagon and supporting both existing and emerging networks (e.g., School2030, Urban Lab, social justice, sustainable food, construction). |

Closer links between actors enable stronger collective action and transition capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|     | Description It is an illusion to think that the climate transition can be managed centrally. It is probably more correct to assume that it's to be facilitated primarily decentrally. Climate Action Plans (KAP) can encourage a diverse range of stakeholders from citizens to businesses to set the right priorities and take the most accurate climate action. The network organization Leuven 2030's goal is to facilitate the climate transition in a more decentralized way and to encourage stakeholders in taking ambitious climate action. Towards actors that already have a KAP, the operation will aim to positively challenge actors to raise the level of ambition where necessary. In addition, Leuven 2030 can support stakeholders' goals and actions where possible, e.g. by facilitating cooperation between stakeholders. To actors who do not yet have a KAP, L2030 will connect them with the right partners in its network so they can co-develop a strategic plan with prioritised climate actions. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

This will undoubtedly impact the number of actions that will take place within the Leuven ecosystem. In addition, this operation strengthens the fabric between Leuven stakeholders, which we also expect to have a positive impact on accelerating the climate transition. After all, the complexity of the climate transition necessitates cooperation. |

|     | Description                                        | Concept Civic Contracting is a mechanism to catalyze collective action aligned to a common goal by creating greater transparency and accountability. It moves beyond broad promises toward more binding action by formalizing commitments along a spectrum from open pledges to outcome-based contracts. Signatories agree to report publicly on progress. Civic Contracting is open to all stakeholder types and is used in Leuven's Mission context and Pilot Cities Programme. |

|                        | Description An important part of portfolio management and implementation will be to establish a MEL approach. Particularly in a context of innovation and experimentation, there is great value in periodic stock-taking to assess progress and, when needed, adjust course. On the short term, the Leuven team will pursue MEL by: • Establishing a structured learning process as part of Leuven's activities in the Pilot Cities Programme, with a focus on the emissions domains of Energy Systems and Built Environment; • Creating a context for learning as part of the effort to establish greater transparency and accountability (accountability-for-learning); • Monitoring the transition, and thereby providing a basis for evaluation and learning; • Aligning monitoring systems to the indicators presented in Module B-3 of the Action Plan; |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|     | Description The steps you take today are based on your images of the future. Therefore, to get people to take action for the climate, it is often suggested that better narratives with positive images of the future can play an important role. Only: there are more images of doom in circulation than there are inspiring images of how things can be different. Moreover, many people or groups do not get the chance to imagine their own positive futures and are dependent on the images that do circulate, which do not always match their lifeworlds. Thus, the climate crisis is also a crisis of imagination. Therefore, in this project we will co-create positive images of the future that give hope and prospects for action. We will do this specifically around housing and with Leuven residents who are prosperous but reluctant to make major changes. We translate the future scenarios that come out of the co-creative workshops into activating communication. Moreover, we also invite theater makers to join the workshops and work with the outcome. Finally, we pour what we learn into a methodological framework that can be applied to other target groups and climate domains. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

**Leuven 2030 (partner)**
Leuven 2030 acts in this project as a client and link to the local network. This means that she helps determine the approach of the case study, helps recruit the target group and ensures that the outcome of the project finds its way to her network. In the context of this project, she pays particular attention to the link with the arts and culture field.
**30CC**
CC is Leuven's cultural center. She puts forward two artists to attend the workshops and invites them to work with the insights gained. She also provides a bridge between the future scenarios and the citywide culture festival "New Horizons" that will take place in Leuven from September 2023 to mid-January 2024. |

| | **Commitments** | Open Time knowledge center commits to incorporate lessons learned into a methodological framework for other audiences/domains and share it for broader use. NONO translates future scenarios into communication material and develops impact assessment. Leuven 2030 shares project outcomes with its network. 30CC integrates scenarios into broader operations, including as an entry point for the citywide cultural festival New Horizons. |
| | **Enabling impact** | Better, more diverse narratives with positive future images are needed to drive climate action. This project develops such narratives, turns them into effective communication, tests effectiveness, uses future scenarios as input for cultural initiatives, targets hard-to-reach groups, and creates a methodological framework that can scale to other target groups and climate domains. |

|     | Description A group of committed young people want to help think about the city's climate policy. They act as ambassadors who want to inspire and activate. The young people play the role of the city's "conscience": they are the future, they have high expectations for climate policy and address politicians, policy makers and the broader stakeholder field about their responsibility. Each time, the young people choose a theme on which they will work for several months, e.g. mobility, reducing paved surfaces, circular economy, ... They receive information from experts, study the city's policy, question other young people about their experiences, ... From these findings, a number of action points emerge, which they address in a dynamic way. Then they invite policy makers to engage in a constructive dialogue about the problems young people identify and to think together about possible solutions. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|     | ### Description                                    | The project broadens the language palette used by service providers so all residents, especially socially vulnerable groups, recognize themselves in climate offerings and can contribute actively. Through targeted training and coaching, capacities are built so this perspective is systematically included in communication, offerings, and project design, with continuous interaction between civil society and relevant service providers. |

|     | Description The goal of the FEAST project (https://feast2030.eu) is to make it easy for all Europeans to eat healthily and sustainably. The project running from 07/2022 to 06/2027 places vulnerable groups at the center to ensure a just and equitable transition. Leuven Living Lab will focus on how digital tools can help create more healthy and sustainable food for vulnerable people. One of the concepts being tested is a common action platform. This platform gives stakeholders working with vulnerable groups and food the opportunity to work together to make an even greater impact. The chosen functionalities and platform are based on the needs of the stakeholders. It also looks at how such a platform works best and what human interaction is needed to make it work optimally. This intervention focuses on the topic of food. However, it addresses two cross-cutting topics, namely the use of digital tools to improve stakeholder collaboration and impact and how to change behavior for the better. The lessons from this project can provide an indication of how to change behavior and accelerate collaboration - including in other thematic areas. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|     | Description To really get people to take action, we need to talk, but most importantly, we need to listen. KlimaatContact is based on the proven methodology of Carbon Conversations (UK) and KlimaatGesprekken (NL). Climate Contact wants people to choose a climate-friendly society. Not because they have to, but because they see it as better. We do this by training and supporting climate coaches to deliver a 6-part workshop series. Participants will be inspired and activated to be part of the climate transition and enter the conversation with others. In the workshops we use the latest insights from climate psychology. Participants learn concrete techniques to better communicate about climate change and the choices we make. They conduct positive and connecting climate conversations and thus influence their environment. In time, this creates a snowball effect. Once enough people are reached, climate-friendly choices become the new normal. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Meanwhile, we have grown into an organization with more than 150 active climate coaches across Flanders. Since January 2022, we have been working on behalf of organizations and companies such as the Province of Limburg, Department of Environment, Flemish Energy and Climate Agency, AZ Groeninge, the King Baudouin Foundation, Colruyt Group, P&G, the Port of Antwerp, UCLL, City of Ghent, Fair Fashion Fest, VUB, KU Leuven and University of Antwerp, etc. etc. We are also currently looking at ways in which City of Leuven can offer such a pathway for its own staff. |

|     | Description A digital twin combines different data streams to create a graphical representation of the city. Within this graphical representation, computational models are then run to do simulation and prediction. A digital twin is widely applicable within various policy domains. A digital twin can make simulations and predictions about e.g. mobility using a traffic model, or it can show links between motorized transport and air quality or help determine where best to plan which modes of transport. A digital twin can also be used in the energy sector to e.g. simulate green energy yields linked to weather forecasts, or to investigate which energy requirements need to be met in urban planning. Of course, a digital twin can also be used within the built environment sector to e.g. create planning prioritization for the renovation of a neighborhood or over the entire city. Through the horizontal, cross-sectoral deployment of a digital twin, this tool offers added value in planning and management tasks within those different policy domains and can also take data and insights from those different domains and combine them to arrive at even broader insights. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

SOCIAL JUSTICE

|     | **Intervention** |     |
| --- | ---------------- | --- |
|     | **Description**  |

A thorough climate transition undoubtedly also has major social implications, with the risk of fueling social inequality. This highlights the need for policies that proactively link climate goals and social objectives. Leuven 2030 aims to be at the forefront of practice development for an inherently socially just climate transition.

Within the Leuven 2030 network, there has been a consortium of professionals from the social work field who want to help set the course for a socially just climate transition.

Their efforts led to the identification of some breakthrough projects that directly contribute to this objective. In addition, through a review of the portfolio, they also made some useful additions to the current set of breakthrough projects to enhance the social-justice nature of the actions. Finally, spurred by this group, a guiding principle was dedicated to this objective so that 20% of each breakthrough project benefits 20% of the population, living below the poverty line.

The way in which will be further concretized in the coming period.                                                                                                  |

# 6 Outlook and Next Steps

Moving forward, attention will shift to implementation of the Climate City Contract. Several areas of activity have been identified to support this process:

**Portfolio Management and Execution**: As a critical first step we will establish a process for moving our portfolio of actions into implementation. Such a process will be designed to enable a wide range of activities (convening stakeholders, creating synergies, surfacing learnings, sustaining engagement) and provide value to a diverse set of actions (early-stage/mature, city-led/ecosystem-led, place-based/non-place-based). It will support the creation of a pipeline of new actions and enable the continuous development of the portfolio;

**Catalyzing Investment**: To support implementation of the portfolio we will seek to use the Investment Plan as a means of deepening engagement with the financial sector and unlocking investment. This could involve the creation of new financial infrastructure such as a steward-owned fund, although further discussion is needed to determine the right approach. Other steps include expanding capacity and capabilities around climate finance, continuing to develop business cases, and engaging with other cities to share best practices and explore possibilities for collaboration;

**Governance and Capacity Building**: Alongside the creation of a portfolio process and an investment approach we will further solidify and develop the governance structure set up around the Mission. This could involve the creation of a hybrid team pooling city and ecosystem capacity and in any case will need to entail expanding capacity and resources to adequately carry the components of the CCC forward;

**Monitoring Commitments**: We will establish an approach to foster greater transparency and accountability and track commitments formalized in the Climate City Contract. Several components could form part of such an approach, including a public inventory of commitments, a reporting mechanism, and a forum for peer-to-peer account-giving. These could be accompanied by the creation of supportive social and digital infrastructure and a team entrusted with overseeing the monitoring process;

**Outreach to Citizens**: We will launch a public campaign to raise further awareness of the Climate City Contract and connect to a wider range of citizens. This broad engagement will complement citizen engagement at the level of individual actions included in the portfolio.

An activity that cuts across all of these areas is building and sustaining support for the Mission, an effort that will continue into the coming months and years. Two upcoming milestones in this regard are a session convening key signatories to revisit the set of guiding principles included in the Commitments section of the CCC (October) and an event to celebrate and present the CCC to stakeholders (November).

Future iterations of the CCC will develop organically as work in the areas set out above gets underway. The portfolio will evolve as new insights and pathways are surfaced in implementation and new signatories come into the fold. Commitment will evolve too, and hopefully deepen in response to the monitoring process. Progress along all three dimensions of the CCC will be documented, enabling us to submit an updated version every two years.

Climate Neutrality Commitments

# 1 Introduction

This document presents and contextualizes the commitments collected for the Climate City Contract (CCC). As described in a section below, commitment was sought at two levels: the level of a set of guiding principles formulated for the CCC and the level of individual actions included in the Action Plan. Both sets of commitments are appended. Like the other components of the CCC, the commitments are part of a process of iterative development, and are expected to be refined and supplemented with new commitments as the CCC moves into implementation.

# 2 Goal: Climate Neutrality By 2030

The city has formally committed to pursuing climate neutrality by 2030. This is affirmed in a decision adopted by the city board in the context of participation in the Pilot Cities Programme. The decision is included in Annex I. The city had previously committed to reducing emissions by 55 per cent by 2030. The Mission raises that target to at least 80 per cent, and the Action Plan marks a first step in attempting to close the resulting gap.

As noted in the introduction to the Action Plan, the goal set by the Mission is exceedingly ambitious and may not be achieved in full. Nevertheless, the hope and the aspiration is to use the Mission as a catalyst for accelerated action and to deliver steep and durable emissions reductions that set the stage for full climate neutrality. In addition to mitigation, the effort to adapt to climate change forms an integral part of our Climate City Contract.

Included in the goal of reaching climate neutrality are all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, with the exception of:

Emissions from transport on highways passing through Leuven (E40/E314);
Emissions falling under the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS);
Non-energy-related emissions from Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU).

These exclusions are discussed in greater detail in Part A of the Action Plan.

Scope 3 emissions are partially included, in the form of emissions from the treatment of waste, totaling approx. 48.000 tons, and emissions associated with materials use in the built environment. These latter emissions, while targeted in the Action Plan, are not included in the emissions inventory as they cannot yet be accurately quantified, but they are estimated to be roughly equal in size to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions combined. Future iterations of the Climate City Contract are expected to more fully map and address Scope 3 emissions.

Beyond the direct impacts of mitigation and adaptation, the decision to take part in the Mission was motivated by delivering the broad set of indirect impacts or co-benefits that accompany climate action. These include improved physical and mental well-being, improved air quality, increased road safety, increased biodiversity, job creation, energy independence, and an increased sense of belonging. They are identified at length in the impact pathways presented in Module B-1 of the Action Plan.

# 3 Key Priorities and Strategic Interventions

When it comes to climate change, there are no silver bullets. Rapid decarbonization calls instead for a broad sweep of measures, designed to do everything, everywhere, all at once. Nevertheless, out of the many interventions needed, some are more impactful than others. Presented below is a set of five key interventions, arranged in no particular order and selected with regard for both direct and indirect impacts. They informed the composition of the portfolio as well as the process of obtaining commitments.

) Collective Green Heat

Of the five emissions domains, the largest potential for emissions reduction (Scope 1 and 2) resides in Energy Systems and Built Environment. Within Energy Systems, the most impactful action is the deployment of collective green heat, which carries a reduction potential of approx. 48.000 tons. Delivering on this potential is a top priority, and one that is reflected in numerous actions included in the portfolio, including the set of pilots developed around the topic (Redingensite, Vaart, etc.) and the action investigating the possibility of establishing a Leuven Energy Company. The deployment of collective green heat also sits at the heart of Leuven's activities in the Pilot Cities Programme.

) Renovation of Non-Residential Buildings

Within Built Environment, the action with the greatest potential emissions impact is the renovation of non-residential buildings (approx. -45.000). While the potential impact of renovating residential buildings is roughly similar, there is a higher degree of concentrated ownership in the non-residential sector, creating a more favorable context for action at scale. If renovation is paired with action to shift to green heat, which in practice it is likely to, the impact of this intervention rises to approx. 60.000 tons of reduced emissions. Two main actions in the portfolio address the renovation of non-residential buildings: the collective renovation program for large building owners and the renovation of city-owned buildings.

) Adaptation

Alongside mitigation, a key priority is adapting to climate change. One strategic intervention is the replacement of impermeable surfaces with natural infrastructure. This enables greater infiltration, replenishing water supplies and softening the impact of flooding, and mitigates the heat-island effect – two pillars of urban resilience. Adaptation also yields many indirect impacts, and it is where climate action becomes most tangible, creating buy-in for the transition as a whole. The portfolio actions addressing adaptation include actions to develop new policy and strategy, establish a taskforce, deploy a toolkit to support citizen and stakeholder engagement, and expand and preserve the Leuven tree stock.

) Place-Based Integration

One key for accelerating the transition lies in integrating and cleverly combining actions. While integration is a principle that we have sought to stitch into the whole of the portfolio, it is most fully and most radically expressed in the portfolio's seven place-based actions. These seek to draw out the connections and potential synergies between actions spanning multiple emissions domains and surface pathways to joined-up implementation. By diving headlong into the complexity of rapid decarbonization, they hope to uncover novel approaches and move whole areas towards climate neutrality and urban resilience.

# 5) Just Transition

A successful transition is one in which **social justice** and decarbonization go hand in hand. This implies that the costs and benefits of the transition are equitably distributed and that processes are designed to be inclusive and responsive to a wide range of voices. As described in the Action Plan, there are several elements in place contributing to a just transition in Leuven, yet opportunities remain to go further. The Climate City Contract seeks to capture some of those opportunities both by incorporating social justice in the portfolio and by enshrining it in the set of guiding principles that form part of Leuven’s Commitments section.

An overview of just-transition actions included in the portfolio is presented in Module A-3.3.

# 4 Principles and Process

The Commitments pillar of our Climate City Contract took shape along two complementary tracks. On the one hand, we sought commitment at the level of the individual actions included in the portfolio. On the other hand, we called on stakeholders to commit to a set of 10 guiding principles. The content of both types of commitments developed iteratively, in consultation with stakeholders. The guiding principles were developed in tandem with the city board and with Leuven 2030’s Board of Directors, which represents six stakeholder groups, while portfolio commitments were shaped in bilateral discussion with stakeholders.

Formalizing commitment marks an important step in our climate-neutrality journey. We believe it has the potential to catalyze collective, aligned action and create greater **transparency and accountability**. By making a formal commitment and agreeing to share progress publicly, signatories to the Climate City Contract voluntarily invite scrutiny and demonstrate that they intend to follow through on their commitment. This builds trust and could inspire others to follow suit, creating a positive feedback cycle that gradually ratchets up ambition. The effectiveness of such a contracting system depends on a number of factors:

The specificity of commitments: Are commitments concrete? Time-bound? The more specific a commitment, the greater the chances at holding its owner to account;
The level of transparency: Are commitments and progress reports easily accessible, and written in language that is easy to understand?;
The level of scrutiny: Are there effective monitoring systems in place? Is there a mechanism for reporting? A forum for peer-to-peer account-sharing (mutual accountability)?

Following submission of the Climate City Contract, the Leuven team will establish a monitoring approach to track commitments and support and enable stakeholders to hold themselves and each other to account. The type of accountability we seek to establish is one oriented towards **learning**. This creates an opportunity to align to the structured learning process that is being put in place as part of Leuven’s activities in the Pilot Cities Programme.

While the precise design of the system is not yet decided, there is clarity around the components it could include: a public inventory of commitments, a reporting mechanism, a process for peer-to-peer account-giving (which could consist of signatories giving a prepared statement, then participating in a question-and-answer session with other signatories), and expert review (for assessing technical aspects of commitments). New forms of digital infrastructure (e.g., a platform for progress-sharing) and social infrastructure (e.g., a venue for the informal gathering of signatories) could be created to support this process.

# ELI M I S S I O N ON 100 CLIMATE NEUTRAL &amp; SMART CITIES - TOWARDS GUIDING PRINCIPLES

CCC CHARTER

## 1. CONTEXT

In light of the first Leuven climate contract (Climate City Contract), a representative innovation portfolio of breakthrough projects is being developed, each including the commitments of the actors involved. Complementary to these project-related commitments, a charter is being drawn up with guiding principles that in the short term will generally and sufficiently formally find their way into the internal processes of the organizations that explicitly opt for an accelerated Leuven climate transition.

## 2. APPROACH

The set of guiding principles is conceived to touch on every crucial aspect within an urban climate transition, from "thematic" to "cross-cutting" approaches.

The charter of guiding principles is not an options menu. With it, the signatory organisations commit to a dedicated mindset and the will to achieve global, coherent policies. Pursuing a positive social impact is crucial and a priority within each organisation.

## 3. TO 10 GUIDING PRINCIPLES

### GOVERNANCE

The accelerated transition will be together, or won't be.

Achieving equitable and sustainable prosperity for current and future generations requires a broad-based acceleration of the transition.
In light of the urban climate transition, it is not enough to only implement fossil-free and resource-saving policies within one's own 'circle of control'. The acceleration of the transition will also be realised in everyone's 'circle of influence'.
For each climate action we implement, we take into account the possible impact on (the climate actions of) other actors and look for synergies. Conversely, we adopt a constructive attitude to contribute to the realisation of climate projects of other actors, in which we are a stakeholder and/or can act as a facilitator.
We realise meaningful systemic impact by collaborating and aligning, across legal entities, silos, ownership boundaries and existing processes.
The European and internationally agreed climate commitments and the findings of climate scientists (IPCC) on the urgency of the challenge are our compass.

# MINDSET

The climate transition requires clear prioritisation and a focus on the most impactful actions.

An accelerated transition, together with the pioneering role that Leuven wants to continue to assume, requires a focus on those **projects and processes** that - sometimes through upscaling - can realise the **greatest impact** and thus contribute in the first place, directly or indirectly, to an accelerated emission reduction.
We approach the accelerated transition challenge with an open mind to explore new territory, to test and embrace **new logics**, to help develop new levers, to **innovate** and **accelerate**, to **lead** beyond existing frames of thought, system boundaries and comfort zones.
We actively propagate this **crucial mindset**, with a focus on meaningful impact on the ground, both to our own constituency, and to the outside world.
We are committed to a strong and ambitious **in-house sustainability strategy**, making explicit the targeted emissions reductions and the intended positive social impact.

# SOCIAL JUSTICE

The climate transition will be social and equitable or won't be.

**Social justice** is an obvious principle in the transition sought. Some 15% of Leuven residents live below the poverty line. Therefore, we apply the guiding principle of the 15% intention in relevant breakthrough projects. Their results (access to (residual) heating, access to shared mobility...) reach an audience of which some 15% live below the poverty line.
An accelerated transition requires **not only an approach based on personal responsibility**, but a '1+1=3 approach'; i.e. together, where stronger shoulders take in tow parties and residents - who otherwise have less opportunity to do so themselves, and where those with a larger footprint also take greater responsibility.

# FUNDING

Everyone's financial policy is a crucial lever in accelerating climate transition.

The necessary steps are being taken to embed **climate budgeting** into its own policy making.
**Ways will be examined to maximize** the sustainability of its own financing, e.g. by choosing financial products with a sufficiently mature sustainability focus and by examining the extent to which it is possible to contribute to the financing of the climate transition according to one's ability.
Finally, it explores ways in which **portfolio-level funding**, through a yet-to-be-determined vehicle, can be a **funding logic** that can be supported and subscribed to by the partners involved.

LEUVEN IN CLIMATE CITY CONTRACT

# MONITORING

To measure is to know.

There is an explicit willingness to be **transparent** about the commitments taken and to report on the realisations - where possible according to calibrated climate standards - that contribute to the acceleration of the Leuven transition. A shared platform thus takes stock of the commitments made and the corresponding progress in realisations.
In addition, its own **internal and public channels** are also used to communicate about its own commitments and the progress of realisations, in accordance with the guidance of the partnered communication strategy.

# DECARBONIZATION BUILT ENVIRONMENT

Every building (and) related project is a key to transition.

For any type of large-scale construction (new construction and renovation), a **fossil-free energy supply** with maximum local production of renewable energy and minimum energy consumption, is targeted for the building in question.
For large-scale construction projects, the potential for **decarbonisation of the entire project site** (if applicable) as well as **for the wider environment** surrounding the project site is investigated and mapped. We pay attention to the existing spatial qualities of the property and its affordability (ref. social justice).
The choice of building **design** (focusing as much as possible on adaptability and reuse) and of **materials used** (use of secondary materials and materials with the lowest possible climate impact) also provides reduction potential along the entire value chain and at the local level for a significant reduction in emissions.

# MATERIAL IMPACT

Reducing resource use across the chain and commitment to circular construction are important levers for accelerating climate transition.

The **impact of building materials** is in the same magnitude as scope 1 and 2 emissions. This is taken into account in the policy.
For any type of large-scale construction (new construction and/or renovation), the (financial, organizational) feasibility of **substantially reducing the total impact of the materials used** is investigated, and based on that knowledge (incl. reuse and LCA), choices are made that take maximum account of this.

# LOCAL PRODUCTION RE

Committing to maximum local production of renewable energy has a positive impact on many aspects of our climate challenge.

Producing renewable energy locally has a positive impact on emission rates, our energy independence and security, and energy price stability. In addition, local energy production provides sustainable job creation and strategic community-building. Opting for as much local renewable energy as possible fits into a broader vision around an active sustainable heating policy and an organised strategy to move away from fossil fuels in the next few years.

LEUVEN &amp; CLIMATE CITY CONTRACT
For any type of large-scale construction (new construction and renovation), maximum deployment of PV on the available (rooftop) area (or any technology that boosts local renewable energy production) is opted for.
For any type of large-scale construction (new construction and renovation), the (financial, organizational) feasibility of maximum heat production (including the possibility of a party other than the project owner investing in it) is investigated.

## MOBILITY

Efficient and sustainable urban mobility creates a positive social impact, including transport justice.

We recognise the importance of integrated planning and mobility policy.
Infrastructure managers, operators, attractors and users are shaping the transition to efficient and sustainable mobility for the purpose of emission reduction, better health, a safer and higher quality living environment and assured multimodal accessibility.
Impactful efforts are made using a three-pronged approach: reduce (e.g. shorter unsustainable trips), shift (to sustainable modes) and change (zero-emission vehicles), including for urban logistics, while paying attention to social justice.
The STOP principle is actively facilitated and promoted: initial focus on pedestrians (Stappers in Dutch) and cyclists (Trappers in Dutch), then on public and shared transport (Openbaar vervoer in Dutch), then on private road transport (P), with an eye on physically, economically, socially and digitally inclusive mobility.

## ADAPTATION &amp; BIODIVERSITY

Climate change will also make itself increasingly felt in the Leuven region. Anticipating this is forward-looking policy.

An ambitious strategy around adaptation complements ambitions around mitigation. We systematically depave where we can, taking into account the growth of the city. Where we own substantial paved surfaces, a strategy will be drawn up in the short term to reduce paving on the whole of those sites in coordination with other policy objectives. This will seek - across the whole of the sites - to maximise depaving/de-surfacing, sustainable water management, and explicitly contribute to restored, richer and more robust biodiversity.
We strengthen the green and blue infrastructure that makes our city more resilient and climate resilient.
In addition, systems are being developed to encourage individuals to break up existing pavement. Net de-surfacing is sought in the reconstruction of public spaces.

Brussels, 6th of October 2023

"EU Mission on Climate Neutral and Smart Cities"
Commitment of the Federal Government in supporting the 4 selected Belgian EU Mission Cities

The EU Mission "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" aims to support the just transition towards climate neutral and smart European cities in 2030. As such, European cities can substantially contribute to the Green Deal target of reducing emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and, in more practical terms, to offer cleaner air, safer transport and less congestion and noise to their citizens.

As part of the 112 European cities selected for this EU Mission, the City of Antwerp, the City of La Louvière, the City of Leuven and the Brussels Capital Region are taking bold steps to accelerate their efforts and, as trailblazers, contribute to Belgium's path towards a climate neutral and sustainable future.

The Climate City Contract they deliver within the framework of the EU Mission consists of an Action Plan, Commitments and an Investment Plan. The presented pathways for an accelerated climate transition within each of these cities will, amongst others, address identified barriers and define breakthrough projects to leverage actual and future impact. Policy coherence across different authorities and innovative finance are important levers to facilitate the successful implementation of the action plans that will be shared with the European Commission.

As Belgian Federal ministers in charge of Development Cooperation and of Major Cities, and of Climate, the Environment, Sustainable Development and Green Deal respectively, we recognise that the efforts at city level will contribute to the realisation of the climate ambition at national level. We confirm our intention to contribute to a policy, governance and financial context in which these Belgian EU Mission cities can create maximum impact, including beyond their own territory and communities.

Under the Belgian presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2024, we intend to organise a high level event in the context of the EU Mission on Climate Neutral and Smart Cities. In doing so, we aim to contribute to the exchange of knowledge and expertise between Belgian and European cities, including through the support for innovation and research networks and identifying potential incoherence in policies. With respect, gratitude and pride for the courage of our EU Mission Cities to radically formulate answers to this complex societal challenge called climate transition, and to enhance this challenge as the number one opportunity for a healthy and prosperous future for all.

City of Leuven updates and checks the building catalogue and analyses if its still in line with current regulations and ambitions.
This will provide the city with a general picture of the state of the building stock and of what is needed to accelerate sustainability. It can also be used as a tool to make conscious choices regarding climate ambitions.

City of Leuven sets ambitious goals regarding sustainable choices for its own building stock. It examines which actions, projects and interventions in municipal buildings can support the goal of the mission in order to make well-considered choices. For each project, it will consider which solutions to choose (according to the clusters: new construction, total renovation, sustainable interventions, replacement/merger, disposal/private cooperation) and how to find a good synergy between the various ambitions. The City of Leuven will communicate about this in a clear, visually strong and unambiguous way.

City of Leuven applies innovation to city's building stock. The City of Leuven is committed to raise the level of ambition for certain urban projects and "experiment" with innovative techniques and/or design ideas, thinking beyond the project or the moment. If or where necessary, the city will set up a collaborative network with educational institutions, innovative companies and research/design agencies.

| City of Leuven continues to integrate circular design and construction in city projects. City of Leuven is already strongly committed to circularity and will continue on this path. Circularity will be integrated in the workflow and in all specifications. The city will also expand its knowledge with circular building principles (reuse of materials, change-oriented design, modular construction, sharing spaces, etc.) and make conscious decisions on how to integrate them in the building-stock projects. |

| GENERAL | General | KU Leuven is willing to contribute to city initiatives on supporting other Leuven property owners in the climate transition. This includes sharing knowledge and expertise, but also supporting smaller property owners financially with subsidies, as happened in the past with the ELENA project. |
| GENERAL | General with link to Place-based project Arenberg | KU Leuven fully exploits its educational and research capacity for the energy transition and makes its domain and building stock available for innovative technologies that support climate ambitions. This can include: Model Predictive Control (MPC) in buildings, agrophotovoltaics, hydrogen panels, hubs to support circularity, integrated PV, environmental technologies, etc. The various research groups are encouraged to instigate or scope potential projects. In addition, KU Leuven uses its own research to contribute to development plans in the city. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AREA | Place-based project Arenberg | Existing plans concerning buildings, the green park, mobility, circularity, research projects , etc. will be integrated into a coordinated approach. Synergies between the sub-plans and also beyond the KU Leuven domain, will be indicated to avoid lock-ins, minimize nuisance and accelerate the transition. Cooperation between the Arenberg campus, the Science Park and imec, among others, will be further reinforced. |
| ES | Case: Cold and heat exchange study | Imec and KU Leuven expressed the intention to conduct a feasibility study in the near future. If the result are positive, they commit to finance an in-depth study. The decision to realize a heat network will depend on the results of this study. |
| ES | Large-scale collective green heat | KU Leuven is willing to share and enlighten its usage data and plans regarding its building stock when asked for future feasibility studies on heat networks or other energy studies, if the KU Leuven buildings can contribute. |
| ES | Large-scale collective green heat-with link to Pilot 3: Redingensite | When/if the plan for the development of a heat network is presented, KU Leuven will evaluate case-by-case if a connection between its building stock and this heat network is possible, also taking into consideration that it will have a positive effect on the total business case and therefore a positive social impact. If it is technically and financially feasible, KU Leuven will connect to the heat network. |

| --- | --- | --- |
| BE | Collective renovation program large building owners with link to Place-based project Arenberg | Existing buildings are renovated to reduce energy demand, if the buildings can be heated by maximally using fossil-free sources. Besides this, a programme will be developed to improve the energetic level of buildings every two years. Smart systems are used to further reduce energy demand. |
| BE | General with link to Place-based project Arenberg | Buildings will be designed to be modular, for optimal repurpose or reuse, and to optimize the use of spaces. |
| NBS | General with link to Place-based project Arenberg | Rainwater on the roofs is maximally buffered and infiltrated by using e.g. green roofs and wadis. |
| AREA | Place-based project Arenberg | The management committee for Arenberg Science Park expressed the ambition to have a fossil-free park by 2030. KU Leuven is landowner and partner in management and other developments; while building owners remain responsible for renovation and green-energy investments, KU Leuven commits to convene building owners (including Bio-Incubator Leuven, Kadans, and Interleuven) and support the transition through knowledge sharing. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ES | Pilot 3: Redingensite | For development of a local heat network (KU Leuven - Redingenhof - inhabitants - ...), KU Leuven actively engages with the responsible third party, communicates openly with the city, considers heat-network integration in Redingensite design/development, and includes other sites (Groot Begijnhof, STUK-Holleberg, Amerikaans College) in research for potential users/producers. |
| ES | General with link to Place-based project Arenberg | Roofs of KU Leuven buildings will be maximally used to generate green electricity, and other suitable surfaces will be analyzed for additional generation potential. |
| ES | General with link to Place-based project Arenberg | The most efficient combination of sustainable resources (e.g., riothermia, aquathermia, air, geothermia) will be analyzed for thermal supply of new buildings and conversion of existing buildings to fossil-free supply, considering both CAPEX and OPEX across long-term scenarios. |
| ES | General with link to Place-based project Arenberg | Renewable electricity generation is optimized based on each building and nearby demand profile where it can be developed and operated profitably. |

| ES | Pilot: Sint-Jansbergsesteenweg | If research shows positive results for a technically and financially feasible collective system in the area, ION commits to connect to this system within the planned development, under the conditions that this does not compromise the project schedule and that any higher costs of, for example, an oversized heat system are factored into the contracted sales prices of the buildings in order to remain budget neutral.

If the possibility to connect to a larger collective system is not yet certain in the design phase, the design team will keep this option open by introducing a number of no-regret measures. For example, a suitable location and appropriate dimensions of the technical room will allow ION to connection to a collective system in a later phase. To the extent possible, the heat network (BEO fields, pipe diameters,...) will have oversized dimensions to keep the option open for the distribution of heat in the area.

| ES | Pilot 5:
**Wakkerzeelsebaan Wijgmaal** | To enable the supply of heat and cold to the surrounding area in the future, the design phase will include research about the possibility to develop a larger sized BEO field on the site. This also includes actively searching for this space which creates the possibility, but not the obligation, to construct a larger BEO field in a later phase. This way, there is more time to seek (possibly external) financing for this larger system, including a possible extension of the heat system to the surrounding area. The Leuven energy company could play a role in this process.

Comments/Conditions:
The design team further investigates the feasibility. If funding for a larger BEO field is not available during construction, the possibility of expanding the BEO field in a later phase will be explored. However, any later expansion of the BEO field must minimize disruption to residents as well as the cost of construction. This can be solved, for example, by providing vegetation for this area that can be easily removed and replanted after a few years.

Timing:
(start of design phase) |
| ES | Pilot 5:
**Wakkerzeelsebaan Wijgmaal** | To enable the long term supply of heat and cold to the surrounding area, the design provides space for a substation where the connection to the surrounding area (surrounding residents, possible residual heat Beneo-Remy) can be made. The location is chosen wisely to make sure that the connection to a heat network in the surrounding area or a connection to Beneo-Remy is convenient.

Comments/Conditions:
The design team further investigates the feasibility. For example, the provided space could also be part of the collective technical space integrated into the buildings. |

| ES | Pilot 5: Wakkerzeelsebaan Wijgmaal | In the design phase the possibility to add more capacity for the heat network, than required for the site itself, is considered. This way, it can be connected to a larger collective system in the future.

Comments/Conditions: By the time the permit is submitted, it should be clear whether this larger collective system will be implemented. If the Leuven Energy Company (if then operational) or a private party is not willing to invest, the capacity of the heat network can still be adjusted in the permit application to the exact size needed for the site itself.

Timing: 2024 (start of design phase) |
| ES | Pilot 5: Wakkerzeelsebaan Wijgmaal | If a feasible financial structure and a suitable and interested investor are found, and the expansion is still feasible, the heat and cold supply will be extended to the surrounding area with the site as a central hub. In this step, the necessary substations will be built in the space provided for this purpose, the BEO field can be expanded, and/or residual heat from Beneo-Remy will be connected.

Comments/Conditions: This option is not definitive, until all the above commitments are completed. Furthermore, renovation support from the Climate House will be necessary to make the houses connection proof. Provided the design is well thought out based on the above commitments, these additional interventions can be carried out with minimal disruption to the residents on the site.

| ES | General | After Fluvius has drawn up the first version of its investment map, further optimization will be done after discussions with the city. Fluvius takes a flexible approach in order to optimize its future plans to the needs of the city on energy transition and the objectives of the Climate City Contract. This is done by setting the right priorities and proactively reinforcing the network where necessary, with minimum disruption to the public domain.

Fluvius supports the city in building a green heat policy, including providing accurate and recent energy data, making expertise available, providing concrete input and feedback on policy plans, tenders, feasibility studies,...

Fluvius is available as a heat network operator in Leuven, without claiming exclusivity in terms of investments, heat production, network management or supply activities at project or city level. A balance between the role as a candidate for heat network management and the role as partner of local authorities will be maintained. Should |

| ES | Pilot 5: Wakkerzeelsebaan Wijgmaal | In the design phase the possibility to add more capacity for the heat network, than required for the site itself, is considered. This way, it can be connected to a larger collective system in the future.

**Comments/Conditions:**
By the time the permit is submitted, it should be clear whether this larger collective system will be implemented. If the Leuven Energy Company (if then operational) or a private party is not willing to invest, the capacity of the heat network can still be adjusted in the permit application to the exact size needed for the site itself.

**Timing:**

| MOB | Shared mobility for every Leuven resident | - Cambio commits to increase its fleet of shared cars in Leuven by an average of 25% per year over the next three years.
Cambio aims to provide a shared car within 150m of every home in the inner city and the centre of Kessel-Lo;
The city supports Cambio in the expansion of station-based shared cars by offering reserved spots. This fits in with the city of Leuven's policy on further expanding Hoppin points and its ambition to give every resident easy access to shared mobility.
Cambio and the City of Leuven are joining forces for a gradual increase in the share of electric vehicles in the coming years. The aim is to reach at least 20% by 2025, provided the market develops favourably, both the affordability of small urban cars and the affordability and availability of charging infrastructure. |

| MOB | Shared mobility for every Leuven resident | Blue Bike commits to rolling out a fleet of 140 electric shared bicycles in Leuven within the project Blue-bike Sharing For Life. In 2024, the project will be launched at Leuven Station.

The further rollout of electric share bikes will happen in 10 locations. This is an important scale-up, as it means that from now on, there will be shared bikes not only at stations but also at other important hubs. These locations will be selected together with the city. Preferably, this will be set up in a back-to-many system. The feasibility is being explored.

Circular bicycles will be used for the scale-up project.

Demand-driven supply will be further expanded.

The city commits to a financial intervention. |
| | | Together with the city, Blue-bike will seek additional locations and more involvement of companies in the further roll-out of shared mobility: regional transport nodes and corporate Hoppin points with co-financing from business associations (ShareDiMobi). |

LEAVEN IN THE CLIMATE
OTT CONTRACT

There is no funding from Leuven 2030 or the City of Leuven. The participating companies pay for the services provided by Scone and Mobiel 21.

Scone approaches companies with a proposal, allowing them to use the Leuven 2030 logo. Mobile 21 can also be included.

The pilot project aims to get the breakthrough project ‘Sustainable commuting network’ operational, with Leuven 2030 activating its stakeholder. From its role as a ‘neutral network’, Leuven 2030 wants to help publicise this offer among its members. Leuven 2030 will coordinate in the first phase (apart from providing its network).

Leuven 2030 is willing, under the terms and conditions stipulated in this agreement, to transfer data from members who are interested in using the indicated services to Scone. Scone will follow up these data according to the agreed modalities.

| MOB                                           | Shared mobility for every Leuven resident | On 1 September 2023 Poppy provides 35 free-floating shared cars via pilot projects that form the basis for a permit and quality framework for shared cars. Poppy commits to cooperate and provide necessary data for the evaluation so that the city can adapt a permit and quality framework in 2024. Commitments include: expanding the supply to 60+ shared cars after 6 months; launching 35 Poppy cars in the center share zone (and extending if successful); making user data available to the city in line with GDPR; negotiating with parking operators on affordable off-street parking rates; integrating supply at MaaS providers; city-wide parking permit support during the pilot; and communication support through city channels. City of Leuven also explores reserving 2-3 off-street parking places for Poppy cars. |
