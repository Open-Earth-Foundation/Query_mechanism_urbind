# Summary

## Textual element

Tauragé district municipality has joined the European Union's Cities Mission, an ambitious initiative to achieve climate neutrality in European cities by 2030, with the aim of becoming one of Europe's leaders in reducing climate change. As part of the European Green Deal, the mission focuses on promoting clean energy, sustainable mobility, circular economy and innovation at city and regional level. By participating in this mission, Tauragé district municipality commits itself to actively implementing climate neutrality actions, while promoting sustainable growth of the local economy and improving the quality of life of its citizens.

Tauragé district municipality was established in 1995 and is a medium-sized municipality in Lithuania. It belongs to the Tauragé county. The area of Tauragé district municipality is 1179 km². Agricultural land accounts for 48.92% (crops and grassland), forests for 38.30%, towns and settlements for 7.55%, wetlands for 3.71%, and other areas for other uses for 1.52%. In 2023, the Tauragé district municipality had a total population of about 37.4 thousand inhabitants, of which 60% live in towns, and 40% live in rural areas. The GDP of Tauragé district municipality in 2022 (in prices at that time)¹ was EUR 493.7 million. GDP per capita in Tauragé county was EUR 13.2 thousand.

GHG emissions in 2018 amounted to 102 tcm. t CO2e. The GHG emissions assessed were carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Sectors assessed: energy, transport, waste, industry and product use (IPPU), agriculture, forestry and land use and change (AFOLU). The transport sector accounts for the largest share of GHG emissions - 63%. The energy sector accounts for about a fifth of GHG emissions (21.3%), the waste sector for 12.8%, IPPU for 2% and AFOLU for 0.7%. As a result, the AFOLU sector's balance remains low and represents a very small share of total GHG emissions. A more detailed analysis of GHG emissions by sector is presented below. Tauragé district municipality has not had a climate action plan so far, but climate action is included in various related strategic documents. The Climate Neutrality Strategy for Tauragé district municipality 2030 (hereinafter – Strategy) is the first long-term strategy addressing climate neutrality in the municipality of Tauragé district. The Climate Neutrality Action Plan 2030 (hereinafter – Action Plan) is one of the three documents of the Strategy. The AP is being implemented in parallel with other municipal and national strategic documents of the Tauragé district municipality.

The Action Plan covers the entire administrative area of Tauragé district municipality until 2030. The 2030 climate neutrality target for Tauragé district municipality corresponds to the administrative territory (boundaries) of the municipality, no exclusion zones, sectors, gases, etc. are identified. The base year for GHG accounting for the municipality of Tauragé district is 2018. The actions identified in the Urban Climate Strategy should lead to an 85% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2018, and residual emissions should not account for more than 15% of GHG emissions compared to 2018. The implementation of the other actions and measures in the Action Plan is expected to lead to a reduction of 27% of the GHG emissions.

Achieving climate neutrality can face a number of obstacles: Limited financial capacity, limitations of GHG accounting, limited use of electricity storage, underdeveloped alternative fuel infrastructure, political unpopularity of solutions, dependence of local policy on national level, complex political situation in the agricultural sector, dependence on financial support, lack of knowledge and skills, lack of experience, Lack of climate neutrality specialists and experts, limited GHG impact assessment, lack of organisational/governance structure, higher cost of new technologies, high competition for funding, negative attitudes towards climate neutrality, difficulties in reaching agreement between different groups, lack of NGOs, travel and other daily habits of the population, limited carbon sequestration capacity. Opportunities include the desire to produce energy for own use, use of existing infrastructure, the strategic goal of the municipality to become the greenest municipality in Lithuania, the development of cooperation, the incorporation of climate neutrality in different documents, the high level of interest and activity in obtaining funding for climate neutrality, the inclusion of socially excluded people, the reuse of objects, and the interest of the population in the topic of climate neutrality. The Action Plan was designed

to structure the actions in a way that would help overcome the obstacles identified while maximising the opportunities.

The goal of climate neutrality is relevant to a wide range of stakeholders, without whom its achievement would not be possible. The most important stakeholders include citizens and businesses, but national institutions also play a significant role through the impact of their decisions, such as ministries. A strong emphasis has been placed on stakeholder involvement in the preparation of the Action Plan. 12 sectoral discussions involving representatives of different sectors, workshops involving various educational and cultural institutions, NGOs, representatives of various social groups, etc., as well as picnics for meetings with different stakeholders, joint meetings, meetings with municipal representatives, including councillors, were organised. The meetings focused on the current situation, including obstacles and opportunities, and on concrete actions that could be taken by stakeholders. In the future, it is planned to involve stakeholders in monitoring the implementation of the Action Plan through annual conferences, data collection on the implementation of actions, etc.

After analysing the current situation and involving stakeholders in the search for solutions, four impact pathways were developed:

|  Impact pathways | Measure portfolios  |
| --- | --- |
|  Climate neutral households | Clean heat  |
|   |  Self-generated green electricity  |
|   |  Reduced number of car journeys  |
|   |  Electromobility  |
|   |  Responsible consumption  |
|   |  More energy-efficient housing  |
|  Climate neutral public sector | Green electricity  |
|   |  Decarbonised vehicle fleet  |
|   |  Green environment  |
|   |  Energy efficient buildings  |
|   |  Effective management of climate neutrality  |
|   |  Improved capacity and capability  |
|  Climate-neutral production and consumption | Decarbonised heat production  |
|   |  Green electricity generated  |
|   |  The business of decarbonising the transport fleet  |
|   |  Decarbonised waste management  |
|   |  Climate-smart agriculture and other land uses  |
|   |  Responsible and engaged business  |
|  A climate-neutral community | Young people with awareness and knowledge  |
|   |  Aware and knowledgeable citizens  |

For each of the impact pathways, a portfolio of instruments is provided. These action portfolios can be expanded through iterations of the Action Plan, and new action portfolios can be developed as future needs arise.

The impact pathways and their portfolios of actions aim to reduce the use of fossil fuels, increase the use of renewable energy sources, develop a circular economy, promote climate-friendly land use, and foster engagement and awareness-raising on climate neutrality. Long-term and sustainable actions are foreseen to offset residual GHG emissions, focusing on the development and improvement of forests.

Indicators for each sector are included to monitor the implementation of the Action Plan. The energy sector (excluding grid-supplied electricity) aims to reduce GHG emissions by 77% compared to 2018. GHG emissions from grid-supplied electricity are targeted to be reduced by 41% compared to 2018, and from transport by 55%, emissions from the waste sector by 76% and from the AFOLU sector (excluding carbon sequestration) by 15% (carbon sequestration in this sector is very similar to GHG emissions, so reducing GHG emissions allows the sector to contribute to the overall GHG emissions reduction). The objective is to achieve a downward trend in GHG emissions from the IPPU sector compared to 2018.

To date, the municipality has not had a coordinated climate neutrality governance structure directly responsible for implementing and coordinating climate neutrality actions. The Action Plan foresees a participatory governance model for climate neutrality. The newly developed governance model (see

figure below) is based on stakeholder cooperation and a transparent decision-making process. It provides for a clear division of responsibilities and cooperation mechanisms between different institutions and professionals, as well as regular consultations, discussions and reporting. The model has a two-tier governance model: the first tier consists of the Decarbonisation Coordination Group and the second tier consists of working groups. The working groups will be responsible for specific areas such as the development of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, urban green infrastructure, etc.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

The implementation of the envisaged participatory climate neutrality governance model and other actions requires the implementation of governance innovations. The Action Plan foresees 15 governance innovations. These innovations are being implemented through the establishment of the Tauragé district municipality Decarbonisation Coordination Group and working groups to coordinate the lists of specific actions developed under the Action Plan. In addition, an EU Cities Mission Coordinator is being created in the municipality to coordinate climate strategies and projects, fostering better cooperation between sectors. The development of a GHG accounting system will ensure more accurate data collection and analysis, while the standardisation of sustainability reporting for municipally owned companies will improve transparency and social responsibility. Finally, investments are being made in staff development and innovation, which will allow the municipality to adopt the latest technologies and methodologies, increasing the efficiency of strategy implementation and the integration of innovative solutions.

Social innovation is also needed to deliver the actions set out in the Action Plan and to achieve climate neutrality. They aim to address the systemic barriers identified and to exploit opportunities for achieving climate neutrality. These initiatives also promote community and business engagement to create new opportunities and raise public awareness of climate change challenges and solutions. Increasing awareness and changing habits contribute to more sustainable consumption and environmental conservation. Social innovation is essential to engage more stakeholders and citizens in climate neutrality initiatives. These innovations help to reduce social and economic barriers, promote participation and build community links. Social innovation focuses on measures for educational institutions to educate young people from an early age, measures for business to encourage business to engage in the green transformation, measures for the population (including different age groups, including seniors, vulnerable groups), and other measures.

In the future, a strong focus on vulnerable or under-represented groups is planned, and more attention will be paid to these groups in the context of the measures envisaged for them. The needs of vulnerable people should also be considered when planning the implementation of the actions foreseen, for example in the design of pedestrian/cycling infrastructure, planning public transport services, adapting information tools, etc. In the formation of working groups, it is planned to include municipal representatives responsible for the interests of vulnerable groups, who could represent these interests at public sector level, and to continue to work with relevant organisations representing the interests of vulnerable groups, by organising individual meetings, inviting them to joint activities and events, and by inviting them to act as experts if necessary.

# 1 Introduction

The Climate Neutrality Action Plan until 2030 covers the entire administrative area of Tauragé district Municipality (1179 km²). Agricultural land accounts for 48.92% (crops and grassland), forests for 38.30%, urban and settlements for 7.55%, wetlands for 3.71%, and other land for 1.52%.

Tauragé district municipality was established in 1995 and is the average size municipality in Lithuania. It belongs to Tauragé county. There are two towns - Tauragé and Skaudvilė, 4 villages - Batakiai, Gaurė, Pagramantis and Žygaičiai, and 320 hamlets. The territory of the district is divided into 8 sub-districts: Tauragé town, Batakiai, Gaurė, Lauksargiai, Mažoni, Skaudvilė, Tauragé, Žygaičiai.²

In 2023, the Tauragé district municipality will have a population of about 37.4 thousand inhabitants, 60% of whom live in urban areas and 40% in rural areas. The employment rate in 2022 was 67.3% (73.8% in Lithuania) and did not differ between women and men.³

The GDP of Tauragé Municipality in 2022 (at current prices) is €493.7 million⁴. GDP per capita in Tauragé District was EUR 13.2 thousand, or 55.4% of the national average (Lithuanian average - EUR 23.8 thousand).⁵

At the beginning of 2023, the largest share of active economic operators was accounted for by those engaged in wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, accounting for 30% (of which 46.8% were engaged in wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; these operators accounted for 14% of the total number of active operators), 11% by those engaged in transport and storage, and 10% each by those engaged in manufacturing and other service activities.⁶ Tauragé district municipality stands out from other Lithuanian municipalities due to its developed vehicle trade and related services. Tauragé district municipality covers not only urbanised areas but also rural areas, and agriculture plays an important role in the context of climate change in this municipality. In 2020, Tauragé District Municipality had about 13 000 farms⁷ (132 000 in Lithuania), of which only 900 or 6.7% had more than 50 ha of agricultural land (8.5% in Lithuania).⁸ This means that there are many small farms operating in the territory of Tauragé municipality.

According to the Cities Mission Expression of Interest, Tauragé district municipality is aiming for net-zero GHG emissions and the expected residual emissions up to 2030 are not specified (to be specified in the next phase of the EU Cities Mission). In this document, the residual emissions by 2030 are detailed in Module A-2. The 2030 climate neutrality target for the municipality of Tauragé district is consistent with the administrative territory (boundaries) of the municipality, no exclusion zones, sectors, gases, etc. are identified. The actions identified in the Climate Neutrality Strategy should lead to an 85% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2018, and residual emissions should not represent more than 15% of GHG emissions compared to 2018.

The transport sector accounts for the largest share of GHG emissions – 63%. The energy sector accounts for about a fifth of GHG emissions (21.3%), while the waste sector accounts for 12.8% of GHG emissions, IPPU for 2% and AFOLU for 0.7%. Considering the main sources of emissions listed above, it is appropriate to involve stakeholders from these sectors in the achievement of the 2030 climate neutrality target: citizens, district heating companies, electricity producers, transport companies, etc. However, the aim is to go beyond these stakeholders. According to the 2023 study on the attitudes, behaviour and attitudes towards climate change and the Tauragé Green Policy, 74.3% of the Tauragé

district municipality residents are concerned or very concerned about climate change, 75.3% believe that they can make a significant or some contribution to climate change mitigation, and the majority of the residents are already changing or are willing to change their habits in order to contribute to reducing climate change. Therefore, in order to achieve climate neutrality, it makes sense to involve the population in this process.

The strategic management system of Tauragé district municipality consists of planning documents, strategic planning system actors responsible for the preparation, approval, implementation, evaluation and reporting on the results of the planning documents. The municipality's planning document system comprises: Strategic Development Plan of Tauragé District (approved by the Municipal Council), Priorities of Tauragé District Municipality (approved by the Municipal Council), Strategic Action Plan of Tauragé District Municipality (approved by the Municipal Council), financial planning documents - the municipality's budget and other documents (approved by the Municipal Council), annual activity plans of the Tauragé District Municipality administration, annual activity plans of the elders' districts (approved by the Director of the administration), annual activity plans of the municipal budget institutions (prepared, coordinated and approved by the heads of the budget institutions), other documents detailing the implementation of strategic planning documents (action and measure plans, etc.) (approved by the Director of Tauragé District Municipality Administration). Thus, there is no formal procedure or planning scheme to which the Action Plan should be aligned. However, given that the Action Plan is being prepared for the long term and covers the long-term vision of the municipality in the context of climate neutrality, it is appropriate to use the procedures for the preparation of a long-term plan in the preparation of this plan. The Action Plan and the interventions it proposes and the necessary investments to implement the interventions and other actions must be prepared by the municipal administration and approved by the Municipal Council. Based on the requirements of the Action Plan, the Mayor of the municipality must organise monitoring, evaluation and learning.⁹

Tauragé District Municipality does not have a Climate Action Plan, but climate action is included in various related strategic documents: the Tauragé District Municipality Strategic Development Plan 2021-2030, the Tauragé District Municipality Renewable Energy Action Plan 2030, the Sustainable Mobility Plan for the City of Tauragé, and the Sustainable Mobility Action Plan for the City of Tauragé 2030, Sustainable Development Strategy for the City of Tauragé 2023-2029, Action Plan for the Implementation of the Sustainable Development Strategy for the City of Tauragé 2023-2029, Strategy for the Tauragé+ Functional Zone 2023-2029, Waste Prevention and Management Plan 2021-2027 for the Municipality of the Tauragé District, Programme for the Environmental Monitoring of the Municipality of the Tauragé District for the period 2022-2027. Most of these documents are sectoral and focused on specific solutions in specific sectors, with a primary objective other than climate neutrality (although climate neutrality is often one of the very important outcomes of the actions envisaged). The Action Plan allows for an analysis of the totality of GHG emissions and identifies the key areas for achieving climate neutrality. In addition, the Action Plan incorporates measures already included in other documents that contribute to climate neutrality. It also includes measures to reduce residual GHG emissions that have not been addressed by existing measures. These additional measures may be included in other instruments if they are relevant to the areas covered by those instruments.

The Action Plan is implemented in parallel with other Tauragé District Municipality and national strategic documents, including the National Energy and Climate Action Plan 2021-2030 (hereinafter – NECAP). This Plan, which was updated in 2024, emphasises the role of municipalities in reducing GHG emissions. The NECAP includes measures in various sectors, either targeted at municipalities (with funding) or for which municipalities are responsible for implementation. For example, financial incentives for municipalities to replace polluting buses in their municipalities and to create the necessary

⁹ The procedures are described in accordance with the procedure for the preparation, approval, implementation, monitoring and reporting of the Strategic Development Plan of the Tauragé District Municipality, as set out in the Description of the Procedures for the Organisation of the Strategic Planning of the Municipality of the Tauragé District Municipality, approved by the Decision of the Municipal Council of the Tauragé District Municipality of 22 September 2021, Decision No 1-268 (wording of the Decision of the Municipal Council of the Tauragé District Municipality of 19 April 2023 No 1-81)

charging/refuelling infrastructure, as well as measures to introduce traffic regulation solutions, to identify low emission zones, to finance measures in sustainable mobility plans, etc. Thus, the NECAP does not only contain obligations for municipalities, but the measures set out in the NECAP also provide a source of funding for the measures to be implemented by municipalities. Thus, the Action Plan for Tauragé district municipality brings together all existing and future efforts towards climate neutrality, as it incorporates actions foreseen in other strategic documents (for more details see Module B-2). In addition, we consider the scope, timeframe, amount and sources of funding and other elements of the measures/actions foreseen in those documents.

The existing plans and documents of the Tauragé District Municipality do not cover agriculture, forestry and other land-use sector (only a few related measures are foreseen), but this sector is very important in the context of climate neutrality of Tauragé District Municipality. Therefore, data and information related to this sector should be collected and analysed in the preparation of the Action Plan. To this end, GHG accounting data, national GHG accounting and national documents related to this sector will be analysed.

The first version of the Action Plan includes all the mandatory parts, based on the methodologies and templates developed. In the future, a participatory climate neutrality governance model is planned. The implementation of the governance model will be ensured through the implementation of the envisaged governance innovations, including the establishment of a coordination group, working groups, the creation of the necessary posts, etc. It will also seek to prioritise the actions envisaged in order to ensure timely and appropriate implementation. Regular monitoring of the implementation of the Action Plan is planned and iterations of the Action Plan will be made in the light of its results. A strong emphasis will be placed on communication activities, which must enable the success of the other actions.

# 2 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

Part A “Current State of Climate Action” describes the point of departure of the city towards climate neutrality, including commitments and strategies of key local businesses, and informs the subsequent modules and the outlined pathways to accelerated climate action.

# 2.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

Module A-1 “Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory” details and describes the latest GHG inventory, where available from 2018 or more recent, referring to a clearly stated geographic boundary. The aim of this section is to establish the emission baseline and to establish the emissions gap to 2030 climate neutrality.

# GHG Emissions Baseline inventory

The base year for GHG accounting for Tauragé district municipality is 2018. GHG emissions were not accounted for in My Covenant or CDO/ICLEI Tracker. The geographical boundaries of the GHG accounting cover the geographical area of the Tauragé district municipality (no exceptions) and coincide with the geographical area of the Climate Neutrality Target. There are no inconsistencies between the GHG accounting and the climate neutrality target. The GHG emissions assessed were carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF₆), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Sectors assessed: energy, transport, waste, industry and product use (IPPU), agriculture, forestry and land use and change (AFOLU). Sectors and categories included in the GHG inventory:

The GHG emissions inventory of Tauragė district municipality was carried out based on the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (hereinafter – GPC), developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) in cooperation with local authorities. The GPC is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol), which provides standards and guidelines for companies and other types of organisations to prepare greenhouse gas inventories. The purpose of the GPC is to provide cities or communities with additional guidance on the application of the GHG Protocol in the local community context. The GPC provides standardised methodologies and procedures to help local authorities quantify the GHG emissions associated with the activities of the community they govern.

The following documents and methodologies were also used to assess GHG emissions:
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Reports and Recommendations;
The European Union's Mission 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities 2030 GHG Inventory Requirements (Info Kit For Cities Interested In Participating In The Call For Expression Of Interest (EOI)).

According to the GPC, GHG emissions at municipal level are assessed using two different but complementary approaches:
Scopes Framework: GHG emissions related to activities within the geographical boundaries of the municipality, broken down into Scopes 1, 2 and 3.
City-Induced Framework: Similar to the Scoping Framework, GHG emissions are broken down by Scopes 1, 2 and 3, but the results of the calculations are presented at two different levels:
BASIC level: covers GHG emissions related to energy, transport, and waste/wastewater;
BASIC+ level: the expanded level covers all GHG emissions at the baseline level, plus additional estimates of GHG emissions from IPPU, AFOLU and other sources.

A variety of data sources were used to calculate GHG emissions, with a preference for direct data providers. Data that could not be obtained from direct data providers were collected from various databases and other sources. A summary of the data sources is given below:

|  Average heat consumption; annual energy demand for hot water, heated area as a percentage of total area | Tauragé District Municipality Renewable Energy Action Plan 2030  |
|  Electricity consumption; electricity consumption losses; natural gas consumption | Data for Energy Distribution Operator (hereinafter referred to as ESO), budget institutions and enterprises managed by the municipality  |
|  Number of buildings connected to central heating; fuel used for heat production by fuel type | UAB “Tauragés šilumos tinklai”  |
|  Railway length; rail freight turnover; rail freight transport; rail passenger turnover; rail passenger transport | Official statistics portal of the State Data Agency, LTG Infra  |
|  Areas of fire stations | State Forest Service  |
|  Area of peatland under exploitation | UAB “Klassmann-Deilmann Laukésa”  |
|  Electricity emission factor | Calculated on the basis of electricity production and consumption balance data provided by AB LITGRID  |

The calculations were primarily based on Tauragé district municipality level performance data. Where these data are not available, the state-level data were recalculated in proportion to the activities taking place in the territory of the municipality in terms of area, population, GDP or another indicator.

The main source of emission factor data is the LT-NIR-2023, which provides estimated national emission factors for different GHG emissions. The global warming potential from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report: Climate change 2014 (hereafter – IPCC 5AR) has been used to convert GHG emissions to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalent.

Base year GHG accounting data provide the basis for developing impact pathways and climate action. That is, the analysis of the GHG structure by sector and category has identified key impact areas for achieving climate neutrality. A more detailed analysis of the categories allows for the identification of the most important/significant impact locations, but also for the identification of the challenges that may be encountered in achieving climate neutrality. This in turn allows for the development of realistic impact pathways and actions.

The strategic priorities of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments document cover key areas for base year GHG accounting. The inventory shows that the focal areas are considered to be livestock

The transport sector accounted for the largest share of GHG emissions in the base year - 63.1%. The energy sector accounted for around one fifth of GHG emissions. The waste sector accounted for about 12.8% of GHG emissions, while IPPU accounted for 2%. The AFOLU sector accounted for the smallest share of GHG emissions, with only 0.7%. This sector has significant GHG emissions compared to other sectors, but due to its large forest area, a large part of the carbon is sequestered. As a result, the AFOLU sector's balance remains low and represents a very small share of total GHG emissions. A more detailed analysis of GHG emissions by sector is presented below.

Energy. Buildings accounted for the largest share of emissions from the energy sector (67.8%), followed by manufacturing and construction (25.4%) and the energy industry, i.e. the production of heat and electricity (6.8%). Among buildings, residential buildings stand out with 90.8% of GHG emissions, while other commercial and public buildings accounted for 6.8%, while municipal

buildings/enterprises accounted for  $2.4\%$ . Among residential buildings, as much as  $93.9\%$  of residential buildings in 2018 were 1-2 apartment residential buildings, with a floor area of  $69.2\%$  of the floor area of residential buildings. The average floor area of a 1-2 dwelling house in 2018 was 138 sqm. Apartment residential buildings accounted for  $5.7\%$  of residential buildings in 2018, with a floor area of  $40.6\%$  of the total floor area of residential buildings. The average floor area per multi-apartment building was 922 square metres.

In terms of fuels used in the energy sector, peat (25.1%) and coal (24.5%) accounted for the largest share of GHG emissions, with natural gas accounting for a significant share (20.6%). Fossil fuels accounted for around 88.8% of GHG emissions in the energy sector, while electricity accounted for around 2.7% and biofuels for 9.3%.

According to the evidence, a strong focus on reducing the use of fossil fuels and generating clean electricity is needed to achieve climate neutrality, as well as clean electricity generation, which can contribute to the phase-out of fossil fuels used for heat generation. A strong focus on energy efficiency, particularly in residential buildings, but also in other buildings and energy efficiency improvements in manufacturing and construction. Particular attention should be paid to individual houses as they make up the majority of the municipality's residential area.

Transport. The largest share of GHG emissions from the transport sector came from passenger cars, accounting for  $58.4\%$ , while trucks and buses accounted for  $36.7\%$ . Other modes of transport accounted for  $5.1\%$  of transport sector GHG emissions. In Tauragé municipality, as in the national level, the transport sector is dominated using diesel fuel, which results in the highest GHG emissions in the passenger car, truck and bus subsectors respectively. To reduce GHG emissions in the transport sector, the focus must be on increasing the use of alternative fuels. In the passenger car sub-sector, the focus should be on the development of electric vehicles and the shift away from cars towards other, less polluting mobility alternatives. The passenger car sub-sector is dominated by diesel vehicles (in 2018, diesel cars accounted for  $77\%$  of all passenger cars and electric cars for  $0.04\%^{12}$ ), which are purchased by the population because of their habits, their easy and affordable servicing, and their clear operating characteristics (in the case of electric cars, there are many doubts about the lack of repairs and technicians, the charging infrastructure, the range, etc). In public transport, the focus should be on the development of electric vehicles, and where there is no possibility of such development, on other alternative fuels. The public transport system is being actively developed not only in the territory of Tauragé District Municipality, but also in the region. As the number of routes increases, it is important to ensure that new travel demand is met by buses running on cleaner fuels. In the heavy transport sub-sector, the focus should be on supporting the currently optimal technology from an economic and business development point of view, to reconcile economic feasibility (cleaner technologies can be several times more expensive than fossil fuel technologies) and GHG reduction targets.

A significant share of the economy of Tauragé District Municipality in 2023 will be accounted for by wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles (14%) and transport and storage (11.3%). Therefore, in Tauragé District Municipality, it is not only the habits of the population in terms of their choice of vehicles that are important, but also the perception of sustainability issues among businesses and their involvement in addressing these issues and implementing actions.

Among the businesses involved in the wholesale, retail and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, those involved in the sale of cars and light motor vehicles accounted for the largest share, while businesses involved in the sale of other motor vehicles accounted for around one fifth. The main second-hand vehicles sold in Tauragé district municipality are imported from other EU countries, such as France, the Netherlands, etc. There is also trade in second-hand cars from Lithuania. The trade is carried out on a national scale and is not limited to the territory of Tauragé district municipality. Repair services are also provided not only in the municipality of Tauragé, but also nationally, part of the repair services being carried out in preparation of imported vehicles for resale. There are also emerging entities in the Tauragé district municipality providing repair services for electric vehicles, but this activity is not yet well developed and future focus should be on developing this activity in order to take advantage of the existing advantages. There is no national or regional policy on this issue, so it is important for the municipality to develop it primarily at the local level.

Among the operators active in transport and storage, road freight transport accounted for the largest share, directly contributing to GHG emissions in the heavy transport and bus sub-sector. At the same time, passenger transport by urban or suburban land transport, which is linked to GHG emissions from buses, accounted for around  $2\%$  of transport and storage operators.

Waste. The largest share of GHG emissions from waste and wastewater was due to landfilling at  $61.8\%$ , followed by wastewater treatment at  $29.1\%$  and waste biological treatment at  $9.1\%$ . Waste incineration accounted for less than  $1\%$  of GHG emissions, as only a small part of the waste sorted in MA is sent for incineration. In Lithuania, waste incineration is carried out in the territories of other municipalities. To reduce GHG emissions from the waste sector, the focus should be on reducing waste to landfill, which is linked to better waste sorting (including green waste). In addition, the municipal waste management centre has so far not had a biological treatment plant to ensure proper treatment of biodegradable waste.

![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)
Figure 2-7. Waste sector GHG emissions by emission source and sub-sector

Industry and product use (IPPU).  $75\%$  of GHG emissions in this sector are emissions of ozone-depleting fluorinated substitutes, mainly from mobile air conditioning systems in vehicles. Tauragé District Municipality is characterised by a high level of services in the transport sector, including vehicle sales, repairs etc. Given the importance of these activities for the economy of the Tauragé Municipality, a reduction in their scale poses a risk. Other significant sources of GHG emissions are

household solvents, dry cleaning, degreasing and chemical products. These are linked to the consumption habits of the population.

![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)
Figure 2-8. GHG emissions from the IPPU sector by emission source and sub-sector

Agriculture, forestry and land use (AFOLU) - Carbon emissions. The AFOLU sector is very important for the Tauragé district municipality, as on the one hand it provides employment for a large part of the population (the number of farms in 2020 amounted to 4,900), but it also provides the potential to absorb carbon. Agricultural land accounted for about  $49\%$  of the territory of Tauragé district municipality, while forests accounted for about  $38\%$ . Tauragé district municipality has many wetlands, some of which are located in protected areas, but some peatlands are also in operation. The AFOLU sector is very important for the municipality to reduce GHG emissions, with emissions in this sector amounting to 167,500 tonnes CO2e. On the other hand, the carbon sequestration potential is also very high and sustainable by nature, as the forest area has remained almost unchanged over the last few years. Moreover, there is potential for forest expansion.

Given the large area of agricultural land, it is also possible to develop renewable energy facilities in this area. Wind power plants can be developed in the northern part of the municipality, as the southern part is restricted by the military due to national security. Solar power plants and parks can be developed throughout the municipality, but farmers are more interested in the production of energy from livestock gases. There is no opposition from the population in the municipality, as the population is largely in favour of renewable energy development in the context of energy security, climate neutrality and energy cost reduction.

Figure 2-9. Important areas of the AFOLU sector: crops, forests, protected areas, wetlands

The most important contributors to the GHG emissions from this sector were fermentation caused by cattle (34.8% of GHG emissions), wetland land due to peat extraction in the territory of the Tauragé District Municipality (25.9% of GHG emissions) and fertiliser use (20.3% of GHG emissions). In this context, the focus should be on animal feeding technologies, peat extraction activities and reducing fertiliser use. In this sector, the number of livestock, i.e. the scale of the activity, has a significant impact on GHG emissions. However, to maintain an important economic sector for the Tauragé municipality, reducing livestock numbers cannot be considered as a GHG reduction option. On the other hand, there are good examples of organic farming in the Tauragé municipality which can inspire other farmers to act in an environmentally and human health friendly way.

been established in the territory of the municipality: the Pagramančius Regional Park, the Visbari Biosphere Polygon, the Viešvilé State Nature Reserve, the Ancija Landscape Reserve, and the Meška Botanical-Zoological Reserve. Carbon sequestration potential can be increased by expanding forests and increasing sequestration on cropland (using sustainable farming techniques). Given that the forest area has remained virtually unchanged over the last few years, these removals can be considered sustainable and long term. In addition, there are various measures at national level to promote climate-smart agriculture on forest land with the aim of increasing forest absorption. These measures can be implemented by entities throughout the territory of Lithuania, including the Tauragė district municipality. In addition, these measures are aimed at both private entities and entities managing public forests.

# A-2.2: Description and evaluation of policies

The vision of Tauragė District is to become a green, vibrant and open district, a municipality worth watching. The municipality's Strategic Development Plan (a long-term strategic planning document based on the State's long-term planning documents and the findings of the environmental analysis), which forms the long-term basis for strategic decisions and the actions needed to implement them, envisages the municipality's ambition to become the greenest municipality in the country by 2030. The municipality sees this ambition as a reduction of its GHG mission through a multi-pronged approach - energy production from RES, building modernisation, CHP development, sustainable mobility solutions. These axes are in line with the climate change management axes identified in the national documents. It therefore envisages the direction not only at the municipal level, but also as a contribution to the national objectives, i.e. there is synergy between national and local documents. In addition, the priorities of the Tauragė District Municipality for the period 2023-2027 include an action line aimed at ensuring sustainable use of natural resources, actively participating in the mission to become a climate-neutral municipality. This is to be implemented by increasing the number of buildings equipped with upgraded renewable energy generation facilities, energy saving projects installed, charging stations for electric vehicles, bicycle paths and sidewalks installed and upgraded, clean buses purchased, and projects to promote the recycling of green, agricultural and other biodegradable wastes into green energy. In addition, the implementation of the other actions foreseen should focus on activities relevant to climate change mitigation, prioritising green business projects and promoting the afforestation of wasteland.

In line with the strategic GHG reduction pathways outlined above, the municipality has developed and implemented related documents:

in the buildings and energy sector: the Action Plan for the Development of the Use of Renewable Energy Sources in the Tauragė District Municipality until 2030, the Tauragė District Heat Management Special Plan 2014-2015. The former focuses on modernisation of multi-apartment buildings and public buildings, energy efficiency measures, reduction of fossil fuel use, and the introduction of renewable energy technologies in the private and public sector. The second document follows the principle of maintaining and developing district heating in Tauragė district, and the environmental impact assessment of the solutions proposed in the document shows that they will help to ensure a reliable, safe and low-cost heat supply, contribute to the reduction of environmental pollution, and create a high-quality living and working environment.

in the transport sector: the Tauragė District Municipality Renewable Energy Development Action Plan 2030, the Tauragė City Sustainable Mobility Plan and the Tauragė City Sustainable Mobility Action Plan 2030, and the Tauragė City Sustainable Development Strategy Action Plan 2023-209. The former focuses on promoting the use of public transport, expanding the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, the replacement of polluting vehicles, and the use of renewable energy to provide transport-related services. The second document aims at renewing the vehicle fleet, improving infrastructure, promoting the use of non-motorised transport, and creating a low emission zone. The actions set out in the third document overlap with the measures and actions set out in the above two documents.

in the waste sector: the Tauragė District Municipality Waste Prevention and Management Plan 2021-2027. This plan focuses on waste prevention and sorting, measures to promote waste sorting, improvement of the waste collection system, including infrastructure, and development of waste monitoring.

# A-2.2: Description and evaluation of policies

There is no separate document for the agriculture, forestry and land use sector, nor is there much attention paid to it in the Tauragė District Municipality Strategic Development Plan 2021-2030. This sector is also given a lot of attention in the nationally implemented National Energy and Climate Action Plan 2021-2030 of the Republic of Lithuania. Support is also provided nationally to farmers for the implementation of eco-solutions in the framework of the Climate Change and Environment schemes in the Lithuanian Strategic Plan for Agriculture and Rural Development 2023-2027 (29% of the funding is allocated to climate change and the environment). Arable land activities such as crop rotation, intercropping, non-farm conservation agriculture techniques, etc., as well as the maintenance of landscape features, perennial grass strips, organic farming, conversion of arable peatland to grassland, extensive wetland management and other measures that benefit the climate, the environment and the well-being of animals, are supported.

In addition, a Sustainable Development Strategy for the City of Tauragė 2023-2029 and a Planned Action Plan for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Strategy for the City of Tauragė 2023-2029 have been prepared separately for Tauragė, which is the centre of the municipality of Tauragė, focusing on measures such as the acquisition of environmentally friendly means of transport, the development of the non-motorised transport system, the promotion of infrastructure for electric buses, and the greening of urban areas.

The Tauragė+ Functional Area Strategy 2023-2029 includes measures for sustainable mobility and wastewater management.

The measures referred to in the different documents are in some cases duplicative or complementary. They cover the following main groups of mitigation measures:

building renovation;
energy efficiency improvement;
reduction of the use of fossil fuels (in the energy and transport sectors);
promoting the production and use of RES;
increasing the use of public transport;
promoting the use of non-motorised transport;
promoting the use of cleaner fuels, including the establishment of urban no-polluting zones;
developing the circular economy (including waste re-use, life-cycle extension, wastewater management, etc.);
greening of Tauragė district areas (urban and rural);
information and education measures in various sectors.

Measures included in different documents are in many cases not assessed in the context of GHG reductions. In the preparation of the Action Plan, all the measures included in other strategic documents were analysed and selected to form a list of existing measures (some measures are repeated in several documents). The selected measures were analysed in terms of whether they were funded, had a clear scope for implementation or had already started to be implemented. The impact of the measures on GHG emissions was assessed. Those measures for which funding is already planned, implementation has already started, and investment plans have already been prepared are treated as existing measures in this plan and are not included in Module B-2. Their GHG emission reductions shall be included in the emission reductions foreseen in other action plans. These measures include actions such as replacement of heating installations, renovation, installation of cycle paths, improvement of waste management infrastructure, etc. In the event that the need to increase the scope of implementation of a measure is identified, the measure with the additional scope of implementation is included in Module B-2. The remaining measures for which the scope of implementation is not clear and the need for funding is not foreseen are included in Module B-2. This approach has allowed to identify and fill planning gaps, considering the need for GHG reductions.

Thus, the existing measures lead to a reduction in GHG emissions of 27,200 tCO2e or 27%. The largest reductions are achieved in the transport sector, which is assumed to reduce the number of journeys through a number of sustainable mobility initiatives. As the reductions achieved are insufficient to meet the target, additional measures need to be planned and implemented. This is particularly relevant in the AFOLU sector, where there is currently a lack of planning at municipal level (only a few measures are being implemented, and there is no strategic direction or document at municipal level for the development of this sector).

Residual GHG emissions cover all sectors and account for 15% of total emissions. Residual emissions are highest in the transport sector, which correlates with the structure of GHG emissions. These

emissions cannot be avoided as the transport sector has a large number of decision makers and the impact on these decision makers is therefore complex. Another important aspect in this area is the geographical area of the municipality, which comprises one city, several smaller settlements and rural areas. People living in more remote areas travel longer distances and have less access to EV charging. There are also constraints on the expansion of charging capacity due to a lack of available capacity on the grid. Another important factor is the limited financial capacity of people to renew their vehicle fleet in order to switch to new clean vehicles and the limited supply on the secondary market for clean vehicles.

It should be noted that no GHG emission reductions are foreseen in the IPPU sector. In this sector, emissions are mainly due to mobile air-conditioning systems (in vehicles). There are alternatives to the gases used in these systems and these will gradually change, but these changes must also be included in the GHG assessment methodology. Currently, a national methodology is used at municipal level, which covers only certain gases used in air conditioning systems. Updating this methodology can track changes in GHG accounting in the IPPU sector, but the assessment is currently limited.

In the buildings sector, residual emissions are mainly driven by fuels used to heat individual houses and apartment buildings not connected to district heating. Among the existing measures and in Module B-2, there are also measures to promote changes in heating patterns and energy efficiency. However, given that the building sector is dominated by individual houses of 1-2 flats, decisions have to be taken by a large number of owners with very different financial situations, habits and beliefs. Influencing this area is complex and requires an integrated approach combining financial incentives with information and education activities and demonstrating the benefits of the necessary actions not only in terms of climate neutrality, but also for the individual homeowner. In the area of multi-apartment buildings, actions are complicated by the need for consensus and decision making - the owners of the apartments in a multi-apartment building have to take a joint decision on the retrofitting of their building, which is difficult due to the lack of community spirit, the different financial situation, the different perception of the benefits etc.

Residual emissions from the waste sector are difficult to avoid for the time being as projects to improve waste management infrastructure are planned and implemented, but the benefits are likely to be realised towards the end of the period or after 2030. Another important aspect is that the (incomplete) gas collected at the landfill site is not yet used for energy production. Such options are being considered and analysed (such an action is included in Module B-2), but it is not yet possible to say how much of the gas could be recovered and whether this would be cost-effective.

# 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

This module identifies key systems and stakeholders in order to identify systemic barriers and opportunities. The analysis carried out in this module forms the basis for action planning to address the identified barriers and exploit opportunities. In addition, a participatory model for climate neutrality in the municipality of Tauragé is described.

* "Influence" describes the degree of formal or informal power to affect the transition positively or negatively to climate neutrality (high, medium, low).
** "Interest" describes the level of positive or negative concern about moving towards climate neutrality (high, medium, low).
*** National scale means that the authority takes decisions at national level that are implemented locally and can have a significant impact on the achievement of climate neutrality, e.g. on support measures that are available to the entire population, or to eligible farmers operating in the municipality under analysis.

# A-3.3: Description of systemic bottlenecks and opportunities – textual elements

Systemic barriers are outlined below, considering the key systems identified and the influence and interest of stakeholders specific to those systems:

## Technologies

Limited financial capacity to deploy technologies that reduce climate impacts (e.g. electric cars, energy generation equipment, etc.). This barrier affects all stakeholders – the population as well as the private and public sectors. The municipality is subject to a borrowing limit and is therefore limited in its ability to implement the measures through debt financing. Long payback periods for different projects, resulting in less motivation to implement them or less ability to realise their financial benefits.
Not all technologies that attract interest contribute to real GHG emission reductions, even though they are environmentally friendly, i.e. not all deployments of technologies (e.g. renewable electricity generation) reduce GHG emissions from polluting technologies, and therefore the implementation of measures to encourage their deployment will not be reflected in GHG accounting. This means that GHG reduction opportunities may reach a point where reductions by conventional means are not feasible, and new technologies are either not available, at an early stage of development or require prohibitive investments.
Very limited use of energy storage, which hinders the production of green electricity (related to the infrastructure challenge of spare technical capacity).

# A-3.3: Description of systemic bottlenecks and opportunities – textual elements

## Infrastructure

Underdeveloped infrastructure for charging or refuelling alternative fuel and electric vehicles, both for light and non-light vehicles.
Lack of spare capacity in electricity networks: one ESO substation has no spare technical capacity, another ESO substation has 10 MW of spare technical capacity. LITGRID does not have any spare technical and balancing technical capacity on its 110 kV section. In the event that there is no spare technical capacity on the network, all the energy generated must be consumed or stored.
Spatial planning, including the siting of various facilities (residential, commercial, etc.), which create the preconditions and conditions for increased car use.

## Political system

The decisions needed may be politically unpopular, making them more difficult to adopt and implement. This is the case for national decisions that need to be implemented nationwide, including in the Tauragė municipality, such as increasing excise duties on fossil fuels or removing subsidies, environmental requirements for agricultural activities, introducing taxes and increasing their rates, etc. It can also be decisions taken at municipal level, such as low emission zones, changing road widths, parking charges, increasing waste management fees (to fund sustainable solutions), etc.
Local policies must not only be developed considering the diverse interests of local stakeholders, but also be compatible with national and EU level policies in the context of climate neutrality. The municipality has to develop multidisciplinary documents that are relevant to climate neutrality, but also have to be aligned with the municipality's strategic documents, which makes the planning process complex, multilevel and requires coordination and adaptation across different documents. This leads to a significant increase in time and resources.
Some sectors depend on measures taken at the national level, e.g. agriculture, industry participating in the ETS, and therefore have very limited local influence or ability to influence activities.
The political situation in the agricultural sector in the EU, nationally and at local level is complex. Limited scope for discussion on GHG emission reductions if the aim is to maintain or increase the current size of the agricultural sector (number of agricultural holdings, production levels).

## Institutional and organisational framework

The feasibility of implementing the measures depends strongly on the financial support, and thus on the timing and content of the calls (e.g. the requirements for applicants, the costs to be reimbursed, the intensity of support, etc.). These measures are usually developed on a national or regional basis, which does not consider local needs or specificities.
The need for infrastructure related to climate neutrality targets (e.g. charging stations, infrastructure for non-motorised transport, waste separation infrastructure, etc.) requiring investment and a medium to long construction/installation period (usually more than 1 year). Also financing the maintenance of such infrastructure during its operation. In some cases, such as electricity transmission networks, changes cannot be made at local level but require changes at national level (including significant investments).
Lack of knowledge and skills in assessing and mitigating climate change impacts, lack of experience in submitting proposals. This leads to a lack of motivation, ability to identify the necessary actions and to implement them successfully. There is also a lack of skills and experience in applying for funding under the measures, both for the population and for the private and public sector. A related issue is the design of the instruments' documents: their clarity, consistency (there are cases where requirements change during the lifetime of a call), complexity (e.g. very specific requirements or complexly described requirements). Hiring specialists who can draw up the necessary documents involves additional costs.
Shortage of climate change and sustainability specialists and experts in both the public and private sectors.

# A-3.3: Description of systemic bottlenecks and opportunities – textual elements

Despite the fact that the municipality has climate-neutral goals and targets, and the solutions needed to achieve them, GHG emission reductions or carbon sequestration are rarely assessed. This does not allow for a full assessment of the benefits of the solutions or for their prioritisation, which is particularly relevant in view of the limited funding and the need to use it optimally.
Lack of organisational/governance framework - there is no entity (working group, responsible staff, board, etc.) in the municipality that is responsible for the management of climate action, including the development of strategic objectives, the preparation of measures, monitoring and control, representation at national and international level, and any other necessary actions in this area.

## Finance

The deployment or use of new technologies often requires higher investment than the deployment or use of "conventional" technologies, and is therefore less attractive, both from the point of view of the population and in terms of its payback. For example, current recycling technologies are often more expensive than landfilling or incineration and the purchase of raw materials.
High competition for measures at national level, resulting in limited access to funding under these measures. This barrier is particularly significant for individuals and the private sector. For example, when a tender is launched for support for the installation of solar power plants, applications for the amount requested are collected in a very short time (less than one day).

## Social system

Lack of community ownership of joint energy projects, which hinders opportunities for faster and more efficient development of local energy generation capacity.
Negative attitudes or experiences in some sectors regarding requirements, policies and measures to reduce climate impacts and protect the environment, e.g. agriculture, industry. The resulting hostility in this area and lack of support for related initiatives.
Difficulties in reaching agreement between groups with different interests, need for cooperation. This is relevant for cooperation between residents to implement joint projects that contribute to the climate neutrality objective, such as agreement on renovation, the creation of energy communities etc. It is also relevant for projects that can only be implemented through public-private cooperation (e.g. on financing, securing the necessary skills, etc.). Lack of community, lack of trust in other parties, the need to appoint a responsible or representative stakeholder (taking on personal commitments or responsibilities) can hamper the implementation of significant climate neutrality measures.
Treating the topic of climate change and related actions as an obligation imposed by the municipality or government. The perception that the topic is only relevant to the municipality and does not affect residents or businesses. Lack of proactivity and initiative from residents and businesses.
Lack of NGOs working in the field of climate, environment – no NGOs working in this field.

## Behaviour

Travel habits of the population (most trips are made by car), which are partly determined by socio-cultural attitudes towards owning a car - owning a car is associated with a successful life. The city is also designed in such a way that it is more convenient for people to travel by car than by walking, cycling, public transport and other modes of travel. Therefore, giving up car travel is a difficult decision. Other aspects include the unattractiveness of public transport for the population, and the fact that the municipality covers rural areas where public transport is poorly developed. In addition, there is a well-developed second-hand car market in Lithuania, which makes it possible to buy used and often polluting cars at relatively low prices. Tauragė District Municipality has a well-developed used car sales business.
People's daily habits, such as energy consumption due to the use of appliances, equipment, waste sorting, cleaning products, which are difficult to change, require motivation and commitment, and sometimes additional knowledge.

# A-3.3: Description of systemic bottlenecks and opportunities – textual elements

Carbon sequestration is limited by land use characteristics and opportunities for nature-based solutions. Less interest and knowledge in implementing nature-based solutions. However, there is also a greater focus on GHG emission reduction measures than carbon sequestration measures, both at national and regional level. Therefore, the focus on GHG emission reduction measures is predominant.

The following are options to support climate neutrality, based on the systems identified and considering their stakeholders and their influence and interests:

## Technologies

The desire to produce energy for our own needs, to avoid dependence on energy suppliers and imports. For this reason, the high popularity of financial instruments to promote the production of energy from renewable sources.
Tauragė District's geographical area is favourable for the development of renewable energy projects.

## Infrastructure

Using the infrastructure created for walking, cycling, other non-motorised means of transport and public transport, breaking the daily habits that lead to GHG emissions.

## Political system

Tauragė District Municipality's strategic ambition to become the greenest municipality in Lithuania, i.e. a strong motivation at municipal level to achieve climate neutrality. Active and strong political leadership within the municipality to achieve climate neutrality. This ambition is long term and continuous despite political cycles and changes. Relevant documents have been developed which cover a wide range of measures relevant to climate neutrality. This means that the strategic objective and measures are agreed at political level, and that the municipal administration is involved in the implementation of these objectives and measures.
Developing cooperation in the Tauragė region in order to achieve common objectives of regional importance (including those of relevance to the Tauragė municipality) that contribute to climate neutrality, such as improving the attractiveness of public transport, measures in the field of tourism etc.

## Institutional and organisational framework

Alignment and interlinking of policies and measures from different documents in the preparation of the Action Plan. This allows to identify optimal solutions, focus on the most beneficial solutions, and attract funding and organisational resources for them.

## Finance

There is a very high level of interest and activity in national measures for residents, such as support for installing renewable energy equipment and purchasing clean vehicles. Applicants from all over the country are eligible to participate, so the nationwide measures open to residents of Tauragė District Municipality are.
A large share of EU funds focuses on environmentally and climate-friendly solutions. These funds are targeted at public sector entities, including municipalities, the private sector and citizens. Funding for targeted measures also comes from other sources such as the Climate Change Programme.

## Social system

Inclusion of socially excluded people in mitigating climate impacts, focusing on measures that not only reduce energy poverty, but also increase energy efficiency, reduce the use of polluting fuels, and address other areas relevant to climate neutrality.

## Behaviour

# A-3.3: Description of systemic bottlenecks and opportunities – textual elements

Re-use of items, repair of defective items, i.e. extending the life cycle of products instead of purchasing new ones, attractive among the population because of the potential savings in resources (economic benefits).
The interest, recognition and awareness of climate change among the residents of Tauragė district municipality increases their motivation to contribute to the implementation of climate change mitigation actions. Publicising good practices in the municipality to show that it is possible to implement different solutions at local level, exposing local climate ambassadors through good practices and involving them in related actions, dissemination of information, etc.

The stakeholder meetings focused on the barriers faced in a particular sector and the opportunities that can be exploited to reduce GHG emissions in the municipality. The discussions covered both the challenges and opportunities faced at municipal level and those that have not been exploited or have been under-exploited, as well as the barriers faced as a result of decisions taken or implemented at national level and the opportunities offered at national level. The following are the barriers and opportunities identified at both municipal and national level that are relevant for Tauragė District Municipality:

## Barriers identified by stakeholders and opportunities to reduce them

|  Sector | Barriers identified by stakeholders | Opportunities identified by stakeholders  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Energy (manufacturing and buildings) | Households are not monitored for fuel use.
The power tax limits the development of green energy.
Green energy is not chosen because of its higher cost.
Difficulties and uncertainties in the application of legislation.
High competition between applicants for renewable energy incentives, resulting in limited access to support for individual house owners.
Requirements for wind turbine development (height, protection zones, etc.).
Uncertainty about the metering system for generation consumers (consideration is being given to changing the current one to one that stakeholders say is less favourable to them).
Lack of available technical capacity, which prevents the development of green energy (except by investing in aggregators).
Contracting with the energy distribution operator is not always possible.
Frequent changes in strategic documents and legislation in the field of renovation.
Unattractive conditions issued by ESO to renovating apartment blocks (significantly increasing the value of the project).
Prioritisation of heat pumps compared to CHS development (funding for heat | CHS development.
Promoting the installation of heat pumps.
Educating citizens and organisations to increase green energy procurement.
Changing heating technologies, in particular away from fossil fuels (in households).
Abolition of fossil fuel incentives.
GHG accounting at company level and development and implementation of company climate plans.
Additional municipal funding for residents and businesses implementing RES measures.
“Green Corridor for municipalities preparing a climate change strategy (first priority for applying for measures).
Elimination of the use of natural gas in industry (replacement by cleaner fuels).
Provision of assistance to small businesses on climate issues (creation of assistants, consultants, educators, etc.).
Developing green hydrogen production.
Development of green energy balancing, storage capacity.
Inventorying boilers and targeting measures based on the results of the inventory.  |

Consumer preference for the cheapest fuel type, reluctance to pay more for cleaner fuels.
Lack of a single preferred technology for heavy transport.
Lack of infrastructure for alternative fuels.
Limited opportunities for green energy production and deployment due to ESO requirements, policies and options.
Some of the vehicles registered in the Tauragé District Municipality use fuels from other municipalities or European countries, but they are included in the Tauragé District Municipality GHG inventory.
Services with a lower CO_{2} footprint are not procured on local and foreign markets due to their higher cost (despite the fact that such services are required on foreign markets).
Low attractiveness of electric cars for car rental due to lack of charging infrastructure.
Lack of available technical capacity in energy distribution networks.
The habits of the population to use cars, including a preference for diesel cars.
Low awareness and knowledge of sustainability among businesses and lack of sustainability professionals. | Encouraging the take-up of electric vehicles (replacing polluting fuel vehicles).

Developing and modernising public transport infrastructure and improving accessibility.
Information and education of businesses on sustainability.
Opportunity to develop Tauragé as a secondary market location for electric vehicles.  |
|  Waste | The amount of waste to be incinerated is agreed in advance, so more waste than agreed cannot be delivered when needed (limited incineration capacity).
If the price paid by municipalities for waste incineration is lower than the price paid by businesses, it is more profitable for incinerators to incinerate the waste of businesses rather than municipalities.
The gases collected at the landfill are not used as a fuel source.
Poor sorting.
Implementation of the priorities and measures envisaged is not fast enough.
Reduction in the scale of projects due to lack of funding. | Expanding gas collection capacity at landfill sites.
Develop the capacity to utilise the gas collected in the landfill.
Educate the population on waste sorting.
Control of waste sorting during collection.
Applying tax measures to residents who do not sort their waste.

The use of national average data in municipal accounting may result in the impact of GHG reduction actions implemented in the municipality not being reflected in the GHG accounting, i.e. the real impact will not be captured due to the accounting method used. Lack of data at business entity level (peatland operations). The use of electricity generated from biogas is limited due to the limited availability of connection to the distribution grid. Low farmer involvement in achieving climate neutrality targets. Short-termism and slow expansion of organic farms due to lack of profitability. Potential expansion of military infrastructure (ranges, bases, etc.) and installation in forested areas, which will increase the need for increased GHG sequestration measures. | Inventory the technologies and other data used on farms (livestock numbers, fertiliser use, etc.) to collect data at farm level. Moving towards more accurate GHG accounting based on farm-level data. Provision of more accurate data at business entity level to the municipality, which will carry out GHG accounting.

# A-3.4: Description or visualisation of the climate-neutral engagement model – textual and visual elements

Achieving climate neutrality requires the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders. The involvement of different stakeholders ensures that different systemic perspectives are considered from different angles, considering diverging interests. The Tauragė district municipality envisages a two-level engagement model. The first level includes participation during the development of the Strategy, the second level includes participation during the implementation of the Strategy.

The participation model has two phases. The first involves involving stakeholders in the development of the Strategy. The second phase involves action to implement the Strategy.

**Level 1 of the Participation Model.** The first level of the Participation Model included several important steps: mapping stakeholders and categorising them according to their interests and capacities, planning ways to engage stakeholders, implementing stakeholder engagement, including timing, preparation of the necessary materials, organising and taking any other necessary actions.

**Mapping stakeholders.** Stakeholders in Tauragė district municipality are divided into five types according to their involvement in the development of the Strategy. The first type includes the Strategy development team, which consists of representatives (staff) of the Ministry of Environment, Tauragė district municipality and the consultant who is preparing the documents. This type of stakeholders communicates on a regular basis to address issues relevant to the preparation of the documents and regularly monitors the progress of the process. The internal type includes the stakeholders directly responsible for the preparation of the Strategy, i.e. the municipality's political power and administration, and the stakeholders related to the municipality, i.e. the municipality's subordinate bodies and companies in which the municipality is a shareholder. The stakeholders in this type are directly interlinked and their decisions or actions are coordinated and can be targeted towards a common goal, and some of them have a direct financial link in terms of allocations or financial and investment decisions. The external type includes stakeholders that are active in the territory of the Tauragė district municipality. This type includes community-based organisations, business and agricultural representatives, scientific organisations and other relevant organisations. Their involvement in the development and implementation of the Strategy is critical, but their links to the Tauragė district municipality are often not direct or based on subordination (governance, funding etc.). Therefore, it is very important to engage with these stakeholders and involve them first in the development and then in the implementation of the Strategy. These types of stakeholders have little interest but a lot of power to drive change. The fourth type includes nationally relevant stakeholders, but these stakeholders have different interests and power.

Figure 2-12. Stakeholder map

Stakeholder grouping according to their interests and powers. The identified stakeholders have been assigned to categories of interest and power according to the specificities of Tauragé District Municipality. The most affected and empowered are considered to be the municipal companies, as well as the Tauragé Division of the State Forest Enterprise, which is responsible for the management of state-owned forests in the territory of the Tauragé District. The population is considered to be strongly affected, but their power varies in different areas. Their power is strong in areas where behavioural change is important, such as daily travel choices, reducing energy consumption, and waste management at household level. The political leadership and administration of the Tauragé district municipality, the Council, as well as the municipal staff and, at the national level, the ministries that formulate and implement policies at the national level. A strong focus must be given to stakeholders who have a lot of power but so far have had little interest in engaging in climate neutrality aspects. In the case of Tauragé district municipality, this group must pay special attention to the involvement of business and agriculture in the development of the Strategy. Their involvement is generally low, but their actions are key to achieving the climate neutrality objectives. The fourth group of stakeholders is considered to have little influence and power. This group includes active communities, NGOs, cultural and educational institutions and academics. They play a key role in informing, educating and persuading and their involvement is therefore essential.

Ways to involve stakeholders. Considering the situation of Tauragé district municipality, the activity of the stakeholders and the different needs of the different stakeholders, different ways of stakeholder involvement have been planned. At the beginning of the process, an introductory event was planned to familiarise the stakeholders with the whole process, to explain the objectives and the process and to provide other necessary information. In order to involve stakeholders in the search for ways to achieve the objectives, it was decided to organise sectoral meetings, which allow focusing on a specific sector and getting deeper into its issues. The sectoral representatives are here also used as experts with knowledge of the specificities of the sector. Given that climate transformation requires the widest possible involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, a great deal of attention has been paid to engaging with residents and communities. To this end, a less formal meeting format has been chosen, with green picnics. In order to involve stakeholders from different sectors beyond those directly related to GHG emissions, a workshop was organised focusing on the involvement of social partners, communities, NGOs, etc. in the generation of actions needed for climate transformation.

In order to ensure a smooth and inclusive dissemination of information and to encourage more people to get involved in the process of developing the Action Plan measures, communication with the population was carried out through various platforms, including the zalia.taurage.It website, the radio, newspapers, community chairpersons and elders, and social networks. All residents were given the opportunity to contribute to the strategy development process, which was open. A dedicated platform for sharing ideas was created and shared in various communication tools.

A Focused conversation (ORID) methodology was used for the meetings with the sectoral representatives. This methodology uses four groups of questions: purpose, reflection, interpretation and decision. For each of these groups, the questions on which the discussion is based.

Implementing stakeholder involvement. During the preparation of the Action Plan, various events such as a town festival, debates for residents, youth and various community groups were organised to discuss various climate change issues, share experiences and ideas on how to address the challenges. A meeting was also organised with the social partners of Tauragé district municipality, i.e. youth organisations, educational institutions, cultural institutions, during which education and training and other measures that can contribute to the engagement and education of citizens, youth and students on climate change were discussed. Meetings were also organised with business representatives to explore ways to collaborate on climate neutrality objectives. Interim results and ideas were presented to the City Council, whose members were actively invited to participate in all meetings, discussions and events.

Meetings were held with representatives of different sectors to consider different systemic perspectives. Three meetings were held with each sector to discuss the current situation (starting point), to generate ideas for action, and to discuss and draw up a list of actions that would be acceptable to all parties and for which the parties would take responsibility for implementation. The process of drafting the Strategy ends with the signing of a commitment document at a joint meeting of all stakeholders.

**Level 2 of the participation model.** Action Plan once developed, must be regularly reviewed to identify the progress of actions and the impact on GHG emissions. Different stakeholders are responsible for implementing the actions. This is why stakeholders are first and foremost involved as responsible actors. Another aspect of involvement is participation in the monitoring process.

The participatory climate neutrality management model is described in detail in Module C-1. This model will be implemented in 2024. In the fall (so far the model has not been implemented). The model provides for the establishment of a coordination group and working groups responsible for coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the Strategy. The coordination group and working groups will include representatives of the municipality, entities responsible for implementing the measures, and other necessary stakeholders. To make sure the interests of vulnerable groups are represented by the participation of all municipal employees responsible for these groups in the working groups, and other relevant stakeholders will be included as needed. Additionally, representatives of the citizens, NGOs, educational and cultural institutions, and other relevant parties will be invited to the annual meetings.

Progress should be monitored regularly, on an annual basis. The participatory model of climate neutrality management foresees the collection of data on the progress of the implementation of the measures from the stakeholders responsible for implementing the measures. Progress in the implementation of the measures is measured by the indicators set out in the Action Plan (Module B-3). The data collected shall be summarised and a conclusion drawn on the progress achieved. On the other hand, GHG emissions have to be assessed in order to identify changes (positive or negative) and to consider changes in activity data (as the scale of activities changes, GHG emissions may also change). Depending on whether progress has been made and how GHG emissions have evolved, decisions have to be taken on the appropriateness and continuity of the actions envisaged (whether or not to continue), as well as the need for new measures. Sectoral considerations must be considered when monitoring progress. The cooperation of stakeholders in providing the necessary data is key to this process.

Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B represents the core of the CCC Action Plan, shaped by local authorities, local businesses, and stakeholders, comprising of the most essential elements: scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, action portfolios and indicators for monitoring, evaluation, and learning.

# 3.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Module B-1 "Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Pathways" lists and describes impact pathways, early and late changes, and direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits) by activity, considering the NetZeroCities Theory of Change and the Action Plan Guidelines.

The pathways to climate neutrality have been developed through a long process, using analytical methods to characterise the current situation and involving different stakeholders. The process identified the current situation and the sectors and activities with the highest GHG emissions and identified barriers and opportunities for achieving climate neutrality through stakeholder discussions. The focus was on identifying actions in each sector and the necessary conditions for them. This process led to the identification of four main impact pathways:

Climate-neutral households. Households in Tauragę district municipality are key to achieving climate neutrality and were therefore given special attention in the formulation of actions. Households can contribute to climate neutrality in many sectors through various actions to reduce fossil fuel consumption, use RES for energy production, increase energy efficiency, reduce consumerism, etc.
Climate-neutral public sector. The public sector plays a key role in the climate neutral path. The public sector sets an example by its actions for other stakeholders, demonstrating the feasibility of actions. Therefore, the public sector and its institutions must strive to transform its activities towards climate neutrality in a wide range of activities, including fossil fuel reduction, energy efficiency, etc. In addition, the public sector coordinates the implementation of climate neutrality and must ensure transparency and accountability in this process.
Climate-neutral production and consumption. The municipality is home to a wide range of businesses engaged in various types of production, sales, service and other economic activities. Agriculture is an important sector in the municipality and accounts for a large part of the territory. The municipality also aspires, and good practices are in the use of RES for energy production. Economic activities generate GHG emissions but have the potential to reduce them. All these opportunities need to be optimally exploited in order to achieve climate neutrality.
A climate-neutral community. Habit patterns, lack of community spirit, negative attitudes and experiences, and lack of thematic NGOs are seen as significant barriers to achieving climate neutrality. These barriers hinder the implementation of measures that directly reduce GHG emissions, and it is therefore necessary to focus on targeted community education and outreach, starting with the youngest members of the community and involving all social groups, including the vulnerable.

Each of the impact pathways covers 20 portfolios of instruments. The number of instrument portfolios assigned to each pathway varies. These portfolios of measures include not only the actions identified in Module B-2 (69 measures, excluding carbon sequestration measures), but also management and social

The early and late changes driven by the exposure pathways are presented below, according to their systemic levers and the direct and indirect effects that result. For the direct impacts, i.e. reductions in GHG emissions, the same methodology was used as for GHG accounting (see Module A-1 for more details). For each measure, the direct impacts were sought to be determined using a variety of tactics to collect or calculate the necessary data. Table B-1.1 shows the total direct impacts by sector. For each measure, the first step was to determine how energy consumption or other activity data used to calculate GHG emissions would change as a result of the measure. The scale of implementation of the measure was used to determine the changes, and the necessary assumptions were made in the absence of specific data on this. The assumptions were made on the basis of available supporting data. For example, the energy savings from renovation were based on historical renovation data and the energy savings per house multiplied by the number of houses to be renovated. Assumptions on the scale of implementation of measures were also based on national targets such as the number of electric vehicles, the number of buses running on cleaner fuels, the number of green households, etc. Once the change in energy consumption has been identified, energy sources were identified. Once the change in energy consumption was identified, the energy sources were identified. Once the energy sources have been identified, the corresponding emission factors were used, and the emission reductions calculated. In case it is not possible to determine with certainty which energy source will change, a weighted average has been calculated, for example in the case of individual houses, for a change in heating method, where coal, peat, biofuels and other energy sources are used to heat individual houses. For some groups of actions, the overall impact on GHG reductions was calculated. This decision was taken in case the action group achieves an overall result and it would be difficult or duplicative to determine the impact of each measure separately. This is the case in the energy field for the phase-out of fossil fuel in district heating, as well as in the impact assessment of sustainable mobility measures, where the cluster of measures aims to reduce the number of car journeys, the introduction of manure and slurry management technologies expected to increase the amount of manure and slurry treated, and the implementation of measures that are expected to increase the number and size of organic farms.

In the case of a national measure to be implemented at the municipal level (relevant in the context of agriculture and carbon sequestration), the direct impacts calculated at the national level have been used and have been recalculated proportionally for the municipality of Tauragé district. The proportions were calculated on the basis of the shares of the Tauragé district municipality's land area, orchards and berrygardens, forests and other areas in relation to the corresponding areas in Lithuania.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

The impact pathways are based on the data and information collected in Module A, linking them together and selecting the optimal solutions to achieve climate neutrality in the Tauragè District municipality.

![img-21.jpeg](img-21.jpeg)
Figure 3-2. Developing impact pathways

The choice of impact pathways is based primarily on the GHG data analysed in Module A-1, i.e. the most GHG-intensive sectors and activities in them. Attention has also been paid to the feasibility of implementing changes in these sectors. The Tauragè District Municipality covers not only the urban and urban areas, settlements, but also agricultural areas, which have a significant impact on the climate (according to the GHG inventory). Therefore, this Plan also focuses on the agricultural and forestry sectors. These sectors also have an impact on GHG absorption capacity. The main directions for the development of these sectors have been identified at national level, and the Action Plan therefore seeks to clarify how these actions can be implemented in the Tauragè Municipality. These decisions have been coordinated with stakeholders involved in agriculture and forestry.

The impact pathways aim to reduce the systemic barriers identified earlier and to exploit opportunities in the context of the conditions and powers of local government. The impact pathways focus on groups of actors that should contribute to climate neutrality. Each impact pathway should aim to reduce the identified systemic barriers. The main barriers that the identified pathways aim to address are listed below:

Climate-neutral household impacts aim to reduce the limited financial opportunities for technology deployment and the unattractiveness of such technologies due to their cost, to promote the use of electricity storage while reducing the constraint of lack of available bandwidth, to encourage the development of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, to plan areas in a way that allows for a reduction in the use of polluting fuel-powered vehicles, and to change the travelling and other daily habits of residents. The aim is to take advantage of energy self-sufficiency and the favourable geographical area for it, to promote the use of existing infrastructure for non-car travel, to take advantage of national funding opportunities for action, to involve the socially excluded, and to increase the reuse of objects.
The impact of climate-neutral local government aims to reduce the unattractiveness of new technologies and increase the motivation to adopt them, reduce the difficulty of implementing politically complex decisions, develop local policies in line with national and EU policies, and reduce the limited scope for local influence, reducing gaps in the conditions for nationally planned financial investments, reducing knowledge and capacity gaps, including the shortage of climate neutrality specialists and experts, expanding GHG assessment capacity and capability, reducing negative attitudes towards climate neutrality, developing a model for organisational governance, and increasing community involvement. The aim is to build on the political consensus to become the greenest municipality in Lithuania, to develop cooperation, to harmonise the objectives of the different documents, and to exploit national funding opportunities for action.
The impact of climate-neutral production and consumption aims to reduce the limited financial opportunities for technology deployment and the unattractiveness of such technologies due to their cost, to reduce the limitations of technologies to achieve GHG reductions, to

## B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

promote the development of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, to reduce the limitations of local action through national measures, to reduce negative attitudes towards climate change and the actions needed to achieve climate neutrality, to reduce the knowledge and skills gap, and to implement flagship projects. The aim is to exploit the opportunities for national funding to implement actions.

The impact of climate neutral community aims to reduce the difficulty of communities to agree together to implement certain actions, reduce negative attitudes towards climate action, raise awareness of climate neutrality, reduce knowledge gaps in the field, encourage the creation of NGOs working in the field, and change people's travelling and other daily habits. The aim is to exploit various opportunities to increase people's interest in climate change.

The barriers identified by stakeholders have also been considered in the design of impact pathways and specific actions. For example, it aims to address the lack of data for GHG accounting at national level, the difficulties in developing green energy, the low attractiveness of electric vehicles, the use of landfill gas, the low involvement of farmers, etc.

## 3.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

This module provides a description of each action in the Action Plan. These actions include actions to reduce GHG emissions (the GHG Emissions Reduction Strategy) and actions to build or develop carbon sequestration capacity to reduce residual GHG emissions (the Residual GHG Emissions Strategy).

### B-2.1: Description of action portfolios – textual or visual

|  Fields of action | Portfolio description  |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Energy systems | List of actions | Descriptions  |
|   |  1) Installation of thermal collectors for hot water and solar collectors
) Complete elimination of the use of fossil fuels for district heating
) Decarbonisation of heat production in the industrial sector
) Implementation of the national ban on the use of coal and peat for heat generation in households
) Inventory of household heating installations
) Develop municipal RECs and CECs
) Development of energy production using RES (non-profit legal entities)
) Developing RES-based energy production in households
) Development of energy production from RES (legal entities)
) Development of solar power plants in UAB Tauragės vandenys
) Development of wind power plants | The list of energy system measures is based on the sources of GHG emissions. In particular, the focus is on reducing the use of fossil fuels in the district heating subsector and in the individually produced heat subsector. Some of the affected actions are already included in existing strategic documents, e.g. optimisation of the district heating system, reduction of heat losses, promotion of the purchase of heat pumps etc.

The district heating sub-sector is dominated by biofuels, but a small share of fossil fuels still remains. The measures therefore focus on fossil fuel divestment. Particular attention is paid to decarbonising heat production in the industrial sector.

The sectoral discussions identified that this process is already underway, and that decarbonisation of heat produced and used in the industrial sector by 2030 can be achieved by connecting this sector to district heating.

Individual heat production is still based on coal, peat and liquid fuels. This sub-sector is dominated by 1-2 flat houses. The formulation of impact measures for this sector has focused on increasing the availability and use of heat pumps - the development of RES power plants.

The development of RES - solar and wind - not only contributes to increasing the availability of cleaner electricity, but also makes the use of heat pumps more economically attractive (discussions have shown that heat pumps have become less attractive as electricity prices have risen). Another important aspect of the development of RES plants is the  |

|   | 12) Development of green energy consumption in municipal institutions/enterprises
) Implementation of educational programmes on renewable energy
) Organisation of information meetings with owners of individual houses | reduction of energy dependence on both fossil fuels and imported electricity. This is a national objective, and each municipality should strive to contribute to it. Tauragė District Municipality is geographically favourable for the development of wind turbines. The measures envisaged include the expansion of capacity to the extent possible within the limits of grid capacity.
Given that the Tauragė municipality is faced with a lack of available capacity in the electricity supply network, it is also important to promote the purchase of green energy from suppliers, especially in areas where there is no longer any available capacity. Future grid reconstruction and expansion is planned at national level, so that RES generation can continue to be developed after 2030.
The lack of awareness and education to advance in the above areas was also identified during the preparation of this plan. Therefore, this plan includes measures to increase awareness and education of the population.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Mobility & transport | 1) Develop an information campaign to promote sustainable mobility or the purchase of sustainable vehicles
) Provide a shuttle service for residents
) Install cycle paths in remote settlements, near recreational areas, garden communities
) Provision of bicycle storage in the bus station area
) Provision of a bicycle transport service on public and intercity bus transport
) Taxed parking in the city centre
) Installation of charging stations for non-motorised vehicles
) Creation of a sustainable car sharing platform for municipal institutions
) Establishment of an electric car hub in Tauragė District Municipality
) Acquisition of electric or other non-polluting fuel vehicles by individuals and legal entities
) Installation of charging stations for electric vehicles in households and in the industrial and business sector | Mobility and transport focus on two main axes: 1) the phasing out and downscaling of cars and 2) the decarbonisation of the transport fleet.
For the first strand, a set of measures is foreseen in the existing plans for sustainable mobility development. However, meetings with stakeholders have identified missing actions. These actions are included in this list of measures. Awareness raising and consciousness-raising is also foreseen to implement the actions included. A large part of the business in Tauragė District Municipality is related to the import, repair, sale and other related activities. Businesses have acquired skills and experience in this area. Therefore, in order to promote electromobility not only in Tauragė but also to contribute to the achievement of the national objectives in this field, this plan foresees the development of an electromobility hub, so that the Tauragė municipality becomes a hub for importing and handling electromobility vehicles in the country. To this end, a range of actions are envisaged. This should contribute to the decarbonisation of the transport fleet.
The decarbonisation of the transport fleet has two strands: one focusing on the decarbonisation of the transport fleet of individuals and legal entities, and the other on the decarbonisation of the transport fleet of the municipality, its institutions and enterprises. The individual and legal entity route includes the development of charging stations in individual households or businesses as a prerequisite for increasing the number of electric vehicles. The transport fleet of the municipality, its institutions and enterprises include cars, special vehicles and buses. In addition to the management of its own fleet, outsourcing of services is envisaged.  |

) Replacement of polluting buses owned by the municipality and the companies it manages with non-polluting buses
) Decarbonize the polluting heavy transport owned by the municipality and the companies it manages
) Optimising public transport routes
) Develop a concept and design principles for Tauragė as a cycling and walking city |   |

|  Waste & circular economy | 1) Implementing control over the composition of municipal waste
) Developing the network of "Padėk" stations^{17} in the region
) Incineration of non-recyclable waste
) Developing a strategy to raise awareness, sensitisation and education on waste management, sorting and recycling
) Carrying out a survey of the population on their sorting habits
) Encouraging residents to install more environmentally friendly domestic wastewater treatment plants
) Increasing landfill gas collection
) Utilisation of landfill gas for energy production
) Optimization of waste collection routes | The waste and circular economy sector focuses on promoting waste sorting and reuse. These measures aim to contribute to reducing the amount of waste going to landfill. This sector does not focus on infrastructure development, as these measures are foreseen in the strategic documents.
Another important aspect is the management of domestic wastewater. In parts of the territory, the development of centralised domestic wastewater management networks is not economically viable, and the focus is therefore on the installation of more environmentally friendly facilities.
A third important area is landfill gas collection, which is currently being implemented, but not to its full extent. The aim is to capture all the gas and use it for energy production. Analytical work in this area is currently underway and should provide more precise answers on the possibilities in this area.  |

The "Padėk" station is a place where residents can deliver their no-longer-used items and leave them there free of charge. Other residents can take those items free of charge for their own use. Various items can be shared, such as furniture, textiles, electrical and electronic devices, etc. Items must be suitable for re-use, i.e. unbroken, untorn, dry, clean.

|  Buildings | 1) Renovation of multi-family houses
) Renovation of public buildings (additional)
) Renovation / modernisation of one- or two-apartment dwellings of individuals.
) Encouraging the renovation of individual houses (1-2 flats)
) Feasibility study on the improvement of energy inefficient individual (1-2 flat) houses | Renovation is a major focus of this plan in order to achieve savings in energy consumption. Renovations are foreseen in existing strategic documents but are not sufficient in scale to reduce both fossil fuel use for heating and electricity consumption.
This plan, unlike the existing strategic documents, focuses on individual houses, which dominate the Tauragė district municipality.
In Tauragė municipality, some of the detached houses have a very large footprint, which has made them unattractive to their owners, and the municipality is therefore seeking to investigate how such houses can be retrofitted, with a particular focus on retrofitting options to help socially vulnerable people.  |

) Investment support for the introduction of climate-smart farming practices on livestock holdings (slurry incorporation) (implementation of a national measure)
) Compensation for land research
) Organisation of information events on catch crops and their benefits for farmers
) Promotion of initiatives to develop organic farming (certification)
) Promotion of organic farming (implementation of a national measure)
) Development of precision fertilisation technologies (implementation of a national measure)
) Development of protein crops (implementation of a national measure) | In the agricultural sector, the focus is on reducing GHG emissions from livestock farming, as well as reducing fertiliser use. The former includes measures on both fermentation processes and the management of manure and slurry, the implementation of which is to be stimulated by financial support to farmers in the municipality of Tauragė district.
On the other hand, measures are being developed and implemented at national level to increase farmers' involvement in sustainability. These measures include both direct payments and investment support, all of which are open to all farmers in the country. Therefore, some of the measures included in this plan foresee the implementation of national measures at the level of the Tauragė municipality.
The need for and the benefits of information and education activities targeting farmers have been expressed. To this end, various types of training and information measures are envisaged.
At both municipal and national level, the development of organic farms is a major focus. Financial support is foreseen for this purpose.
Peat extraction is another important area for the Tauragė region. In cooperation with businesses operating peat extraction in the territory of the Tauragė municipality, measures have been identified to reduce the impact of this activity on GHG emissions.  |

Climate Neutrality Action

Plan

C

The portfolio of actions includes a large number of actions, which are often quite detailed, but by listing all the actions, the aim is to clearly identify the actors responsible for their implementation, and to allocate actions to specific sectors/activities. Given the large number of actions, the governance model presented in Module C-1 includes an element of prioritisation. Prioritisation of actions will be the responsibility of the coordination and working groups, which will consider the different circumstances and possibilities for implementing the actions and will be able to check with the actors responsible for implementation during the prioritisation.

Some of the actions in the Action Portfolio do not have a direct impact on GHG emission reductions, but allow for the proper implementation of other actions, or lay the groundwork for additional actions that may be required in the iterations of the Action Plan. The total costs presented in Table B-2.2 include investment and operating costs, the sum of which is also used to determine the cost per CO2e.

|  Name of action | Sector/area of activity | Description of the link/benefits | Related actions from the Action Portfolio  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Inventory of household heating installations | Energy systems | Provides information for the implementation of the ban on the use of coal and peat for domestic heating. It also provides a basis for future actions to target incentives to encourage people to switch away from the most polluting fuels first, or to bring about changes in a given area, etc. | Implementation of the national ban on the use of coal and peat for domestic heating  |
|  Implementation of educational programmes on renewable energy | Energy systems | Raises people's awareness and knowledge of renewable energy, and provides information on the different ways of using RES. It can therefore not only encourage the direct implementation of RES projects, but also not interfere with projects developed by businesses. | Development of energy production using RES (non-profit legal entities) Developing RES-based energy production in households Development of energy production from RES (legal entities)  |
|  Organisation of information meetings with owners of individual houses | Energy systems | Information on various energy issues is provided to owners of individual houses, who make up the majority of house owners (the majority of dwellings in the Tauragé district municipality are individual houses with 1-2 apartments).

B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

The impact assessment of the GHG emission reduction measures shows that residual emissions are around 15%. The impact pathways and measures have been developed in the context of actions already underway, with additional measures developed through sectoral discussions and meetings with citizens and various other stakeholders. The design of the measures aims at selecting actions that are feasible to implement and setting the scale of implementation at a level that reflects the realistic prospects of achieving it.

Residual issuance is spread unevenly across sectors. In the energy sector (including buildings), residual emissions account for 24% of the total. This sector is confronted with a large number of individual homes, so that decisions to reduce emissions have to be taken by many individuals. In Tauragė District Municipality, biofuels are already used to a large extent for heat production both in the district heating system and in individual houses, and a large part of electricity in Lithuania is produced using renewable energy sources and imported, so that the cumulative reductions in this sector are not large. However, the need for energy efficiency measures in heating systems and buildings is high, as it not only provides GHG emission reductions but also economic benefits for businesses and individuals. Residual emissions from the transport sector account for around 45% of the GHG emissions.

In this sector, a strong focus must be placed on individual vehicle owners. Given the situation of the population and their limited possibilities to both switch to electric vehicles and to use non-motorised vehicles (long distances, only part of the year with suitable weather conditions), the impact measures are based on the national targets set. On the other hand, the transformation of the sector is based on a strong focus on information and education aimed at changing the strong habits of the population. In the waste sector, residual emissions account for around 24% of total emissions. In this sector, many changes are already underway in terms of infrastructure improvements, and this plan focuses on improving the sorting habits and skills of the population. GHG emissions from the IPPU sector are mainly due to emissions from air-conditioning systems in vehicles. National emission factors are used to estimate these emissions, so even if there are changes in this sector (e.g. the use of other gases), these changes will not be reflected in the GHG emission dyad.

Tauragė district municipality is actively farmed, but on the other hand, about 38% of its territory is covered by forests, and this share has remained almost unchanged for at least 10 years. The stable forest cover guarantees stable carbon sinks. The Tauragė district municipality also has protected areas that include both forests and wetlands, which ensures carbon sequestration and long-term locking. Given that the municipality's carbon sinks are currently very high and the total GHG emissions of the AFOLU sector are low compared to other sectors, the residual GHG emissions are -3038%. In the case of GHG emissions from the AFOLU sector alone, the actions foreseen reduce GHG emissions by 15% and residual emissions by 85%. This situation is due to the current situation and the measures foreseen for the agricultural sector. The agricultural sector has a number of measures at national level aimed at contributing to climate change mitigation. Many of these measures provide for direct payments to farmers applying so-called eco-schemes. Given the high availability of financial incentives for the implementation of eco-schemes, these measures have been included in this Action Plan (the scale of their implementation is based on the scale of agricultural activity in the Tauragė district compared to the country as a whole).

To offset residual emissions, the plan includes measures that involve long-term solutions: expanding forest areas (private and public) and improving the maintenance and quality of forests (see Table B-2.2 for details). The following actions are foreseen to offset residual emissions:

|  Actions to offset residual emissions  |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Title | Implementation period | Responsible subject | Carbon sequestration (t CO2e)  |
|  Reimbursement of the cost of forest seedlings to encourage afforestation | 2025-2030 | Tauragė district municipality | -1 503,1  |
|  Developing green infrastructure in urbanised environments | 2025-2030 | Tauragė district municipality | It is not possible to determine the direct impact at this stage, as specific measures are being developed  |

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part C "Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030" aims to outline any enabling interventions, i.e., regarding organizational setting or collaborative governance models or related to social innovations – designed to support the climate action portfolios (Module B-2) as well as aiming to achieve co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Module B-1). These interventions also address the identified opportunities, gaps and barriers identified Module A-2 and A-3.

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

This module details innovations in urban governance to achieve urban climate neutrality by 2030, including innovations in institutional design, leadership, collaboration and outreach processes. These innovations are implemented at the inter-organisational level, or within the key organisations responsible for achieving climate neutrality. It also describes the expected outcomes, such as how these governance innovations enable climate action and its co-benefits (identified in Modules B-1 and B-2) and how they address the opportunities, gaps and barriers identified in Modules A-2 and A-3.

### C-1.1: Description or visualisation of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

Currently, Tauragė district municipality does not have a coordinated governance structure directly responsible for the implementation and coordination of climate neutrality actions. Instead, climate change issues are dealt with by individual specialists and institutions that work on topics that fall within their remit, i.e. energy efficiency, waste management, etc. This division of labour, while allowing for the execution of tasks, is not sufficiently efficient when it comes to coordinating joint efforts and ensuring the systematic and consistent implementation and monitoring of climate neutrality objectives. This division of labour leads to gaps in the exchange of information and the coordination of strategies, which can lead to duplication of effort or, conversely, to important activities being missed. In addition, there is a lack of a unified vision and Action Plan covering all areas related to climate neutrality, thus underutilising synergies between different sectors and initiatives. These challenges can be overcome through the establishment of an effective governance framework.

The process of developing the Action Plan involved a wide range of stakeholders, experts and representatives, which helped to form the basis for a new governance structure. This involvement and cooperation included not only the participation of the municipal administration and Council members, but also the community, the business sector, NGOs, the agricultural sector and others. This multifaceted involvement has led to the development of an integrated and collaborative approach and problem-solving that reflects the needs and expectations of the various sectors. Furthermore, this broad participation of representatives from different sectors has led to the development of a comprehensive and inclusive climate neutrality strategy. This process has highlighted the potential for a participatory governance model.

The newly developed governance model (see figure below) is based on stakeholder cooperation and transparent decision-making. It provides for a clear division of responsibilities and cooperation mechanisms between different institutions and professionals, as well as regular consultation, discussion and reporting. The model has a two-tier governance model: the first tier consists of a decarbonisation coordination group and the second of working groups. The working groups will be responsible for specific areas such as the development of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, urban green infrastructure, etc. This governance model ensures that the results achieved are systematically monitored and evaluated, and that the Action Plan is quickly adjusted if necessary. It should be stressed that the governance model developed will also promote continuous dialogue and cooperation between the different stakeholders, allowing the sharing of best practices and innovations. This will not only increase the efficiency of the implementation of climate neutrality objectives and measures, but also help to adapt to changing conditions and new challenges in the future. Such an integrated and collaborative approach, involving different stakeholders, will create the conditions for a sustainable and coherent development of the city of Tauragė, ensuring a successful trajectory towards climate neutrality.

Figure 4-1. Tauragé district municipality's Decarbonisation Governance Model

## Coordination Group:

The Tauragé district municipality Coordination Group will be composed of the Coordinator of the Urban Mission and the curators of the 7 working groups: decarbonisation of transport, decarbonisation of energy, decarbonisation of waste, decarbonisation of land use, decarbonisation of business and investment, decarbonisation of social innovation, and the curators of the working groups of the future and innovation. The Coordination Group shall elect the Chairperson of the Board and other bodies necessary for its operation. This structure ensures that all decisions and actions are aligned and efficiently executed in order to achieve the climate neutrality targets. The Board has a number of key responsibilities that ensure the effective implementation of the climate neutrality strategy:

Regular meetings: the Coordination Group meets regularly to discuss progress, challenges and possible solutions. During these meetings, each Working Group mentor presents a report on the activities of his/her Working Group, which includes the results achieved, ongoing and planned initiatives and emerging challenges. During these meetings, common issues are discussed, and decisions are taken to ensure the smooth implementation of the strategy.
Annual Progress Review and Reporting: The Coordination Group prepares an annual Progress Review each year, which assesses the results achieved by all working groups, i.e. how climate action has been implemented and how monitoring indicators have been achieved. This review includes a detailed analysis, an assessment of the targets achieved and new recommendations. The report is a key document for adjusting the strategy and the Action Plan to achieve even more effective results.
Strategy adjustment: Based on the results of the annual report, the Coordination Group adjusts the Climate Neutrality Action Plan and the Investment Plan. This adjustment may include setting new targets, modifying existing actions and measures, adding new initiatives and measures in the light of the latest data, recommendations and situation.
Organisation of an annual Climate Neutrality Conference: the Coordination Group organises an annual conference to discuss achievements, share experiences and present planned next steps. The conference brings together members of the working groups, the municipal administration, experts and stakeholders to discuss the progress of the strategy, new initiatives and ideas, and challenges.

This is an essential element to enable the coordination group to effectively coordinate and manage all aspects of the Climate Neutrality Strategy Action Plan. The strategic leadership function includes several key elements: alignment and coordination, risk management, resource allocation and monitoring and evaluation. The Coordination Group ensures that all working groups are aligned and coordinated to maximise synergies and efficiency. To achieve this, the Coordination group shall ensure that there is constant communication and information exchange between the Working Groups. This ensures that there are no gaps in information and knowledge and promotes interdisciplinary cooperation. The Coordination Group also reviews and aligns the Action Lists produced by the Working Groups to ensure that they are in line with the overall strategic objectives and the Action Plan.

In addition, the Coordination Group identifies potential risks associated with the implementation of the Climate Neutrality Strategy and identifies options for managing them. The meetings should discuss and decide on the management of potential risks and designate, as appropriate, those responsible for risk management.

The Coordination Group also carries out resource allocation. The Coordination Group identifies priority areas and ensures that the necessary financial resources are allocated efficiently.

Monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the Action Plan is carried out to ensure operational efficiency. This is done through the preparation of annual reports on the implementation of the Action Plan, which include a description of progress in the implementation of the measures, the level of achievement of the established monitoring indicators, the challenges encountered and how they have been addressed, new opportunities, risk assessment, etc. Based on the results of the monitoring and evaluation, the Coordination Group adjusts the Action Plan and its actions as necessary, i.e. iterations of the Action Plan are made.

The work of the Coordination Group will ensure that all actions are coordinated and aligned with the objectives set, that decisions are based on objective information and data, that new initiatives and innovations are quickly incorporated into the strategy, and that risks are managed effectively, minimising potential negative impacts. The work of the Coordination Group will also help to foster a culture of cooperation between working groups and stakeholders, promoting efficient use of resources and sharing of knowledge and experience.

## Working groups:

Working Groups are the main executive structures that coordinate the implementation of the Climate Neutrality Strategy, working with those responsible for implementing specific actions. They are made up of representatives of a wide range of stakeholders, including municipal administration, municipal companies, associations, NGOs and academic institutions. This diversity ensures that all sectors and interests are represented, and that the implementation of the strategy is as effective as possible. The working groups have the following main responsibilities:

Assignment of GHG reduction targets: each working group is responsible for the implementation of its own area-specific GHG reduction targets set out in the OP.
Preparation of the Action List: The Working Groups, based on the Climate Neutrality Strategy (Action Plan, Investment Plan and the Commitment Document), shall establish the Action Lists within the remit of the specific Working Group. In addition, they take responsibility for monitoring the monitoring indicators within their remit (collecting, summarising, collating, etc.).
Implementation of the Action List: The Working Groups are responsible for coordinating the implementation of their Action List. This includes coordinating the implementation of specific actions, collecting, analysing and summarising information on their implementation, cooperating with other working groups and stakeholders, responding in a timely manner to obstacles encountered, and assisting the entities responsible for implementing the actions.
Monitoring of implementation: The mentor of each working group is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Action Plan. This includes regular monitoring of the progress of the Action Plan, evaluation of the results and submission of the foreseen reports to the Board.
Proposal generation: The Working Groups are responsible for generating proposals in their own field that could contribute to the achievement of the climate neutrality objectives. This includes the development of new initiatives and project ideas and their presentation to the Board.

Climate Neutrality Action

Plan

Members of the Working Groups meet regularly to discuss progress on the Action Plan, to address challenges and to coordinate with other Working Groups. These meetings are an essential element to ensure the smooth implementation of the strategy and effective communication between the different groups and their members. The working groups meet regularly to discuss ongoing work, progress and emerging challenges. During these meetings, the mentors report on the implementation of the Action Plan. The reports outline what actions have been carried out, what results have been achieved and what challenges have been faced. The meetings also discuss possible solutions and next steps. These regular meetings help to ensure that all members of the group are informed of progress and have the opportunity to contribute to the decision-making process. This allows for a rapid response to emerging challenges and the adaptation of action plans in the light of up-to-date data and the situation, i.e. contributing to the interation of the Action Plan.

Each Working Group shall prepare an annual progress review and report to the Coordination Group on the basis of the list of actions it has established. This report shall include an assessment of the results achieved, i.e. the measures implemented, with an assessment of the extent to which they have been implemented, the measures that have not been implemented, with an indication of the reason for non-implementation and the actions planned for the future, the use of funds for the implementation of the measures or plans for the future, etc. The Progress Review provides an assessment of how well the objectives have been achieved and which measures have been most effective. It also identifies the main challenges encountered and how they were addressed. The annual review also allows the identification of areas where additional resources or attention are needed to improve the effectiveness of future actions. It is an important instrument to ensure transparency and accountability in the implementation of the Climate Neutrality Strategy.

The Working Groups participate in the annual Climate Neutrality Conference organised by the Coordination Group. The conference discusses achievements, shares experience and plans the way forward. The conference provides a platform to present the year's achievements, hear success stories from other groups and gain valuable insights and guidance. It also fosters collaboration between working groups and stakeholders, allowing them to interact directly and exchange ideas.

Based on the analysed experiences, the report produced, the knowledge and information gained, the working groups propose, as appropriate, possible new actions and interventions that could contribute to the climate neutrality objective.

## Governance interventions:

Table C.1.2 presents the management interventions that would address the systemic barriers identified in Module A-3. The main barriers include lack of a responsible entity for implementing climate actions, lack of specialist knowledge and capacity, and lack of coordination between actions. These problems are addressed through the establishment of the Tauragé district municipality Decarbonisation coordination group, working groups to coordinate the lists of specific actions developed under the Action Plan. In addition, the municipality is creating the post of a Cities Mission Coordinator to coordinate climate strategies and projects, promoting better cooperation between sectors. The development of a GHG accounting system will ensure more accurate data collection and analysis, while the standardisation of sustainability reporting for municipally owned companies will improve transparency and social responsibility. Finally, investments are being made in staff development and innovation, which will allow the municipality to adopt the latest technologies and methodologies, increasing the efficiency of strategy implementation and the integration of innovative solutions.

Social innovations that address the systemic barriers identified in Module A-3 and exploit the opportunities for climate neutrality can make a significant contribution to climate neutrality by not only addressing existing systemic barriers, but also promoting sustainable development. Notably, these initiatives also promote community and business sector engagement, creating new opportunities and raising public awareness of climate change challenges and solutions. Increasing awareness and changing habits contribute to more sustainable consumption and environmental conservation. Social innovation is essential to engage more stakeholders and citizens in climate neutrality initiatives. These innovations help to reduce social and economic barriers, promote participation and build community links.

Various climate education programmes and initiatives are one of the key factors in raising public awareness and understanding of climate change problems and possible solutions. These programmes are aimed at school children, adults, professionals and the general public, and provide a wealth of knowledge and information to encourage responsible behaviour and innovative solutions to climate change. Educational programmes and initiatives have several main objectives: firstly, they aim to provide knowledge about climate change and its causes. This includes the scientific basis for explaining how human activities contribute to GHG emissions and the effects of climate change. Secondly, they aim to develop practical skills, encouraging changes in habits that will help people to reduce their carbon footprint in their daily activities. Thirdly, they promote participation and engagement in climate change mitigation initiatives at local, regional level. It should be stressed that the educational programmes will be tailored to the target groups, which will not only allow for more effective communication of information, but also encourage active participation, positive behavioural changes and increased community involvement in sustainability initiatives. This tailoring allows each group to have access to information and tools that meet their unique needs and conditions, making the education programmes more tailored and effective. Incorporating climate change topics into school curricula can create a new generation of responsible citizens. Schools would have integrated curricula that include practical as well as theoretical knowledge. For example, pupils could take part in energy-saving projects, carry out experiments with renewable energy sources or organise waste sorting campaigns in their school. Schools can also work with local communities and businesses to implement sustainability projects. This would not only give students real-world experience, but also promote community participation and awareness of climate change issues. For example, schools could take part in an Eco-friendly school competition, celebrate Climate Neutrality Week in educational institutions, and implement a range of educational and curriculum programmes on climate neutrality themes, such as sorting.

Climate education programmes should be accessible not only to schools but also to the general public. This can include a range of activities and initiatives such as seminars, workshops, information campaigns and public debates. Such programmes can be delivered through local community centres, libraries, universities and other public facilities. One of the main objectives of these programmes is to raise awareness of the role of each individual in climate change. Everyone can contribute to reducing climate change by taking responsible action in their daily lives. For example, people can be encouraged to switch to energy-efficient lighting and heating systems, to reduce the use of single-use plastic products, or to choose sustainable means of transport such as bicycles or public transport. In addition, such programmes can encourage civic participation in climate change initiatives. This can include volunteering with local green organisations, taking part in community actions or programmes, participating in climate protests or signing petitions for environmental policy changes. This strengthens community ties and increases public involvement in climate change solutions.

Community projects are also an important tool for achieving climate neutrality, as they not only encourage active participation at local level, but also raise awareness and increase resource efficiency. Such projects create a vision for a sustainable future, empowering citizens to act and share responsibility for environmental and climate protection. By their very nature, community-based projects can be diverse and raise awareness on a wide range of topics related to climate neutrality. Community projects have many benefits that contribute to a sustainable and responsible community life. Firstly, they encourage the participation of residents and give them the opportunity to contribute directly to mitigating the effects of climate change. When residents are actively involved in project activities and see that their actions have a direct impact on the quality of the environment, they become more motivated to continue these actions and to share their experiences with others. Second, community projects strengthen social ties and community spirit. By working together towards a common goal, people build a stronger community base and increase trust in each other. This helps

to overcome social challenges and promote cooperation between different groups. Thirdly, such projects provide practical knowledge and skills that are useful not only in the short term but also in the long term. For example, taking part in waste sorting projects or trying out sustainable mobility measures helps people to better understand how they can effectively reduce their carbon footprint and make more sustainable choices in their daily lives.

Events and social advertising are also powerful tools to promote engagement and awareness of climate change. These tools not only inform and educate the public, but also create opportunities for direct participation, cooperation and engagement in achieving climate neutrality goals. Cultural and community events such as art exhibitions, film screenings, debates or festivals help to bring more attention to the climate change debate. Such events focus on raising public awareness through creative expression and cultural engagement. For example, an art exhibition on environmental themes or a documentary film festival on climate change can attract a wide audience and stimulate debate and action on climate issues. Communities can also organise various campaigns and challenges, such as 'Sustainable Mobility Week' or 'Passing the torch', in which residents can take part in order to achieve specific climate and environmental goals. For example, challenges can be organised in which people compete to reduce energy consumption or waste, or to encourage greenery. These actions not only encourage personal involvement, but also create a sense of community and meet sustainability goals. In addition, events aimed at strengthening partnerships and cooperation between different sectors can also be very useful. For example, forums or meetings with business, academia and NGOs can be organised to discuss and develop joint solutions on climate neutrality. These events can stimulate the development of innovative solutions and an integrated approach to climate action.

Social campaigns and advertising can also be an effective way to educate the public about climate change and how they can contribute to mitigation. It should be noted that it is important that these advertisements are informative, attractive and persuasive in order to attract and engage a wide audience and to be understandable and clear to people of all ages. Social networking platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, X (Twitter) and TikTok are good and modern tools for disseminating information and engaging a wide audience. Short informative posts and competitions can be created by interacting with influencers or public figures. Such campaigns can also include video reports, podcasts or other formats that convey information about climate neutrality and how individuals can contribute to its achievement through their actions. It should be noted that an information campaign on social networks would not only be limited to the municipality but would also cover the whole country. This means that not only the inhabitants of the municipality would be educated and informed about the initiatives that are being carried out and implemented in Tauragé. Moreover, it is worth noting that social networks are mostly used by the younger generation, so it is necessary to use other means of information to reach out to those who do not use the social networks. This can be done through television advertisements, newspaper articles and radio announcements. In addition, leaflets, brochures, publications, websites or advertisements can provide people with information on climate change issues and solutions. These can be distributed in public libraries, schools, community centres and other public spaces.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

## Plans for next Strategy and Action Plan iteration

In order to successfully implement the Strategy, the first step will be to implement the Tauragé district municipality Decarbonisation Governance Model, which will ensure the necessary follow-up actions. The implementation of this model will require the procedures for the establishment of the coordination group and the working groups, which are required under the existing legislation and procedures. Once established, the Coordination group and the Working Groups will start to carry out their assigned functions. The exercise of these functions will enable the AP to be updated in a timely and appropriate manner and, if necessary, supplemented or amended.

The next important step is to prioritise the actions to be taken, so that they can be implemented in a timely and appropriate manner. The prioritisation of actions depends on the timeframes foreseen for their implementation and, in the case of long timeframes, on other factors such as the availability of funding, the preparation needed for the actions, etc. The anticipation of actions will allow their implementation to be planned in advance and to be included in the strategic plans of the municipality, as well as to be considered in the planning of the municipality's resources or those of the other

responsible entities. The timeframe for the implementation of some measures is dependent on the plan foreseen by the subsidies/grants, so this aspect must be considered when planning measures for which such a source of funding is foreseen.

The Action Plan has focused on stakeholder involvement to ensure a just transition. Stakeholders involved in the process included a range of vulnerable or under-represented groups, such as organisations representing people with mobility disabilities, older people. However, these groups were under-represented as they were not actively involved in the process. It is therefore planned to pay more attention to these groups in the future, by discussing measures with them separately. The needs of vulnerable people should also be considered in the planning of the implementation of the actions envisaged, e.g. in the design of pedestrian/cycling infrastructure, in the planning of public transport services, in the adaptation of outreach measures, etc. In the formation of working groups, it is planned to include municipal representatives responsible for the interests of vulnerable groups, who could represent these interests at public sector level, and to continue to work with relevant organisations representing the interests of vulnerable groups, by organising individual meetings, inviting them to joint activities and events, and by inviting them to act as experts if necessary.

The iterations of the Action Plan will be carried out in the context of the envisaged decarbonisation governance model. This model foresees regular supervision of the implementation of the Action Plan and monitoring of the results achieved according to defined indicators, which will allow to identify the need for changes. At that time, the satisfaction of this need can be discussed in working groups and in the Coordination group, with a view to finding options for their implementation.

A very important step is the communication activities, which are foreseen in various forms in both Module B and Module C of this Plan. These activities will allow to attract and convince those stakeholders who have not yet been reached and who have not been involved in the preparation of this Action Plan (for more details on stakeholder involvement see Module A).

# 1 Introduction

In order to become one of the European leaders in climate change mitigation, has joined the European Commission's Mission for 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 (the Cities Mission), an ambitious initiative to make 100 European Union cities climate neutral by 2030. The Climate Cities Mission is part of Europe's Green Deal, which focuses on promoting clean energy, sustainable mobility, circular economy and innovation in cities and regions. As part of this mission, Tauragé district municipality is committed to actively implementing climate neutrality actions, while ensuring sustainable growth of the local economy and improving the quality of life of its citizens.

The vision of Tauragé district municipality is to become a green, vibrant and open district, a municipality worth watching. Tauragé district municipality decided to participate in the Urban Mission not only to reduce its environmental impact, but also to become an example for other municipalities in Lithuania and Europe, as envisaged in its vision. This decision was made considering several important factors. First of all, Tauragé district municipality has a long-standing focus on sustainable development and environmental protection – the goal of becoming the greenest municipality in Lithuania is enshrined as a strategic objective, and participation in the Cities Mission provides an opportunity to achieve these goals more effectively. Secondly, Tauragé district municipality aims to benefit from financial and technical support from the European Union to expand its green policy initiatives and invest in innovative solutions. Thirdly, Tauragé district municipality is aware that the challenges of climate change require global solutions that can only be implemented in cooperation with other European and global communities.

The municipality has already done a lot of important work to reduce climate change. One of the most important steps has been the creation and implementation of the Strategic Development Plan 2021-2030, which sets out the municipality's vision of becoming a green and exemplary municipality. A strong focus is placed on the development of sustainable energy, the use of renewable resources and the implementation of circular economy principles. Tauragé has also developed and is implementing a Renewable Energy Action Plan, which includes increasing energy production from solar, wind and biomass. The aim of this plan is not only to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also to ensure energy security and independence. In addition, Tauragé is actively involved in sustainable mobility initiatives. The Tauragé Sustainable Mobility Plan includes measures to reduce pollution in the city, promote the use of public transport, expand the cycle path network and increase the number of pedestrian zones. These solutions not only contribute to reducing climate change, but also improve the quality of life for the city's inhabitants, reducing traffic congestion and air pollution.

Tauragé district municipality is also involved in various national and international initiatives to share good practice and experience in climate change mitigation. The municipality contributes to the implementation of the measures outlined in the National Energy and Climate Action Plan 2021-2030 (NECAP), which emphasises the role of municipalities in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The NECAP provides municipalities with financial and technical incentives to implement green policies more effectively. Tauragé is also involved in international initiatives, such as the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme, which promotes innovation and technological development in various fields, including climate and energy.

Participation in the Climate Cities Mission opens up a wide range of opportunities for Tauragé district municipality. First of all, the municipality can benefit from European Union financial instruments and technical assistance to promote green development and innovation. This will allow the development of renewable energy projects, modernisation of public transport and other sustainable initiatives. Secondly, the Cities Mission provides an opportunity for Tauragé to become part of a wider European climate network, to share good practices with other cities and to learn from their experiences. Thirdly, participation in the Mission will increase the attractiveness of the municipality to investors looking for opportunities to contribute to sustainable projects. Fourthly, the citizens of Tauragé will have the

opportunity to be directly involved in these processes, contributing to building and improving the future of their community.

The Cities Mission will not only help Tauragé district municipality to achieve its climate neutrality goals, but also ensure that these goals are implemented in a sustainable way, involving local communities and delivering long-term environmental and economic benefits. Tauragé district municipality aims to become a leader in sustainable development and climate change mitigation not only in Lithuania but also in Europe, and participation in the Cities Mission is an important step towards this goal.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

According to the Cities Mission Expression of Interest, Tauragé district municipality is aiming for net-zero GHG emissions, while the expected residual emissions up to 2030 have not been determined (to be elaborated in the next phase of the Mission). The residual emissions in 2030 have been identified in the preparation of the Climate Neutrality Strategy 2030 for the municipality of Tauragé district (hereinafter referred to as the "Strategy"). The climate neutrality target for the municipality of Tauragé district is in line with the elements of the definition of climate neutrality in the Cities Mission, including the residual emissions allowed. The actions set out in the Climate Neutrality Strategy should lead to an 85% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2018, and residual emissions should not account for more than 15% of GHG emissions compared to 2018.

The climate neutrality target has four impact pathways: climate-neutral households, climate-neutral public sector, climate-neutral production and consumption, and climate-neutral community. These impact pathways cover all sectors and each of them manifests itself differently in different sectors. The climate-neutral households impact pathway includes actions focused on clean heat, self-generated green electricity, reduced car travel, electro-mobility, responsible consumption, and more energy-efficient housing. The climate-neutral public sector impact pathway includes actions focusing on green electricity, decarbonised vehicle fleet, green environment, energy efficient buildings, effective climate neutrality management, improved capacity and capability. The climate-neutral production and consumption pathway includes actions focusing on decarbonised heat production, green electricity generation, businesses that decarbonise the transport fleet, decarbonised waste management, climate-friendly agriculture and other land uses, and responsible and learning businesses. The climate-neutral community impact pathway includes actions targeting climate-conscious and knowledgeable young people and a climate-conscious and knowledgeable population.

Tauragé district municipality was established in 1995 and is the average size municipality in Lithuania. It belongs to Tauragé region. There are two towns – Tauragé and Skaudvilé, 4 villages – Batakiai, Gauré, Pagramantis and Žygaičiai, and 320 hamlets. The territory of the district is divided into 8 sub-districts: Tauragé town, Batakiai, Gauré, Lauksargiai, Mažoni, Skaudvilé, Tauragé, Žygaičiai. In implementing its strategic vision and Climate Neutrality Action Plan for Tauragé district municipality 2030 (Action Plan), the municipality has committed itself to the ambitious goal of climate neutrality by 2030. The 2030 climate neutrality target of Tauragé district municipality is consistent with the administrative territory (boundaries) of the municipality, and no exclusion zones, sectors, gases, etc. are identified. The Tauragé district municipality has a number of ETS installations operated by UAB "Tauragés šilumos tinklai". These installations are included in the climate neutrality objective as they are operated by a municipally owned company and the municipality may have a significant influence on their operations.

The goal of climate neutrality by 2030 is expected to bring many additional benefits to the municipality of Tauragé, increasing the region's sustainability, resilience and quality of life. These additional benefits are not just a by-product, but are integral to the region's holistic approach to climate change action:

Economic resilience. Moving away from fossil fuels and investing in renewable energy sources will boost the local economy by creating new jobs in the green energy sector. This transition will also reduce the vulnerability of the district to fluctuations in global energy markets, which will

Tauragė District Municipality Climate Neutrality Commitments 2030

promote long-term economic stability. The focus on sustainable agricultural practices will help to secure the livelihoods of smallholder farmers as they will be able to continue to operate profitably while reducing their environmental impact.

Health and well-being of citizens. Reducing GHG emissions from the transport and energy sectors will improve air quality, reduce respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and reduce noise levels. Greener urban spaces through increased tree planting and green infrastructure will contribute to mental health and well-being, provide recreational opportunities and increase the aesthetic value of urban areas. This means that the quality of life and the living environment of citizens will improve.
Energy security. By investing in renewable energy infrastructure, such as wind, solar and biomass energy, Tauragė district municipality will reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels, increase energy security and promote local energy independence. This development will also protect the region from the economic impact of energy price fluctuations.
Environmental protection. Protecting and restoring wetlands and expanding forests will not only contribute to carbon sequestration, but also maintain biodiversity, improve water quality and enhance ecosystem services. These actions will help to mitigate the effects of climate change, such as flooding and soil erosion, as well as creating habitats for wildlife and carbon sequestration, thus further contributing to the climate change objectives.
Community participation and social cohesion. The Climate Change Action Plan will involve and empower local communities, promoting a sense of shared responsibility and collective action. Public participation in climate initiatives, such as community-based renewable energy projects or local conservation efforts, will strengthen social bonds and raise awareness of environmental issues.

# 3 Strategic priorities

In order to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, Tauragė district municipality has the following systemic strategic priorities:

Reducing the use of fossil fuels. This strategic priority covers a wide range of activities: energy systems, including district and individual heat generation and the use of polluting electricity; transport, with a focus on phasing out polluting vehicles while developing sustainable mobility options; buildings, reducing energy use.
Increasing the use of renewable energy sources. This strategic priority covers the use of solar, wind, hydro, biogas and other renewable energy sources to generate energy for clean energy self-sufficiency and energy independence.
Developing a circular economy. This strategic priority includes waste prevention, preparation for reuse and recycling, and reuse to minimise waste to landfill.
Climate-friendly land use. This strategic priority includes the promotion of the use of advanced farming methods and technologies in livestock and crop production; restoration of disused peatlands.
Engagement and awareness-raising on climate neutrality. This strategic priority involves informing, educating, involving and engaging various population groups, businesses, various institutions and other stakeholders in initiating and implementing actions to achieve climate neutrality.

The next 2-3 years cover half of the timeframe for achieving climate neutrality. Therefore, this phase should focus on the development and implementation of a governance model for the implementation of climate neutrality actions, preparatory actions for the implementation of major projects (e.g. preparation of technical designs, preparation of funding applications, spatial planning, etc.) and engagement and awareness-raising activities. Where preparatory work is already underway, planned projects can be launched.

|  Objectives to focus on in the next 2-3 years | Time period  |
| --- | --- |
|  Developing a participatory model for managing climate neutrality | 1 year  |
|  Incorporate climate neutrality actions into budgets/expenditure planning (municipality, municipal enterprises, businesses, households, other stakeholders) | 1-3 years  |
|  Develop detailed plans (e.g. a campaign) for engagement and awareness-raising activities | 1-2 years  |
|  Implement the preparatory actions necessary for major projects | 1-3 years  |
|  Implement the actions foreseen in the Action Plan within the next 1-3 years | 1-3 years  |

Residents are key to accelerated change, as they are targeted for actions that will make a significant contribution to reducing GHG emissions. Each individual citizen may contribute a small part to the climate neutrality goal, but the population as a whole is making a significant difference in a wide range of areas - energy systems, transport, circular economy. Residents also lead to community contributions, dissemination of information, demonstration of good practices and therefore have a significant influence in the context of engagement and awareness raising. Timely decisions and involvement of citizens in the implementation of actions lead to the possibility of accelerating the achievement of objectives. Given that a large part of the actions is co-financed by EU funds and the national budget, as well as the barriers identified at national level, the achievement of climate neutrality can be accelerated by the national authorities by taking the necessary decisions in a timely manner, considering the local needs, and responding quickly to the difficulties encountered. The third crucial group is business, as its decisions not only make a difference in the business field (green technologies, fossil fuel reduction, waste reduction, etc.), but also contribute to employee and customer engagement and awareness-raising. The Action Plan includes a number of targeted measures to engage these stakeholders.

# 4 Process and principles

Tauragė district municipality will use a systemic participatory governance model to achieve its climate neutrality targets by 2030. The newly developed governance model for climate neutrality is based on stakeholder cooperation and transparent decision-making. It provides for a clear division of responsibilities and cooperation mechanisms between different institutions and professionals, as well as regular consultation, discussion and reporting. The model has a two-tier governance model: the first tier consists of the Decarbonisation Coordination Group and the second tier consists of working groups.

The Tauragė district municipality Coordination Group will be composed of the EU Urban Mission Coordinator and the curators of 7 working groups: decarbonisation of transport, decarbonisation of energy, decarbonisation of waste, decarbonisation of land use, decarbonisation of business and investment, decarbonisation of social innovation, and the Future and Innovation Working Group. The work of the Coordination Group will ensure that all actions are coordinated and aligned with the objectives set, decisions are based on objective information and data, new initiatives and innovations are quickly integrated into the strategy, and risks are managed effectively, minimising potential negative impacts. The work of the Coordination Group will also help to foster a culture of cooperation between working groups and stakeholders, promoting efficient use of resources and sharing of knowledge and experience.

Working Groups are the main executive structures that coordinate the implementation of the Climate Neutrality Strategy, working with those responsible for implementing specific actions. They are made up of representatives of a wide range of stakeholders, including municipal administration, municipal companies, associations, NGOs and academic institutions. This diversity ensures that all sectors and interests are represented, and that the implementation of the strategy is as effective as possible.

The governance model provides for regular activities of the established working groups and the coordination group. The climate neutrality objective is launched with the establishment of a Coordination Group and Working Groups that will coordinate the implementation of actions in their assigned sectors. The Coordination Group and the Working Groups are expected to meet regularly to discuss progress and challenges (at least four meetings per year).

Each year, a review of progress will be carried out and a report produced. Each working group will provide a progress report on the actions planned and implemented under its responsibility. The monitoring indicators in the Action Plan will also be used to monitor progress. A Climate Neutrality Conference is planned to be organised each year, inviting not only members of the Coordination Group and the Working Groups, but also other interested parties. The conference will be open to all those interested and concerned about the topic of climate neutrality and progress towards the climate neutrality target.

The Action Plan and the Investment Plan will be adjusted each year on the basis of the results of the annual activities, the proposals of the working groups and the suggestions of stakeholders. These adjustments will aim at achieving the climate neutrality objective as quickly as possible, considering the current situation and responding in a timely manner to the circumstances.

The format of the Coordination Group and the Working Groups and the planned monitoring system, including annual conferences, allow for continuous learning, sharing of knowledge and experience, and continuous involvement of the members of the groups and other stakeholders in the process of improving the Strategy. The envisaged system also allows for the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders who are directly responsible for the implementation of the measures and who have an interest in climate neutrality, and who can contribute indirectly to the achievement of climate neutrality.

Guiding principles for the implementation of the Strategy:

**Transparency**: the aim is to ensure that all information related to the implementation of the Strategy is accessible to all interested parties.
**Accountability**: to ensure that all parties involved are held accountable for the implementation of the commitments made, and that timely and adequate information is provided on the progress of implementation of the actions and on the funds used.
**Co-creation**: the aim is to involve as many stakeholders as possible in the implementation and updating of the Strategy, so that climate neutrality becomes a common goal for all those who live and work in the Tauragė district municipality.
**Integrity**: The aim is to ensure that climate neutrality is integrated into planning, implementation, financing and other areas at different levels, across different sectors and areas of life.
**Continuous learning**: The Strategy aims to continuously improve the knowledge and skills of citizens, businesses, municipal authorities and other stakeholders in the field of climate neutrality, and to ensure the sharing of good practices.
