# Summary

## Textual element

This section summarizes the content of Gabrovo 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CCC Action Plan), which describes how the city emphasises the importance of achieving the 2030 climate neutrality target of the Cities Mission, and states the specific scope of the CCC Action Plan and how it builds on existing policy frameworks.

The climate action plan for Gabrovo follows a structured approach following the NZC templates with key components:

**Baseline Assessment (Part A):**
The climate action plan commences by evaluating greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) based on data from 2008. Between 2008 and 2018, Gabrovo successfully reduced GHG emissions by 32.9%. The ambitious target is to achieve an 80.5% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030
The remaining 20% of emissions are considered residual, and the municipality has developed a strategy to address them.

**Groundwork and Context (Part B):**
Gabrovo explores existing policies, plans, and projects related to climate change at local, national, and European levels. This provides an overview of past efforts and helps identify barriers and opportunities.
The focus is on both climate actions and their social dimensions.

**Theory of Change (Part B):**
Gabrovo outlines pathways for short- and long-term change, along with direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits). These impacts are associated with actions in various fields:
Energy systems and Built environment
Mobility and transport
Waste and circular economy
Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions

**Action Portfolio (Part B):**
The city tests actions – NETZEROHERO pilot project, including those already implemented and ambitious actions.
Stakeholders actively participate in implementing these actions.

**Indicators and Evaluation:**
Gabrovo develops indicators to measure and evaluate the impact of each action, considering whether it directly or indirectly contributes to climate neutrality.

**Complementary Actions (Part C):**
Part C describes governance, organizational, and social innovation actions already in place. These support the city's climate neutrality pathway by engaging stakeholders in the transition.

Gabrovo’s 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan aims to create a sustainable and resilient future by addressing climate challenges collaboratively.

Effective management of change is crucial for ensuring a smooth transition towards climate neutrality and minimizing resistance to these changes. It involves clear communication about the reasons for the shift, the benefits it will bring, and how it will be managed. This is where the role of the Transition Team becomes particularly important. The team is responsible for guiding the process, addressing concerns, and ensuring that all stakeholders are informed and engaged. By fostering a transparent and inclusive approach, the Transition Team helps build trust and commitment, paving the way for successful implementation of climate initiatives and governance changes necessary to achieve climate neutrality. However, CCC Action Plan is not just about achieving climate neutrality, but also about transforming Gabrovo into a sustainable city for future generations that is in alignment with the city's vision for the future. It's about making Gabrovo a leader in climate action and setting an example for other cities to follow. And most importantly, it's about ensuring a better, healthier, and more sustainable future for all.

The CCC Action Plan represents a significant step towards climate neutrality. However, the plan itself is just the beginning. The real challenge lies in its implementation. This requires substantial change management efforts, as it involves shifting existing practices, adopting new technologies, and changing mind-sets.

This Climate City Contract is a living and evolving document that seeks to establish the main objectives, priorities and key principles for achieving climate neutrality in the city of Gabrovo. In this way, it maintains the city's commitment to continue working and improving the plans and actions already underway.

# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

**Gabrovo's local geographic and policy context in the city's 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan**

Gabrovo's 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan encompasses a comprehensive range of actions across key focus areas. These include energy systems and the built environment, mobility and transport, waste management, circular economy initiatives, and the development of green infrastructure and nature-based solutions.

## Gabrovo in facts and figures

Gabrovo is a city located in North Central Bulgarian region, established in 1860. It is the administrative centre of Gabrovo municipality and Gabrovo district, which included 4 municipalities – Gabrovo, Sevlievo, Tryavna and Drianovo. Gabrovo municipality has a population of about 64 000 people on a territory of 555 sq. km. with 1 city and 133 villages. The city of Gabrovo is situated at the foot of the central Balkan Mountains, in the valley of the Yantra River. Gabrovo is known as the longest city in Bulgaria, stretching over 25 km along the Yantra River. The geographic centre of Bulgaria - Uzana - is located near the city. The territory of Gabrovo municipality is covered more than 50% by forests and it belongs to the important mountainous regions of Europe. Because of that Gabrovo is strongly affected by the climate change and important solutions has to be taken to become climate neutral.

During the Bulgarian Revival period, Gabrovo, known as the "Bulgarian Manchester," was home to the first Bulgarian secular school, Aprilov National School, founded in 1835. The city's strong educational traditions fostered innovation and entrepreneurship. Figures like Ivan Berov, dubbed "the Japanese of the Balkans," introduced electricity and other innovations, while Pencho Semov, known as the "Bulgarian Rockefeller," showcased entrepreneurial talent in Gabrovo.

Presently Gabrovo ranks second in Bulgaria in both economic and social development after Sofia – the Capital of Bulgaria. Gabrovo Province ranks fifth in GDP per capita, average income in the district is higher than the national average, and salaries have been rising at a stable rate. The most important industrial sectors are: mechatronics, robotics, electronics, machine building, and CNC equipment manufacturing, plastics and textile industry.

Gabrovo, with over 3500 companies, prioritizes sustainable economic development through its Smart Specialization Strategy focused on circular economy. More than 50% of these companies are export-oriented and advanced innovators, and the city is actively working on creating carbon-neutral industrial zones in collaboration with the business community.

Gabrovo faces significant climate-related challenges due to extreme weather events. Prolonged droughts followed by torrential rains and hail have caused severe damage to populations, farmers, businesses, and nature. Immediate and bold measures are crucial for Gabrovo to adapt to climate change. Recent data shows that the city's average annual temperature has risen by 1.3°C since 1961, with doubled hot days (temperatures exceeding 30°C). Precipitation patterns have shifted, resulting in more intense rainfall and less snowfall. By 2100, projections indicate a potential 3.9°C temperature increase, quadrupling hot days, an 11% decrease in precipitation, and complete snow cover loss. Indeed, the impact of climate change is far-reaching, affecting various aspects of our lives. Higher temperatures, droughts, and extreme weather events strain water resources, disrupt ecosystems, and challenge infrastructure resilience. Gabrovo's commitment to climate action is not only crucial for its own well-being but also contributes to the broader goal of achieving climate neutrality within the European Union.

Gabrovo, guided by the Climate City Contract (CCC), seeks to transform its approach by engaging with local, regional, and national stakeholders. The city's ambitious objective is to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. This collaborative effort aims to break down conventional silos and challenge business-as-usual practices.

The development of Gabrovo's 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan involved co-creation processes, engaging the mission Transition Team.

The recently established transition team in Gabrovo has played an active role in preparing the Climate City Contract (CCC). This team's creation marks a significant shift, breaking down silos on both administrative and organizational levels within the municipality. As a newly established structure, the transition team fosters collaboration and innovative approaches toward achieving climate neutrality by 2030.

Gabrovo's climate city ecosystem comprises of stakeholders from various sectors, expertise and level of influence, such as: locally - citizens, academia, schools, media; local and national level - business, NGOs, government - ministries and agencies, local municipal facilities. This new establishment has set the foot forward towards more inclusive and participatory citizenship practice.

The main goal of the Gabrovo CCC and SECAP is: Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 80.5% compared to 2008 levels and achieving climate neutrality by 2030. This ambitious target reflects the city's commitment to sustainability and climate neutrality.

# Gabrovo's Action Plan aligns with other Climate City Contract components:

Climate Neutrality Commitment: The Action Plan embodies the climate-neutrality ambition shared by the municipality and all stakeholders. It outlines specific actions to achieve climate neutrality, building upon existing efforts as stated in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitment.

Climate Neutrality Investment Plan: The Investment Plan closely relates to the Action Plan, assessing the feasibility and economic viability of defined actions. By mapping costs and necessary capital, the Investment Plan serves as a comprehensive long-term economic and financial strategy toward achieving climate neutrality by 2030. Gabrovo also intends to align existing climate action plans, projects, and strategies with the development and subsequent implementation of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.

Gabrovo aims to integrate elements from existing sources while developing its 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan. Similar to other European cities, Gabrovo focuses on strategies to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions across various areas: Energy&amp;Built environment (buildings), Waste&amp;Circular economy, Mobility&amp;Transport, Green infrastructure&amp;NBS (nature-base solutions).

The goal is to create a harmonious and coherent Action Plan that aligns with existing climate change initiatives aligned with Gabrovo Integrated Development Plan. By complementing measures already implemented, Gabrovo strives to achieve climate neutrality effectively.

The implementation of the activities set in the climate city contract for Gabrovo it is crucial to undertake capacity building in Bulgarian municipalities by improving the competencies of municipal employees in the field of climate change mitigation and adaptation.

This radical change in attitude towards global and local climate change requires an unprecedented effort to work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders to connect the interests and motivators of citizens, the private sector, academia and administrations in the city of Gabrovo while developing and implementing a comprehensive plan for climate neutrality.

Gabrovo is well known as one of the most proactive, innovative and entrepreneurial cities in Bulgaria with a rich history and vibrant culture.

# The Transition Team

The purpose of the Transition Team is to develop a new inclusive model for urban development by involving various stakeholders, ensuring transparency and information exchange at the concept development stage, and improving interaction to encourage civic participation in decision-making. The lessons learned, which were the driving force behind the formation of this team, underscore the importance of dialogic coordination, broad invitations for participation without exclusion, and engaging the local community in the use, implementation, and long-term sustainability of projects. Additionally, it is crucial to maintain structured processes with clear rules, distributed responsibilities, and tasks. Balancing formal and informal communication, utilizing unified portals for comprehensive and up-to-date information, simplifying project presentations for the general public, integrating communication channels, and disseminating timely information are also essential. These lessons highlighted the necessity for a dedicated team to address these aspects effectively.

# Structure and functions:

Management Board (MB): The functions of the MB is played by Gabrovo Council for Sustainable Urban Development, appointed by Order No. 1460 dated 22.07.2024.

The Management Board represents the four pillars of the quadruple helix governance model by comprising members from business, academia and research, government, and society (citizens). The stakeholders involved in the process and related to the Council of Urban Sustainable Development include local communities (citizens and/or their representatives), other municipalities, central executive authorities, regional authorities, the private sector, environmentalists and environmental protection organizations, trade unions and employer organizations, service providers (utilities), scientific and research organizations (universities), funding organizations, and the media.

The MB has supervisory functions and monitors the progress of the implementation of Gabrovo's CCC by observing the results of the agreement's monitoring. It evaluates the effectiveness of the work of the various departments in achieving the goals of Gabrovo CCC by 2030 and provides recommendations for improving their work. The MB convenes at least twice a year for organized meetings, either in person, online, or in a hybrid format to structure the processes in the creation, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of sustainable urban development policies at the local level, by concentrating and directing the efforts of stakeholders; increasing the efficiency of resource utilization and more successful implementation of Integrated Territorial Investments (ITI); strengthening the pluralistic approach in local governance. The Council of Sustainable Urban Development is a natural extension of the already established and implemented practices of the Municipality of Gabrovo. Since the early 2000s, the municipality has been organizing Climate and Energy Days in collaboration with Eneffect. These initiatives have laid a strong foundation for the Council's current efforts in promoting sustainable urban development and citizens' engagement.

Secretariat: Directorate for Sustainable Development, in collaboration with ICT Department and Gabrovo District Information Center (communicator).

The Secretariat organizes the work of the Transition Team of Gabrovo Municipality, including planning and organizing the schedule and meetings of the MB, as well as all operational meetings for the respective departments. It prepares the agenda and minutes of all meetings, publishes the results of the work on the Gabrovo CCC on the designated platform, invites participants to the meetings, and all stakeholders in the respective departments. It ensures the technical support for the meetings and assists and coordinates the work of the Transition Team, including all planned campaigns and seminars to enhance the capacity of the community, including citizens and businesses. It organizes the conduct and reporting of the results of the monitoring of Gabrovo CCC and their dissemination to the general public.

The rationale behind focusing on these five areas is Gabrovo’s extensive experience in these domains. The Gabrovo municipality has been engaged in projects within these areas for years, thereby accumulating substantial expertise and knowledge. This experience, coupled with the already achieved reductions in CO2 emissions and the implementation of new greenhouse gas (GHG) measures, underscores the municipality’s commitment to sustainable development towards climate neutrality by 2030. The Transition Team is divided by the areas of interventions in the focus of Gabrovo CCC, as follows:

Energy Systems &amp; Built environment (buildings and energy communities)
Mobility &amp; Transport
Waste &amp; Circular Economy
Green Infrastructure &amp; NBS
Public engagement

## THE CORE TEAM

Comprises accomplished experts from Gabrovo Municipality. Their primary responsibility is to coordinate the implementation of planned actions across all sectors of Gabrovo CCC. They will oversee and manage the established working groups, collaborating closely with appointed organizations and partners.

Gabrovo Transition Team operates under the leadership of Gabrovo Municipality and involves key directorates, including the Directorate for Infrastructure and Environment, the Directorate for Territorial Planning, and the Directorate for Education and Social Activities. These directorates play essential roles in coordinating and implementing climate action initiatives.

Communication efforts supporting the transition team’s work are overseen by an expert team within the transition team itself. This expert team is responsible for public engagement, capacity building, and organizing information campaigns.

The creation of the Gabrovo Transition Team was a collaborative effort, with strong partnerships and commitments from regional governmental institutions, the Technical University of Gabrovo, local companies, the Regional Innovation Center “Ambitious Gabrovo,” EnEffect Consult Sofia, Bulgarian ministries, and other interested parties.

Community development is a process where members come together to take collective action and generate solutions to common problems, often involving “capacity building” to improve the community. This process is similar to generalist social work practice models, which include steps such as exploration, engagement, assessment, planning, implementation, goal attainment, and termination. Implementing these initiatives is crucial for Gabrovo’s ambition to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. Engaging citizens through online platforms, surveys, and public forums ensures active community involvement in decision-making, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility towards climate action. Educational campaigns and integrating climate education into school curriculums raise awareness and instill sustainable practices from a young age. Encouraging community-led projects and collaborating with local businesses promote innovative and sustainable solutions, while regular updates and feedback mechanisms ensure transparency and continuous improvement. Together, these efforts create a cohesive and informed community dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving a sustainable future.

# 2 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

The city of Gabrovo is widely recognised in Bulgaria as front-runner on climate and energy topics and has pledged itself to lead on climate action, setting forth ambitious Goals and projects. Gabrovo has proved its place as an innovative, entrepreneurial, and industrious city through successful projects that managed to reduce CO2 eq emissions already by 32,9% until 2018. It has won a few accolades along the way: being a founder of the EcoEnergy municipal network in 1997, it became the first Bulgarian Municipality with an integrated system for street lighting back in 1998 and the first with energy efficiency demonstration zone in 2005. The city became member of the Covenant of Mayors in 2013, completed multiple projects in the framework of its SEAP, and won the European Green Leaf Award in 2021; in 2022, it won in the Green Municipality category in National Mayor Awards with its vision to become the first Bulgarian climate-neutral city.

The challenges however remain and even grow stronger, as despite the multiple projects in public infrastructure, the drive to engage residential and commercial building owners, involve enterprises and transform private transportation is becoming even more demanding due the overlapping energy and economy crises. The fight for every saved kilowatt-hour is getting harder, and the pressure from disinformation and rejection of European values is being felt deeper and deeper.

## 2.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

### GhG Emissions Baseline inventory

The Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan of Gabrovo Municipality by 2030 (SECAP) was developed in connection with the accession of the municipality, approved by Decision No 129 / 25.07.2013 of the Municipal Council - Gabrovo and the commitments to the Covenant of Mayors. The preparation of the SECAP is in line with all existing strategic and programming documents operating on the territory of the municipality and the goals set by the Covenant of Mayors by 2030. The plan has been developed in accordance with the guidelines set by the Covenant of Mayors.

To identify the best areas of action to reduce CO2 eq emissions by at least 40% by 2030, the SECAP uses the results of the 2008 Baseline CO2 eq Emission Inventory and the trend towards interim year 2018. In connection with the development of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, the greenhouse gas inventory was updated to include emissions from stationary sources in industry and the absorption of carbon dioxide by forests.

The GHG inventory has been developed according to the requirements of the Guidebook 'How to develop a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP)' PART 2 – Baseline Emission Inventory (BEI) and Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (RVA) and IPCC 2006.

The GHG inventory includes CO2 and CO2 equivalent emissions (emissions from electricity consumed, and CH4 emissions from the waste sector). Total emissions are expressed in CO2 equivalent with the application of GWP in accordance with the Fifth Assessment Report – IPCC.

The GHG inventory is presented in four main groups of sources:

Stationary combustion processes:
Municipal buildings, equipment/facilities
Municipal street lighting
Residential buildings
Tertiary (non-municipal) buildings, equipment/facilities
Industrial facilities

Mobile combustion processes

# A-1.5: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

As a result of targeted activities aimed at reducing the GHG emissions under the Convention of Mayors by a minimum of  $20\%$  by 2020 (according to SEAP - Gabrovo) and by a minimum of  $40\%$  by 2030 (SECAP - Gabrovo), the municipality has observed a trend in emissions reduction, as depicted in Figure 7.

Figure 7 also includes data from 2020, which was inventoried in accordance with the Covenant of Mayors. However, 2020 was not considered an interim year due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emissions.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 7: Trend of GHG emissions and percentage reduction for period 2008 - 2020

Data showed that emissions from all sectors in the Municipality of Gabrovo decreased, except for the transport sector.

The most significant percentage reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions occurred in the buildings and facilities sector. Specifically, emissions from stationary combustion processes decreased by an impressive  $48.1\%$ . Additionally, the waste sector saw a substantial reduction of  $37.8\%$  in emissions. These positive trends reflect our commitment to sustainable practices and environmental stewardship

In the buildings and facilities sector, industrial facilities and residential buildings are the primary sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Meanwhile, in the transport sector, private and commercial transportation significantly contribute to emissions.

from solid and liquid fossil fuels, as well as electricity, and adopting natural gas and biofuels, we've further curbed emissions. Similarly, the decrease in GHG emissions from public lighting can be attributed to a reduction in the emission factor for electricity. These efforts align with our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility.

Tertiary buildings

The reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from tertiary buildings primarily results from energy efficiency measures and the transition to lower-emission fuels. Specifically: Energy Efficiency Measures: Implementing energy-saving practices in tertiary buildings has led to a decrease in overall energy consumption. Transition to Lower-Emission Fuels: By shifting away from solid and liquid fossil fuels and increasing the use of natural gas and biofuels, we've effectively curbed emissions. These efforts align with our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility

Residential buildings

The reduction of GHG emissions in residential buildings is mainly due to the energy efficiency measures and transition to using lower emission fuels. A decrease in the total energy used, reduced consumption of solid fossil fuels, and increased consumption of natural gas and biofuels is observed.

The reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from residential buildings can be attributed to energy efficiency measures and the transition to lower-emission fuels. Specifically: Implementing energy-saving practices in residential buildings has led to a decrease in overall energy consumption.

By shifting away from solid fossil fuels and increasing the use of natural gas and biofuels, we've effectively curbed emissions.

Industrial facilities

The reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in industrial facilities primarily results from energy efficiency measures, modernization, and the transition to lower-emission fuels. As total energy consumption decreases, solid and liquid fossil fuels as well as electricity usage are reduced, while natural gas, LPG, and biofuel consumption increase.

Transport

Municipal fleet of vehicles

The rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from municipal vehicle fleets primarily results from the heightened overall fuel consumption, particularly of diesel fuel.

Public Transportation

The rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from public transportation primarily results from the heightened overall fuel consumption, particularly of diesel fuel

Private and Commercial Transportation

The reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from private and commercial transportation primarily results from the overall decrease in fuel consumption, particularly diesel fuel. Despite a 14.2% increase in diesel fuel consumption, there was a corresponding 33.5% decrease in gasoline consumption.

Waste

Gabrovo has taken proactive measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by preventing waste formation, promoting changes in public attitudes, and implementing high-quality separate waste collection, reuse, and recycling practices. The initiation of the 'Construction of a Regional Waste

The Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) for Gabrovo Municipality, developed in alignment with the Covenant of Mayors, outlines specific measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 40% by 2030. Based on an inventory of CO₂ eq emissions from 2008 to 2018, SECAP identifies key areas for action and sets clear reduction targets, timeframes, and responsibilities.

The SECAP builds upon existing GHG reduction efforts while introducing new initiatives, including:

Restricting the use of high-emission solid fuels and heating appliances.
Upgrading municipal buildings to achieve maximum energy efficiency, with new constructions meeting nearly zero-energy standards.
Installing renewable energy systems (RES) in renovated municipal buildings and implementing monitoring mechanisms for RES production and consumption.
Renovating residential buildings to higher energy efficiency classes (A and B).
Encouraging efficiency improvements in existing residential and commercial buildings, including the construction of zero-energy and energy-positive structures.
Piloting projects for zero-energy and energy-positive buildings.
Transitioning to LED street lighting.
Enhancing source-separated municipal solid waste (MSW) collection, bio-waste utilization, and underground waste collection.
Additionally, composting biodegradable waste and using the resulting compost in erosion-prone areas, parks, and gardens.
Establishing a carbon-neutral industrial zone.

Particular attention is paid to the transport sector, where growth in GHG emissions is reported. It is envisaged: gradual replacement of the public transport fleet with electric and CNG and of the fleet of intra-departmental transport with electric transport; encouraging the use of electric vehicles in private and commercial transport; creation of zones with limited access of cars and expansion of the zones for paid parking and the rules for their use; regulatory framework supporting the construction of charging stations for electric cars, etc.

The SECAP introduces adaptation measures to the CC, with the measures envisaged aimed at:

Connection with the city center and urban landscaping through separate green wedges, river valleys, eco-trails, bicycle and other tourist routes.
The long-term tree vegetation in the urban environment, protection and improvement of its condition, compensatory landscaping and development of a list of tree species suitable for landscaping within the municipality of Gabrovo, taking into account the expected future climatic conditions. Exploring the possibility of storing rainwater and using it to irrigate city parks and gardens, as well as to build boreholes for the same purpose.
Maintaining the conductivity of the riverbeds and creating and maintaining a public flood register on the territory of Gabrovo Municipality.
Introduction of highly effective fire protection systems in the building stock and facilities.
Forest areas, abandoned agricultural land, forests and eroded and threatened by erosion areas, protection and improvement of the condition of suburban parks, etc.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

In this section of Gabrovo CCC AP the impact pathways based on the planned areas of interventions are described. I fact there are 5 main sectors choozen for interactions based on the needs and plans of Gabrovo Municipality till 2030, alreday included in the scope Gabrovo Integrated Development Plan and related to its sectoral substrategies. In this CCC AP the sector of Energy Systems is merged with the sector Built environment, because most of the interventions on energy systems are included in buildings reconstruction and renovation. Also the renovation of industrial buildings and facilities are included in this sector. The most important measure in Energy System and Built Environment sector are focused on public and private buildings' renovation and RES installations.

The sector Mobility and Transport will implement actions related to electrification of public and private transport, and development of a sustainable mobility through construction of new cycling lanes, efficient traffic management and control.

The Sector Waste and Circular economy is choozen because of the long experience of Gabrovo as an industrial center and its efforts to establish a regional innovation valley in Circularity together with Technical University of Gabrovo, Regional Innovation Center and advanced innovative companies. The actions in this sector will try to reduce and re-use waste both by companies and citizens, through separation of waste, smart waste management system, new underground bins' sites, trying to achieve zero waste.

The Green infrastructure and NBS are part of Gabrovo adaptation strategy to climate change and though this area of interventions an improvement of green areas by implementation of NBSs is planned in this CCC AP.

# Energy systems &amp; Built environment

The building stock, constructed between 1960 and 1970, exhibits reduced energy efficiency. Many residents rely on outdated heating systems that use high-emission fuels, largely due to their lower socioeconomic status. Consequently, the municipality's efforts are directed towards:

Transforming Energy Systems and Built Environment - Integrating renewable energy, sustainable design, energy efficiency, and green infrastructure for a sustainable urban future.

Renewable Energy Integration - Incorporating solar and other renewable sources to power buildings and infrastructure, reducing carbon footprint and dependence on fossil fuels.

Sustainable Building Design - Implementing eco-friendly materials, efficient layouts, and green technologies to enhance energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact in construction projects.

Energy Efficiency Measures - Adopting smart technologies, energy management systems, and insulation practices to optimize energy use and minimize wastage in buildings and urban facilities.

# Mobility &amp; transport

A substantial portion of the vehicle fleet is outdated, as indicated by Bulgarian statistics. Therefore, the municipality's efforts are focused on:

Transforming Urban Mobility: A Sustainable Future - Innovative public transportation, cycling infrastructure, and electric vehicle adoption are shaping the future of urban mobility towards sustainability and efficiency.

Public Transportation Expansion - Investments in expanding public transportation networks improve access, reduce congestion, and lower carbon emissions in cities.

Cycling Infrastructure Development - Developing safe and connected cycling infrastructure promotes active transportation, reduces pollution, and enhances quality of life for urban residents.

Electric Vehicle Adoption - The adoption of electric vehicles contributes to cutting emissions, decreasing reliance on fossil fuels, and advancing sustainable transportation in cities.

# Waste &amp; circular economy

Gabrovo Municipality operates a two-component system (biodegradable and recyclable) for the separate collection of household waste, supplemented by systems for collecting packaging waste, textile waste, and annual campaigns for the disposal of specific waste types. Additionally, there are provisions for the free disposal of sorted construction and bulky waste.

However, the municipality has identified several shortcomings in waste management, including outdated and inefficient equipment and mechanization for waste collection, as well as a lack of understanding among some residents about the importance of separate waste disposal. Despite an increase in inquiries from citizens regarding the disposal of hazardous, construction, or bulky waste, there is still room for improvement in this area. The rate of separate waste collection remains insufficiently high, and the current waste fee system does not incentivize proper waste segregation.

Consequently, the municipality's efforts will be focused on:

Efficient Waste Management Strategies - Implementing innovative waste management strategies is crucial for reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainability in urban areas.

Optimizing Waste Collection Systems - Utilizing smart technology and data analytics can streamline waste collection routes, leading to cost savings and improved efficiency in waste management processes.

Promoting Source Separation Practices - Encouraging residents and businesses to separate recyclables from general waste at the source can increase recycling rates and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills.

## B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

The Residual emissions will be compensated through offsetting, as well as regular reviews of the planned actions and policies to ensure their impact is enhanced.

Municipalities can participate in offsetting through: purchasing carbon credits – financing projects for renewable energy, reforestation, waste management, or energy efficiency; developing local projects – investing in green infrastructure projects at the local level, such as reforestation, renewable energy, or energy efficiency programs; partnering with other organizations – collaborating with national or international offsetting programs.

Particular attention will be given to CO2 absorption by forests, which amounted to 41,088 tons of CO2 in 2018. It should be noted that the additional measures and policies in the waste sector have not yet been evaluated, which will also contribute to covering the Residual emissions.

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

Achieving Climate Neutrality by 2030 aims to detail the initiatives that the Municipality of Gabrovo has already implemented in terms of organizational, governance, and social innovation. This important event plays a crucial role in transforming commitments and portfolio actions into reality, thereby achieving climate neutrality by 2030. As of April 2024, the Municipality of Gabrovo has established a new Sustainable Development Directorate to lead the change as a representative of the municipal network.

Gabrovo, guided by the Climate City Contract (CCC), seeks to transform its approach by engaging with local, regional, and national stakeholders. The city's ambitious objective is to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. This collaborative effort aims to break down conventional silos and challenge business-as-usual practices.

The development of Gabrovo's 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan involved co-creation processes, engaging the mission of the Transition Team. The recently established transition team in Gabrovo has played an active role in preparing the Climate City Contract (CCC). This team's creation marks a significant shift, breaking down silos on both administrative and organizational levels within the municipality. As a newly established structure, the transition team fosters collaboration and innovative approaches toward achieving climate neutrality by 2030.

Gabrovo actively participates in European initiatives and holds distinguished membership in EU bodies related to governance and climate change. As part of the "Covenant of Mayors" initiative, Gabrovo commits to regular inventories of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, following the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. These inventories cover $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CH}_4$ emissions, with 2008 as the base year, and are conducted biennially across the entire administrative boundary of Gabrovo municipality. The strategic documents of Gabrovo, including the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), play a crucial role in supporting the CCC 2030 Gabrovo Plan. Here's how they align and contribute:

The SECAP outlines specific actions to reduce CO2 eq emissions by at least $40\%$ by 20301. This aligns with the CCC 2030 Gabrovo Plan's broader goals of achieving significant greenhouse gas reductions.

Both the SECAP and the CCC 2030 Plan adopt an integrated approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation. This means they not only focus on reducing emissions but also on enhancing the city's resilience to climate impacts.

The SECAP provides a framework for monitoring and implementing the outlined actions, ensuring that progress is tracked and adjustments are made as needed. This systematic approach supports the CCC 2030 Plan's objectives by ensuring accountability and continuous improvement.

Both plans emphasize the importance of engaging local communities and stakeholders in the planning and implementation process. This ensures that the actions taken are inclusive and have broad support, which is essential for long-term success.

Gabrovo effectively implements EU and national strategies, plans, and directives, which are integrated into the SECAP, SEAP, and other relevant strategic documents. These efforts support the CCC 2030 Gabrovo Plan, driving the city towards a more sustainable and resilient future. Gabrovo distinguishes itself among Bulgarian municipalities through proactive energy efficiency and smart city projects. Guided by its Integrated Development Plan 2027, SECAP 2030, SUMP 2030, and S3 2030, Gabrovo takes an integrated approach to sustainable development. The city embraces innovative solutions, adopts clean technologies, and collaborates with local businesses, academia, and civic sectors following the quadruple-helix principle. Gabrovo's vision revolves around being green, innovative, and smart, fostering sustainable economic growth and an environmentally conscious transition.

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

The governance participation of Gabrovo CCC is designed to be inclusive and transparent:

Gabrovo's CCC aims to foster collaboration and co-creation among stakeholders to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. A key principle of this plan is transparency and accountability, ensuring that decision-makers are held responsible for their actions and that these decisions are openly discussed and reported. To ensure transparency, the Municipality of Gabrovo will publicly share information about its climate actions, including decisions, implementation measures, and results. This will enable citizens and stakeholders to stay informed and contribute to the goal of climate neutrality. CCC plan emphasizes inclusivity and diversity, ensuring that all citizens, regardless of age, gender, education, place of residence, or socioeconomic status, have an opportunity to participate. The process will be designed to be accessible to all interested individuals, avoiding any form of discrimination or harassment

## Gabrovo CCC's Co-Creative Process

Gabrovo's Co-Creative Process exemplifies the city's innovative approach to fostering collaboration and creativity within its vibrant landscape through the following activities:

Workshops and Brainstorming Sessions: Regularly organized to gather ideas from diverse community members through events such as energy community, meetings of the private property owners, meetings of the Council for Sustainable urban development that comprises of various members of society – administrative bodies, academia, business, NGOs – RIC "Ambicious Gabrovo" is especially prominent for the city as it brings together academia, business and administration together to tackle and work on issues and projects.
Collaborative Projects: continue project work that involves citizens, local organizations and municipal experts on projects pertaining to culture, sustainable governance, mobility and energy efficiency, also adapting to climate changes that has commenced last year for the municipality of Gabrovo. Projects that Gabrovois involed in like Amigos, Mount resilience, Soteria work with a broad stakeholder groups from the community comprising of members of - TU Gabrovo, RIC Ambitious Gabrovo, Regional governor's office, Energo pro- local energy supplier, VIK - local water management company, Fire department, Police department, MBAL Tota Venkova - regional hospital, National statistics institute, Municipal enterprise for public works, Insurance companies, Smart behavior - specializing in human behavior and change, and others.
Feedback Mechanisms: Continuous collection of feedback through surveys, public forums, and social media that has been an ongoing practice for Municipality of Gabrovo. Apart from the websites for events that take place – chistogarovo.bg; uzana polyanafest; radio programmes, FB page, Gabrovo has created a new platform dedicated specifically for projects on climate change and adapting to it. It is called FORUM. It is expected to be launched in the fall 2024.

## Engaging Citizens

Engaging the community is a cornerstone of the CCC's mission. This is achieved through:

Public Events: Gabrovo is hosting a variety of events such as festivals, concerts, and art exhibitions that are open to all throughout the year. There are seasonal festivals that take place

Green Infrastructure&amp; Nature base solutions
#

GABROVO

MUNICIPALITY

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Each of these domains will be led by a designated expert representative, who will oversee their domain team on issues specific to their area of expertise and relevant stakeholders. These representatives will

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

be responsible for organizing and implementing initiatives within their respective domains, while also maintaining regular communication with the Council for Sustainable Urban Development and the Directorate for Sustainable Development. Each domain plays a vital role in Gabrovo's sustainable transformation and contributes to its specific goals.

Each domain will collaborate with relevant stakeholders to address specific issues and implement initiatives. These (micro) teams are accountable to the Council for Sustainable Urban Development and in communication with the Secretariat of Gabrovo's Transition team. (See page 11)

To ensure transparency, the Municipality of Gabrovo publicly shares information

about its climate actions, including decisions, measures, and results. This allows citizens and stakeholders to stay informed and contribute to the goal of carbon neutrality.

Gabrovo's CCC emphasizes on inclusivity and diversity, ensuring that all citizens, regardless of age, gender, education, place of residence, or socioeconomic status, have an opportunity to participate.

The process aims to be accessible to all interested individuals, avoiding any form of discrimination or harassment. Gabrovo has a long history of involving citizens in the process of shaping their community. This tradition of citizen participation is essential for achieving climate neutrality by 2030.

Social responsibility and inclusion is of paramount importance for reaching our climate goals. Gabrovo Municipality has a long history of citizens' engagement and thus continues to work on projects while

seeking active citizen involvement, working collaboratively with local stakeholders to create systemic change.

The Municipality of Gabrovo is actively working to empower its citizens and foster a sense of belonging and responsibility for climate-related issues. They have established several points of contact between citizens and local government actors, including, but not limited to the following parties:

District Information Point: A one-stop shop for information and assistance.
RIC Ambitious Gabrovo: A resource centre for climate initiatives and smart specialization.
Monthly Vending Machine Events: Regular events to engage the community.
Planned and Ad Hoc Meetings: Opportunities for open dialogue and collaboration on everyday climate-related issues, such as waste disposal.
Open door policy - Additionally, Gabrovo has an open-door policy, allowing citizens to call, visit, or receive advice on their issues via phone or personal visits to the municipality. Citizens can also book meetings with the mayor during regular open days.

This proactive approach aims to create a collaborative environment where citizens feel involved and responsible for addressing climate challenges in their community.

The processes of informing, monitoring and joint learning are crucial to ensure that climate actions are on track. However, this can be challenging due to the diverse range of stakeholders involved and the focus on individual and corporate actions. To address these challenges, the municipality will prioritize inclusivity in citizen participation measures, ensuring that underrepresented groups, including those from different age, gender, ethnic, religious, and minority backgrounds, are represented.

Joint learning provides a valuable platform for sharing knowledge and experiences among stakeholders and the community. By integrating a citizen-centered approach in the already established bureaucratic one, Gabrovo aims to set a new and innovative way for citizens inclusion in the decision making. As clarified in the action plan, the decision making process for municipality of Gabrovo is oftentimes burdensome as it involves approval by the city council. Any decision that pertains to a new activity, project and or practice, and financing has to go through the city council's approval.

Gabrovo's City Council is responsible for a wide range of activities that shape the community, namely:

Urban Development: They oversee the planning and development of infrastructure projects, including roads, public buildings, and parks.
Public Services: This includes waste management, water supply, and public transportation.
Education and Culture: They support local schools, libraries, and cultural institutions, organizing events and programs to enrich community life.
Economic Development: The council works to attract businesses and investments to the area, fostering economic growth and job creation.
Environmental Initiatives: They implement policies and projects aimed at sustainability and environmental protection.

For the Gabrovo CCC and its strategic implementation an array of various stakeholders from municipality – administrative and other departments, the Council for sustainable urban development, actors from municipal enterprises will be involved. But also service staff, including transport, waste management actors, universities, schools, national actors, and the industrial sector, will be involved in the process. Given the significant contributions of the transport, mobility, and industrial sectors to Gabrovo's emissions, the city will prioritize their involvement in assessing and implementing measures

to bridge the gap towards climate neutrality. Technical meetings with sector leaders and dynamic sessions will be held to explore innovative approaches and inspire systemic, demand-driven actions.

By adopting a collaborative and inclusive approach, Gabrovo aims to create a sustainable and resilient future for its citizens and communities.

Being one of the most proactive Bulgarian municipalities, Gabrovo also strongly relies on the good cooperation with different levels of governance, including regional, national and European. National level policies and actions support capital allocation towards net zero also in the cities, but the long political crisis became the main barrier to access the available funding on time and to implement the planned activities and projects.

Citizen involvement is crucial for the achievement of the CCC goals. Engaging residents directly in different activities, including design and implementation, guarantees their active participation in the initiatives. Through these strategies of citizen engagement, the objective is to provide meaningful opportunities for residents to connect with the narrative and purpose of the CCC actions, in order to enhance the collective understanding, enable co-creation process, stimulate ownership of the Gabrovo climate policies, and incentivize local investments within a citizens engagement strategy will be developed under NetZero Hero project. The strategy for citizen participation will include several important components: Community surveys; Co-creation workshops; Pilot Projects and Demonstrations; Capacity Building and Training for citizens; and Community Outreach and Awareness Campaign.

Gabrovo is committed to achieving climate neutrality by leveraging the expertise and tools provided by administrative, financial, citizen, and academic institutions. By working closely with all citizens, Gabrovo ensures that its efforts align with the city's vision of being clean, green, smart, and sustainable, while adhering to the principle of "no one is left behind."

Gabrovo will prioritize citizens' involvement in assessing and implementing measures to bridge the gap towards climate neutrality. Technical meetings and dynamic sessions will be held to explore innovative approaches and inspire systemic, demand-driven actions.

By adopting a collaborative and inclusive approach, Gabrovo aims to create a sustainable and resilient future for its citizens and communities.

However to accurately depict the reality of Gabrovo in terms of public works, decision-making, governance, and authority, it is essential to clarify the following:

Any financial or significant decision concerning the city of Gabrovo must receive mandatory approval from the City Council, covering both budgetary and decision-making aspects. Additionally, all procedures related to these decisions must comply with public procurement regulations, ensuring transparency, fairness, and adherence to legal standards. This process can sometimes require technical time to pass the vote and come into effect.

Despite the constraints of a limited municipal budget and various challenges Gabrovo faces in terms of centralised budget and governmental beaurocratic deays, Gabrovo has managed to secure a high percentage of European and national funds for its projects. In comparison to other Bulgarian municipalities, Gabrovo has also provided a significant rate of co-funding from the municipal budget to continue its improvements in all sectors, as mentioned in the Gabrovo CCC AP.

Gabrovo is committed to achieving climate neutrality and has implemented a comprehensive action plan. To ensure the success of this ambitious goal, the city has adopted several key strategies

Transparency and Accountability: To ensure transparency and accountability in the implementation of the CCC, Gabrovo has established regular monitoring and reporting mechanisms. These mechanisms provide stakeholders and the public with timely updates on the progress of climate initiatives, fostering trust and ensuring that the city remains accountable to its commitments.

Stakeholder Engagement: The co-creation process of the CCC involves active participation from all relevant stakeholders. This engagement ensures that the diverse perspectives and expertise of local government, businesses, academia, and civil society are integrated into the CCC. By involving stakeholders in the planning and execution phases, Gabrovo enhances the relevance and acceptance of its climate policies.

Citizens' Involvement: Citizens play a crucial role in the co-creation process of the CCC. They contribute ideas, feedback, and support for climate actions through public consultations and participatory workshops, studies and activities. This inclusive approach ensures that the voices of the community are heard and considered, fostering a sense of ownership and commitment to the city's climate goals.

Iterative Learning: The CCC is designed as a living document that evolves based on continuous learning and feedback from stakeholders. This iterative process will allow Gabrovo to identify and address obstacles, ensuring that the CCC remains relevant and effective over time. By embracing a culture of continuous improvement, the city can adapt to new challenges and opportunities in its pursuit of climate neutrality.

# C-1.2: Description of organisation and governance interventions

The Municipality of Gabrovo has a strong commitment to achieve efficacy and cohesion within its departments and new structure, enabling the formulation of projects that link different divisions and disciplines. The Transition Team formed for the mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" is an example of this. It includes members from various department across all levels of expertise of the city administration, as well as from the transport and mobility, environmental and circular economy, intelligent systems, and the economic and territory development.

The team also comprises of members from NGOs, business, municipal and local enterprises.

Some of the stakeholders in this huge undertaking are longstanding partners of the municipality on projects that are focused on climate change, environmental education, and biodiversity, smart systems.

The Municipality of Gabrovo has set targets to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of multilevel governance for climate neutrality by maintaining and implementing action plans at the local level that are aligned with national and EU decarbonisation targets. Gabrovo will continue to engage in European and national networks (e.g. Energicities, Civitas, URBACT, Netzerocities) to share best practices and knowledge. Regular dialogue with national and EU decision-makers will ensure that community needs and perspectives are considered in high-level decision-making processes.

The governance measures outlined in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan include the governance initiatives from the NZC Pilot Cities Programme (NETZEROHERO) and the successful initiative set to be implemented in the municipality of Gabrovo that have demonstrated their positive impact on the local community from September 2024 onwards.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

Gabrovo's 2030 plan is aligned with EU and national plans, strategies, and programmes for climate neutrality. It also incorporates all strategic documents of the Municipality of Gabrovo, ensuring a comprehensive and cohesive approach to achieving climate neutrality by 2030. Citizen participation is a critical component of Gabrovo's climate agenda. Collaboration with various levels of government, citizens, and different stakeholders will be critical for accelerating the transition to climate neutrality by 2030.

The National Action Plan for Climate Change Adaptation serves as a reference document, determining key guidelines for climate change adaptation actions in several key areas. The plan also contains an evaluation of 55 risks and vulnerabilities across 9 different sectors. The "Integrated Energy and Climate Plan of the Republic of Bulgaria" sets priorities for energy sector development and climate change mitigation. The plan's general objectives are to stimulate the development of a low-carbon emission and sustainable economy, achieve national energy independence, decrease fossil fuel imports, and ensure affordable energy. The plan sets two key national targets for the year 2030: a minimum of 28% of all electricity consumption in the country to come from renewable energy sources and a minimum of 32% overall energy consumption decrease.

The "National Long-Term Strategy for Building Renovation 2050" and the "National Plan for Nearly Zero Energy Buildings" set the target for all new buildings and renovated existing ones to become nearly zero energy. All key measures and actions in the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) relevant to this sector are in correspondence with this plan. The "National Recovery and Resilience Plan" will be an important strategic document setting objectives for a low-carbon economy, biodiversity conservation, sustainable agriculture, and measures such as establishing a National Decarbonisation Fund and assessing energy poverty.

The municipality has been using diverse methods for raising awareness and improving the level of citizen engagement: a one-stop-shop for energy advisory; organizing annual campaigns (spring clean ups, waste collection for raising funds for charity, Eco festival 'Uzana Polyana Fest, Earth Day and Environment Day), ad-hoc events and initiatives, using different communication channels (manuals, online platforms, radio broadcasts about Ecology, games, competitions, discussions, forums etc.).

Gabrovo has numerous initiatives targeting the youth (educational campaigns on waste in schools, thematic theatre plays for children about waste).

The online platform chisto.gabrovo.bg provides thorough and regularly updated information about the waste separation, collection and management and greening activities of the municipality. Green.gabrovo.bg provides real-time monitoring of air and water quality.

The museum House of Humour and Satire is an important partner in the process of citizen engagement on the topic of sustainability. It regularly organizes different art and cultural events (City Garden installation for children, 'Art at the landfill') in collaboration with the Regional Waste management site, portraying waste as a valuable resource. The continuation and broadening of all those actions is crucial for Gabrovo's transition to climate neutrality and they can also serve as good examples for other cities.

The most important initiatives related to citizens' engagement are the following but not limited to:

# Multi-family buildings' retrofitting

Gabrovo Municipality has extensive experience in collaborating with citizens on retrofitting multi-family buildings since 2016. Between 2016 and 2018, Gabrovo Municipality actively participated in the National Program for Energy Efficiency in multifamily buildings. As a result, 37 multi-family buildings were retrofitted, amounting to €19,940,000 (100% grant). A total of 242 buildings were included in the program for renovation. Implementing energy efficiency measures in all residential buildings is a crucial step towards decarbonisation and will also help reduce energy poverty.

#

In 2023, the Bulgarian Recovery and Resilience Plan provided another opportunity for retrofitting multifamily buildings. Gabrovo Municipality prepared 200 multi-family buildings to apply, with 100 effectively applying and 24 being approved for funding.

Citizen engagement was the most important factor for success. To support citizen participation, the Gabrovo Municipality team sent invitations to the managers (representatives) of the associations of owners of independent units in the condominium regime. Meetings were held at the Municipality of Gabrovo building with several representatives from the respective buildings. This approach aimed to limit large gatherings while avoiding unnecessary conflicts.

To avoid pushing people away due to a lack of clarity, Gabrovo Municipality began with larger buildings, giving them more time to prepare and discuss the new, albeit still unclear, conditions. During the meetings, contacts of municipal administration employees and more active owners (regardless of their role in building management) were exchanged to act as mediators. This led to the creation of a contact list of emails, to which additional information regarding the possibilities and administrative procedures for preparation was sent.

The information provided aimed to prepare the associations so they would be ready and, in the absence of building selection criteria, be among the first to open a measure. Briefly, the information covered eligible buildings, application conditions (such as the availability of a Technical Passport, a technical survey, and an Energy Efficiency Audit), the limited resources from the Bulgarian Recovery and Resilience Plan, and the understanding that not all waiting buildings would be rehabilitated, nor were they preferred. Information was also provided about the essence of the mentioned documents and the process of their preparation.

As a result of these meetings, a community was built between the citizens and the administration, facilitating subsequent communication on energy efficiency and other topics such as energy communities, renewable energy sources, and opportunities to participate in various projects and initiatives with the support of the Municipality of Gabrovo or other interested parties.

The identified obstacles to the associations are the permanent absence of owners and uninhabited objects in the buildings, and the neighbors have no contacts, which is an obstacle in the convening and holding of the meetings (quorum and majority), as well as subsequently in the implementation of the activities themselves.

The main goal of Gabrovo CCC AP is to establish tools and framework to build stakeholder capacity, promote collaboration, tailor approaches to local contexts and monitor progress for effective dissemination and replication.

# Energy communities - new models for public-private partnership between local authorities and citizens

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

In the implementation of the initiative to create an energy community, the municipality of Gabrovo follows its established model in conducting a campaign to engage citizens as follows:

During the introductory/initial presentation of the initiative, in order to reach a wide

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

range of interested persons, various mass communication channels are used, through which the information about the respective initiative is provided in a synthesized and conceptual way already at the stage of its development. In the energy community project,

months before the decision was made to issue a call to citizens, the National Radio, a podcast in the "CAPITAL" media, inclusions in the local radio and publications in various media were used to inform the citizens. In this way, a wide range of people is reached, the problems, the idea and the vision for the future implementation of a specific project or initiative are presented to them.

Passing through this stage allows the inclusion of persons with knowledge and interest in the field to contribute to the realization of the project through direct participation with ideas, experience and knowledge, as well as through its dissemination. In the specific case, after mass awareness, nongovernmental organizations, technical persons who, through their questions and expressed opinions, contribute to the development of the project. It also prepares both those who want to get involved as participants in the energy community and the business to meet the needs for the implementation of the initiative.

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

The next level of engagement is when shaping a concrete concept and reaching an administrative, technical and financial level of readiness to share it with a smaller circle of interested persons. The process becomes more dialogic by organizing meetings with citizens, which are again aimed at reaching a wide range of interested persons, but already answering specific questions. At this stage, instruments like conferences, workshops, meetings, discussions and others are used. The use of online communication tools helps to reach a wider range of people. The

main task at this stage is to finalize the concept, to give the project its final form, but also to reach the persons who would actually participate in the implementation of the initiative.

After the project is in the final stage, direct involvement of the citizens is started, by providing opportunities for direct communication - face to face, with the relevant experts, both through the
#

GABROVO

MUNICIPALITY

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

existing one-stop-shop and through direct communication by phone, e-mails and others directly with the responsible experts.

At this stage, binding contracts, commitments and other - in the specific case - contract for participation in the energy community are also signed.

After the implementation of the project/initiative, communication regarding the specific project takes place in a relatively closed circle - between the participants. But instead, in order to replicate the project and upgrade it, the results of it are communicated to the rest of the citizens. In this way, commitment and readiness is achieved when identifying an opportunity for the next initiative.

"Days of Intelligent Energy"- is an event and an informational platform carried out for several years in Gabrovo municipality. Its goal was to engage and educate citizens about the positive impacts and importance of implementing energy efficiency solutions for the environment and for their everyday lives. The platform also had a strong focus on students and children of all ages. It also gave the municipality the opportunity to showcase its latest energy efficiency projects to citizens.

An association of local businesses established the Regional Innovation Centre "Ambitious Gabrovo" with the goal to develop and maintain a sustainable and evolving innovation ecosystem with a focus on digitalization, Industry 4.0 and the circular economy, thus strengthening the competitiveness of companies in the region, creating, and supporting talent. Four main directions will be developed - talent incubator, automation systems, technologies and circular economy.

The municipality became an active partner with TU Gabrovo, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the Centre for energy efficiency 'Eneffect' for EE research and solution implementation.

Gabrovo is a partner in numerous R&amp;I projects under different programmes (e.g. Horizon 2020 Programme).

One of the projects - Science with and for Society (2018-2020), TeRRitoria (Territorial Responsible Research and Innovation) focuses on strengthening the collaboration between TU Gabrovo and the local business.

Under OP "Science and Education for Smart Growth" in TU Gabrovo Centre for Competences "Intelligent Mechatronic, Eco and Energy saving systems" has been established. The Centre comprises 4 laboratories equipped with modern science infrastructure with high-tech equipment. The equipment will be used for applied science studies in the field of mechatronics and clean technologies, as well as education. The facilities will be accessible for the business organisations and part of them will be accredited.

# Waste&amp; circular economy

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

It is important to note that underground waste facilities were first introduced in Gabrovo in 2019 for residential buildings, and this trend has been gradually expanding to other areas of the city. In 2020 textile and leather waste material bins were positioned in a few places in Gabrovo. In 2022, a new set of underground waste facilities was introduced as a pilot project for smart underground containers for household waste in the central part of the city. This project was introduced to a residential area in Gabrovo where each family had an individual access to the waste facility. The facilities were equipped with access

control systems, video surveillance and a network of smart sensors which will provide occupancy levels, frequency of use and number of services statistics compiled by the smart sensor based

programme 'LoRanetwork'. The project was the first step towards the introduction of smart underground waste collection in the municipality. Also in 2022 a pilot demonstration project for a deposit vending system for plastic bottles and aluminum cans was launched in Gabrovo. The project aims to increase the amount of collected clean recyclable material and to encourage citizens to undertake further efforts for waste separation. In return for the deposited bottles and cans, citizens received eco-friendly gifts and a number of incentives, including food vouchers, monthly transport card, and other items or services. The project proved to be a success in our community so far.

Additionally in 2017 Gabrovo launched an initiative for separate collection of biodegradable waste from restaurants and shops by providing individual containers and using the waste for compost creation. The system has expanded and now more and more restaurant and shop owners express their interest in the initiative. The current capacity of the specific waste collection infrastructure for biodegradable waste is not sufficient to cover all of the sites but additional investment could allow for a scale up.

One of Gabrovo's main projects is the creation of the carbon neutral industrial zone in the Northern industrial zone through the implementation of PPPs between all companies in the area and the municipality (a feasibility study under the EUCF initiative to evaluate the RE production potential of the rooftops of factories is underway). The Green Accelerator initiative aims to support green business and innovation. Gabrovo works with businesses for the separate collection of green waste and produces compost for local farmers. It also engages with local companies for environmental awareness-raising campaigns and capacity building.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the CCC Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for refining the CCC Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract in future iterations.

## Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iteration

### Gabrovo 2030:

#### Advancing Climate Action and Stakeholder Engagement

The Municipality of Gabrovo is committed to continuously improving and refining the Climate City Contract (CCC) over the years. Future iterations will include more stakeholders, along with their commitments and actions towards achieving climate neutrality. The CCC is considered a "living" document that must be regularly updated to reflect the evolving reality of Gabrovo and its dynamic environment. Additionally, the municipality aims to enhance the design and layout of the CCC to align with the vision of Gabrovo 2030: Join the Green Transition.

#### Key Initiatives:

**Stakeholder Involvement:**
Engaging a diverse range of stakeholders in the development and design of the CCC is crucial. Initial steps have been taken to involve stakeholders through the Gabrovo initiatives and events.
The municipality plans to continue to expand its activity in this regard, each time involving more stakeholders and diversifying the target groups. A potential innovation camp is already in the works for this autumn, and a number of other climate related events are already in the planning stages.

**Workshops in SDGs:**
The SDG workshops are already in the plans of Gabrovo and will be launched in the new months to a year. These workshops aim to further refine and align strategies and actions and educate a wider audience.

**Industry Engagement:**

The relationships with business are already established, and Gabrovo will continue to develop these industry relationships and seek broader implementation of joint climate-related actions. Strengthening the relationship between the municipality and industry actors remains a priority.

**National Government Collaboration:**

The municipality aims to continue engaging with stakeholders and the National government for the implementation of actions. National support and advocacy are crucial for Gabrovo's climate related initiatives and project development.

Gabrovo intends to continue demonstrating leadership and efforts towards climate neutrality at a political level, serving as a beacon for other municipalities in Bulgaria. A delicate point to consider is that Bulgaria has experienced significant political instability over the past few years, a trend that not only persists but also exacerbates the divisions within the political and governmental landscape. These processes inevitably affect all cities, including Gabrovo, given the centralized nature of the government.

The international and economic future of Gabrovo is intrinsically tied to the geopolitical climate within the European Union and other international relations that directly or indirectly impact our country and city. These dynamics will inevitably influence Gabrovo's future, particularly concerning the Schengen Area, the adoption of the Euro, conflicts, and other disrupted international relations, given Bulgaria's geopolitical context. Additionally, health hazards such as COVID-19-like epidemics are likely to affect the investment and financial aspects of the Climate City Contract (CCC) implementation.

These are potential threats in our foreseeable future that necessitate the establishment of a contingency plan. In this regard, Gabrovo has a robust transition team led by the Committee for

# Annex 1 - Best practices and project experience of Gabrovo Municipality in stakeholders' engagement through a wide participatory model

Over the past two decades Gabrovo municipality has made significant strides in developing and implementing sustainable energy policies, strategies, and projects. Since 2013, Gabrovo has been a member of the Covenant of Mayors and began implementing its Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP). This plan focused on key mitigation sectors, including **buildings, transport, waste management, street lighting, renewable energy integration, smart grids, and energy communities**, thereby solidifying its position as the leader in energy planning in Bulgaria.

To monitor the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP), inventories of greenhouse gas emissions reductions were conducted in 2016, 2018, and 2020. In 2021 Gabrovo City Council adopted Gabrovo’s Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), which incorporates both mitigation and adaptation measures. The primary objective of this plan is to achieve a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

As a whole, Gabrovo is distinguished as one of the most progressive municipalities in Bulgaria regarding climate and energy planning. The city also ranks among the leaders in managing to attract and invest EU funds which are instrumental for the implementation of innovative initiatives including energy communities, sustainable procurement, smart waste management, sustainable urban mobility, awareness raising campaigns, etc.

# Sector ENERGY EFFICIENCY &amp; BUILT ENVIRONMENT

Gabrovo has accumulated extensive experience in implementing major projects for public and private building retrofitting, public transport, urban infrastructure development, and waste management improvement. Motivated by positive impact the experience and armoured with the ambition to reach climate neutrality by 2030 Gabrovo has developed a new strategy which will help to implement Gabrovo Climate Change Commitment (CCC).

Presently, Gabrovo Municipality is implementing new projects related to retrofitting public and private buildings as well as promoting sustainable mobility and ecological transport. These projects will be funded by the Bulgarian Recovery and Resilience Plan, with Gabrovo Municipality providing approximately 10% co-funding to support the implementation of these actions.

A notable success is the modernization of Gabrovo’s street lighting system through an innovative contract with an Energy Service Company (ESCO), which has been recognized as a best practice not only in Bulgaria but also across the EU. This achievement underscores Gabrovo’s leading role in energy planning and sustainable development.
In 2022 Gabrovo Municipality successfully developed and implemented its Investment Concept, funded by EUCF, focused on building retrofitting (public and private) and development of carbon neutral industrial zone.

The involvement of private stakeholders is crucial for the execution of the local climate policy, and the municipality is actively working to engage them in sustainable energy projects and initiatives. Over 200 homeowners' associations have been established to participate in renovation programs for multi-family residential buildings. Thirty-seven blocks of flats were renovated before 2020, and 84 have prepared their projects and applied for funding from the Bulgarian Recovery and Resilience Fund in 2023.

The municipality has also established and operates one-stop shops (District Information Point) where citizens and businesses can request information and advice regarding the implementation of their sustainable energy and climate projects, financing opportunities, and more. The municipality is supporting the citizens at each and every step and level of the process, and also organizes meetings and seeks citizens' participation at every step of the process that has been an on-going activity for Gabrovo's municipality for years now.

As a logical continuation of the collaboration between the municipality and its citizens, Bulgaria's first energy community was established in 2024. Over 65 citizens and three small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have joined forces with the Municipality of Gabrovo to create this pioneering initiative. Based on a public-private partnership (PPP), the focus is on constructing and operating a photovoltaic (PV) installation.

Numerous new EU projects have been developed to support climate change adaptation and Gabrovo's Climate Policy, which is based on Gabrovo's Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), and Gabrovo Integrated Development Plan 2021-2027.

It is important to highlight that the establishment of the 1st Energy community is a significant achievement not only for Gabrovo but Bulgaria as well. Given the minimal personal funds and resources available to many people, energy and social poverty are prevalent issues in Eastern Europe, particularly in Bulgaria. Addressing these challenges and providing resources and funds for vulnerable groups is one of the major goals of the Municipality of Gabrovo. Additionally national policies are characterised by delays in the transposition of European directives, creating significant challenges for cities in their desire to implement more ambitious and sustainable projects and initiatives. For example, the national definition of nZEBs only became mandatory on 1 January 2024 and energy communities are not yet supported in legislation.

Therefore in order to co-create sustainable and climate neutral future for the city and its citizens the municipality of Gabrovo is closely working with - citizens and organizations, companies and ministries in the energy systems and built environment spheres - Eneffect Consult SLTD, Sofia; Energopro Gabrovo - electricity supplier; Technical University of Gabrovo; Regional Innovation Center "Ambitious Gabrovo"; Ministry of Energy; Ministry of finance; Ministry of innovations; MBAL « Tota Venkova »; Districit Information Point - Gabrovo (one stop shop); National Association of the municipalities of the Republic of Bulgaria (NAMRB); Sustainable Energy Development Agency (SEDA); Ministry of regional development and public works; National statistics institute; Associations of owners in multifamily buildings.
At the local level, the work in this sphere is overseen by the Council for Sustainable Urban Development in Gabrovo, while communication is managed by the Directorate for Sustainable Development at the Municipality of Gabrovo. Although the local systems may differ from those in most of Western Europe, they are well-suited to the administrative, financial, decision-making, and cultural realities of the region. The Regional Innovation Center – Ambitious Gabrovo was established as a key point of contact between citizens, the municipality, and businesses. This center is the result of public-private partnership and is the driving force behind the establishment of innovation and smart specialization processes in Gabrovo.

Gabrovo also strongly relies on the good cooperation with different levels of governance, including regional, national and European. National level policies and actions support capital allocation towards net zero also in the cities, but the long political crisis became the main barrier to access the available funding on time and to implement the planned activities and projects.

Citizen involvement is crucial for the achievement of the CCC goals. Engaging residents directly in different activities, including design and implementation, guarantees their active participation in the initiatives. Through these strategies of citizen engagement, the objective is to provide meaningful opportunities for residents to connect with the narrative and purpose of the CCC actions, in order to enhance the collective understanding, enable co-creation process, stimulate ownership of the Gabrovo climate policies, and incentivize local investments within a citizens engagement strategy will be developed under NetZeroHero project. The strategy for citizen participation will include several important components: Community surveys; Co-creation workshops; Pilot Projects and Demonstrations; Capacity Building and Training for citizens; and Community Outreach and Awareness Campaign.

The municipality of Gabrovo aims to strengthen the administrative capacity in the field, building on the achievements of the TANDEMS and LIFE LOOP projects. In addition, the implemented energy community model should be further developed, as well as new concepts for the inclusion of citizens in the energy transition through an energy community with a capacity of 236 kW PV in private multi-family homes and 310 kW PV with the participation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and residential buildings.

Sector MOBILITY &amp; TRANSPORT

By 2030, significant investments are anticipated from the private sector and industry for the development of energy systems, retrofitting of production facilities in industrial zones, enhancing industrial carbon footprint capacity, and purchasing electric vehicles for private transport. Gabrovo has become a partner in the RESPOSE project (Horizon 2020) and has begun developing its Positive Energy District (PED) area and Bold City Vision 2050. Additionally, the Municipality has initiated new adaptation projects and successfully applied for the MountResilience and AMIGOS projects, funded by Horizon Europe in 2023, which focus on green infrastructure development and urban mobility

The Municipality of Gabrovo actively engages various stakeholders to enhance mobility and transport within the city. Gabrovo is taking steps to promote cleaner vehicles and sustainable transportation. Additionally, the city is investing in infrastructure for active transportation, such as bike lanes and pedestrian paths, and organizing events to encourage citizens to adopt these sustainable habits. There are on-going activities to improve the already implemented traffic calming measures is set in motion, such as: fixing street signs, speed limits monitoring, pedestrian crossings, and roundabouts building, improvement of road safety and prioritize pedestrians and cyclists.

Through a project: "Development of Sustainable Urban Transport in the City of Gabrovo", procedure: Direct grant award procedure - "Implementation of Integrated Urban Development Plans 2014-2020 - Gabrovo" (part of procedure BG16RFOP001-1.001-039 "Implementation of Integrated Urban Development Plans 2014-2020") and funded by: Operational Programme "Regions in Growth" 2014-2020; Priority Axis 1 "Sustainable and Integrated Urban Development". This project aimed at improving the urban transport system in Gabrovo by making it more sustainable. It's part of a larger initiative funded by the European Union's Operational Programme "Regions in Growth" to promote sustainable urban development. Secured more efficient, faster and more environmentally friendly urban transport to Gabrovo with less power
consumption and capabilities for alternative forms of transport which contributed for raising quality of life and improvement of the ecological environment.

Additional activities are promotion of carpooling and ride-sharing initiatives are planned to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. Incorporate active transportation principles into urban planning decisions to create more walkable and bikeable neighborhoods. Continue the already established education and awareness Campaigns in schools and kindergartens in Gabrovo by the Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Interior – Gabrovo. Continue to involve citizens in the planning and implementation of mobility and transportation initiatives, through conducting studies on related issues as we have conducted pertaining to Amigos project where citizens were asked to contribute with their opinion on biking lanes and walking issues. By engaging a wide range of stakeholders and implementing these activities and projects Gabrovo can promote a more sustainable, accessible, and healthier transportation system for its citizens: Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Interior – Gabrovo; Municipal transport company; Local companies; Enegopro – local energy provider; National Statistics; Regional Innovation Center “Ambitious Gabrovo; Council for Sustainable urban development; Municipal company for public works; Gabrovo regional Government; Gabrovo Schools; Technical university of Gabrovo; DIP – district information point; MBAL 'Tota Venkova; Youth center Gabrovo. All of these stakeholders get engaged and collaborate on activities, events and or meetings throughout the year. The process of communication, work and execution albeit difficult due to bearucacy is working. The newly established Council for Sustainable urban development has the opportunity to tackle this issue by optimizing the processes by bringing together a diverse set of professionals, expertise and skills to address current or future problems. In this way, Gabrovo is setting in an example of an innovative, participatoy and co-creative governance model.

Promotion for eco-driving, implementation of technical measures like smart cards for public transport, and offers of financial incentives for citizens is taking shape. Voluntary measures, such as the European Week of Mobility, involve young families and children to participate in educational and ecological activities.

The Ministry of Education, regional offices, and schools play a crucial role in educating children about safety, transport, and mobility. The Ministry of Youth and Sport also promotes various activities throughout the year. New electric vehicle charging stations are being built to support sustainable transport. This comprehensive approach ensures active stakeholder engagement and citizen participation in Gabrovo's mobility and transport initiatives.

# Take me to the village

https://www.priemimenaselo.eu/
Bulgarian villages are wealth - wealth of knowledge, but also wealth of the spirit. They preserve the customs, traditions and values of our people. But the villages are becoming more and more depopulated day by day and are being erased from the country's map.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Young people are gradually moving away from their roots and losing touch with the village and nature. The initiative "Admit me to the village" was launched in 2013 and from then until now he continues to take young people (children, students, young people) to the villages of Gabrovo. There they get to know village life - the cultivation of plants and animals, the preparation of traditional foods, the observance of traditions and the preservation of the connection with nature.

# 1 Introduction

## Background

Situated in south-eastern Europe, Gabrovo is centrally located at the heart of Bulgaria, serving as a strategic gateway between Northern and Southern Bulgaria. This advantageous positioning enhances Gabrovo's role as a key economic and cultural center in Bulgaria, making it an ideal location for sustainable urban development.

Gabrovo Municipality is nestled in the Balkan Mountains, alongside the Yantra River, which contributes to its natural beauty and diverse ecological landscape. The city is the administrative center of the municipality, which includes 133 villages and covers an area of 555.579 km². The population of Gabrovo Municipality is 64,000 people. More than half of the municipality's area is covered by forests, highlighting its rich biodiversity and commitment to preserving natural resources.

Historically known as "The Bulgarian Manchester," Gabrovo has been at the forefront of Bulgaria's industrial development for over 150 years, initiating modern factory production during the 19th century. This legacy of innovation and entrepreneurship remains a cornerstone of Gabrovo's identity, supporting its strategic ambitions today.

## Motivation

Gabrovo's decision to join the EU Mission '100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030' is driven by its commitment to sustainability and climate action. The EU Mission provides a framework for cities to accelerate decarbonization and achieve climate neutrality, aligning with Gabrovo's long-standing dedication to environmental stewardship.

In the face of escalating global climate-related emergencies, the EU has committed itself to spearheading climate action through ambitious goals and legislation. The EU aims to cut emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and reach climate neutrality by mid-century. Cities, responsible for more than 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions while occupying only 3% of the Earth's surface, play a pivotal role in this endeavour.

Gabrovo recognizes the opportunity to leverage the EU Mission to enhance its climate action plans and implement innovative solutions.

## 4 Process and principles

Gabrovo’s path to climate neutrality by 2030 is not just a plan; it’s a pioneering framework that embodies innovation, inclusivity, and strategic collaboration. Designed to set a benchmark for cities in South-eastern Europe, Gabrovo’s Climate City Contract (CCC) is both a mission and a movement—a blueprint for how cities can mobilize and lead in the fight against climate change.

## A Systematic and Smart Process for Urban Transformation

Gabrovo’s approach is holistic, innovative, and driven by a bottom-up philosophy that empowers every stakeholder—from local citizens to international partners. This process is further strengthened by the active involvement and leadership of key regional figures and institutions:

Co-Creation and Bottom-Up Engagement: At the heart of Gabrovo’s process is co-creation. We engage a diverse array of stakeholders—including government agencies, businesses, academia, and civil society—in a continuous dialogue to design and implement climate solutions. This bottom-up approach ensures that the strategies are not only effective but also widely supported, reflecting the collective vision and needs of the community. Gabrovo’s commitment to collaboration extends beyond city limits, fostering regional partnerships that amplify our impact. Gabrovo Council for sustainable urban development plays a pivotal role in aligning regional policies and resources with national objectives and the CCC, thereby strengthening the cohesion and effectiveness of our climate action

Capacity Building and Empowerment: Gabrovo recognizes that true transformation requires more than just policies—it requires empowered people. Our capacity-building initiatives are designed to equip local leaders, businesses, and citizens with the knowledge and skills they need to drive change. Through workshops, training programs, and knowledge-sharing platforms, we are building a citywide network of climate champions who will carry this mission forward. The Technical University of Gabrovo is leading academic and research initiatives that provide cutting-edge knowledge and innovation, which are critical to the city's climate strategy.

The team's work is coordinated by a Secretariat that ensures smooth communication, seamless execution, and the continuous flow of innovative ideas. Led by Gabrovo Council for sustainable urban development, this transition team is the driving force behind Gabrovo's climate ambitions, and its set to inspire other cities to follow suit.

## Adaptive Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

Gabrovo's commitment to excellence is reflected in our rigorous approach to monitoring and continuous improvement. This process is supported by the collaborative efforts of key stakeholders to ensure that progress is not only tracked but also strategically enhanced over time:

Annual Reviews and Dynamic Updates: At least once per two years, Gabrovo Council for sustainable urban development conducts a thorough review of our progress. This review is not just a formality—it's an opportunity to recalibrate our strategies based on the latest data, emerging trends, and stakeholder feedback. Adaptive management is at the core of our process, allowing us to evolve and refine the CCC as we move forward.

Engagement-Driven Feedback Mechanisms: Feedback is a cornerstone of our strategy. We've created multiple channels—public consultations, workshops, and digital platforms—where citizens and stakeholders can share their insights. This continuous loop of feedback ensures that our actions are aligned with the community's needs and aspirations, making the CCC a living document that evolves with the city. Gabrovo Council for sustainable urban development is particularly involved in ensuring that feedback mechanisms are robust and inclusive, fostering broad-based participation across the region.

The Gabrovo Climate Transition Team is integral to these efforts, providing educational and engagement opportunities that empower the community. To ensure the efficient and successful implementation of Gabrovo's Climate Change Commitment (CCC), a dedicated transition team was established by Mayor Tanya Hristova in July 2024. This team operates under the oversight of the Gabrovo Council for Sustainable Urban Development, which is responsible for approving the integrated territorial investments outlined in the Gabrovo Integrated Development Plan 2027.

The transition team's composition is diverse and dynamic, involving not only Gabrovo Municipality's administration but also representatives from the quadruple-helix sectors. These sectors include regional and national authorities, business leaders, academia, and healthcare professionals.

The transition team's structure and responsibilities are carefully organized to leverage the unique skills and knowledge of each member. While maintaining simplicity, the team ensures effective communication. Their multifaceted duties include synchronizing efforts across various sectors, aligning initiatives with climate neutrality objectives, and fostering collaborative communication among stakeholders. This approach cultivates teamwork and mutual respect

Gabrovo CCC has full political commitment the driving force behind Gabrovo's journey towards climate neutrality. Their dedication, expertise, and collaborative spirit are what will guide us towards a sustainable future. Together, we are making Gabrovo a leader in climate action.

The purpose of the transition team is to develop a new inclusive model for urban development by involving various stakeholders, ensuring transparency and information exchange during the concept development stage, and improving interactions to encourage civic participation in decision-making. The lessons learned, which led to the formation of this team, emphasize the importance of coordinated dialogue, inclusive invitations for participation, and engaging the local community in the use, implementation, and long-term sustainability of projects. The transition team plays a crucial role in ensuring a smooth adaptation to evolving urban development needs, bridging the gap between planning and execution while fostering community trust and engagement. Key lessons include the need for structured processes with clear rules, distributed responsibilities and tasks, and a balance between formal and informal communication. Additionally, utilizing unified portals for comprehensive and up-to-date information, simplifying project presentations for the general public, integrating communication channels, and disseminating timely information are essential. These insights highlighted the need for a dedicated team to address these aspects effectively.

The rationale behind focusing on these five areas is Gabrovo's extensive experience in these domains. The Gabrovo municipality has been engaged in projects within these areas for years, thereby accumulating substantial expertise and knowledge. This experience, coupled with the already achieved reductions in CO2 emissions and the implementation of new greenhouse gas (GHG) measures, underscores the municipality's commitment to sustainable development towards climate neutrality by 2030.

The Transition Team, overseen by the Council for Sustainable Urban Development and facilitated by the Directorate for Sustainable Development, is a crucial component of Gabrovo's climate neutrality journey. The team's interconnectedness is evident in its focus on five key domains: energy systems &amp; built environment, mobility and transport, waste and circular economy, and green infrastructure &amp; nature-based solutions. To address these areas

## CO-CREATION OF THE CCC FOR GABROVO

Gabrovo's Climate City Contract embodies a pioneering approach to urban climate governance, driven by a shared vision for achieving climate neutrality by 2030. This vision is supported by a comprehensive strategy that delineates the pathways to reach this ambitious goal. Emphasizing the importance of co-creation and collaborative leadership, the contract engages all stakeholders on local, regional and national level comprising of representatives of the quadruple helix and fosters continuous learning from the process that is led by Gabrovo Transition Team. The execution of Gabrovo's CCC is spearheaded by the city administration, which actively involves multiple stakeholders at various governance levels. This includes local government, businesses, academia, and civil society. By fostering a collaborative leadership approach, the city ensures that diverse perspectives and expertise are integrated into the decision-making process, enhancing the effectiveness and inclusivity of climate actions. Through this inclusive and adaptive approach, Gabrovo is well-positioned to attain its climate neutrality objectives and serve as an example for other cities.

However to accurately depict the reality of Gabrovo in terms of public works, decision-making, governance, and authority, it is essential to clarify the following:

Any financial or significant decision concerning the city of Gabrovo must receive mandatory approval from the Municipal Council, covering both budgetary and decision-making aspects. Additionally, all procedures related to these decisions must comply with public procurement regulations, ensuring transparency, fairness, and adherence to legal standards. This process can sometimes require technical time to pass the vote and come into effect.

Despite the constraints of a limited municipal budget and the challenges Gabrovo faces due to centralized funding and governmental bureaucratic delays, the city has successfully secured a substantial proportion of European and national funding for its projects. Compared to other Bulgarian municipalities, Gabrovo has also contributed a significant amount of co-financing from its own municipal budget, allowing it to continue making progress across all sectors, as outlined in the Gabrovo CCC Action Plan.

Gabrovo is committed to achieving climate neutrality and is prepared to implement a comprehensive Climate city contract plan. To ensure the success of this ambitious goal, the city has adopted several key strategies:

Transparency and Accountability: To ensure transparency and accountability in the implementation of the CCC, Gabrovo has established regular monitoring and reporting mechanisms. These mechanisms provide stakeholders and the public with timely updates on the progress of climate initiatives, fostering trust and ensuring that the city remains accountable to its commitments.

Stakeholder Engagement: The co-creation process of the CCC involves active participation from all relevant stakeholders. This engagement ensures that the diverse perspectives and expertise of local government, businesses, academia, and civil society are integrated into the CCC. By involving stakeholders in the planning and execution phases, Gabrovo enhances the relevance and acceptance of its climate policies.

Citizens' Involvement: Citizens play a crucial role in the co-creation process of the CCC. They contribute ideas, feedback, and support for climate actions through public consultations and participatory workshops, studies and activities. This inclusive approach ensures that the voices of the community are heard and considered, fostering a sense of ownership and commitment to the city's climate goals.

Iterative Learning: The CCC is designed as a living document that evolves based on continuous learning and feedback from stakeholders. This iterative process will allow Gabrovo to identify and address obstacles, ensuring that the CCC remains relevant and effective over time. By embracing a culture of continuous improvement, the city can adapt to new challenges and opportunities in its pursuit of climate neutrality.

The ongoing political crisis in Bulgaria, which has persisted for several years, along with the absence of a stable government, has significantly delayed the implementation of the Recovery and Resilience Plan, the national programs for 2021-2027, and other related initiatives. These governmental delays and decisions have had a considerable impact on municipalities across the country. Local governments have struggled to access necessary funds and resources, hindering their ability to carry out critical projects and improvements. The uncertainty and instability at the national level have also disrupted the planning and execution of local initiatives, causing delays and setbacks in municipal operations and development efforts. In response to these challenges, the CCC will focus on five key areas: energy efficiency and the built environment, mobility and transport, waste management and the circular economy, green infrastructure, and nature-based solutions. The CCC will continue to involve and engage a broad range of stakeholders and citizens in relevant project activities and decision-making processes.

# GABROVO PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT EXPERIENCE AND GOOD PRACTICES

It is called FORUM. It is expected to be launched in the fall 2024.

## 2. Engaging Citizens

Engaging the community is a cornerstone of the CCC’s mission. This is achieved through:

Public Events: Gabrovo is hosting a variety of events such as festivals, concerts, and art exhibitions that are open to all throughout the year. There are seasonal festivals that take place during the year, but also a diverse array of artists that participate in the cultural life of the city – from classical and modern music through theatre, exhibitions and festivals.
Educational Programs: Gabrovo offers a number of workshops, classes, and lectures that cater to different age groups and interests pertaining to health, mobility, energy systems, urban development and ecology. A number of these programs take place in the public, however there are those that cater specifically for children
Volunteer Opportunities: Encouraging citizens to participate in the CCC’s activities by volunteering, which fosters a sense of ownership and involvement.

## 3. Governance Structure

The governance of Gabrovo CCC is designed to be inclusive and transparent:

Gabrovo’s Climate Action Plan aims to foster collaboration and co-creation among stakeholders to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. A key principle of this plan is transparency and accountability, ensuring that decision-makers are held responsible for their actions and that these decisions are openly discussed and reported. Gabrovo aims to focus on five main domains of climate change:

Energy Systems and Built Environment
Mobility and Transport
Waste and Circular Economy
Green Infrastructure
Nature-Based Solutions

Each of these domains has an appointed leader who will work on issues specific to their area of expertise and relevant stakeholders. They will also be accountable for organizing and carrying out the initiatives within their respective areas of responsibility while communicating with the Council for Sustainable urban development and Directorate for sustainable development. Each individual domain is integral to Gabrovo’s sustainable transformation and contributes accordingly to its specific goals.

To ensure transparency, the Municipality of Gabrovo will publicly share information about its climate actions, including decisions, implementation measures, and results. This will enable citizens and stakeholders to stay informed and contribute to the goal of climate neutrality.

The CCC plan emphasizes inclusivity and diversity, ensuring that all citizens, regardless of age, gender, education, place of residence, or socioeconomic status, have an opportunity to participate. The process will be designed to be accessible to all interested individuals, avoiding any form of discrimination or harassment.

Gabrovo has a long history of involving citizens in the process of shaping their community. This tradition of citizen participation is essential for achieving climate neutrality by 2030.

Social responsibility and inclusion is of paramount importance for reaching our climate goals. Gabrovo Municipality has a long history of citizens' engagement and thus continues to work on projects while seeking active citizen involvement, working collaboratively with local stakeholders to create systemic change.

The Municipality of Gabrovo is actively working to empower its citizens and foster a sense of belonging and responsibility for climate-related issues. They have established several points of contact between citizens and local government actors, including, but not limited to the following parties:

District Information Point: A one-stop shop for information and assistance.
RIC "Ambitious Gabrovo": A resource centre for climate initiatives and smart specialization.
Monthly Vending Machine Events: Regular events to engage the community.
Planned and Ad Hoc Meetings: Opportunities for open dialogue and collaboration on everyday climate-related issues, such as waste disposal.
Open door policy - Additionally, Gabrovo has an open-door policy, allowing citizens to call, visit, or receive advice on their issues via phone or personal visits to the municipality. Citizens can also book meetings with the mayor during regular open days.

This proactive approach aims to create a collaborative environment where citizens feel involved and responsible for addressing climate challenges in their community.

The processes of informing, monitoring and joint learning are crucial to ensure that climate actions are on track. However, this can be challenging due to the diverse range of stakeholders involved and the focus on individual and corporate actions. To address these challenges, the municipality will prioritize inclusivity in citizen participation measures, ensuring that underrepresented groups, including those from different age, gender, ethnic, religious, and minority backgrounds, are represented.

Joint learning provides a valuable platform for sharing knowledge and experiences among stakeholders and the community. By integrating a citizen-centered approach in the already established bureaucratic one, Gabrovo aims to set a new and innovative way for citizen's inclusion in the decision making. As clarified in the action plan, the decision making process for municipality of Gabrovo is oftentimes burdensome as it involves approval by the city council. Any decision that pertains to a new activity, project and or practice, and financing has to go through the city council's approval. Gabrovo's City Council is responsible for a wide range of activities that shape the community, namely

Urban Development: They oversee the planning and development of infrastructure projects, including roads, public buildings, and parks.
Public Services: This includes waste management, water supply, and public transportation.
Education and Culture: They support local schools, libraries, and cultural institutions, organizing events and programs to enrich community life.
Economic Development: The council works to attract businesses and investments to the area, fostering economic growth and job creation.

Environmental Initiatives: They implement policies and projects aimed at sustainability and environmental protection.

For the Gabrovo CCC and its strategic implementation an array of various stakeholders from municipality – administrative and other departments, the Council for sustainable urban development, actors from municipal enterprises will be involved. But also service staff, including transport, waste management actors, universities, schools, national actors, and the industrial sector, will be involved in the process. Given the significant contributions of the transport, mobility, and industrial sectors to Gabrovo's emissions, the city will prioritize their involvement in assessing and implementing measures to bridge the gap towards climate neutrality. Technical meetings with sector leaders and dynamic sessions will be held to explore innovative approaches and inspire systemic, demand-driven actions.

By adopting a collaborative and inclusive approach, Gabrovo aims to create a sustainable and resilient future for its citizens and communities.

As one of the most proactive Bulgarian municipalities, Gabrovo places significant emphasis on strong cooperation with various levels of governance, including regional, national, and European. National-level policies and actions support capital allocation toward achieving net zero, including in cities. However, the prolonged political crisis has become a major obstacle, delaying access to available funding and the implementation of planned activities and projects. Citizen involvement is essential for achieving the goals of the CCC. Direct engagement of residents in various activities, including design and implementation, ensures their active participation in initiatives. These citizen engagement strategies aim to provide meaningful opportunities for residents to connect with the narrative and purpose of the CCC actions, fostering a deeper collective understanding, enabling co-creation, encouraging a sense of ownership of Gabrovo's climate policies, and stimulating local investment. By fostering a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility, Gabrovo aims to not only meet its climate targets but also to inspire lasting, sustainable change that will benefit future generations. The involvement of businesses, NGOs, and educational institutions will further amplify the impact, ensuring that innovation and expertise are fully utilized in the city's climate journey. Through these combined efforts, Gabrovo seeks to position itself as a national leader in sustainable urban development, demonstrating that meaningful change is possible through collective action. A comprehensive citizens' engagement strategy will be developed as part of the NetZero Hero project. This strategy will include several key components: community surveys, co-creation workshops, pilot projects and demonstrations, capacity building and training for citizens, and community outreach and awareness campaigns.

Gabrovo is committed to achieving climate neutrality by leveraging the expertise and tools provided by administrative, financial, citizen, and academic institutions. By working closely with all citizens, Gabrovo ensures that its efforts align with the city's vision of being clean, green, smart, and sustainable, while adhering to the principle of "no one is left behind".
