# Executive Summary

The Porto's Climate Neutrality Action Plan presents a holistic strategy for achieving carbon neutrality by 2030, emphasizing collective action, systemic approaches, and inclusivity. The city targets an 85% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 2019 levels, with the Porto Climate Pact driving citizens and organizations (currently, it has 538 individual subscribers and 228 institutional subscribers) to action and to create a large community of learning, sharing, and mutual support. Despite challenges in attracting private investment and stimulating substantial behavioural and habit changes, the City Executive believes that a common vision and goal for decarbonization can help all stakeholders move in the same direction.

This Action Plan begins with an evaluation of the city's current state of climate action, including a detailed GHG baseline inventory managed by Agência de Energia do Porto (AdEPorto). In 2019, Porto emitted 937 ktCO2eq, primarily from buildings, followed closely by transports, and then waste. Unlike industrial territories, Porto's emissions from Industrial processes and product use (IPPU) are relatively low. Despite over one-third of the city being urban green areas, recent studies indicate that Porto has a notable capacity for carbon sequestration. Knowing where the city stands in terms of energy consumption and GHG emissions is decisive to develop a solid Climate Neutrality Action and Investment Plans considering the actions being promoted by both the Municipality and by other city stakeholders.

Responding to the climate emergency, Porto, recognized as one of the 100 European carbon-neutral Mission Cities, launched the Porto Climate Pact in January 2022. Within this framework, a pivotal step was taken to consolidate the city decarbonization efforts with the creation of Porto's Transition Team, formed by 11 entities including municipal departments, companies, agencies and private entities, with a formalized commitment through the agreement "Towards Carbon Neutrality 2030". This collaborative effort emphasizes breaking down silos, fostering interdisciplinary cooperation, and addressing multifaceted challenges to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.

Acknowledging governance barriers and multilevel governance hurdles, Porto actively participates in a national network to align local objectives with central government policies. Systemic barriers across sectors are identified, and a collaborative approach, including initiatives like the Porto Climate Pact Talk Series dedicated to discussing carbon neutrality issues through a series of sessions addressing the challenges faced by the city of Porto, is adopted to enhance understanding and participation.

In line with Porto's 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments, the Action Plan clearly identifies the impact pathways and strategic portfolio of actions which prioritize expanding green infrastructure, enhancing mobility options, adopting clean energy, and promoting circular practices. Actions include doubling garden and park areas for carbon sequestration, reducing motorized transportation, promoting shared mobility and electrifying vehicles, emphasizing sustainable transportation goals. The energy system focuses on clean energy sourcing, renewable generation, and energy efficiency, while waste and circular economy actions target increased recycling and efficient processes.

Overall, Porto is committed to an 85% emissions reduction target by 2030. This means that the percentage of emissions reduction previously planned through other Action Plans already in progress represents 35% of this target, while the rest of the emissions reduction expected through this CCC Action Plan represents 50%. Therefore, 416 ktCO2eq represents the emissions gap which will be

addressed through the comprehensive portfolio of actions defined in these CCC Action Plan. Residual emissions represent 121 ktCO₂eq coming mainly from transport and waste sectors. The plan emphasizes collaboration between municipal and private stakeholders through the Porto Climate Pact, reflecting a continuous and inclusive engagement in the climate neutrality process.

Regarding monitoring and evaluation of the Climate City Contract (CCC) and its Action Plan, a comprehensive set of key indicators are identified and a robust plan to track progress is developed establishing a baseline (2019), a plan for carrying out routine monitoring (on a yearly basis), and mid-term (2025 and 2027) and final (2030) evaluations. These indicators measure the outcome(s) or impact(s) of one or more of the actions in this Action Plan and show how close an action is to the desired pathway and targets.

In terms of governance, Porto's model is centred around the Porto Climate Pact and managed by the Transition Team, demonstrating a collaborative and inclusive effort involving citizens and various stakeholders, both public and private, to achieve carbon neutrality. Beyond the goal of decarbonization, Porto also aspires to ensure a fair transition that actively engages its citizens with several different projects and other initiatives related to Porto Climate Pact. However, challenges arise at the national level, impacting regulations, funding, and alignment with central government policies.

In its determination to build a city that is resilient in the face of challenges, socially inclusive in its opportunities, and environmentally conscious in its development, Porto's social innovation projects and interventions are essential. They mainly incorporate entrepreneurship incubators, awareness campaigns, and circular economy initiatives, as a forward-thinking, community-centric model for urban development.

Looking ahead, Porto plans a thorough review of the CCC in the next two years, outlining steps for climate strategy refinement, stakeholder engagement and a tailored monitoring strategy. These steps aim to align actions, enhance citizens and stakeholder involvement, ensure effective monitoring, and adapt the CCC to Porto's unique climate journey. Through this iterative process, Porto seeks to attract resources, monitor progress, and achieve its vision for a sustainable and resilient future by 2030.

# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

The stability of the global climate system is at risk as a result of the high concentration of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) in the global atmosphere. Mitigating these emissions is urgently needed to avoid unpredictable consequences on the natural, economic, and social systems. The European Union (EU) has been leading the way: Member States should set a target of 55% reduction in 2030 and neutrality in 2050. At a national level, the Portuguese Climate Law sets a reduction in emissions of at least 55% by 2030, 65% to 75% by 2040, and 90% by 2050. Indeed, in parallel with the drafting of its Climate City Contract, as a Mission City, Porto is also drafting its Municipal Climate Action Plan to respond to the national Climate Law, seeking to align both documents and showing a higher ambition than the national one. Reducing GHG emissions to reach carbon neutrality requires bold measures and high public and private investment as well as a comprehensive engagement of all city stakeholders, from the Municipality to the private sector, academia, NGOs, and citizens. At the same time, this city transformation represents an opportunity for competitiveness, employment, and social justice.

Driven by its determination to lead by example and become a reference in climate neutrality, Porto committed to accelerate carbon neutrality by 2030, reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 85%, compared to 2019. This ambition was firstly expressed in 2021 in the Expression of Interest (EOI) to the '100 Climate neutral and Smart Cities' Mission and since then, the city has been diligently working on this commitment.

Porto's ambition to reduce GHG emissions by 2030 (compared to 2019)

Porto is the epicentre of a region with more than 1,7 million inhabitants – the Metropolitan Area of Porto, being the 4th most populous Portuguese Municipality and the 3rd most densely populated in the country. Porto city, which is the entire Municipality of Porto, is small compared to its metropolitan area, with an estimated population of just 231 800 people (in 2021) in a Municipality with only 41,42 km². Located along the Douro River estuary in northern Portugal, Porto is one of the oldest European centres, its historic centre was proclaimed a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1996, and the western part of its urban area extends to the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean.

In the last few decades, the city is getting more attractive for living, studying, and hosting businesses. Indeed, one in every five startups nationwide are in Porto and the city's connection to academia and research centres contributed to the creation of a hub known for generating, attracting, and retaining knowledge. Also, over the last few years, Porto has experienced significant tourism increase, which may be partly linked to the Ryanair hub at Francisco de Sá Carneiro Airport, located in the vicinity of the city. Indeed, Porto won the European Best Destination 2012, 2014 and 2017 awards and several other prizes in the World Travel Awards.

Since 2009, when it became the first Portuguese city to subscribe to the Covenant of Mayors (and one of the first five European cities), Porto has been designing a transformative way to develop a low-carbon, sustainable and inclusive city, leading by example and setting the standards for other national and European cities, while putting citizens and local stakeholders at the centre of this city transformation. This way of working and thinking has led to Porto, the second Portuguese city and the capital of the country's northern region, being selected to be part of the group of European cities that aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.

This Climate City Contract is directly in line with Porto's Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP), developed under the scope of the EU Covenant of Mayors, and whose goal was to achieve a GHG reduction of 60% by 2030, compared to 2004. By increasing the reduction target, the

measures foreseen in the city SEAP (and included in this action plan) were revised and further strengthened. Also, this Action Plan is fully aligned with the Municipal Climate Action Plan in development under the scope of the National Climate Law whereas the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan builds partially on the Investment Concept developed by Porto under the scope of the European City Facility (EUCF) initiative. Also, to ensure the city's systemic change, Porto's Climate

Figure 1. Link between CCC components and Porto's strategic plans.

City Contract builds on the Porto Climate Pact, a central piece of the city strategy towards neutrality and the merging element boosting all agents to act in favour of carbon neutrality.

By having a clear idea of how energy is used in the city and how emissions are evolving in the territory over time (the city inventory of GHG emissions cover the entire administrative territory, sectors, sources and scopes, excepting AFOLU (Agriculture, forestry, and other land use) as Porto is a purely urban area, without agricultural activity, Porto knows that the path towards carbon neutrality in Porto is demanding and calls for collective action and demands a systemic approach where all city elements must act collaboratively, realizing the interdependencies and synergies between them and the city government. Also, Porto realized that no matter how aligned and committed the Executive may be with this objective, it cannot drive this transformation alone. Therefore, the diversity of Porto's ecosystem should be invited to participate and act in the city transformation. In this sense, to activate and foster an inclusive climate transition, in 2022, the Municipality launched the Porto Climate Pact with a clear rationale: The path towards carbon neutrality is demanding and calls for collective action. The City Executive believes that a common vision and goal for decarbonization can help all stakeholders move in the same direction. Therefore,

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
Figure 2. Porto Climate Pact launch event.

the Porto Climate Pact intends to involve citizens and organizations to action and to create a large community of learning, sharing, and mutual support. The signing of the Pact is voluntary, non-binding, free of charge and everyone is invited to join in and, currently, it has 228 institutional subscribers and 538 individual subscribers (citizens).

In 2022, within the framework of the Porto

Climate Pact, a pivotal step was taken to consolidate the city decarbonization efforts. An internal team, comprising diverse entities, from various municipal departments, municipal companies, and agencies, formally coalesced to spearhead the city's decarbonization strategy. This collaborative effort, now known as Porto's Transition Team, had been informally collaborating for years, but now solidified their partnership through a formal agreement titled "Towards Carbon Neutrality 2030". This landmark agreement, signed by 11 entities, underscores a commitment to allocate human resources towards a shared vision of sustainability governance. This team encompasses therefore core competencies geared towards achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 and integrates:

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
Figure 3. Porto Transition Team structure.

This initiative showcases not only the direct involvement of various Porto Municipality Departments but also strong engagement from municipal companies/agencies and private companies responsible for the city decarbonization efforts. These include the energy agency, water and energy management, waste collection and management, digital transition and transformation, public transport, social housing, and municipal buildings management, among others. This collaborative effort emphasizes the importance of breaking down silos and fostering interdisciplinary cooperation across sectors to ensure a holistic approach to the city's transition and effectively address the multifaceted challenges of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030.

To support this agreement, the Porto Municipal Assembly approved a formal mandate to Porto Ambiente to orchestrate the municipal efforts towards carbon neutrality. With a dedicated team to coordinate these efforts, there is a Carbon Neutrality Department to align these activities under the political portfolio and leadership of Mr. Filipe Araújo, Vice-Mayor of Porto, the main sponsor of Porto Climate Pact. This ensures a strong political alignment and commitment to make carbon neutrality by 2030 a reality and, especially, to ensure its importance and relevance for the future.

This integrative and growing dynamic of the Porto Climate Pact maintains continuous communication with its network of subscribers, primarily using the Porto Climate Pact website as the main contact point and information dissemination medium. This website features a section that is consistently updated with news from the numerous subscribers, aiming to disseminate and publicize results and best practices that can engage the community and create contagious dynamics of knowledge within the broader community. This constantly updated section can be accessed at the Pact website in both Portuguese and English versions.

One of the first priorities of this team was to map the universe of city actors with an impact on decarbonization, identifying its protagonists, their roles, and interrelations. This mapping allows the creation of lasting relationships between city actors and the design of co-creation processes between such entities in a fertile environment for new ideas and experimentation, allowing the development of a shared vision of the city. In fact, several of the biggest city energy and sustainability projects resulted from collaborations between different city entities (see Box 1 and Box 2).

To strengthen the climate transition mandate, the full city ecosystem of actors needs to be positively engaged and, although there is currently a clear idea of the roles and relationships between everyone, it is necessary to involve citizens and make them active actors in the city transformation. In this domain, Porto has developed structural processes that aim to involve citizens in decision-making and in the implementation of public policies to achieve a fairer and more sustainable city. Regarding citizen participation, Porto has been promoting the creation of various mechanisms for consultation and dialogue with citizens, mainly through the creation of events for public participation. In this way, it seeks to foster citizen co-responsibility in the management of the city, and to promote transparency and accountability. Accordingly, Porto has been developing several citizen-centred approaches, promoting the integration of different profiles. The following three examples reflect the identification of challenges and the strategies that have been created as opportunities to include everyone:

In a broader approach, it became necessary to create a joint effort, combined with the sense of community that is so characteristic of Porto. This is how the Porto Climate Pact came about, integrating everyone in this joint effort and which, in addition to institutions, already has more than 500 individuals as signatories who are now more aware of the environmental cause and the need for action. The Porto Climate Pact maintains continuous communication with its network of subscribers, primarily using the Porto Climate Pact website as the main contact point and information dissemination platform. This website features a section that is consistently updated with news from the numerous subscribers, aiming to disseminate and publicize results and best practices that can engage the community and create contagious dynamics of knowledge within the broader community.
The Transition Team also realized the need for a more personalized approach. For this reason, the Porto Climate Pact Talk Series was designed to bring citizens and experts together

to debate ten essential topics for the climate transition. For nearly three months, the carbon neutrality issue was discussed in a talk series that debated the themes of climate change and the challenge of decarbonizing the city of Porto. These sessions, held weekly, at the Porto Innovation Hub, brought together more than 500 participants and 40 speakers. In each of the 10 sessions, the formula was constant: a moderator led a conversation between several guest speakers, experts on different topics, in a healthy sharing of good practices, ideas and ambitions about the topic of the session that inspired those present and gave clues about the way forward for the future. Decentralized and clean energy, sustainable mobility, decarbonization of construction, the circularity of the food system, community involvement, carbon sequestration, the challenges of a just transition, the importance of data, financing

and nature-based solutions

were the motto of the different sessions that convened figures from academia, the business sector, public organizations, and industry associations for discussion. The sessions, open to the public, were guided by the dynamics of interaction between speakers and audience, always challenged to make suggestions, questions, or make comments on the topics addressed. The interest shown by those present demonstrates the importance of the topic for civil society and is evident in the growing

number of subscribers to the Pact. The Talk series discussions are available on the Porto Climate Pact website, with videos of the sessions, written highlights as well as in podcast format on the main platforms. These sessions, held on Porto Innovation Hub (PIH), the innovation heart of the city, were key to engage citizens in the city decarbonization process, and to show them the set of projects being developed in Porto. Indeed, the success of these sessions inspired the Transition Team to consider this tool as one of the axes for promoting citizen participation in the city's decarbonization process during the next years. Similarly, training and co-creation sessions are planned in the Municipality's parish councils, promoting a community approach to the issue, the search for solutions based on the reality experienced locally and benefiting from everyone's participation due to the geographical proximity and the positive pressure everyone can exert on their neighbours to raise awareness and increase participation.

To further continue this effort of engaging citizens in the city decarbonization path, Porto aims now to start to build an integrated approach merging technology and information to place citizens at the centre of the city climate action. This aim was applied to the NetZeroCities Pilot Cities Programme and the project "WAKE UP!" (Wider Approach to Keep Engaged citizens on sustainable Urban Policies) will now develop a digital engagement tool. WAKE UP! aims to develop a broader set of services provided by multiple city partners whilst raising citizens awareness and promoting the adoption of sustainable-friendly behaviours. The overall idea is to use an app associated with Card Porto, to allow citizens to track their carbon footprint

and access tips to reduce it while being rewarded for sustainable behaviours. This idea was submitted and approved to the NZC Pilot Cities Programme Cohort 2 and is understood as a key initiative to engage citizens and promote the so-desired behavioural change in the local population. Porto's city management model also prioritizes people, especially vulnerable groups, involving them in the sustainable development journey. Looking globally, it is clear that the most vulnerable populations are typically those who suffer the most from climate change, and in large urban centres this reality persists.

For a fair climate transition where no one is left behind and equitable access to opportunities are provided, Porto's strategies include increasing literacy and supporting citizens in mitigation but also in adaptation measures. Aligned with this, examples of mitigation measures are:

The substantial investments in the renovation of social housing that have been made to enhance the quality and the energy efficiency of residential buildings. The Municipality of Porto has allocated more than 150 million euros in the last decade to fund these renovation projects. By upgrading social housing, Porto not only improves living conditions for its residents but also contributes to a reduction in energy consumption and environmental impact.
Another noteworthy measure in Porto's climate mitigation strategy involves providing free public transport passes to Porto Card users under the age of 18, since 2019 until 2023. In 2024, this initiative will be financially supported by the national government taking on the funding responsibility. By offering free transportation to young residents, Porto encourages the use of public transit, reducing reliance on individual vehicles and, consequently, lowering carbon emissions. From 2024 onwards, the municipality's budget will provide 22 free public transport trips to all Porto Card users, a new incentive for urban transport in the city.

Interventions related to adaptation to climate change for the most vulnerable citizens are also relevant to guarantee a fair and just climate transition. Related to adaptation two concrete examples of measures that aim to reduce the impacts of climate change, are presented as follows:

The homeless population is the most exposed to extreme weather conditions, phenomena that have been occurring more frequently in the city. With this in mind, Porto has developed a Cold Weather Contingency Plan for Homeless People which guarantees shelter and overnight stays in closed, heated spaces.
Also, heavy rainfall events have become increasingly frequent in Porto, leading to disturbances in the city. During one of this events, part of the eastern area of the city, in "Ilha dos Moinhos – Fontainhas" has been particularly affected forcing the evacuation of families. The Municipality has found an effective solution to the problem by having relocated the families, acquired the land and developing a green area in which nature-based solutions will be implemented to absorb abundant rainfall water.

These are some examples of measures that are also being reflected in the Municipal Climate Action Plan, which is currently being developed alongside with the update of the Municipal Climate Change Adaptation Strategy.

Also, Porto focus on the engagement of vulnerable people during the city decarbonization. One example of citizen involvement that the Municipality has been working on is the URBiNAT project, in which Porto is one of the participating cities and which seeks to create "healthy corridors"

in the parish of Campanhã, one of the city's most vulnerable areas. In the scope of this project, this area has been targeted by several investments with a view to improve the liveability of three social housing neighbourhoods through the deployment of cocreation processes involving the citizens who work and live in the parish of Campanhã, organisations and schools. These moments came in various formats, such as awareness-raising activities, talks, workshops, digital contents, and games, with around 150 participants. A set of immaterial and material initiatives were co-developed. That

includes a four-hectare green park is now under construction in the location (Park Alameda de Cartes included in Porto's Action Plan) and which will incorporate nature-based solutions, complemented by educational, environmental, and socio-economic initiatives, all co-designed and co-developed by the local community.

As part of the Porto Orgânico project, which aims to improve the collection and management of biowaste in the city, Porto created two community composting islands that are available for citizens to dispose of their organic waste. The two islands are located in different housing neighborhoods in the city and everyone who lives nearby can participate. The project provides initial knowledge on organic waste separation and a kit with a bucket for collecting food waste, a key to access the composter, a vertical garden and a rucksack. Participants can count on the support of technicians on the field, who oversee and monitor the entire composting process. The result is a 100% natural organic compost, which is made available to project members. In less than two years, 151 families have contributed to the project, which has enabled more than 7,6 tonnes of biowaste to be recovered, resulting in more than 2 tonnes of compost distributed to the participating families.

This project is the result of a collaboration between LIPOR and the municipal company Porto Ambiente. The implementation of these two community composting sites stems from the work carried out as part of the City Loops project, funded by the Horizon 2020 (H2020) research and innovation framework programme. Community composting has emerged as a solution for the local treatment of biowaste, making it possible to reduce costs and also reduce the associated environmental impacts. This is a project that actively involves citizens in the management of their own waste, boosts the circularity of these

resources and allows for the reduction of the individual environmental impact.

Also under development is the "ComEC0" project, which has emerged as a quest for greater citizen involvement, with the aim of involving and training entry managers from the city's social housing neighbourhoods to promote sustainable practices in vulnerable communities, with an emphasis on literacy for sustainability. This project has the potential to positively impact part of the approximately 950 entry managers, spread across the 44 social housing groupings, as part of Domus Social's ConDomus programme, which aims to involve tenants in the management processes of the common spaces in municipal buildings, similar to what happens in a conventional building complex. One of the goals of this initiative is to develop a playbook, which will be the result of a close collaboration with municipal organisations specialising in a wide range of areas, to promote more responsible, conscious, and greener knowledge and practices. This document will empower entry managers, providing them with the necessary skills for a more positive impact and for passing on knowledge to their peers.

Actions such as practical and interactive workshops will be organised, covering topics such as waste-free cooking, reuse and the circular economy, energy, and water efficiency, for example. The experience will be gamified, establishing a closer relationship between the community and the Municipality, facilitating learning and the adoption of sustainable practices. This project aims to create a direct relationship between the economic and environmental aspects associated with sustainability, while also making a clear contribution to the social pillar. By correlating the economy and the environment, the aim is to encourage more sustainable behaviours, showing that conscious attitudes positively influence not only the individual's environmental impact, but also the city's quality of life. The project establishes an essential synergy between the Municipality and vulnerable communities, recognising the intrinsic interconnection between the city's ecosystems. By empowering these communities, not only environmental resilience is boosted, but also a direct positive impact on economic conditions is expected. These actions will be able to create proximity between the various stakeholders, benefiting the Municipality by receiving crucial data, allowing communities to actively participate in the climate transition and move closer to municipal opportunities. It shows that everyone is an integral part of a movement for sustainability, promoting a just transition towards this common goal: carbon neutrality by 2030.

By having a culture of innovation and co-creation settled in the city, to start to draft the portfolio of key actions to be included in the Porto's Climate City Contract, city stakeholders were invited to participate in a joint workshop organized together with the Net Zero Cities team in April 2023 (Figure 7) in which, for three days, municipal entities and partners of the Porto Climate Pact worked together on this topic. Dedicated to the strategic alignment between partners, the first day included the sharing of results achieved and objectives of several entities, including the Municipality of Porto, Misericórdia do Porto, Sociedade Transportes Colectivos do Porto (STCP), Centro Hospitalar Universitário São João, Fundação de Serralves, REN Portgás, LIPOR, Futebol Clube do Porto, Instituto de Ciência e Inovação em Engenharia Mecânica e Engenharia Industrial (INEGI), SONAE, Elergone Energia and Centro de Investigação do Território Transportes e Ambiente (CITTA)/ Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto (FEUP). The remaining sharing moments were dedicated to identifying and assessing the city's diverse climate needs, especially focused on concrete measures to be developed, with a view to carbon neutrality by 2030. This event resulted in the creation of liaison points between the different stakeholders who have since established synergies. The workshop involved also the

Also, directly in the scope of the Cities Mission participation, to further strengthen Porto's climate mandate and since the city has an anchor role in the Porto Metropolitan Area, Porto has been participating in a network of Portuguese cities that aim to be carbon neutral. Although only taking the first steps, this network is expected to encourage the exchange of experiences and good practices from a collaboration and mutual aid perspective. The network was launched under the name "Network of Portuguese Cities and Regions for Climate Neutrality" and has already secured funding for its operation in 2024

from the Environmental Fund of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Action. This network includes Portuguese cities and regions committed to the transition to climate neutrality. By taking on this leadership role, these cities and regions aim to implement climate actions, strengthen internal capabilities, and collaborate with stakeholders in order to move towards a sustainable and resilient society. The network currently comprises 21 cities and regions, and its initial selection was based on all Portuguese cities and regions that applied to the "100 climate-neutral and smart cities", even if they were not selected. The network currently has a technical secretariat provided by IN+ (Center for Innovation, Technology and Policy Research), which will serve the cities and regions that make up the Network to assist them with developing measures that contribute to climate neutrality, through knowledge, tools, and training. This network stems from good benchmark examples observed in other member states regarding the interaction between different cities working towards a common goal. Among these, we would highlight citiesES due to its proximity to Spain as a constituent country of the Iberian Peninsula and for participating in previous joint actions.

Under the organization of CapaCITIES: Advancing national support for climate-neutral cities, Porto is also involved in a closer national collaboration with the Mission Hub Policy Group, an initiative developed by the ANI (National Agency for Innovation), involving all the relevant public organizations within the ministries that deal with the relevant policy instruments that support the country and the cities to become carbon neutral. There is a cities' group to share experience, know-how and learnings in their work to achieve the goals of Cities Mission with these national and regional relevant stakeholders. National partner supporting the Cities Mission is the DGEG (Directorate General for Energy and Geology).

# 2 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

## 2.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

### GHG Emissions Baseline inventory

Reporting to 2004, established as the baseline year for GHG emissions in Porto's SEAP, the city reduced its emissions in 38% by 2019 and 42% by 2021 (Erro! A origem da referência não foi encontrada.). This reduction trend has been steady over the years and is mainly driven by the

![img-33.jpeg](img-33.jpeg)

electricity of energy use in buildings (residential and commercial) and the decarbonization of the national power system. Also, this overall reduction is reflected into a significant reduction in the per capita figures which decreased 33% from 2004 to 2019 and 37% in 2021, compared to 2004. With this inventory as a basis for decision support, the city is aware of the need to intervene on the decarbonization of buildings (stationary energy) and transports since these are the main GHG emitters, representing 51% and 42% of the total GHG emissions in 2019, respectively. Moreover, this methodology allows the city to understand its direct (scopes 1 and 2) and indirect (scope 3) weight in emissions, which makes it possible to prioritize direct actions and to establish partnerships with other municipalities to act on the territory in a holistic way. AFOLU (Agriculture, forestry, and other land use) accounting is not included in Porto's GHG emissions inventory as no agricultural activities are developed in the city, which is a purely urban area.

The city's annual inventory is the basis for most of the city's strategies (e.g., SEAP and Municipal Climate Action Plan) and allows a clear identification of the gaps to achieve carbon neutrality in Porto: Despite the positive evolution in terms of electrification, a considerable effort in building renovation (municipal facilities, social housing and incentives for privates) and a huge investment in sustainable mobility options (electrified bus fleet, new metro lines, free public transport), Porto still has a long way to go in terms of buildings and transports. The strong local and national political will, as well as the existence of funding options (both from the Municipality and from funding programs as the Recovery and Resilience Plan) and a local Transition Team used to work collaboratively from some years are important enablers for Porto's decarbonization path. However, the need to massify private participation in the city climate action, both to raise awareness

and leverage private investment (crucial for building renovation, for instance) as well as the need for a profound behavioural and habit change regarding private transport and waste recycling rates are important barriers that Porto need to overcome in the coming years.

This inventory is annually updated by AdEPorto and has been carried out since 2009, endowing Porto with a detailed annual record of energy and GHG, which is key to periodical reports to initiatives such as the Covenant of Mayors¹ – subscribed by Porto in 2008 and updated in 2019 – and the CDP - Disclosure Insight Action – in which Porto has been awarded with class A in 2020, 2021 and 2022. This knowledge is crucial for the city as establishing an intelligible baseline is key to designing city policies and understanding how to act. Knowing where the city stands in terms of energy consumption and GHG emissions is decisive to develop a solid Climate City Contract Action and Investment Plans considering the actions being promoted by both the Municipality and by other city stakeholders.

# BOX 3: Improvements to consider

This annual inventory is mostly based on data provided by national (i.e., DOEG) and metropolitan entities (Porto Metropolitan Area), but also on data from local actors (i.e., Metro de Porto, STOP, etc.). By being dependent on national and regional entities for data provision, the city GHG inventories have a delay of two years (i.e., data from 2019 were only made available in 2021 and so on). This issue occurs for the whole territory and an effort has been made to work with national entities to accelerate the access to consumption data. Another point to improve is related to mobility and transports. The information that allows measuring the modal split, as well as the origin-destination matrices results from a metropolitan mobility survey carried out over a period of 10 years (the last survey data of 2014). In this sense, and as a way of improving this crucial information, the municipality of Porto is discussing this issue at a metropolitan level so that the survey is carried out with a greater regularity. Finally, it should be noted that municipalities do not have a detailed characterization of how energy is consumed in buildings, especially in residential ones. Assumptions are made considering a National Household Consumption Survey - a national survey carried out every ten years and which can mischaracterize energy consumption in a purely urban environment, as is the case in Porto, since a large part of the Portuguese territory is semi-rural.

In an effort to improve these gaps in future iterations of the CCC, Porto hopes that, through its participation in the National Network of Cities and Regions for Carbon Neutrality (Figure 8), the sharing of technical knowledge (data, models and tools) and collaborations between and with interested parties, particularly with providers of crucial data, will allow the existing methodology to be improved. At the same time, members of the Transition Team, namely AdEPorto, will continue to work with national entities, such as ADENE, to also try to unlock and facilitate access to some data necessary for the local energy and emissions inventory.

Also, as the city has currently a consolidated characterisation of its direct emissions (scope 1 and 2) and since Porto is a purely urban territory, the Transition Team will now focus on assessing consumption-based emissions, namely the emissions produced by the consumption of goods and services (such as food, clothing, electronic equipment, etc.) by Porto residents. This area was not yet exploited by the team and represents the next logic step to have a better understanding of the city impact.

Since 2008, when Porto subscribed to the Covenant of Mayors, the city has been working on monitoring energy consumption and GHG emissions, developing and refining an assessment methodology. Recently, to cover all GHG emission domains, the city updated its approach and adopted the City Inventory Reporting and Information System (CIRIS), developed by C40 Cities, as monitoring tool. CIRIS is an accessible, easy-to-use, and flexible Excel-based tool for managing and reporting city GHG inventory data based on the Global Protocol for Community-scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC) standards. The tool facilitates and harmonizes the reporting of emissions for five sectors, namely: a) Stationary energy; b) Transportation; c) Waste; d) Industrial processes and product use (IPPU) and e) Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU).

The methodology adopted is detailed in Annex 1 – Energy and GHG inventory methodology and the results are presented in Tables A-1.1 and A-1.3.

* Porto is a purely urban Municipality without agricultural and forestry activities.

Figure 11 and Figure 12 detail the energy consumption in Porto, per sector and energy vector. In 2019, the Municipality of Porto was directly responsible for the consumption of 3 430,60 GWh of final energy, a  $28\%$  reduction compared to 2004, the base year defined by the city in its SEAP and official reporting processes. In addition to this consumption, indirect consumption due to losses in the electricity transmission and distribution networks (137,84 GWh) and fugitive emissions resulting from the natural gas distribution infrastructure (2,84 GWh) should be considered, totalling the 3 571,28 GWh presented in Table A-1.1. Being a densely urbanized territory, stationary energy (consumption in buildings) and the transport sector are large energy consumers (1 913,7 GWh and 1 472,1 GWh, respectively²). Compared to 2004, these sectors have decreased their final energy consumption by  $32\%$  and  $22\%$  respectively, translating the increased efficiency of energy consumption in buildings and transports, the electrification of energy uses (such as electric water heating and cooking) and the modernization of mobility services, because of urban mobility policies. On the other hand, as a low-industrialized territory where solid waste is treated outside the city limits, energy consumption in

Figure 12. Sankey diagram of energy consumption in Porto, 2019.

In terms of energy vectors, those that contribute most to the overall final energy consumption in the Porto territory come from the stationary energy and transport sectors, due to the growing electrification of the former, and the weight of on-road transport in the Municipality's mobility. Thus, due to its predominance in buildings, electricity is the most used vector in the Municipality, followed by diesel. This is in fact a good starting point, as the decarbonization of the buildings sector is facilitated by the high level of electrification already taking place. However, the overwhelming dominance of diesel in the transport sector reveals the challenge of decarbonizing this sector.

Electricity is, therefore, the most used energy vector in the Municipality (39%), especially in Buildings (65% of the energy consumed in Porto's buildings is electric). Natural gas is the second most used vector in buildings (19,9%), and the third most consumed at municipal level (11%), as a result of its still widespread use for cooking and heating purposes (both hot water and spaces). Renewable sources, including biomass, solar thermal and solar photovoltaic energy, still account for only about 2% of the total energy consumed by of Porto's buildings. At the municipal scale, and because of the weight of the transport sector, diesel is the second most consumed vector in the territory (29%). Sectorally, diesel represents 70% of the energy consumption of on-road transports, followed by gasoline (23%). The consumption of natural gas in public transport (mainly due to the consumption of STCP buses) makes this vector the third most consumed in terms of road transport (4%), followed by electricity (2%), due to the existing rail transport (train and metro) network and the increasing electrification of road transport. The remaining sectors (Waste and Wastewater and IPPU), represent low energy consumption in Porto (0,5% and 0,8%, respectively), due to the low industrial presence in the city and the fact that Porto's waste is treated outside the city boundaries.

After collecting the energy data, both the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and the emission factors were defined in CIRIS. For the GWP, the values from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (2014) were considered as they reflect the most recent and advanced state of knowledge concerning the science of climate change. As for the emission factors, a mixed country-specific and local approach was used. For grid-supplied electricity, the annual carbon intensity factor of the national power system was assumed. This factor is annually provided by ADENE, the Portuguese Energy Agency, and available in the Portuguese Energy Observatory. In 2019, this value was  $253\mathrm{tCO}_{2eq} / \mathrm{GWh}$ . In turn, for the remaining energy vectors, the national Order 17313/2008 (Despacho n.° 17313/2008) establishes the Carbon Intensity factors for to the emission of greenhouse gases, expressed in kilograms of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  equivalent ( $\mathrm{kgCO}_{2eq}$ ). These emission factors are the ones presented in section A-1.2. Finally, for waste, the local emission factors calculated by LIPOR, the managing entity responsible for waste collection for treatment in Porto, were used.

Regarding GHG emissions, in 2019, the Municipality was responsible for the emission of 937,010 tCO₂eq, an overall reduction of 38% compared to 2004 (Table A-1.3 and Figure 14). Table A-1.4 presents additional relevant data used to compute the city GHG emissions.

As the most intensive sector in terms of energy consumption, buildings (stationary energy) are also the main source of GHG emissions in Porto (477 685 tCO $_{2eq}$ ), closely followed by transports (392 128 tCO $_{2eq}$ ) and waste (60 004 tCO $_{2eq}$ ). As explained above, Porto is not an industrial territory, which is clearly reflected in the GHG emissions associated to IPPU. In addition, Porto is a densely built-up area, and although urban green areas cover more than 1/3 of Porto's surface, recent studies $^{3}$  estimate that the tree cover corresponding to the green area has a carbon sequestration potential of around 650 kg/ ha/year, which corresponds to a carbon sequestration capacity of around 1 355 tons/ year.

Figure 15. GHG emissions in Porto, by subsector and scope, 2019.

By examining the matrix of emissions by scope, the dichotomy between scope 1 (emissions occurring within

the city) and scope 3 (emissions occurring outside, but by action of the city) in road transport stands out. This dichotomy characterizes the daily commuting movement to and from the city. Additionally, the significant electrification of energy uses in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings and facilities is represented by the preponderance of scope 2 emissions in these subsectors (Figure 15).

At the European level, the European Green Deal and the European Climate Law pushed by a policy crisis, characterized by the interplay between the COVID-19 pandemic, the invasion of Ukraine, the energy crisis, the housing affordability crisis and the climate crisis, are the main drivers for the EU climate agenda. In line with these two documents and proposed under the scope of the Green Deal, the following complementary strategies and regulations must be considered as they set targets for different carbon-related dimensions:

The 2030 EU Biodiversity strategy (May 2020) seeks to make our societies more resilient to future threats, such as the effects of climate change, forest fires, food insecurity and disease outbreaks (particularly focusing on wildlife protection and combating its illegal trade).
The Farm to Fork Strategy (May 2020) has food security as a priority and sets main objectives to ensure affordable and nutritious food within the limits of the planet production capacity.
The European industrial strategy (March 2020, updated May 2021) supports the twin transition to a green, sustainable, digital, and resilient economy, making EU industry more competitive globally, and enhancing Europe's open strategic autonomy.
The Circular economy action plan (March 2020) aims to accelerate the transition of the EU economy to a model in which economic activities are not dependent on the extraction of raw materials and the production of waste, but which promotes the re-use of materials within the EU itself and seeks to reduce external dependency on materials.
The EU Hydrogen Strategy (July 2020) aims to develop clean, renewable hydrogen, produced using mainly wind and solar energy as the most compatible option with the EU's climate neutrality goal in the long term.
The Chemicals strategy (October 2020) is part of the EU's zero pollution ambition and aims to better protect citizens and the environment from harmful chemicals and boost innovation by promoting the use of safer and more sustainable chemicals.
The Renovation wave (October 2020) seeks to improve the energy performance of buildings across the EU, promoting energy efficiency and sustainability.
The Mobility Strategy (December 2020) is a comprehensive strategy to meet a target to reduce transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2050 and ensure that the EU transport sector is fit for a clean, digital and modern economy.
The EU Adaptation Strategy (February 2021) sets out how the EU can adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change and become resilient to climate change by 2050. The strategy has four main objectives: to make adaptation smarter, faster, and more systemic, and to strengthen international action for climate resilience.
The EU Action Plan "Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil" (May 2021) is a key deliverable of the European Green Deal, to better prevent, remedy, monitor and report on air, water, soil, and consumer products pollution.

The New Forest strategy 2030 (July 2021) aims to increase the size and quality of Europe's forests and improve their resilience to challenges such as climate change, while supporting communities whose livelihoods depend on forestry.
The REPowerEU (May 2022) is helping the EU save energy, produce clean energy, and diversify its energy supply sources and is focused on the continued delivery of new national REPowerEU chapters under the updated Recovery and Resilience Facility; boosting industrial decarbonization; sign-off and implementation of new legislation for faster renewables roll-out; investments in energy infrastructure and interconnections; regulatory measures to increase energy efficiency; a modern regulatory framework for hydrogen, and a hydrogen accelerator.
The EU Solar energy strategy (May 2022) is a relevant part of the REPowerEU plan as it aims to bring online over 320 GW of solar photovoltaic by 2025 (more than doubling compared to 2020) and almost 600 GW by 2030.

In addition to the Green Deal strategies and regulations, other important European initiatives include:

|  **Smart Cities and Communities Initiative**
Promotes the development of smart sustainable urban areas by integrating technology and data to enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impact. | **Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy**
A valuation commitment by local and regional authorities to exceed the EU's climate and energy targets. | **European Climate Pact**
Engages citizens, communities, and organizations in climate action, fostering collaboration and sharing best practices.  |

At the national level, Portugal has declared a state of climate emergency and has set objectives for the adoption of a mature and assertive climate policy, strengthening the principles of sustainability, cooperation, information, participation, prevention, and accountability, with the right to climate balance being enshrined as a constitutional right, where everyone has the right to a human, healthy and ecologically balanced living environment. The National Spatial Planning Policy Program (PNPOT) 2020 identifies climate change and risks as one of the 18 land-use planning problems.

The exercise of the right to climate balance confers the power to require public and private entities to comply with the duties and obligations to which they are subject in relation to climate issues, namely regarding GHG emission reduction targets set out in the Portuguese Climate Law (LBC). As currently drafted, LBC establishes the need to mitigate the impacts of climate change (promoting the adoption of adaptation measures and increasing resilience to climate change) and to achieve decarbonization targets, without considering the contribution of land use and forests to offset emissions. According to the LBC, Portugal must decrease its GHG emissions by at least 90% by 2050, with interim targets of at least 55% by 2030 and 65-75% by 2040, compared to 2005. In line with the climate goals and decarbonization targets, Portugal has been developing climate policies with a view to climate balance since 2018, when it developed its 2030 National Energy and Climate Plan (PNEC 2030). This strategic document has become the country's main energy and climate policy instrument, proposing guidelines for 2030 by focusing on renewable energy and energy efficiency as tools for decarbonizing the economy and the energy transition. The PNEC 2030 sets a target of up to 47% renewables in the energy mix, aiming to make more and better use of endogenous resources and diversify energy sources to achieve greater energy independence for the country. The sun, wind, rivers, waves, and biomass are natural resources that can and should become cheaper and more accessible forms of energy production, helping to reduce costs

and increase competitiveness for businesses and household budgets. Promoting vehicle electrification, strengthening active, soft, shared, and connected mobility, and improving the supply and quality of public transport are all important in reducing emissions by improving mobility. Also, the PNEC 2030 is based on a fair, democratic and cohesive model of transition, ensuring that opportunities are available and enjoyed by all in an equitable and inclusive manner, and that the most vulnerable are defended and protected. These assumptions are essential for the development of a decarbonized, more competitive, and fairer economy capable of generating jobs, wealth, and prosperity in line with the national goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

Indeed, in 2019, Portugal published its 2050 Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality (RNC2050), which sets out the long-term strategy for a sustainable, zero-carbon economy by 2050. The RNC2050 brings together a range of energy and mobility policies that can reduce GHG emissions by around 85 per cent compared to 2015 and increase carbon sequestration by expanding and strengthening the ecosystem services provided by land use and forestry to offset the 15 per cent of remaining emissions.

For the decade 2021-2030, the entry into force of the following strategies and regulations leading to decarbonization in Portugal should also be highlighted:

National Strategy for Hydrogen (EN-H2) - Promotes the use of hydrogen in the various sectors of the economy, creating the necessary conditions for the establishment of a true hydrogen economy in Portugal.
Long-Term Strategy for Building Renovation in Portugal (ELPRE PT) - Aims to promote the energy efficiency of existing buildings with a view to transforming them into Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB).
National Long-Term Strategy to Fight Energy Poverty (ELPCPE PT) - Aims to reinforce the importance of achieving the indicative targets for the decades 2030, 2040 and 2050, which aim to address issues related to energy poverty and improve the quality of life of citizens.
Decree-Law No. 15/2022 of 14 January - Regulates the operation of the national electricity system in accordance with the European Union directives on the internal electricity market and the promotion of renewable energy. This law incorporates the provisions on renewable self-consumption (and repeals Decree-Law no. 162/2019, of 25 October) and establishes the regulatory framework for the creation of renewable energy communities, citizen energy communities and renewable self-consumption projects.

Regarding climate adaptation, the 2020 National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (ENAAC) was launched in 2015 and will run until 2025. It establishes the model for the implementation of adaptation solutions for different sectors of activity and defines the objectives of adaptation as improving knowledge on climate change, implementing adaptation measures, and promoting the integration of adaptation in sectoral policies and instruments. In order to complement and systematize the results of the ENAAC, the Programme of Action for Adaptation to Climate Change (P-3AC) has been developed, one of the aims of which is to achieve the second objective of the ENAAC, i.e. to implement adaptation measures, particularly with regard to physical interventions that have a direct impact on the territory. In this context, the P-3AC identifies and brings together a series of actions that are considered priority to reduce the vulnerability of the national territory and to increase the resilience of natural and human systems, with a view to promoting the well-being of the population, especially the most vulnerable groups.

The decarbonization of the Portuguese power system foreseen in the RNC2050 has a significant impact on GHG emissions reduction expected by 2030. Alongside, the penetration of green hydrogen in the natural gas distribution network forecasted in the National Strategy for Hydrogen has also a considerable impact on the city decarbonization. Together, these two measures are expected to avoid the emission of over $289\mathrm{ktCO}_{2eq}$ by 2030. Also, the sociodemographic scenarios of the 2050 Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality as well as its assumptions regarding consumption trends in buildings (including industry) and transports, as well as waste management estimates, were used to compute a Business-as-Usual (BaU) scenario for Porto in 2030. This BaU is used for target setting and the assumptions considered (population, gross value added, etc.) are not double counted in further estimations.

At the local level, in the specific context of climate change mitigation, the Municipality of Porto signed the Aalborg Charter (2006) and the Covenant of Mayors (2008), an initiative launched in Europe in 2008 with the aim of bringing together local governments voluntarily committed to meet and exceed the EU's climate and energy targets. The Municipality committed to reduce the city's GHG emissions by $45\%$ between 2004 and 2020, implementing common approaches to decarbonization and adaptation to climate change. In 2019, Porto, as part of a group of 12 European cities, once again signed the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, this time committing to voluntarily reduce carbon emissions by $60\%$ by 2030. In line with the Covenant of Mayors commitment, in 2021, Porto approved its SEAP which details the relevant actions to mitigate climate change, both on the initiative of the Municipality and other stakeholders, which together will contribute to the objective of reducing GHG emissions. Also, since 2016, the Municipality has in place its Municipal Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change. This strategy includes 52 adaptation measures, most of which are already underway. Porto's commitment to these issues is also reflected in its membership to the CDP - Disclosure Insight Action, which provides companies and cities with the world's largest information system for measuring, disclosing, and managing their environmental impacts and strategies resulting from actions taken to mitigate, decarbonize and adapt to climate change. Porto has been recognized as a CDP A-List city for 2020, 2021 and 2022. Currently, to answer the national Climate Law requirements and update its climate goals, the Municipal Climate Action Plan is under development and will be aligned with this Action Plan to ensure a comprehensive guidance towards carbon neutrality.

Figure 17. Porto's SEAP (above) and Municipal Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (below).

To ensure an integrated view of the city and a comprehensive spatial planning, reference should also be made to the Municipal Master Plan (PDM) of Porto, approved in June 2021 and already in implementation, focuses on five guiding axes:

Environment and Quality of Life: This component of the plan includes:
The definition of the environmental city system considering the existing natural risks, the "green" and "blue" structures of the territory and the acoustic zoning.

Porto.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

The valorisation of the municipal ecological structure as a fundamental element of the territory, defined considering the green areas with public access, the green areas with high ecological value, the green corridors along the existing water lines, the alluvial areas and the network of ecological connection providing green corridors along the city's main canal spaces.

The densification of the city's green structure, including:

Doubling the green area of public access through the creation, expansion or requalification of public parks and gardens;
The definition of the green system including spaces associated with urbanizations, publicly or privately owned, with public access;
The afforestation of the city's structuring streets;
The creation of incentives with reduced fees for operations that vacate the interior of blocks, making them permeable green spaces;
The creation of incentives with reduced fees for operations that promote the public use of private spaces in the central area of the city;
The creation of an incentive system that positively discriminates against operations that contribute to the Municipality's environmental policy.

Within this scope, the Municipal Ecological Structure has as its main objective the improvement of the urban space through the preservation and integration of green and natural spaces, recognized as an essential tool to promote the resilience of the territory in the face of climate change. In turn, the Municipal Greening Plan, presented on 17 May 2023, is a strategic document whose main objective is to improve the sustainable public greening of the city of Porto, created with the aim of materializing and implementing, at a finer and more programmatic scale, the vision of the municipal ecological structure included in the PDM revision process. Urban greening, in this case through trees, is particularly important because of the bioclimatic benefits - regulation of thermal and hydrological cycles, release of oxygen, carbon sequestration, trapping of pollutants, etc. - and the opportunities for maximizing biodiversity that it offers.

![img-43.jpeg](img-43.jpeg)

Building and Housing: This component of the plan focuses on:

Functional balance and territorial cohesion, through mitigating the excessive concentration of activity in the city centre by distributing urban loads, as well as strengthening the network of collective facilities.
The expansion of areas with type-morphological criteria for buildability.
Porto.

Strategic densification, through the adjustment of building rates, increased for the construction of accessible or social housing and also with the creation of new areas of economic activity.
The creation of inclusive zoning, which provides those urban operations with a relevant building area, located in the city centre, allocates a percentage of their area to affordable housing.

To accelerate the renovation of buildings and transform them into renewable energy hubs, Porto has launched several initiatives. The city has in place several municipal incentives, both for housing renovation - exemption from municipal taxes in the case of improving the energy efficiency of housing - and for renewable energy production (regulation in public consultation).

![img-44.jpeg](img-44.jpeg)

## Mobility and Transport: This component of the plan includes:

Reinforcing the focus on public transport, with the definition of a structuring network consisting of high-quality bus lanes, circular corridors and radial axes.
Changing the current paradigm in private parking policy, introducing maximum sizing criteria for non-residential uses in the Historic Centre, Downtown and in the areas influenced by existing and planned metro stations.
The creation of “Zones XXI”, where the aim is to progressively eliminate parking in public spaces and along streets, replaced by parking for residents in existing or upcoming collection garages.
The definition of the fundamental structure of the circulation network intended for smooth modes.
The creation of pedestrian zones in the Historic Centre of Porto.

Within this scope, the Sustainable Urban Logistics Plan (PLUS), approved in November 2021 and already in implementation, is a relevant integrated strategic plan that defines an integrated strategy for regulating logistics activities in the city of Porto.

![img-46.jpeg](img-46.jpeg)

## Economy and Employment: This component of the plan provides:

The creation of areas of economic activity defined in the land qualification charter, corresponding to new areas of work and urban identification.
The strategic densification of specific areas of the city.
The reduction of urban taxes on operations that promote street commerce.

The enhancement of the role of university campuses as catalysts for territorial transformation.

![img-47.jpeg](img-47.jpeg)

**Identity and Heritage**: This component of the plan, with great value for the city given its tourist nature, foresees:

The promotion of the Historic Centre and central areas as major references for the urban development of the metropolitan agglomeration.
The creation of a systematized database of protected properties to be preserved, consisting of a set of more than 1000 sites.
The preservation of the identity of urban places, in addition to individual properties, considering the urban fronts, forms of coverage, physical geography, elements of urban identification, vegetation cover, among others. To this end, specific rules were created for areas of urban and architectural interest, for complexes and properties with heritage value and for historic centres and places.
Strengthening the protection of protected areas, with a more geographically contained delimitation but with a more densified identification of the values to be protected and more objective and concrete protection criteria.
The incorporation of the protection of stores, establishments and entities recognized within the scope of the municipal program “Porto de Tradição”.

The objectives for each PDM main topic are detailed in a dedicated website, which also provides all documentation related to the review process.

Urban waste management and the cleaning of public spaces are essential public services for the population, being directly related to the defence of the environment, public health, collective security, economic development and, in general, improving the quality of life of citizens residing in the city of Porto. Transposing a set of European directives into the national law, ambitious targets regarding the reuse and recycling of waste, new obligations regarding the selective collection of bio-waste and other fractions, as well as other equally relevant measures such as the banning of waste that could be recycled or recovered to landfill, are being discussed. Committed to achieving the objectives set by the legislator, including in the National Waste Management Plan approved in March 2023, the Municipality is also now preparing its **Municipal Action Plan for Urban Waste Management (PAPERSU)**. Finally, Porto also has a long-lasting tradition in circular economy, which is one of the key themes in the medium and long-term municipal strategy for Porto's environment. The city wants to increasingly contribute to the regeneration of ecosystems, to the recycling and reducing of waste, to the reuse of by-products as a resource for other processes (for example, treated wastewater), to the involvement of companies, consumers, and other actors in the sector in reflecting on the steps that each one must take in this direction. Porto has been putting a substantial part of its effort into very concrete actions, some of which are reflected in the 2030 Roadmap for a Circular Porto, drawn up in 2017. This document, prepared with the collaboration of several active people and organizations in the city, highlights the main practices and projects taking place while proposes a long-term vision and identifies opportunities and concrete actions to transform Porto into a circular city in 2030.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

The climate emergency has fuelled the city's desire to achieve even bolder goals and in 2021 Porto announced its willingness to become carbon neutral by 2030. This motivation derived the selection of Porto as one of the 100 European carbon neutral Mission Cities. Achieving climate neutrality by 2030 and forestalling the national and European targets by 20 years has become Porto's new goal. To assist the carbon neutrality journey, on 31 January 2022, Porto launched the Porto Climate Pact. This initiative is based on the principle that the path to carbon neutrality in Porto is demanding and requires collective action for collective benefit. Carbon neutrality in Porto can only be achieved through concrete actions by all actors, regardless of their size, past actions, or legal personality. Porto believes that a common vision and goal for decarbonization can help all actors move in the same direction to achieve a common goal. That is why the Porto Climate Pact aims to stimulate action among citizens and organizations, creating a large community of learning, sharing and mutual support.

Currently, Porto Climate Pact is managed by the city Transition Team and works as an umbrella for all neutrality-related actions occurring in the city, meaning that all the progresses being made in the plans presented previously are followed, supported, and monitored by this team. Thus, the portfolio of measures proposed in this Action Plan are aligned with the city current guiding documents, namely its SEAP, the Sustainable Urban Logistics Plan, the Municipal Master Plan, the Municipal Greening Plan, and the Municipal Action Plan for Urban Waste Management.

Together, these measures are expected to avoid the emission of over 416 ktCO₂eq, as presented in table A-2.1. Considering as starting point the BaU baseline emissions and the emissions reduction achieved through national policies (namely the decarbonization of the national power system as well as the penetration of hydrogen in the natural gas distribution network forecasted by the 2050 Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality (RNC2050) and the National Strategy for Hydrogen, respectively), bold emission reduction targets were set up for buildings (-98%), transport (-78%) and waste (-40%). Also, a 140% increase target was set up for carbon sinking. Although ambitious due to the reduced available area for green spaces in the city, this carbon sink target is still insufficient to compensate residual emissions.

Overall, Porto is committed to an 85% emissions reduction target by 2030. As presented below in table A-2.1, this means that the percentage of emissions reduction previously planned through other Action Plans in progress represents 35% of this target, while the rest of the emissions reduction expected through this CCC Action Plan represents 50%. Therefore, 416 ktCO₂eq represents the emissions gap which will be addressed through the comprehensive portfolio of actions defined in the CCC. Still, a 123 ktCO₂eq of unavoidable residual GHG emissions are estimated by 2030 mainly due to the difficulty of provoking a deep change in the way people use transports – Porto is a large urban centre (for Portugal) and is one of the most congested cities on the Iberian Peninsula – and the difficulty of sequester carbon due to the highly urbanised territory.

## 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

### A-3.1: Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

Due to its intricate urban nature, achieving climate neutrality in Porto involves a multifaceted approach that encompasses various systems (technological/infrastructural, institutional/regulatory, organizational, financial, political, social, and behavioural), that play different roles in the city GHG ecosystem. Also, these systems involve different stakeholders which play key roles in the city (as presented in Figure 20 and which resulted from the NZC workshop in Porto). The extensive listing of stakeholders as well as their influence and interest in Porto’s climate neutrality ambition is further described in Table A-3.2.

In addition to municipal entities and local companies, stakeholders mapping highlights the weight of the role of citizens in Porto's path towards carbon neutrality. Besides a fair and economically viable city decarbonization, the Municipality has the transversal objective of

investing in participatory innovation to support the development of new projects, focused on improving the quality of life of citizens and increasing the efficiency of services. This was the motto for the creation of the Porto Innovation Hub (PIH), which aims to demonstrate the potential of innovation in transforming cities, presenting the direct impact of this relationship on improving the quality of life of citizens, contributing to the creation of qualified jobs, and the potential for cities to reach new levels of development. PIH and its social innovation character will be key in engaging citizens in the decarbonization process, functioning as a space to facilitate open and co-creation activities and discussions between citizens, employees, and managers of the Municipality. Through the various ongoing initiatives (including City Café, In-House Innovation sessions and Stepping Out Innovation sessions), PIH proposes the creation of new scenarios and opportunities for innovation and sustainability on an urban scale, contributing to the city's culture of innovation and encouraging citizens to assume the role of drivers of innovation and decarbonization. Additionally, initiatives such as the Porto Climate Pact Talk Series (in which representatives of civil society and citizens may be invited not only as participants, but also as speakers), and tools under development such as the one to be developed within the scope of WAKE UP! are effective ways of motivating and involving the population over time. These principles of continuous stakeholder engagement with a special focus on citizens will be emphasized while implementing the Action Plan, by stressing the role they may play as positive proactive actors of the city's carbon neutrality journey.

By having a clear idea of the critical emission areas which Porto needs to tackle, a more comprehensive mapping of Porto's GHG ecosystem was drafted, based on the knowledge of the different entities composing the City Transition Team (Figure 21). This complex mapping of the city's GHG emissions does not focus only on buildings and transport (the main GHG emitters), but rather represents the comprehensive ecosystem of the city, including all its main GHG emissions sources, the relationships established between them, the synergies that can be established and which originate relevant actions included in Porto's actions portfolio.

As previously mentioned, there is a strong political system and commitment to climate action and carbon neutrality targets at the local level. Porto's leading entities prioritize sustainable policies and engage with higher levels of the national government to influence metropolitan, regional, national, and even international policies to boost climate action. Indeed, the Porto Climate Pact as well as the ambition to bring forward carbon neutrality in Porto are one of the banners of the Porto Municipal Executive which has discussed these goals and all ongoing measures to achieve these objectives with the Municipal Assembly. So far, the Municipal Assembly has generally unanimously approved the proposed strategies, plans and initiatives related to climate neutrality. The most recent is the property tax exemption mechanism for renewable energy producers. It is also worth mentioning the Municipality's commitment to incentivize public transport with continuous incentives through ticketing: Porto will channel the approximately three million euros per year with which it financed free public transport passes to users up to the age of 18 to offer trips free to Porto Card users, now that the Government itself finances this measure.

Shortly after the creation of the Porto Climate Pact and the selection of Porto to the 100 EU cities to become climate neutral and smart by 2030, the Municipality established its Transition Team for engagement of the city's main actors in this project. Since then, members of this team have been working and discussing Porto's carbon neutrality, developing skills and deepening their knowledge on this topic. At the same time, together with Lisbon and Guimarães, the two other Portuguese Mission cities, periodic meetings were organized to share the ongoing activities, and discuss barriers and challenges, as well as good practices and opportunities. These meetings also partially served to debate the relevance of the national network of cities aiming to reach carbon neutrality, as well as establishing the three Portuguese Mission cities as leaders of this network. At an international level, Porto's long-lasting participation as Chair of Eurocities Environment Forum (from 2018 to 2022) as well as on the Board of Directors of Energy Cities, allows the city to be at the forefront of carbon neutrality and discuss this topic with European front-runner cities.

Also, Porto enjoys a leadership position in the Porto Metropolitan Area. By being a pioneer in the implementation of several projects related to carbon neutrality (e.g., *Asprela + Sustentável*), Porto has set the pace for many neighbouring municipalities being aligned with the ambition to accelerate carbon neutrality. Proof of this is the expression of interest in participating in the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities EU Mission from neighbour municipalities (e.g., Maia and Matosinhos) and their public commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2030. This positioning allows Porto to work with neighbouring municipalities and at a metropolitan level on larger-scale intra-municipal and regional projects with significant impact, particularly in terms of mobility (e.g., metro lines and metropolitan transport strategies).

Having covered the political will/ leadership and policy advocacy requirements, for reaching the Porto climate neutrality target, the first systems that come to mind are technological/infrastructural, namely the need to: 1) invest in and expand the use of renewable energy sources and infrastructure such as solar power; 2) implement technologies and practices that enhance energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industrial processes; and 3) develop intelligent energy distribution systems - smart grids - to optimize energy use and integrate renewable energy sources. This political will is key to get things done. The maintenance of strategic partnerships with entities as E-REDES, the Portuguese Distribution System Operator (DSO), through initiatives as the Energy Transition Centre has enabled Porto to reinforce its smart grids infrastructure over the last few years. At the moment, Porto has one of the most extensive national smart metering infrastructure, covering almost all electrical installations. This collaboration has allowed the Municipality to develop several pioneering projects in terms of digitalization and the application of advanced smart grid concepts, such as real-time monitoring and demand side management (Asprela + Sustentável). Also, the

continuous investments made over the last few years in public transport, housing and renewable production constitute currently a strong and robust support for the implementation of this plan, both due to the infrastructure already implemented and the internal technical capacity acquired. As an example, the city has in place several municipal incentives, both for housing renovation and for renewable energy production. However, these incentives do not appear to be sufficient to massively accelerate investment in building renovation, and although the city centre currently has a large stock of renovated buildings due to growing tourism pressure and a sustainable local housing strategy, the outskirts of the city still have many buildings in serious need of renovation. As a way of supporting people in the process of renovating their homes, the city has had the Porto Energy Hub since September 2022. Developed as part of the EU-funded Porto Energy ElevatoR project, the Porto Energy Hub is a physical and virtual one-stop-shop to help citizens implement energy efficiency and renewable energy production in their homes. In addition, over the last few decades, Porto has made significant investments in the renovation of social housing managed by the city. In total, Porto has invested more than 150 million euros in these buildings.

Institutional/regulatory systems are no less important. Establish and implement climate action plans, as the city SEAP, that outline strategies, goals, and actions for reducing GHG emissions at the same time as a city transformation is boosted is vital, as well as to rigorously enforce regulations on energy efficiency, renewables, transports, etc. In turn, adopting zoning regulations and land use policies that encourage sustainable urban development, energy-efficient buildings, and green spaces should not be underplayed. Spatial planning is often called the 'framework' for implementing mitigation and adaptation measures at the local and regional level. In this setting, the city Master Plan is a key policy tool. In addition, to promote sustainable transportation choices and encourage sustainable consumption patterns, the behavioural system is also addressed in Porto as a way of prioritizing public transit, cycling, and walking, as well as the use of energy-efficient appliances and eco-friendly products. This system is closely linked to the social system, which can be strengthened by increasing public awareness and education about climate change, sustainable practices, and the benefits of acting on climate change from a young age. This behavioural change is key in what concerns transport as a major shift in the city's mobility strategy is needed if Porto is to achieve its carbon neutrality goals. Major investments have been made in the urban transport sector in recent years (reflecting the long-lasting city work on this topic):

# Metro Line expansion

As part of the Recovery and Resilience Program, Porto will have three new metro lines (extension of the yellow line, new pink and ruby lines) and a BRT [Bus Rapid Transit], with a total investment of over 908 million euros.
Note: All the works on both the several metro lines and the BRT already started.

# Decarbonization of public on-road vehicles (municipal fleet)

A municipal investment of around 10 million euros has recently been made in the acquisition of more sustainable equipment and vehicles for the municipal company that operates in the field of urban cleaning and waste collection, in addition to the rental contract for light electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the municipality, which from 2017 will allow Porto to save money as well as reducing  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions into the atmosphere.

# Free access to public transport modes

Bus and metro tickets are free for the elderly, children and young people (up to 18 years). More and more young people are taking part in this measure, which is proving to be effective, and it is financially supported by the city council at a cost of over 17 million euros (until 2030).

Figure 22. Example of actions taken to improve Porto's mobility.

Figures show that the number of passengers using public transport is increasing - in 2022, Metro do Porto exceeded 65 million validations and in 2023 the value surpassed 79 million validations, the best result the company has ever achieved. In the same direction, the number of passengers transported
Porto.

by the city's main bus operator in 2022 increased by 35% compared to 2021 and 7,5% in 2023 compared to 2022. Despite the increases in buses, STCP still have 96,3% of the 2019 passengers (the best result before COVID-19). Still, national and metropolitan statistics also show that the share of people travelling by private car on a daily basis remains constant (and is even increasing). Thus, despite the efforts, the city needs to do more in this area. Porto is currently developing a more ambitious strategy for mobility in the city - continuing to invest in public transport, promoting soft mobility and establishing a new parking policy. These are key objectives of the city Master Plan to improve accessibility and mobility conditions in the city, while reducing GHG emissions.

Community engagement is also important, by involving citizens in decision-making processes and encouraging community-led initiatives. Therefore, the organizational system should foster collaboration and partnerships among local governments, businesses, NGOs, and community groups to implement joint climate initiatives and build/strengthen the capacity of local government and organizations to plan, implement, and monitor climate actions effectively.

Finally, regarding the financial system, it is important to develop green financial mechanisms to support climate-friendly projects, including subsidies, and incentives, and attract private investment in sustainable infrastructure and technologies and engage in public-private partnerships. Also, due to its privileged location and economic development in the recent years, Porto can currently be considered a magnet to attract funding, both public and private. The most recent Ernest &amp; Young (EY) study on Portugal's attractiveness in terms of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was presented in September 2023, which confirms the country's upward trajectory, with Porto at the forefront. EY highlights the city's "upward trajectory", reflected in the more than 2250 foreign companies based in the region, "including technology centres and IT services from around the world such as Natixis, Euronext, Kantar, TeamViewer, Maersk or Critical Techworks. Indeed, the city created InvestPorto, an investment promotion agency founded by Porto City Council to promote, win and support investments in key areas for a more sustainable and competitive future. Also, the city has extensive experience in applying for both National and Regional Operational Programs, namely Norte 2030, and the Recovery and Resilience Program. The Municipality and its municipal entities are qualified to prepare and execute projects. Furthermore, the Municipality and the Transition Team have mapped out a series of international financing opportunities in strategic areas such as

climate science and solutions, energy supply, energy systems and grids, buildings in energy transition, communities and cities, clean, safe, and accessible transport and mobility, smart mobility, circular economy, sustainable waste management, etc. New opportunities within the scope of the New European Bauhaus (due to Porto's goal of creating a more sustainable, inclusive, and beautiful environment for its citizens), LIFE and Horizon Europe programs.

The discussions held on the

Concept developed and approved in 2022 for the European City Facility program, which was now revised and updated.

![img-51.jpeg](img-51.jpeg)
Figure 24. Listing of barriers, challenges and required levers of change.

Regarding barriers, the following have been identified:

Governance barriers are common to all emission sectors (except industry, which has its own characteristics) and are mainly related to the need to articulate and involve the various internal departments of the Municipality, the municipal entities, and the main stakeholders of the city around a common goal. This barrier has been overcome through the creation of a Transition Team, coordinated by the Directorate of Carbon Neutrality of Porto, an internal unit of the municipal company Porto Ambiente, created specifically with the purpose of guiding the city's entities to work in the same direction.
Multilevel governance: Also, from a governance perspective, the city still faces challenges in aligning local goals with central government and national targets. There are several examples where the scope of the city's executive action goes far beyond the Municipality's remit (e.g., structural roads that cross the city and worsen the mobility in the city), making government support essential for achieving local climate neutrality. To mitigate this challenge,

# BOX 4: Multilevel alignment

Despite being autonomous about the actions to be implemented in its territory, the Municipality depends on external actors when it comes to:

Transport: Strategic decisions such as the construction of new metro lines have to be taken at central state level due to the required investment. In turn, due to the existence of metropolitan public transport solutions (such as public bus), decisions that affect these joint services have to be taken at the metropolitan council level.
Roads and strategic infrastructures - The municipality of Porto is crossed by the Via de Cintura Interna (VCI), a fast road with the profile of a motorway that loops around the central area of the urban centres of Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia, in an extension of 21 km. VCI is considered the transversal problem of traffic in Porto, as result of intense traffic and congestion that sometimes extends for long kilometres. The intensification of the traffic problem in recent years was the reason for the creation of a working group that includes representatives from three municipalities - Porto, Matosinhos and Maia -, Infraestruturas de Portugal (IP) and specialist technicians, with a view to carrying out a survey of existing problems and the definition of a strategy for VCI. The medium and short-term conclusions were announced in April 2021, with the working group meetings resulting in 27 measures aimed at to improve VCI circulation. However, action depends on the consensus of the three municipalities and the Government's decision, without which measures cannot be implemented. In this sense, in order to implement effective solutions, a joint front and the support from the Government is necessary to resolve the biggest congestion problem in the city of Porto.
National goals, funding and regulations: The expected decarbonization of the electricity sector and natural gas supply, with the increase in renewable production capacity and the introduction of hydrogen or other renewable gases into natural gas supply networks, essential for the decarbonization of the country and municipalities, are dependent on national policies and investments. Additionally, the formulation of key regulations as well as the scanning of permitting processes for the massification of renewable energy communities, energy certification, construction of NZEB buildings, etc., as well as the release of community funds channelled through the Government, hinder the action of the municipality and its actors.

Porto's participation in the National Network of Cities and Regions for Carbon Neutrality (Figure 8) is expected to contribute to the development of a closer and facilitated relationship with several key entities, among which, the Government, which has a crucial role in the local decarbonization.

and as discussed previously, Porto is participating in a national network of Portuguese cities that aim to accelerate carbon neutrality and discuss this issue directly with the central government, decreasing the dependence of external entities.

Barriers resulting from the specificities of each sector: In the Energy sector, the physical characteristics of the electrical system can hinder the injection of distributed photovoltaic production; in Buildings, the demanding nearly zero-emission building (NZEB) requirements for new buildings can pose difficulties; in Industry, the low flexibility and specificity of production processes can hinder the shifting of used energy vectors or the use of non-energy products; in Transport, the still limited storage capacity of vehicles (especially for public transport) and the difficulty of converting existing fossil-fuel vehicles to sustainable ones; and in Waste, the difficulty of reducing and managing organic matter or improving recycling rates. These are just a few examples of sector-specific barriers that affect the transformative change required in Porto. To these must be added the barriers imposed by the characteristics of the city: mobility and the availability of green spaces in Porto are largely influenced by its geography and land use, while the classification of the historic centre as a UNESCO World Heritage Site restricts energy efficiency

interventions in buildings (which must maintain the original design, which affects the thermal insulation of external facades and interventions in glazing) and the installation of rooftop renewable production systems, both for electricity production and water heating. These restrictions must be overcome both through increased knowledge and innovation, and through technological progress with the emergence of alternative energy systems and construction technique.

Knowledge and literacy barriers, whether in technical terms, available financing mechanisms or in terms of legal frameworks/licensing procedures, have also been identified as barriers to the implementation of energy efficiency measures and renewable energy production in buildings (residential, commercial, and local/public administration), as well as more sustainable practices in terms of waste management and use of water resources. In

order to reduce these barriers, initiatives such as the Porto Energy Hub and the Porto Climate Pact Talk Series have been implemented to disseminate information and increase the capacity of the population to adopt more efficient behaviours and practices. In addition, at a technical level, the Municipality often draws on the support and advice of the local scientific and academic ecosystem, as well as the AdEPorto (Porto Energy Agency), to increase the capacity of its internal staff.

Access to funding and leveraging of private financing to implement urban transformation is also a barrier that cuts across all sectors. This barrier is overcome both by taking advantage of the available funding programs (operational programs, Recovery and Resilience Program (Next Generation EU Funds), structural funds, etc.) and by exploring alternative business models that leverage private investment to accelerate city transition.

Additionally, the generalized shortage of human resources (across all sectors), both at the technical and implementation levels, which can be particularly worrying in the building (e.g. renovation works) and transport (e.g. construction of new metro lines) sectors, is also a relevant obstacle to consider, as it can have a significant impact on the implementation of projects. This scarcity of human resources can lead to significant social changes, both in terms of the quality of life of the population and in the local economy, with implications for (un)employment and wealth creation. In addition to the shortage of labour, there is also a shortage of materials (e.g. components for photovoltaic systems) due to the pandemic crisis and the war situation in Europe, which has a negative impact on the execution time and cost of projects.

Also noteworthy are the barriers to digitization, both due to the lack of a massive roll-out of smart metering in buildings and sophisticated information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructures that allow real-time monitoring and management of energy data (consumption and production), and the infrastructural barriers that delay the massification of distributed photovoltaic production and electric mobility. Both barriers can only be overcome with massive investment in electrical and communication infrastructures and the development of appropriate technologies for monitoring and managing big data.

Social barriers should also be considered. On the one hand, both economic and energy poverty are relevant social risks at the city level. According to municipal data, more than 28 thousand residents currently live in social housing complexes owned by the Municipality (around 12% of the total resident population). Of these, more than 28% are retired and 8% are isolated elderly people. The vision of Porto Executive is that no one should be left behind in the decarbonization process. Thus, in addition to the investments in energy efficiency and improvement of thermal comfort conditions in these buildings made over the last few years and to continue in the coming years, to which must be added the foreseen municipal investments in renewable production, the Municipality has now the ambition to reinforce the engagement of the most vulnerable segment of the population through targeted campaigns and sessions (similar to the ones developed under the scope of the URBiNAT project), which allow citizens to have a say in the city carbon neutrality plans. On the other hand, experiences and initiatives as the Porto Energy Hub reveal that, even the citizens with the necessary capacity to make investments (whether in the rehabilitation of their homes, in the replacement of equipment or in renewable energy production), they usually do not know how and need suitable support to carry out these interventions. In this sense, the Municipality intends to reinforce this service through parishes and other nearby entities, in order to reach more citizens.

Despite these challenges, one thing is clear: A collective understanding of the carbon neutrality task requires a collaborative and inclusive approach. Several strategies can and will be used to foster collective understanding and ownership, as well as to incorporate different viewpoints in addressing the complexity of climate action for neutrality in Porto. These are based on the fostering of multidisciplinary discussions, as the ones occurred during 2023 in the Porto Climate Pact Talk Series, including experts from different fields such as urban planning, environmental science, economics, sociology and engineering, and sectors such as government, industry, academia and civil society.

The strategies are summarized as follows:

# Stakeholder Engagement

Inclusive Processes: Engage a diverse range of stakeholders, including local residents, businesses, community organizations, academic institutions, and governmental agencies.
Participatory Decision-Making: Involve stakeholders in the decision-making process to ensure that a variety of perspectives are considered.
HOW TO DO IT? Through sessions as the Porto Climate Pact Talk Series in which guest speakers and experts from different topics share good practices, ideas and ambitions on topics relevant to the city and where assistance is challenged to make suggestions, questions and provide comments on the topics covered. The large number of citizens participating in this municipal initiative demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach and the importance of the carbon neutrality topic for civil society, reflected in the growing number of citizens signing the Pact at the personal level. Also, the lessons learned from initiatives as URBINAT, ConDomus and Porto Orgânico will also be used to foster stakeholders engagement.

# Data Sharing and Transparency

Open Data Platforms: Create platforms for sharing relevant data openly, allowing various stakeholders to access and analyze information.
Transparency in Decision-Making: Ensure transparency in decision-making processes, providing stakeholders with insights into the factors considered.
HOW TO DO IT? Porto has currently an open-data platform which includes daily data, such as traffic intensity, public transport use, internet use on public buses, $\mathrm{NO}_2$ emissions and noise levels. This platform aims to support decision making and urban management and will be shortly updated with energy data and other relevant information. Developed by Porto Digital, in partnership with NOVA Information Management School, the platform was presented at the International Data Corporation (IDC) Future of Digital Innovation, in Lisbon, and at the Smart City Expo World Congress, in Barcelona.

# Community-Based Research

Local Knowledge Integration: Recognize and integrate local knowledge and expertise from community members who have insights into specific challenges and opportunities.
Community-Led Initiatives: Support and amplify community-led research and initiatives that address climate issues from the ground up.
HOW TO DO IT? Through the fostering of local academia and research outcomes and the use of the city as a living lab for smarter cities, thus creating the conditions for future research and development in areas such as sustainability, mobility, urban planning and information and communication technology (e.g., Asprela+Sustentável project).

# Scenario Planning

Future Scenario Development: Utilize scenario planning exercises and digital twinning tools to explore different possible futures and their implications.
Stakeholder Workshops: Conduct workshops to involve stakeholders in the creation and exploration of alternative scenarios.
HOW TO DO IT? The city is taking the first steps on the development of a digital twin for a specific area of the city, under the scope of the ASCEND project. This tool, which allows for simulate alternative scenarios, will be expanded for other parts of the city and included in Porto's urban data platform. This process will be informed by local stakeholders. The city has experience with the organization of citizen engagement sessions and focus groups, as shown by the Porto Climate Pact Talk Series.

# Feedback Mechanisms

Continuous Feedback Loops: Establish mechanisms for continuous feedback from stakeholders throughout the planning and implementation processes.
Adaptive Management: Be willing to adapt strategies based on feedback and changing circumstances.
HOW TO DO IT? The continuous monitoring of municipal facilities' consumption through the Energy Observatory provided by the AdEPorto as well as the new engagement and feedback tool to be developed under the scope of the WAKE UP! pilot are expected to foster consecutive feedback loops which are key to inform future energy decisions.

# Communication Strategies

Effective Communication Channels: Use various communication channels to disseminate information about climate action initiatives and engage diverse audiences.
Clear and Accessible Language: Ensure that communication materials are presented in clear, accessible language to reach a broad audience.
HOW TO DO IT? Use city platforms as preferred communication channels (e.g., Porto Card, WAKE UP! app, etc.) and the Porto Climate Pact brand as umbrella for the development of a coherent and unified communication strategy.

# Education and Awareness

Educational and training Programs: Implement educational programs to increase awareness of systemic issues related to climate action.
HOW TO DO IT? By taking advantage of the structure responsible for the activity of education for sustainability in the Municipality and municipal companies and increasing their skills and competencies, as well as areas of activity.

For 2022, the value of 150 thousand euros was set for each parish council. This mechanism, called collaborative budgeting, aims to be an instrument of participatory democracy of proximity, through which citizens are given the possibility of submitting investment proposals, choosing the projects they wish to see implemented. The proposals to be supported within the scope of the collaborative budget must be concerned with promoting sustainability as a whole.

## B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

Knowing the city's ecosystem, the potential barriers to implementation and the levers that can be developed to circumvent them, the Transition Team was ready to start drafting the carbon neutrality vision for the city in 2030 (Figure 26). This vision of the city was co-created together with the city's stakeholders in the workshop held in April 2023. The collected ideas transversally cover all sectors, apart from industry, which does not have a significant presence in the city, and several levers of change. The focus on the green structure and the economic and social prosperity of the city also revealed central in this co-creation process (Figure 27).

Figure 27. Priority areas of the portfolio of actions of Porto (results from the joint workshop held in April 2023 with the NZC team).

Considering the outputs of these exercises, the portfolio of actions undertaken and to be undertaken by the city was refined to include both actions based on readily available technology (e.g., building renovation, renewable energy production) and new projects based on technologies and systems still in experimental stages (e.g., incorporation of hydrogen in natural gas networks), creating space for innovation labs and regulatory sandboxes in the city. Indeed, Porto is known for its innovative spirit. In 2021, for instance, the publication 'Urban Future with a Purpose' highlighted Porto City Council's commitment to improving the urban life of its citizens, with work in areas such as mobility, environment, government, and security. The study praises the city's drive for innovation and creativity. For example, in the chapter dedicated to digital innovation ecosystems, Porto is cited as a good example, alongside the cities of Espoo (Finland) and New York (United States). "In 2016, Porto began to position itself as a city of innovation and creativity. It created what is currently known as Porto Innovation Hub, an innovation aggregator in which the city functions as a living laboratory, bringing together businesses, entrepreneurs, citizens, and the Municipality to promote problem solving", noted the Deloitte team. The study also mentions that "Porto was chosen as a mentor city in the European Commission's 100 Intelligent Cities Challenge program. This decision was a recognition of the digitalization effort and scalability potential. The city stood out in 2020, when it won first place in Monocle magazine's ranking of the best small cities to live in, for its environmental ambition, business-friendly environment, inclusion, and accessibility". Currently, the city of Porto was chosen again as a mentor city in the Intelligent Cities Challenge 2.0 edition.

The proposed actions derive from the pipeline of projects underway by different municipal companies and the city's main partners until 2030. These actions comprise concrete and soft interventions which have been quantified in terms of both carbon impact and investment required, as the city aims to achieve carbon neutrality in a financially viable way. Stakeholders have also been mapped to help identify and build synergies. This mapping of projects and initiatives also allowed the Transition Team to better consider social, economic and governance co-impacts, both positive (such as the increase in economic activity in pedestrianized streets in the historic centre, etc.) and negative (such as the impact on quality of life and economic activity resulting from the long duration of construction of new metro and Bus Rapid Transit lines).

The impact pathways listed in Table B-1.1 are tailored to the proposed actions and derive from the experience already gathered through the implementation of some projects in the city (and being monitored, e.g., renewable energy production in social housing) and the indicators proposed for their measurement and evaluation over time, which allow a comprehensive understanding of their systemic effects for the city (e.g., improved air quality, noise reduction, etc.). The knowledge gathered from the deployment of the Investment Concept developed under the scope of the EUCF program was also key for defining Porto's impact pathways.

The effects of the listed impact pathways should be monitored taking into account the target values proposed in Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning, together with the respective metadata sheets, which will allow for an adequate assessment of progress and the evolution towards climate neutrality at the same time that the effects on society and the economy are analysed. Therefore, the rationale for choosing the long-term and short-term impact pathways are presented below. Also, the priority of each impact pathway as well as the indicative implementation chronogram are presented as follows.

The portfolio of actions presented in this Action Plan includes a mix of immediate actions that Porto is already implementing and long-term strategies the Municipality is currently drafting, reflecting a comprehensive approach to achieving sustained carbon neutrality in the city. Due to the carbon emission reduction, they represent and the potential effect they may have on local population (especially in the vulnerable one), some of these measures are considered as priority. As most of these priority actions (ES.01, ES.02.A, ES.04, MT.01, MT.05) are solely dependent on the Municipality, the implementation of these actions is facilitated as the City Executive is committed to carbon neutrality and has budget dedicated for this purpose. In turn, actions as ES.02.B, MT.02.B, MT.04.A, although not dependent on the Municipality, they will be implemented by entities that work closely with the Municipality, such as STCP, Metro do Porto, LIPOR, among others, which also facilitates implementation as it gives them greater visibility and relevance. In addition, some of these measures, although implemented and dependent on private action, such as BE.03, BE.04 and BE.05, are facilitated by the action of the Municipality, through for instance the Porto Energy Hub service and the digital infrastructure already existing in the city. Lastly, actions as ES.03 which are only reliant on private actors, are facilitated and fostered by the engagement of these agents within the Porto Climate Pact as it allows them to share best practices and discuss challenges with other entities implementing similar projects.

Additionally, the Transition Team ensured that the identified impact pathways are well-aligned with Porto's 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments, highlighting the strategic priorities of achieving a greener environment, better mobility options, increased use of clean energy, and promoting circular and sustainable practices across the different fields of action.

![img-54.jpeg](img-54.jpeg)

Actions in the field of Green Infrastructure &amp; Nature-Based Solutions (GI) directly contribute to the commitment of doubling the area of gardens and urban parks, using nature-based solutions. Specifically, GI.01 Increased green infrastructure (carbon sink) focuses on expanding green spaces, contributing to carbon sequestration and the overall well-being of the city.

Mobility and Transport actions are closely aligned with the commitment to better mobility. MT.01 Reduced motorized passenger transportation needs and MT.03 Increased shared mobility and MaaS options (as well as MT.05) encourage more sustainable and efficient transportation options, promoting active and shared mobility and reducing the dependency of private transportation needs. In turn, MT.02 Reduced pkm traveled by car - shift to public and electric transport, MT.04 Electrification of private vehicles, and MT.06 Electrification of light and heavy freight vehicles contribute to the goal of decarbonized mobility.

![img-55.jpeg](img-55.jpeg)

Energy Systems actions strongly align with the commitment to more clean energy. ES.01 Purchase of  $100\%$  certified renewable energy ensures clean energy sourcing, while ES.02.A to ES.02.D and ES.03 involve renewable energy generation in various sectors, including municipal and private buildings, and industry. These actions contribute to decentralizing renewable energy production and fostering local energy sharing, promoting sustainability in energy consumption. ES.04  $100\%$  LED street lighting equipped with control and monitoring system, BE.01 Renovation of existing buildings, BE.03 Efficient lighting and appliances and BE.04 Digitalization, literacy and awareness and BE.05 Decarbonized space and water heating generation are also directly aligned with the strategic energy efficiency priorities.

![img-56.jpeg](img-56.jpeg)

Waste and Circular Economy actions address the commitment to greater circularity. WCE.01 Increased waste recycling, WCE.02 Optimized processes and efficiency in wastewater treatment facilities, and actions in the Built Environment field, including BE.01 Renovation of existing buildings and BE.02 Construction of new energy-efficient buildings, contribute to reducing unnecessary resource consumption and promoting circular practices, including in construction. Additionally, BE.04 Digitalization, energy literacy, and awareness support sustainability in energy consumption.

At this stage it will not be possible to accurately quantify or provide numerical estimates for all co-benefits resulting from the identified impact pathways listed above, either due to their typology or due to the difficulty in collecting data for this assessment. However, the main co-benefits can be estimated over the 2030 horizon as presented in Table B-3.1. The monitoring of these co-benefits will be done according to the methodology and data described in the indicators' metadata sheets presented in Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning.

Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) is a critical process in the context of Porto's Action Plan. At present, Porto can identify a selection of indicators to monitor and evaluate progress along the defined impact pathways and wider fields of action described in Module B-1, together with a preliminary Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (M&amp;E) plan (B-3.1 and B-3.2), that offers milestones and a timeline (2025, 2027 and 2030). In addition, a checklist for the development of a MEL plan is presented, as the learning part of MEL, the process by which information generated by M&amp;E is reflected upon and deliberately used to continuously improve a project's ability to achieve results, is

the one most at risk of being disregarded. Therefore, both the MEL cycle and MEL planning are almost fully covered. There are several MEL tools that can help to visually represent impact pathways and related indicators. The Theory of Change has been used, but others, such as the Weaver's Triangle⁵ and the Log Frame⁶, can allow an action to be presented in a logical way, helping to assess the extent to which the actions identified are working towards climate neutrality.

For Porto, MEL planning included establishing a baseline (2019), a plan for carrying out routine monitoring (on a yearly basis), and mid-term (2025 and 2027) and final (2030) evaluations, as mentioned above, described throughout this document, and summarized in B-3.1 and B-3.2. During the CCC period, monitoring will be therefore an ongoing process and a significant effort will be put on MEL activities, including detailed staff work plans and regular reviews to be scheduled with partners (members of the Transition Team, targeted Porto Climate Pact subscribers, or others considered relevant for data gathering) to ensure that monitoring is taking place.

The mid-term evaluation will allow the city to take stock of where Porto's CCC stands and whether the city is on track and on target, not only in terms of early changes, but also in terms of late outcomes and direct impact. By 2030, a final evaluation will be carried out in collaboration with city partners to determine whether, in addition to early changes, late outcomes and the direct impact of reducing carbon emissions, actions have made a real difference in Porto's communities and to assess if the city suffered a systemic transformation as foreseen - indirect impacts.

The indicators identified in the next sections measure the outcome(s) or impact(s) of one or more of the actions in this Action Plan and show how close an action is to the desired pathway and targets. As observable and measurable characteristics, they can be used to show the progress an action is making towards achieving a specific target. Targets were determined considering baseline data, collected from two sources: primary data collected directly from target areas/communities (most of it already collected by the city) and secondary data from written records and national statistics.

Once the final evaluation has been completed, Porto should take time to review it and take note of any lessons learned from challenges, failures and take aways to adjust approaches and improve future initiatives. This stage provides an opportunity to use these learnings to inform decision-making and strategy refinement, identify successful interventions and best practices that can be scaled up or replicated, as well as an input for new action ideas.

Porto's MEL plan will be a working document produced to guide the city on how and when to implement MEL activities. In the context of CCC, this plan will be continuously refined and improved over time (i.e., regularly reviewed and updated with more comprehensive monitoring mechanisms and indicators).

Although there is a clear notion of the necessity of reflecting on information and learning from it to improve the CCC performance, detailed planning on how to go about it can be further demonstrated in a MEL plan. For Porto, this plan will be created and put into practice right after the submission of the CCC. Often there is an additional risk that the learning stays with the people directly involved in these processes and lost if those people leave, if not properly shared. It is therefore necessary to ensure that there is appropriate documentation of processes and reports and adequate storage of MEL outputs to keep the learning within the Municipality and the partners when key staff leave or members of the Transition Team change.

The specific data required to monitor the progress of Porto's Climate City Contract implementation analysis will vary depending on the goals and strategies adopted. Nevertheless, the following stand out:

B-2.1: Description of action portfolios

|  Fields of action | Portfolio description  |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  List of actions | Descriptions  |
|  Energy systems (ES) | ES.01Purchase of 100% certified renewable energy | Since 2020, all the electricity purchased by the Municipality of Porto (and its municipal companies) for its municipal buildings and public use is renewable. The electricity is classified through guarantees of origin that prove the source of the energy supplied.  |
|   |  ES.02Renewable energy generation in buildings | ES.02.A Renewable generation in municipal buildings: The city is actively working towards the production of decentralized energy, both for self-consumption and in community projects, engaging in a variety of projects to achieve this goal. This activity involves the use of municipal public buildings for energy production, taking advantage of the existing rooftop areas for self-consumption renewable energy generation. ES.02.B Renewable energy community from waste: The municipalities that constitute LIPOR (Association of Municipalities for the Sustainable Waste Management of Porto), are discussing the creation of an intermunicipal energy community - the first in the country - to capitalize on the surplus electricity produced through the incineration of domestic waste. The objective is to optimize the 170 thousand MWh of electrical energy generated annually for the benefit of municipal entities, companies, and citizens in the region, transforming waste into a valuable energy resource. ES.02.C Renewable energy communities as tools to mitigate energy poverty: Porto owns a considerable number of residential buildings targeted at social housing. Porto City Council manages a housing stock made up of around 50 municipal neighbourhoods, with around 13 000 dwellings, where around 28 000 people live. The Municipality is, therefore, the largest landlord in the city, responsible for around 13% of the built stock. Considering the available rooftop area and the contribution that cheaper renewable energy may have on energy poverty alleviation, Porto has in place an ambitious roadmap to create renewable energy communities (REC), including social housing and nearby municipal facilities as schools and administrative buildings. Porto has already implemented the first REC in the Agra do Amial neighbourhood and is now taking diligences to replicate the process across the city. Indeed, this municipal ambition created the scene for the development of the first positive energy district in the Municipality, currently under development as part of the ASCEND project and which focuses on a particular area of the city with a large concentration of social housing and buildings under municipal management. ES.02.D Renewable generation in private buildings and facilities: Following the steps of the city executive, local businesses and companies operating in the city are also taking the first steps to produce renewable energy, taking advantage of their rooftops. Among these entities are the Hospital de São João, the University of Porto and the Porto Polytechnic Institute, STCP, among other. The interest of privates with renewable production is even expected to increase with a new city tax incentive for reducing Municipal Property Taxes to private owners (both residential, commercial, or industrial) who install PV systems in their buildings and facilities.  |

|   |  List of actions | Descriptions  |
|   | ES.03 Renewable energy generation in Porto's industry | EnergyCon, an energy service company, is implementing a REC, in the industrial area of Porto, in partnership with the local Volunteer Firefighters. This REC, which will be developed by the company, will involve an investment of over 25 million euros, and has a social nature as the company will give up 10% of the REC's profitability for the local firefighters. The company estimates that the REC will bring together more than 60 members and be almost finished by 2026. Also, according to the company estimates, the full-operating REC will avoid the emission of around 25 thousand tons of carbon dioxide.  |
|   |  ES.04 100% LED street lighting equipped with control and monitoring system | Porto is currently finishing the replacement of its street lighting infrastructure (26 000 luminaires) for LED technology at the same time as it is implementing a remote management control system. The smart and centralized control of the street lighting infrastructure will make it possible to better respond to the effective lighting needs of different urban contexts, implement routines for greater energy efficiency, and optimize equipment availability rates, also contributing to improve the security and mobility in the city. This system is complemented by a smart traffic lighting feature capable of actively control traffic lights in accordance with data received by the city Traffic Management video surveillance system (a network of traffic controllers spread across the city).  |
|  Mobility & transport (MT) | MT.01 Reduced motorized passenger transportation need | Porto's Master Plan promotes the enhancement of accessibility and mobility conditions, with a new approach to public transport modes, a focus on the structure dedicated to soft mobility and a new parking policy. This component of the program includes: - The reinforcement of the focus on public transport, with the definition of a structuring network consisting of high-quality bus lanes, circular corridors, and radial axes. - A deep change in the current private parking policy, introducing criteria for non-residential uses in the Historic Centre, Downtown and in the areas influenced by existing and planned metro stations. - The creation of “Zones XXI”, where the aim is to progressively eliminate parking in public spaces and along streets, replaced by parking for residents in existing or upcoming parking lots. - The definition of the network intended for smooth modes (more cycling lanes, e-scooters and bicycles sharing and parking enhanced across the city). - The creation of pedestrian zones in the Historic Centre of Porto (four restricted motor vehicle access zones implemented and seven more planned and Network 20 program).  |
|   |  MT.02 Reduced km traveled by car - shift to public and electric transport | MT.02.A Encouraging the use of public transport through ticketing: Porto is actively fostering public transport use through several initiatives. The free access to public transport was granted within the scope of the measures of the Public Transport Fare Reduction Support Program (PART), launched in 2019, in the Porto Metropolitan Area and which guarantees fare reduction for the entire population and free of charge public transport until the age of 12. In this context, Porto went further and extended the free provision up to 15 years. The success of the measure led to the Municipality extending the free public transport ticketing initiative in the 2020/2021 school year up to 18 years old, thus making it coincide with the national mandatory education age. Additionally, in January 2024 a new measure was announced: all Porto Card users will be  |

|   |  | entitled to 22 free trips per year, either on the city's public buses or on the metro. The application of this measure was possible due to the entry into force, at the beginning of the year, of intermodal passes for students up to the age of 23 covered by the Government, meaning that the Porto City Council no longer had an annual expenditure of around three million of euros with the under-18 pass, being able to use this money to generate the creation of new public transport demand. Furthermore, this year, the Municipality is going to implement the extension of the existing on-demand transport model to the general population, reaching areas where public transport is not yet effective.

**MT.02.B Encouraging the use of public transport through new and better offer:** Increasing the quality and quantity of public transport, namely buses and metro, is also a priority to attract users to public transport. In this sense, the main city transport companies, namely, *STCP* and *Metro do Porto* have joined forces to reinforce and improve the quality of the service provided, whether through the reinforcement of structuring routes or through more comfortable and sustainable vehicles. STCP has been decarbonizing its fleet, discontinuing diesel buses, and replacing them with electric or natural gas buses, where the penetration of green hydrogen is also a hypothesis under evaluation. Currently, STCP's fleet consists of 434 vehicles, 77 % of which run on natural gas (11.5 % of this gas is biomethane), 5% on electricity (100 % electric vehicles) and 18 % on diesel. The electrification of the fleet is going to continue, aiming to achieve 43% of the fleet electric by the end of 2027, and discontinuing diesel entirely from the city bus fleet by then. In this sense, in the coming years, STCP has planned to invest almost 100 M€ to renew the fleet.

Additionally, the offer of the Metro do Porto is also being expanded through the construction of two new lines (Pink and Ruby lines) and the design and construction of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Line which is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. This integrated approach is also facilitated by intermodal infrastructures, such as the new Campanhã Intermodal Hub (TIC), opened on July 20, 2022, a single terminal with connection to the Metro, urban buses and train, car park and bicycle rack for park-and-ride. TIC was built according to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards (waiting for certification) and can be the first terminal in Europe with this important sustainability certification. The São João intermodal hub is also a central piece of the public transports offer of Porto as it covers the Asprela area, where the city universities and the main city hospital are located.  |
|   |  MT.03
Increased shared mobility and MaaS options | A key strategy to increase mobility efficiency and reduce its effects is the percentage increase in the average number of passengers per car/motorcycle in the coming years due to differentiated services such as carpooling and car-sharing, as well as other mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) products. In this context, different urban mobility projects and concepts are currently being piloted in Porto, which includes, for example, the shared e-scooters available in the city for public use, during short periods, and whose sharing points are identified by blue markings on the pavement complemented by the Municipality's online mapping. The Gemini project, with the participation of Porto entities, is also an important project in this scope as it aims to develop and test new mobility solutions and services with significant impact on environmental sustainability, with financial viability and effective user adoption and based on digital services and solutions that combine the use of public transport with micromobility and shared mobility. Porto is one of GEMINI's eight *Mobility Living Labs*. At the  |

|   |  | same time, the city also participates in the FABULOS project, which, by using Public Procurement Innovation approaches, aims to find market solutions for the supply and management of automated public transport for the last-mile journey, as part of the existing transport system. The Porto pilot, to be implemented in the Asprela area, will test new vehicles that should improve the level of service and bring substantial cost savings. Also noteworthy is the “USHARE by AEFEP” app, a carpooling mobile application, which could reach 40 thousand users from the entire academic community in Porto.  |
|   |  MT.04 Electrification of vehicles (cars and motorcycles) | MT.04.A Network of recharging points for electric vehicles and electrification of private fleet: To promote the adoption of electric vehicles and motorcycles at the private level, the Municipality has several projects in the pipeline associated with, for example, the expansion of charging stations across the city. Since January 2021, electric charging stations operating on public spaces are available. This measure results from a decision by Porto City Council which, by the end of 2019, announced the installation of electric vehicle charging stations on municipal property. These charging points are now spread in car parks across the city and the executive enforced the mandatory installation of charging infrastructure in new and renovated parking facilities. Also, to facilitate electric vehicles' users to identify charging points, a digital map of the locations displaying their availability was created by the city and made available in its website. In turn, the municipal company Águas e Energia do Porto currently has a park of 68 charging points installed on its facilities for its own fleet of electric and hybrid vehicles. In total, the Municipality of Porto currently has around 300 electric charging stations, for the exclusive use of municipal entities that are managed by this company.
MT.04.B Electrification of the municipal vehicle fleet: As a way of leading by example, since 2018, 70% of the light diesel vehicles in the municipal fleet have been replaced by electric or plug-in hybrid ones, totalizing 390 vehicles. Currently it accounts with 75%. The municipal fleet, operated under the first and largest leasing contract in the country, had covered more than 4 million kilometres in electric mode by the end of 2020, contributing to a significant reduction in its carbon footprint. More recently, the fleet of urban solid waste collection vehicles (from the Porto Ambiente company) was also renewed through the acquisition of 26 new natural gas-powered vehicles. Currently, new electric sweepers are at the beginning of their duties, and soon some more vehicles will arrive to reinforce the waste collection more sustainable fleet.  |
|   | MT.05 Optimized logistics | Based on the National Carbon Neutrality Roadmap, a significant shift in the logistics transport is required so that the carbon neutrality goal is possible. In this sector, the increased digitalization of supply chains (more online shopping, more reverse logistics) increases the demand for the mobility of goods, also increasing the pressure exerted on this sector. Thus, in order to improve its efficiency, it is necessary to: 1) increase the load factor of heavy and light goods vehicles; 2) increase the fleet autonomy and 3) foster the replacement rate of vehicles. The decarbonization of short and long-distance freight transport, promoting a logistics chain with a modal distribution that minimizes the carbon and energy intensity of the transport system is, therefore, a priority especially in a highly tertiary context such as Porto.
With a view to reducing pollution caused by vehicle traffic associated with urban logistics, reducing the level of CO2 emissions associated with urban logistics  |

|   |  | through increasing the efficiency of loading and unloading operations and mitigating mobility constraints caused by operations and the circulation of logistic vehicles, Porto developed in 2021 its Plan for Sustainable Logistics (PLUS). This plan introduces a set of 15 recommendations that aim to improve logistical transport in the city. To support the implementation of an ambitious plan such as PLUS, the Municipality of Porto, supported by Porto Digital, has a detailed digital mapping on the location of municipal car parks, loading and unloading spaces, soft mode sharing points, among others. This data is made available through the city's Urban Platform and its Open Data Portal. This work was made under the scope of the C-Streets initiative whose main objectives are the sharing of data, the development of MaaS solutions, the promotion of effective and accessible public intermodal transport, the reduction of accidents, as well as the evolution of the concept of sustainability and decarbonization in transport.  |
|   |  MT.06
Electrification of light and heavy freight vehicles | Still at the freight transport level, the National Carbon Neutrality Roadmap global narrative regarding mobility foresees the emergence of new energy vectors, such as the green hydrogen - identified as an important decarbonization vector in sectors with limited alternative technological options, such as heavy passenger and freight transport. According to estimates of this structural document, it is expected that in the 2030s, green hydrogen and electricity will ensure 70% and 88% of the demand for heavy goods mobility in the country, respectively. The implementation of these solutions will depend on the development of structural infrastructure, whose investment and operating costs are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty given the limited pilot projects underway. However, the electrification of heavy transport is already a reality for passenger vehicles (electric buses) and is also beginning to be an option for the freight transport. As an example, reference is made to the experience of the transport companies DHL Express and DPD,, with a great presence in the city and which are electrifying their logistic fleets.  |
|  Waste & circular economy
(WCE) | WCE.01
Increased waste recycling | The Urban Waste Strategic Plan, with a time horizon until 2030 (PERSU 2030), and the National Waste Management Plan (PNGR 2030) establish a national urban waste management policy which promotes the prevention of waste production, the reuse, recycling, and other forms of recovery, encouraging the reduction of consumption of raw materials, and contributing, in a generic way, to a more sustainable lifestyle. The targets defined for the reuse and recycling of waste are set at 55%, 60% and 65% for 2025, 2030 and 2035, respectively. Additionally, the prevention target is set at a reduction of 5% and 15%, in 2025 and 2030, respectively, compared to the production of solid waste in 2019, whose production per inhabitant reached 511 kg/inhabitant.year at national level. In Porto, in 2022, around 42% of solid waste resulted from selective collection (multimaterial and biowaste), with each resident separating, on average, about 80 kg/inhabitant.year of selective waste. Therefore, municipal action should continue this path to achieve even better results.  |
|   |  WCE.02
Optimized processes and efficiency in wastewater treatment facilities | An important contribution to GHG emissions in the Municipality comes from the operation of the Freixo and Sobreiras wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The Aqualitrans cross-border project, in which Águas e Energia do Porto is a partner, aims to develop an efficient and sustainable energy model for the WWTPs in the Municipality, but also for some other municipalities in the north of Portugal and Galicia. Within the scope of this project, the municipal company  |

|   |  | implemented several measures with a positive impact in the city wastewater network.
Another contribution is the SUPREMAS project, currently under development - modular gasification units for renewable energy production from multiple wastes and for different applications. The goal is to promote the development of decentralized synthesis gas production systems from by-products of various origins, thus contributing to the energy transition and environmental sustainability. It aims to provide circular value chains, in which different types of waste can be used to produce electricity, thermal energy, and new materials. Porto will test this technology through the installation of a mobile modular unit at the Freixo WWTP. This unit will use the sludge produced in the anaerobic digestion stage for gasification (either alone or in combination with other raw materials), producing synthesis gas (syngas), which will be valorised through a cogeneration system. The system will also include a gas purification module for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), allowing the highly efficient generation of electric power and heat with zero emissions to the atmosphere.  |
|  Green infrastructure & reduce-based solutions (GI) | GI.01 Increased green infrastructure (carbon sink) | Porto's Master Plan sets the goal of doubling the Municipality's green areas by 2030, with the aim of not only combating climate change and fostering sustainability, but also contributing to a better quality of life of the citizens. Therefore, a set of interventions have been planned and implemented as a way of meeting the objective outlined in the PDM, with an estimated total investment of over 11,6 M€.  |
|  Built environment (BE) | BE.01 Renovation of existing buildings (envelope) | According to the latest available data (2021), of the approximately 39 thousand buildings in Porto, around 4 800 require medium repairs and more than 2 100 are in urgent need of renovation. Of the existing buildings, only 16% were built after 1990, the date of the first buildings' thermal performance regulation in Portugal, which allows to foresee a poor thermal quality of the building stock. In fact, of the more than 87 thousand energy certificates issued in buildings in the Municipality, only 44% have a performance level higher than C (on a scale from A+ to F, where A+ represents superior energy performance). In this context, Porto has several actions in place.
BE.01.A Private buildings: This action foresees the renovation of the existing residential building stock, at a rate of 2,5%/year until 2030. The renovation focuses on deep interventions (needed in 70% of the building stock), capable of reducing up to 60% of the heating needs.
BE.01.B Municipal buildings and facilities: Municipal buildings (including administrative buildings, schools and sports complexes) have also been targeted by the city executive. The city is investing in deep interventions, aimed at enhancing their use and liveability, at the same time as their energy efficiency is optimized, with significant savings for the Municipality.
BE.01.C Social housing: One of the Municipality's largest projects is the improvement of the living conditions in municipal neighbourhoods. Social housing in Porto accounts for 13% of the city's-built housing, corresponding to around 13 000 dwellings, where around 28 000 people live. This number of dwellings and population justifies the more than 150 M€ invested in improving these buildings over the last few decades. Energy efficiency, thermal comfort  |

|   |  | and savings are the direct results of this commitment, which was recognized by the European Commission (EC) as a good practice in the application of EC funds.  |
|   | BE.02
Construction of new energy-efficient buildings (NZEB standards) | In terms of new construction, the Municipality has been developing the Environmental Index, a composite index that assesses the performance and energy-environmental impact of new construction projects in the city. In addition to strict energy requirements (NZEB requirements), this index also assesses the expected impact of a new building in terms of water efficiency, existence of green areas, energy efficiency, circularity of materials used, etc. The index has been discussed with bioclimatology, landscaping, water management, energy, noise, designs, refurbishment, and real estate players and is expected to establish the criteria for new buildings in the city by imposing standards for more sustainable and energy-efficient construction, serving as a guidebook for urban developers which, in turn, may benefit from appealing construction exemptions and incentives fostered by the city.  |
|   | BE.03
Efficient lighting and appliances | In a residential environment, lighting and electric equipment spend a significant amount of electricity (20% and 35%, respectively). In this sense, during home renovation or simply due to equipment natural wear, appliances and bulbs will tend to be replaced by more efficient technologies (class A+ or higher and LED technology). In this scope, this measure considers the replacement of lighting technology and appliances in residential dwellings, with energy savings of around 40%.  |
|   | BE.04
Digitalization, literacy and awareness | For Porto, education for sustainability is a crucial tool to involve people in the transition process to a greener and carbon-free city and change energy behaviours. The Municipality understands that environmental and energy problems persist because there is still a gap between the way nature (and the city) works and the way people think (and consequently act). This alignment is therefore fundamental. In this scope, Porto has a long-lasting experience in developing environmental education activities so that citizens can: 1) understand environmental and energy processes; 2) develop collective environmental awareness; 3) know solutions and options; 4) acquire skills that are important in their daily life; and 5) can collaborate in concrete actions with positive consequences. Also, the digital transition is expected to follow the energy transition in order to support the development of value-added services and products.  |
|   | BE.05
Decarbonized space and water heating generation | According to the 2021 Domestic Energy Consumption Survey (ICESD 2021), space heating corresponds to the second largest domestic use of energy in the residential setting. The main source of energy used for heating purposes is biomass (81,2%), followed by electricity (7,6%), heating diesel (4,6%), LPG (Liquefied petroleum gas) (3,2%) and natural gas (2,7%). In what concerns water heating, gas (both natural gas and LPG) is used in around 3/4 of homes: natural gas is used in 35,6% of homes, followed by bottled LPG (32,9%) and piped LPG (7,0%). As there is no detailed characterization at the municipal level, it is assumed that Porto follows the national trend in terms of energy use for space and water heating, and therefore, there is still a long improvement journey until decarbonized space and water heating services.  |

B-2.1: Description of action portfolios - Summary
Figure 29. GHG expected impacts per promoter.

Although with a strong focus on municipal action, Porto's portfolio of actions depends heavily on the action of other entities, such as transport operators, citizens and companies. In fact, more than  $65\%$  of the reduction in emissions necessary for the decarbonization of the territory is in the hands of other entities, which reflects the relevance of engaging and motivating these stakeholders over time, given their relevance to this city's purpose.

Table 2 presents the estimated GHG impacts from both municipal and other actions, per field of action and action. Also, the table reveals the gap of each action and field of action as of January 2024, showing that, there is still a long way to go in what concerns Mobility &amp; Transport (85% gap) and Energy Systems (73% gap). The gap in Transports will be shortened due to the investments which are only expected to occur during the coming years. In turn, the slow adoption of renewables is expected to increase in the coming years due to the easing of the permitting processes. The remaining fields of action are in a more advanced stage of development.

| Action description | The creation of renewable individual or collective self-consumption projects in social housing buildings and including other nearby facilities (i.e., schools) is a Municipality plan which is two-fold. On the one hand, local energy production is intended to reduce energy costs for residents, with positive impacts on alleviating potential energy poverty situations. On the other hand, the Municipality takes advantage of the extensive available rooftop areas to reduce the city GHG emissions, sending a positive sign to potential private investors. The first city REC including the Agra do Amial social housing complex and the local Agra school is being concluded within the scope of the Asprela+Sustentável project. In total, 114 kWp of photovoltaic systems were installed, coupled with storage systems, and connected to electric vehicle charging points. |

Field of action: Mobility &amp; Transport (M&amp;T)

| Action outline | Action name | MT.01 Reduced motorized passenger transportation need |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Action type | Technical intervention |
| Action outline | Action description | Reducing transport needs through urban planning and changing work and use patterns of and in the city is a key action for the Municipality's mobility. In addition, having a solid circulation network dedicated to soft mobility modes and in which motorized transport is not prioritized is one of the aims of the recent Municipal Master Plan (PDM). This document is in line with Porto's Sustainable Urban Mobility Action Plan (PAMUS) and focuses on key strategies discussed as follows. |
| 1. Soft mobility: Porto intends to move forward with a pioneering project to rescue public space, which includes, among others, the installation of more cycling lanes, adding to the already existing 35 km of cycle paths, distributed throughout the Asprela, Prelada, Frente Marítima/Marginal, Parque da Pasteleira, Parque da Cidade, Avenida da Boavista and Avenida Gustavo Eiffel areas. The Municipality also imposed conditions for operators of sharing services (bikes and scooters), defining and mapping the parking sites across the city. In the car parks managed by the Municipality there are 130 supervised bicycle parking spaces (free of charge) and 210 bicycle and scooter sharing points in the city. There are also additional 72 bicycle racks with capacity for 520 parking spaces across the city. |
| 2. Pedestrian zones in the city Historic Centre: In line with other European cities, reserving arteries in the historic centre for pedestrians and prohibiting the entry of cars is a key measure foreseen in the city PDM. Currently, four restricted motor vehicle access zones exist in the city and seven more are planned. |
| 3. Updated parking rules: Porto's PDM also introduces new developments regarding parking, particularly concerning the change (reduction) of the current paradigm in private parking policy, which means a smaller available share of parking in public spaces (on street). The PDM wants to contribute, whenever possible, to the progressive elimination of parking along streets and public spaces, proposing alternatives in covered parking (off street) (Zone XXI initiative). |
| 4. Lastly, within the scope of the Network 20 program, a set of priority routes for soft mobility were established covering almost 30 kilometres of streets. These routes only allow the circulation of vehicles at reduced speed (20 km/h), fostering a shared public space concept between vehicles and soft modes. |
| Together, these measures are estimated to reduce the motorized passenger transportation in the city centre by around 25%. |
| Reference to impact | Systemic lever | • Technology/ infrastructure.
• Governance & policy.
• Social innovation.
• Learning & capabilities. |
| Outcome | • Time saving by avoiding traffic jams, closeness to facilities and teleworking.
• Improved air quality.
• Noise reduction.
• Enhanced public transport connectivity through soft mobility integration.
• Increased health and well-being through sustainable urban lifestyle adoption. |

| Action description | The Public Transport Fare Reduction Support Program (PART), launched in 2019 in the Porto Metropolitan Area, manifested itself most visibly in Porto through the fare reduction for the entire population and the free public transport up to 12 years old. That same year, Porto extended the free access up to 15 years old, creating the Andante Porto.13-15 pass for young people living in Porto and allowing access to the Metro, STCP and Funicular dos Guindais services. The title, available throughout the 2019/2020 academic year, was supported by the Porto City Council, which guaranteed in full the costs of using the monthly passes. In that first academic year, around 45% of students residing in Porto, aged between 13 and 15, were able to use the public transport system free of charge. In the following academic year, the initiative was extended to 18 years old. Even in the pandemic context, at the beginning of the academic year, more than 5,000 students residing in Porto had valid Andante Porto.13-18 subscriptions. The Andante Porto.13-18 can be associated with the Porto Card, the city card that gives free access to the City Museum, 50% discounts on shows at the Teatro Municipal do Porto, access to municipal swimming pools, allows the free use of the Guindais Funicular, in addition to other advantages that will be associated over time. To be inclusive, this physical card comes wrapped in a digital experience that aims to aggregate services and benefits from different areas, facilitating interaction between the Municipality and its citizens.

In 2023, more than 7 300 young people, aged between 13 and 18, used the Andante “Porto.13-18” intermodal system free of charge. This clear adherence to the free transport ticket by young people is a strong indicator that the Porto City Council's work in encouraging the use of public transport, with a special focus on young people, is producing positive effects.

In the 2019/2020 academic year, the cost was 718,9 thousand euros and more than 1,2 million euros in the 2020/2021 academic year. In 2022, the Municipality had a budget allocation of more than 1,5 million euros for this program.

Additionally, in January 2024 a new measure was announced: all Porto Card users will be entitled to 22 free trips per year, either on the city's public buses or on the metro. The application of this measure was possible due to the entry into force, at the beginning of the year, of intermodal passes for students up to the age of 23 covered by the Government, meaning that the Porto City Council no longer had an annual expenditure of around three million of euros with the under-18 pass, being able to use this money to generate the creation of new public transport demand. Furthermore, the Municipality is studying the possibility of extending the existing on-demand transport model to the general population, reaching areas where public transport is not yet effective.  |

| Action description | STCP, Porto's public bus company, has an ambitious investment roadmap in order to enhance the quality and sustainability of its fleet. The company intends to acquire 171 electric buses over the next five years, corresponding to two-fifths of the current fleet. By 2027, the company aims to acquire 171 electric vehicles, both to replace and add to the current fleet of 420 units, 80% of which is currently powered by natural gas. For 2023, a public tender of around 20 million euros was launched, corresponding to the acquisition of 48 electric vehicles, 24 of which for fleet expansion and 24 for replacing diesel vehicles. In 2024, it is planned to acquire 20 standard electric buses, in an investment of 8,4 million euros to replace 20 natural gas vehicles, and eight midi electric buses (larger than a minibus but smaller than a standard), in an investment of 2,9 million euros to replace eight current diesel minibuses. For 2025, STCP plans to acquire 40 electric buses, 20 of which are standard (for 8,4 million euros, to replace the same number using natural gas) and 20 articulated (for 14,4 million euros, to replace 10 standard and 10 articulated natural gas fuelled). In 2026, the company will acquire more 40 articulated electric buses, estimating an investment of 28,8 million euros to replace 20 natural gas and 20 diesel articulated buses, as well as 15 batteries (2,6 million euros). Finally, in 2027 it is planned to purchase 15 double-decker electric buses, costing 11,6 million euros, to replace 15 buses of the same type, but running on diesel. In 2023 and 2024, investments were also planned to acquire two electrical substations for charging buses, for a total investment of four million euros. The company intends therefore to invest around 100 million euros to provide a better and decarbonized service to the city by 2030. The city bus service is also facilitated through the creation of dedicated lanes, as the Fernão de Magalhães high quality bus corridor. |
|  | In addition to the bus fleet renewal, there are also investments in intermodal platforms in the city, namely the Terminal Intermodal de Campanhã (TIC) which foster the use of public transport. TIC is part of the city's mobility policy, which is based on the articulation between the different transport subsystems and the promotion of a multimodal citizen culture. The Campanhã hub was built in full compliance with the international LEED standards and has, since 2022, eight boarding docks for buses in rotation and 30 parking spaces. The infrastructure totals a gross construction area of around 24 thousand square meters and includes utility areas, car park, bus terminal, connection to the metro and train, service station, kiss & ride stops, bicycle park and park taxi areas, complementary public support areas, administrative areas, as well as essential technical areas, serving around five million passengers (July 2022 to June 2023). Additionally, the renovated transport terminals of Camélias, in Batalha, and Aspreia, which include the interfaces of the Hospital de S. João and the University Centre, also stand out. The renovation of these hubs aims to provide better accessibility conditions, comfort, and safety, both for operators and passengers. |

At the Asprela Hub, Metro, STCP, and other bus services coexist to connect Porto hospitals and universities to other surrounding municipalities.

The company Metro do Porto is also increasing mobility offerings and services in the city through three structuring projects, namely:

The new Metrobus line is currently being built in the city to add quality, speed and flexibility to the transport network. The two lines, Boavista – Praça do Império and Boavista - Anémona (Matosinhos), will combine the efficiency, punctuality and reliability of the Metro with the flexibility and comfort of the latest generation of hydrogen buses. With priority over all other modes of transport (through an intelligent traffic light system), an exclusive lane and integrated into the Andante ticketing system, the Porto Metrobus will be in operation in 2024. The great competitive advantage of Metrobus is its speed and reliability; the Boavista – Império connection will take just 12 minutes and the journey between Boavista – Anémona will take 17 minutes. The global investment in this work is 66 million euros and includes the construction of the two lines, the supply and maintenance of the fleet of 12 vehicles, the construction and equipment of the hydrogen factory and the fuelling stations. All investment is financed by the European Union's Recovery and Resilience and Next Generation Program. The entire Metrobus project is being carried out by Metro do Porto.

The new metro Pink Line that will connect Boavista to the city centre, connecting the Blue, Red, Green, Violet and Orange lines, at Casa da Música, and the Yellow Line, at S. Bento Station, will serve important health, teaching, culture and arts centres, and reaching, within walking distances, the Palácio de Cristal, Avenida Miguel Bombarda and the Campo Alegre faculties.

Figure 35. New metro lines in construction.

This new line represents an extension of 2.7 kilometres and should be completed in 2025. At the same time, the Yellow Line, which connects Porto and Gaia since 2005, will grow three kilometres in Gaia, facilitating the connection between the two cities. The global investment in the two lines is 407 million euros - including expropriations, projects, inspection, equipment and exploration support systems -, with financing from the Environmental Fund and European funds from the Operational Program Sustainability and Resource Use Efficiency (POSEUR).

|   |  | • The new Ruby Line will connect Casa da Música, in Porto, to Santo Ovídio, in Vila Nova de Gaia. In between, six stations and a bridge over Douro River, on a route of more than six kilometres that adds quality and alternatives to the mobility of citizens in the Porto Metropolitan Area. The Ruby line starts in Porto, connecting to the Blue (A), Red (B), Green (C), Violet (E), Orange (F) and Pink (G) lines. From there, the Metro makes its way in a tunnel to the very popular Campo Alegre area, from where it then heads towards the surface, crossing the Ferreirinha Bridge which provides the connection to the city of Gaia. In Gaia, the first stronghold in this new connection takes place in Arrábida. Immediately afterwards, the metro heads towards VL8, traveling along this avenue until they reach Candal station. The next stopping point is what, perhaps, also promises to be one of the most iconic on the Ruby Line: the Rotunda station, also located on the VL8 and which includes an underground car park, with capacity for 500 vehicles and a green park intended for culture and leisure. For the last part of this journey, a buried route is reserved to the Devesas and Soares dos Reis stations, located in a very residential area, in the parish of Mafamude. The journey ends one kilometre further south, in Santo Ovídio, where an underground station will be built parallel to the current one and which serves the Yellow Line (D). According to estimates by the company Metro do Porto, one million people will be directly covered on this route between the main entrance to Porto and the coastal area of Gaia, which should attract more than 12 million new customers per year and 1,7 thousand million euros in benefits of various types. The consignment contract for the project was signed in January 2024 for more than 379,5 million euros. The global investment value of the new line is 435 million, an investment financed by the Recovery and Resilience Funds (RRF).
In total, these investments are expected to provoke a shift in the number of people using private vehicles in a daily basis, by reducing 35% of the passenger kilometres travelled by car and which shift to electric public transport.  |

|   |  Action description | Also, within the scope of the city's mobility strategy, Porto aims to increase the number of passengers per car and motorcycle by 2030, through shared mobility solutions such as carpooling or car sharing. In addition to the implementation of projects with pilot actions on shared, autonomous and micro mobility, such as Greening European Mobility through cascading innovation INItiatives (GEMINI) or FABULOS, and the soft mobility sharing system (bikes and e-scooters) with sharing and parking points spread across the city, the carpooling platform developed within the Faculty of Economics of the University of Porto (FEP) should be highlighted due to the size it can acquire and the environment in which it is located, where more than 40 thousand people, including students, teachers and collaborators may be involved. The USHARE by AEFEP app, launched in April 2023, was created and developed in a partnership between AEFEP (FEP Student Association) and the junior company of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, JuniFEUP, and is a carpooling approach that allows the use of private vehicles to share trips between different users, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The application promotes the concept of shared economy, making travel more accessible and economical, contributing to reducing the number of vehicles in circulation.  |

|  | Action description | Porto was one of the 25 national municipalities that formed the MOBIE-E national consortium, whose mission is to develop and implement a network of universally accessible, interoperable, and user-centric electric vehicle charging stations across the country. In this sense, and to promote electric mobility in Porto, the city Executive made municipal spaces available for the installation of public charging points, as a way of encouraging the expansion of this market. This increase in the network of electric charging comes as a way of encouraging the acquisition of electric vehicles by private individuals, with 35% of electric and hybrid vehicles expected to be incorporated into the private car fleet in circulation in 2030, in line with the predictions of the 2050 National Roadmap for Carbon Neutrality. Additionally, to charge the municipal electric and hybrid fleet, the Municipality have around 300 electric vehicle chargers on the municipal network, guaranteeing an effective response to the increase in this type of mobility. All these chargers are managed by the municipal company Águas e Energia do Porto. |

|   | Action description | In 2018, 70% of light vehicles in the municipal fleet (diesel) were replaced by electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, for a total of 390 vehicles. It is estimated that these vehicles have covered more than 4 million kilometres in electric mode by the end of 2020, contributing to a significant reduction in their carbon footprint, due to the reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels. In addition to the advantages related to the reduction of GHG emissions, there was an important contribution to improving air quality in the city, as well as reducing noise pollution. At stake is the acquisition of 390 vehicles, 241 of which are targeted to the Municipality and the rest for municipal companies, from housing to public works, environment, and leisure. The vehicles will replace existing diesel vehicles at the end of the lease contract, in areas such as urban cleaning, municipal works, policing, employee transport, etc. Nowadays, the municipal fleet accounts with 75% of electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.Additionally, Porto invested around 10 million euros in the acquisition of more sustainable equipment and vehicles, at the service of Porto Ambiente, to be used in daily urban cleaning and waste collection activities in the city. In total, more than six million are allocated to new solutions, mostly electrical, to support the activity of cleaning public spaces, namely sweeping equipment. Regarding waste collection, the value exceeds three million euros allocated to modernizing the fleet, replacing old trucks with new vehicles powered by natural gas.  |

|  |  | therefore, several impacts, from increased congestion and occupation of public roads and parking spaces, to increased atmospheric emissions and noise, and reduced road safety.
European studies show that goods vehicles are responsible for 20 to 30% of emissions in urban areas and this is also the case for Porto, as expressed in its Sustainable Urban Logistics Plan (PLUS), which intends to promote :
• The reduction of pollution caused by vehicle traffic associated with urban logistics.
• The reduction in the level of GHG emissions associated with urban logistics by increasing the efficiency of loading and unloading operations and other activities.
• The mitigation of mobility constraints caused by the operations and circulation of vehicles transporting goods and providing services and contributing to increasing road safety.
The freight transport and logistics sectors are intrinsically related to the region's economic activity. The growth of e-commerce (Porto is not only a place for delivering e-commerce but also where a growing number of local economic activities sell online); in tourism and local accommodation (Porto has particularly benefited from the growth of this sector, which leads to a significant increase in the consumption of goods and services, namely in the HORECA channel and in commerce); the digitalization of the economy (with the emergence of platforms such as Uber Eats, Glovo or Deliveroo). In this setting, Porto's PLUS presents a set of fifteen measures that are divided into:
**Infrastructure** (included in the city PDM regarding mobility):
• Adaptation of the built environment to logistic operations.
• Relocation and sizing of loading and unloading places.
• Adaptation of the logistics infrastructure.
• Resizing of loading and unloading locations.
**Regulations and Incentives**:
• Awareness campaigns among store owners and traders.
• Time restricted access.
• Adjustment of time windows to the real dynamics of the sector.
• Adjust loading and unloading times to the different types of operators.
• Access restriction (based on vehicle volume).
• Increased supervision to avoid deviations.
**Operational Management**:
• Helpdesk for urban logistics (supported by tools as Porto's traffic management tool)
• Logistics micro-platforms.
• Creation of collection points.
• Circulation of logistic vehicles on BUS routes.
It is estimated that the implementation of the measures proposed in this plan will allow a 10% reduction in the distance (kilometres) covered by logistical (trucking) vehicles in and due to city action. |

| Action description | In addition to the optimization of logistic services, the renewal of the combustion engines freight fleet to electric or hydrogen fuelled vehicles is key to decarbonize the freight sector. According to the National 2050 Carbon Neutrality Roadmap, and in line with Porto's Sustainable Mobility Action Plan and Sustainable Urban Logistics Plan, in a transitional phase, advanced biofuels will play a key role especially in heavy long-distance road intercity transport of passengers and freight. However, as time goes by, it is expected that biofuels may become neglected due to the increased competitiveness and cost-effectiveness of electric traction and other energy vectors such as hydrogen. In the case of heavy vehicles, the possibility of introducing new fuels such as hydrogen (H2) or new dynamic propulsion technologies (e.g., overhead contact lines or induction systems) is expected. However, the implementation of these solutions will depend on the development of core infrastructures, and their investment and operating costs are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty, given the small number of pilot projects underway. These two energy vectors are expected to account for almost all heavy passenger and freight mobility by 2050, while 100% of light duty trucks (<3,5tones) are expected to be electric by 2030. This trend is being followed by companies in the territory, as DHL Express Portugal, which in December 2023 acquired 44 new electric vehicles. The company will fully convert 60% of its last mile fleet by 2030 at its terminals in Porto, Viseu, Covilhã, Leiria, Lisbon, Loule, Funchal and Ponta Delgada. With this fleet conversion in mind, the expansion work on the DHL Express air cargo terminal at Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport, in Porto, prepares the building with charging stations for electric vehicles, to respond to new demands. The company DPD, with a strong presence in the domestic express transport market, also began the second phase of decarbonization of the distribution fleet in 2022, with the immediate placement of over 70 electric vehicles and chargers in various parts of the country. After starting the process of electrifying its fleet in Lisbon in 2019 (with 55 electric vehicles), the company decided to extend the measure to other parts of the country, including Porto, where the company currently has more than 46 electric vehicles. |

| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Action type | Technical intervention  |
|   |  Action description | Porto has been steadily improving in terms of waste management. In 2022, it surpassed all recycling targets as each Porto inhabitant separated, on average, around 80 kg/year of packaging waste, an increase of 10 kg compared to 2021. The rate of preparation for recycling also grew compared to 2021 (39,3%), reaching 42,2%. Lastly, selective waste collection also recorded an increase of around 5 500 tons in 2022, an increase of around 20% compared to 2021. These targets contribute to the zero landfill policy the city is committed to and are the result of a set policies and initiatives implemented by Porto, such as: • Dose Certa and Embrulha: Two projects implemented together with LIPOR concerning the reduction of food waste; • Orgânico: An initiative promoted by Porto Ambiente with the aim of reducing food waste, while contributing to a more circular economy. It consists of distributing a kit to separate organic waste for subsequent deposit in the respective container. • Good Food Hubs: A pilot project started in 2020 with the aim of facilitate the access to organic, local and healthy food. • City Loops: A project started in 2019 and led by ICLEI which is based on the collaboration between a set of partners to implement actions aimed at increasing circularity in the use of materials, focusing on construction and demolition waste and the organic matter.  |

ReBOOT Porto: A project launched in 2023 and organized by the Municipality of Porto aiming at to recover computing equipment and to deliver it to entities with social projects and have specific needs for this type of equipment.

The positive results achieved on waste recycling are also due to the efforts of city entities and partners in:

Raising awareness: In 2019, a pioneering service in which awareness teams travel daily around the city to identify non-compliances related with waste disposal and packaging rules was started. When repeated problems are detected, Environmental Training sessions are prescribed, instead of issuing fines. The goal is to educate instead of punishing and to raise awareness on citizens and business owners.

Provide the enabling conditions: The city has around 4ha (13 gardens scattered across the city) of area occupied with municipal gardens used to organic farming. These slots have also 400 composters used to produce 120 tons/year of organic matter to be reused in the municipal gardens. In addition, Porto citizens have two community composting islands at their disposal, funded under the City Loops project, in which they may deposit their organic waste. From this process, a 100% organic compost is produced to be used by both participants and by the city, in green areas. Porto also implemented a door-to-door collection system for green waste (from citizens and entities), in collaboration with LIPOR, with the consequent transformation of this waste into an organic agricultural amendment used in the Municipality's green areas.

# BOX 6: LIPOR - New automatic packaging sorting line

In September 2023, LIPOR opened the largest automatic packaging sorting line in the Iberian Peninsula. Located in the municipalities of Condemar and Velango, the investment was around nine million euros and was supported by European funds, through POSEUR. The new infrastructure, which goes artificial intelligence, allows monitoring all stages of the operation in real time, ensuring greater efficiency in the separation of materials and, consequently, an increase in the recycling rate.

The sorting line has a minimum nominal capacity of 6 tons per hour and can annually process between 14 600 tons in one shift and 29 200 tons in two shifts. This progress meets the objectives established by the National Waste Management Plan, PERSU 2030.

Also, in order to foster waste recycling, the Municipality has collective waste collection in the city 24 hours a day, door-to-door collection in homes and commercial facilities, and a complete and updated mapping of recycling sites, ecocentres, and other waste collection equipment, which provides city inhabitants and users with an integrated waste disposal network.

To promote the Circular Economy, the Municipality is also creating the Centre for Circular Economy of the City of Porto, which includes the construction of a space dedicated to the reception of objects/equipment/materials with the potential to be reused by carrying out small restoration interventions/repairs, promoting the city's environmental literacy through training/workshops and making the space available to all who wish to repair/transform their materials. The objective is to change behaviours regarding waste production and will be implemented at the Prelada ecocentre. In the first phase, the centre will repair electrical and electronic equipment and small furniture. After experience in dynamizing the centre and history of circularity indicators, the centre will evolve to another type of materials/products/objects. It should be noted that the objects will be donated, with no associated costs and an app will advertise the objects for donation available to residents, as well as to social solidarity institutions.

| Action description | Águas e Energia do Porto, the municipal company responsible for water and energy infrastructures in the city, through the learning of the Aqualitrans project, implemented several measures in the Sobreiras WWTP. One of the implemented measures was the optimization of the initial lifting system, which led to the replacement of existing pumps allowing an increase in pumping efficiency and a reduction in consumption by 15% - savings of around 452 000 kWh/year. Another measure implemented following the Aqualitrans project was the optimization of the energy management system, which was implemented in the highest consumption equipment, where controllers were installed to measure consumption and identify areas of intervention to reduce consumption. The estimated energy savings are around 330 000 kWh/year, which corresponds to a reduction in GHG emissions of approximately 155 tCO2/year. It should be noted that the implementation of these two measures had an associated budget of less than 50 000 €. Also, the Águas e Energia do Porto municipal company has ongoing plans to expand the Freixo WWTP, as well as interconnect it to two current WWTPs. To achieve this, it is planned to make the necessary changes to the drainage network. Additionally, it is planned to automate the Freixo WWTP and optimize biological treatment. This operation aims to increase the resilience of the treatment process and its optimization. In addition, Porto has other measures in place to reduce water consumption. For instance, the city has since 2023 a project to reuse reclaimed water for cleaning public spaces, watering gardens, cleaning containers and streets, etc., thereby saving potable water. Also, a smart irrigation infrastructure is being implemented across the city in gardens and parks. This measure has ensured water savings of around 15%. |

Field of action: Green infrastructure &amp; nature-based solutions (GI)

|   | Action name | GI.01 Increased green infrastructure  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Action type | Technical intervention  |
|   |  Action description | Among the planned investments for Porto's greenification, the following are highlighted: • Asprela Central Park: Completed in 2022, it allowed the creation of 5,5 ha of green area, adding 900 planted trees and the preservation of more than 700 trees and shrub plantations. The project, developed in partnership with the University of Porto, adopts nature-based solutions using the “sponge city” concept, which significantly reduces the occurrence of floods through the stabilization of the riverbeds and the increase in the permeability of the soil. • Alameda de Cartes Park: This park emerged as a response to the community's appeal and covers around 4 ha of area, creating around 1,5 km of new pathways for soft modes and linking three social housing neighbourhoods, a communal vegetable garden, a municipal sports field, a municipal swimming pool and the city's eastern park. The project is currently in the execution phase and scheduled for completion in 2024. It totals a municipal investment of 2,2 million euros. • Lapa Urban Park. The Lapa urban park is also in the execution phase and scheduled for completion in 2024. In the first phase, it will create 1,7 ha of green area and the restoration of a river. In a second phase, it will allow the creation of an additional 2,5 ha of green area. This investment comes through a public-private partnership with the Renaissance Hotel Group, which is responsible for the work in exchange for the non-payment of municipal taxes. The project includes nature-based solutions, serving as sponge during periods of high rainfalls. • São Roque Park. Completed in 2022, it added 1,2 ha of new green area in an investment of 1,4 million euros. The investment allowed for an expansion of green areas, recovered paths, rest areas and the preservation and renovation of viewpoints. With a current area of 5,2 ha, this park is strategic to the city due to its central location to host several cultural and leisure events.  |

|   |  | Figure 39. Oriental park.  |
|   |  | In addition to interventions related to new green areas, the Municipality also has a set of actions that aim to increase carbon sequestration. The FUN Porto - Native Urban Forests project, started in 2016, includes a set of initiatives implemented in the Municipality's environmental strategy and contributing to the mitigation and adaptation to climate change, of which the following stand out: · "If you have a garden, we have a tree for you." This program allows the acquisition of native trees and shrubs by citizens who want to plant them in their gardens. It aims to promote biodiversity, as well as increase the quantity and quality of the city's private backyards and gardens, which make up around 8% of the city's green coverage. The goal is to foster the plantation of 10 000 native trees and shrubs. · 100 000 trees project: It aims to ecologically rehabilitate burnt, degraded, or underutilized areas of the Porto Metropolitan Area through adequate vegetation management and the planting and maintenance of trees and shrubs native to the region. · Porto BioSpots Network: Network of urban forest areas (dominantly autochthonous) created to promote biodiversity, ecosystem services, adaptation to climate change and landscape mitigation. It started as a protocol between Porto and Infraestruturas de Portugal and focus on 14 areas distributed along the city main traffic routes (junctions, embankments, lateral green areas). The goal is to plant 10 000 trees which will be able to store approximately 50 tons of carbon per year, while save around 25 thousand euros of maintenance costs for the city. · Living tree beds: The project, which includes 719 tree beds, totalling 300 m², was implemented in different city streets to control invasive species and boost biodiversity, by attracting pollinating insects. · Mapping of the green infrastructure: The city owns a detailed mapping and ledger of all urban trees which are adequately identified and georeferenced, allowing for a real-time management. In line with these projects, Porto has a plan for the rehabilitation of water lines aiming to promote the protection and valorisation of the city's rivers and streams, with a view to better adapting to the effects of climate change, as well as reducing the territory's vulnerability to these effects. This local adaptation measure is aligned with the Municipal Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change of the Municipality of Porto and the new Municipal Climate Action Plan.  |

|  | Action description | To promote interventions and leverage private investment, in its Municipal Tax Exemptions Regulation, Porto has provided for different municipal property tax exemptions targeting urban buildings subject to renovation. In addition to these municipal incentives, since September 2022, the Municipality has operated the Porto Energy Hub, a one-stop shop to support Porto citizens in implementing energy efficiency and renewable production measures in their homes, providing technical and legal support and helping people applying to available financing options. This service, provided for free and funded under the Porto Energy ElevatoR (PEER) project, also aims to increase energy literacy by supporting diagnosis. In one year of operation (September 2022- September 2023), over 400 homeowners were supported by this service. Together, these actions are expected to boost a 2,5% renovation rate/year until 2030 in residential buildings and foster deep renovations with a significant energy performance enhancement. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Although the scope of the Porto Energy Hub has been restricted to the residential sector, it is expected that after the end of European funding, the OSS business model will also include the commercial sector, expanding the scope of the support given to this sector with a large presence in the city. |

|  Action description | Among the interventions carried out by Porto in its municipal buildings, the following are highlighted due to their relevance and visibility:  |
| --- | --- |
|   |  Falcão school and Alexandre Herculano high school: The renovation works were completed at the beginning of 2023 and, together, totalled more than 10 M€ of municipal investment. The interventions aimed a deep improvement of the schools' equipment and their expansion, also improving their functionality. The project also included the introduction of natural-based solutions on the  |
|   |  Falcão school roof, through the implementation of green roofs on the building, a green wall and the creation of a pond that allows rainwater to be used for use in the community garden "Horta da Oliveira". Additionally, the Falcão school is part of the Porto Solar project, and therefore it is equipped with a photovoltaic installation for self-consumption.  |
|   |  The emblematic renovations of the Cinema Batalha and the Mercado do Bolhão are emphasized as these are two charismatic spaces in the city which were returned to its citizens, after high municipal investments in their rehabilitation.  |
|  The city has also renovated the current headquarters of Porto Ambiente and GoPorto municipal companies according to the best sustainability practices, being internationally recognized though the LEED rating system standards, in a municipal investment of around 4 million euros. In the new facilities of the municipal companies GO Porto and Porto Ambiente, sustainability is a priority. The building was completely renovated, with environmental and efficiency considerations, involving an investment of around four million euros. The building presented a wide range of pathologies, which resulted in a significant state of degradation from age and lack of maintenance. The intervention included the partial demolition of some elements, as well as occasional expansion and construction of vertical components, to adapt to the functional needs and to obey to the applicable legislation. The environmental merit of this renovation came in the form of a LEED certification: the new headquarters of GO Porto and Porto Ambiente are the first public building in Portugal, the first rehabilitation intervention and the first building with natural ventilation to obtain this certification. All solutions were considered to maximize benefits: a sophisticated natural ventilation system, including a careful sizing of window areas and an occupant notification system which alerts whenever it is convenient to open windows (with air quality control sensors); 40% energy savings compared to a  |   |

Likewise, the facilities are equipped with a flat and two inclined green roofs.

• The executive is also fostering the reconversion of the old city slaughterhouse, deactivated for over 20 years, into a new multipurpose business and leisure space. The investment of over 40 M€ supported by the construction company which won the tender is expected to be finished by mid-2025.

Interventions in the city's different theatres and cultural spaces (Teatro Campo Alegre, Campus Paulo Cunha e Silva, Teatro Rivoli and Teatro Municipal do Porto), as well as in some administrative (Ágora - Cultura e Desporto headquarters) and sports buildings (municipal swimming pools, with the replacement of sand filters, implementation of centralized technical management systems, lighting replacement, etc.), are also planned for the coming years, as a result of the availability of funds through the NORTE 2030 Program. This action is complemented by a wide-range energy audits program carried out by the Municipality covering 200 municipal buildings and facilities.  |

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

Applying all the measures listed in the portfolio of actions presented in Section B-2.1 and which represent an  $85\%$  reduction in Porto's GHG emissions, to achieve carbon neutrality, a residual amount of 121  $\mathrm{ktCO}_{2\mathrm{eq}}$  remain, which must be compensated through other means than greenification, as these actions are already covered. Porto's main residual emissions by 2030 are expected to stem from Transport (over 71,8  $\mathrm{ktCO}_{2\mathrm{eq}}$ ), despite the great efforts focused on this sector and large ongoing investments, and Waste (over 33,9  $\mathrm{ktCO}_{2\mathrm{eq}}$ ), which is expected to reduce significantly after implementing the different LIPOR projects presented in Boxes 6, 7 and 8.

Given that Porto is not an industrial city – which hinders direct carbon sequestration in large emission sources - Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) technologies are not an option. Porto's GHG emissions are diffuse (transport and buildings), which would require capturing carbon from the atmosphere, ensuring its compression, transport, transformation, and storage in deep geological formations. These technologies still face major challenges in terms of maturity and economic viability, so Porto will remain attentive to these options and to the concrete study of possible solutions for the city, but it does not count on them in the short term to the sequestration of its residual emissions. Indeed, the city has been gaining capacity and acquiring knowledge on this topic through the creation of collaborations with the academia and experts in this field, as was the case of the sixth session of the Porto Climate Pact Talk Series, held on June 22, 2023, on the topic "Carbon Capture" (Figure 46).

A study on the global carbon capture potential carried out in Porto $^{11}$  demonstrates that the city's green spaces capture annually (on average) 1 355 ton  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ /year, which represents around  $1\%$  of the carbon to be captured by 2030. This carbon capture service may increase as Porto

has some actions in place to extend the existing green areas and to ecologically recover them. However, the city acknowledges that this percentage may not increase significantly by 2030: Assuming that the 65 000 trees mapped in the city sequester an average of  $50\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{CO}_2/$  year (conservative average value and estimated based on the carbon sequestration potential of the different tree species existing in the city, adjusted to the Portuguese reality), the city greenification plan and the actions listed in this plan together reach an overall carbon sinking of over 3 kt of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ .

Although these figures are not promising in terms of carbon sequestration, the Municipality intends to study in a more systematic way (with the appropriate scientific institutions) the carbon sequestration potential of its soils, trees and water bodies (fresh and marine) and apply the

necessary measures to make the most of these carbon reservoirs. It is worth highlighting that Porto is a coastal city and physically constrained by the estuary of one of the largest Iberian rivers: there is, therefore, potential for using water masses for carbon sequestration through marine plants (which has not yet been studied).

However, it should also be noted that Porto is a city with a very limited territory  $(42\mathrm{km}^2)$  and very densely urbanized (historic city and world heritage site), which limits carbon offsetting within its territorial limits, despite efforts to enhance nature-based solutions in all their aspects and on all possible surfaces. Therefore, the main solution that the city intends to use to offset most of its residual emissions is the Voluntary Carbon Market[12] (in Portugal) established very recently by Law n.° 4/2024, of January  $5^{\text{th}}$  and which opens up the possibility of establishing carbon offsetting projects in the national territory. These projects aim of using nature-based solutions for carbon sequestration, simultaneously providing important benefits for the protection of biodiversity and natural capital, to the regulation of different natural cycles, for landscape design and intervention

in territories, especially the most vulnerable, also contributing to adaptation to climate change by increasing the resilience of the national territory. This Law must still be subject to specific regulation, but it is of great interest to cities as Porto that wish to offset their carbon emissions while also hoping to have the most positive impact on the surrounding territory (the North region of Porto). Thus, the city will exploit this new regulation and develop a comprehensive strategy based on it, expecting more developments in the next CCC iterations.

|  Indicator Name | Air quality  |
|  Indicator Unit | -  |
|  Definition | The air quality index translates in an easy and understandable way the state of air quality. In Portugal, thresholds are established for short-term (hourly and/or daily) and long-term (annual) air quality levels regarding relevant pollutants. The QualAR index, which includes data collected in the city is recommended by Porto's Environmental Department, and presents a classification based on the concentration of pollutants recorded at monitoring stations. The results are translated into a colour scale divided into five classes, from "Very Good" to "Bad".  |
|  Calculation | The calculation is carried out based on the arithmetic averages of pollutants measured at air quality stations according to the following criteria: • Zones - it is mandatory to measure the pollutants ozone (O3) and PM10 or PM2.5 particles (particles with a diameter equal to or less than 10 μm and 2.5 μm); • Agglomerations - it is mandatory to measure the pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM10 or PM2.5 particles. When available, the pollutant SO2 is also measured.  |

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

### C-1.1: Description or visualisation of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

The described governance structure for Porto's climate action, particularly the creation of the Porto's Transition Team and the establishment of a formal mandate for Porto Ambiente, reflects a comprehensive and collaborative approach to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. Below are described the key components of this participatory governance model:

#### 1. Porto Climate Pact:

The Porto Climate Pact, launched in 2022, represents a collective multi-stakeholder commitment to deal with climate change and achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 in the city of Porto. This ground-breaking agreement involves the formal collaboration of various entities, including the Porto Municipality, waste and energy companies, urban rehabilitation and construction entities, academia, digital transformation associations, public and private organizations and it has 228 institutional subscribers and more than 500 individual subscribers (citizens). The pact sets out a comprehensive strategy, encapsulated in the "Towards Carbon Neutrality 2030" agreement, which outlines the shared responsibilities and goals of the signatory entities. Led by the Vice-Mayor of Porto and supported by a dedicated Transition Team, this commitment symbolizes a concerted effort to address climate challenges through collaborative governance, emphasizing the significance of coordinated action and a unified approach to sustainable development. It exemplifies a strategic and structured initiative to propel the city towards its ambitious climate goals.

![img-62.jpeg](img-62.jpeg)
Figure 48. Formal presentation of the Porto Climate Pact in September 2022.

Porto Climate Pact has Porto's Transition Team as a managing team that includes a technical leadership in Porto Ambiente to orchestrate the municipal and to monitor the non-municipal efforts. Currently, the Directorate for Carbon Neutrality in Porto maintains permanent contact with its signatories through very different channels: physical and online meetings, group and bilateral meetings, workshops, informal moments, e-mail, phone calls. In this kind of networks, proximity is key, so there is a very aligned treatment with lots of technical representatives of these organizations. Moreover, since the beginning, this closer articulation enabled several perspectives on the work that has been done in the city. Different programmes, conferences, new plans and projects, lots of different initiatives and new commitments arose from these contacts, in both ways, among different subscribers of Porto Climate Pact. The Climate Neutrality Commitments 2030 presents a huge list of more ambitious commitments, some of them directly results from this closer interaction and some of them are inspired or at least aligned with Porto's carbon neutrality goal.

Formally, hundreds of institutions were invited do subscribe the Pact, mainly in the launch of the initiative. After that, there were dozens of organizations that did it on their own initiative. Recently, we also partnered with our colleagues from Porto Ambiente's awareness-raising teams, that are helping us to disseminate the project on the field, helping us in the expansion of the network of subscribers

and consequently increasing the potential for creating synergies and community impact in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

There has also been significant work in the approach to bring closer and involve citizens in this Pact. There is a Porto Climate Pact's activation stand used at local events to engage citizens to subscribe the Pact, explaining them the importance of the topic and how can be part of this wave of behavioural change. After that, we keep them engaged with a dedicated newsletter and invitations to other events, as well with new strategies we are developing, some of them related to WAKE UP! Pilot Project funded by NetZeroCities Pilot Programme Cohort 2, and other strategies to be developed specially related to the development and implementation of new climate policies.

As has been the case with other initiatives, the Transition Team is planning future work based on co-creation between the several different stakeholders, under the umbrella of the Porto Climate Pact. We intend to continue providing moments of consultation and development in the city, not just with experts and academics, but with everyone who contributes to urban dynamics. The work carried out under the Climate City Contract is an asset for the way in which it has been possible to gather and work on the various projects developed in the Municipality, organise the necessary investments and the consultation and commitment of current and new partners. This will be an iterative process that will support decision-making and stakeholder involvement and it is already based on an excellent working framework, but always learning from other cities' best practices and the support of NetZeroCities consortium.

During 2024, using the Climate City Contract as a reference, we plan to organize the Pact's subscribers into thematic clusters of interest, given that there is already a critical mass for this. The goal is to contribute synergies to accelerate the implementation of defined measures and commitments, and, possibly, to raise the bar on new commitments that allow for the acceleration of climate objectives. Some cluster topics will be decentralized clean energy production, energy efficiency measures, mobility and transport, sustainable construction, community engagement, food and circular economy, and carbon capture projects.

It is important to reinforce, at this level, the strong commitment of the political representatives of the city, with particular emphasis to the Mayor and the Vice-Mayor of Porto. The Porto's climate neutrality targets are often highlighted, and they are a way to create additional pressure on relevant political topics to assure a positive climate transition in the city such as more investment for public mobility and transports.

## 2. Porto's Transition Team:

![img-63.jpeg](img-63.jpeg)

• Actively participate in the objectives of the Mission “Smart and climate-neutral cities” for which Porto was selected to be one of the 100 cities chosen by the European Commission;
• Dynamize and actively contribute to the community of partners resulting from the “Porto Climate Pact” initiative;
• Contribute to the development of an innovation community and experimentation that enhances the development of new solutions and services for cities, with a high potential for replication.  |
|   | The team's responsibilities span various sectors, reflecting a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to climate action and decarbonisation. This collective involvement and diversity enhance the city's capacity to address a broad spectrum of climate-related challenges and complexities.  |
|   | The creation of the Porto's Transition Team brings together diverse entities, including units of the Porto City Council, municipal companies, and affiliated entities, fostering collaboration and shared decision-making. The collaborative institutions defined a set of general commitments, namely:

• Designate employees who should contribute and collaborate in the development of activities to be carried out within the scope of this Strategic Partnership;
• Contribute to the preparation of an annual work plan that describes the activities, goals and results achieved or to be achieved within the scope of the implementation of this Protocol;
• Provide data, technical and documentary support within the scope of the activities to be developed;
• Ensure the sharing of information on investments and actions that contribute positively to the objectives to be achieved within the scope of this Protocol.  |

Additionally, specific commitments stand out in accordance with the responsibility of each entity in the Porto Transition team. The collective approach ensures that multiple perspectives are considered in the formulation and implementation of climate strategies. The entities within the team have been collaborating for several years, even before this formalization. The agreement and formalization strengthen the alignment of efforts, ensuring a coordinated approach to the city's decarbonization strategy. The Porto Climate Pact and the involvement of various municipal companies/agencies also highlights the establishment of partnerships and networks. These collaborations with the Municipality leverage the expertise and resources of different entities, creating a municipal collective force to address climate challenges.

These partnership with CEIIA where they will be the main interlocutor with the involved cities, reflects a commitment to innovation in sustainable mobility, with a focus on quantifying and incentivizing carbon reduction. The development of this CCC can contribute and inspire other cities involved to step up their ambition to make their territories carbon neutral. The various contributions are fundamental for a coherent alignment with the defined goals.

# COMMON HOME OF HUMANITY

Collaboration with the University of Porto - Common Home of Humanity project

Ambitious project aiming to designate the climate as a world heritage and establish a global legal framework for climate. The collaboration signifies Porto's role in contributing to global initiatives that transcend local boundaries, showcasing leadership in addressing climate change at a broader scale.

In summary, the described governance model demonstrates a concerted effort involving various entities, both public and private, to tackle the complex challenge of achieving carbon neutrality in Porto. The formalization of the Porto's Transition Team, the mandate given to Porto Ambiente, and the strong political leadership indicate a commitment to a coordinated, multi-sectoral, and well-supported approach to climate action towards carbon neutrality.

Nevertheless, Porto recognizes that the national level plays a key role, namely in setting regulations and opportunities for funding, which poses a significant challenge in aligning local climate goals with central government policies and national targets. The city of Porto faces hurdles in implementing its climate initiatives when certain aspects of governance, such as the scope of executive action, extend beyond the Municipality's jurisdiction. Therefore, the need for alignment and collaboration with the central government is essential to ensure that national regulations, funding opportunities, and supportive policies are conducive to Porto's climate goals.

To mitigate this challenge, Porto is proactively engaging in a national network of Portuguese cities and regions committed to the transition to climate neutrality. The network was launched under the name "Network of Portuguese Cities and Regions for Climate Neutrality" and has already secured funding for its operation in 2024 from the Environmental Fund of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Action. This collaborative platform currently comprising 21 cities and regions aims to accelerate carbon neutrality and directly address the coordination issues with the central government. The objective is to create a more streamlined and cooperative framework that decreases dependence on external entities and fosters a more cohesive and integrated approach to climate action at the national and municipal levels. By participating in this network, Porto seeks to overcome systemic barriers and enhance the coordination between local and national climate initiatives.

"Zero Desperdicio" project, awarded the 1st prize in the "Support for the development of ecological markets and resource efficiency" category at the European Enterprise Promotion Awards¹⁸, stands as a beacon of circularity with profound social and climate objectives. In partnership with LIPOR, the intermunicipal waste management association, the initiative, championed by the Municipality of Porto, has successfully recovered approximately 350 tons of food. Launched in 2016 and gaining momentum in 2017 through the "Parcerias para o Impacto" program, the project expanded its reach across the intermunicipal territories. This collaborative effort has not only combat food waste but has also prevented over 300 tons of food from turning into waste, benefitting 35 000 recipients by the end of Q3 2020. The project serves as a model for circular, social, and sustainable practices, aligning with the principles of the circular economy, creating positive social impacts, and contributing significantly to climate resilience.

Municipal vegetable gardens' project https://ambiente.cm-porto.pt/solucoes-inspiradas-na-natureza/hortas-urbanas in Porto is a transformative initiative converting idle spaces into cultivable land, providing citizens the opportunity to engage in organic farming, allocating plots to individuals interested. Across four hectares and 13 dispersed locations in the city, 500 small areas each one with a composter facilitate the return of 120 tons of organic matter to the soil annually. Aligned with Porto's commitment to environmental consciousness, the Municipality invests in an ongoing sustainability education program to instigate generational behaviour change and citizen engagement. The strategy involves expanding the network of municipal gardens to enhance food security with minimal public resource utilization. Through partnerships with public and private entities, the City of Porto, acting as a mediator and technical supporter, delegates management responsibilities to the partner organization LIPOR in its broader project "Horta à Porta". Alongside the plot, participants receive training in organic farming and composting. The produce is for personal consumption, and participants are provided with water, a communal tool storage area, and an individual composter. After receiving a plot, monthly monitoring by LIPOR ensures compliance with organic farming practices, with annual recycling of the training. This project represents a significant step towards sustainable urban agriculture, education, and community engagement in Porto.

Community Composting Islands is a project implemented in Porto through Porto Ambiente, which has created 2 pilot community composting spaces. There are already 151 families making a fundamental contribution to the success of these spaces, which are estimated to have enabled more than 7,6 tonnes of bio-waste to be recovered. The commitment of these participants has made it possible to produce 2,05 tonnes of compost, which has been distributed to the participating families. In addition to the circularity promoted by this project, there is a clear community involvement around environmental issues that brings citizens closer together and valorises their contribution.

The Center for Circularity project will develop a reuse centre in the ecocentre of Prelada and it will promote the recovery and reuse of old equipment increasing its lifetime value and use.

The ReBOOT https://reboot.porto.pt/ is an initiative that aims to contribute to a circular, fair and responsible economy in Porto. The initiative intends to demystify the difficulty of repairing and recovering computers and give users the skills and tools they need to extend the useful life of their computer equipment. Under the slogan "Repair your computer. Transform the world", ReBOOT is a computer recovery, repair and sharing initiative with the aim of saving money and natural resources, as well as sharing knowledge and promoting access to digital environments while at the same time being able to support some Porto's social institutions with this recovered equipment.

Social innovation initiatives in Porto play a crucial role in addressing systemic barriers on the journey towards carbon neutrality. They often involve a collaborative governance model where various stakeholders, including municipal departments, private entities, and community representatives, work together. This promotes effective communication, coordination, and decision-making, addressing governance barriers. Moreover, these social initiatives incorporate participatory processes that involve citizens in decision-making. This fosters transparency, accountability, and ensures that governance structures align with the needs and expectations of the community.

The type of social innovation initiatives identified also encourage collaboration between different sectors, enhance the exchange of knowledge and resources, breaking down silos and addressing challenges that arise from sector-specific approaches.

The social awareness campaigns and educational programs mentioned are integral components of social innovation initiatives and they aim to address knowledge and literacy barriers promoting the spread of knowledge about climate issues, sustainable practices, and the benefits of specific projects. By empowering individuals to actively participate in and contribute to projects related to sustainability, these initiatives also contribute to enhance community skills regarding climate-conscious practices.

By participating in international initiatives and networks, Porto's social innovation projects may access grant opportunities provided by European and global organizations, mitigating financial constraints. Entrepreneurship incubators and innovation hubs often explore innovative financing models, including public-private partnerships and crowdfunding. These models can help overcome traditional funding barriers by diversifying funding sources.

Collaborations with technology companies and startups can bring expertise in digitization and the development of technologies. Such partnerships contribute to overcoming technological barriers and ensuring effective implementation.

By addressing these barriers, social innovation initiatives showcase Porto's determination to build a city that is resilient in the face of challenges, socially inclusive in its opportunities, and environmentally conscious in its development. Porto is not merely responding to the present needs but is strategically planning for a future where innovation and sustainability go hand in hand, creating a model for urban development that is both forward-thinking and community centric.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

## Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iteration

Porto's Climate City Contract (CCC) is set for a comprehensive review in the next two years, reflecting the city's commitment to ongoing climate action initiatives. The ensuing steps outline the city plans to refine and elevate the Action Plan within the CCC framework in future iterations:

### 1. Climate Strategy Refinement

Identify and define the various actions, initiatives, and projects outlined in Porto's Action Plan, aligning them closely with the city's carbon neutrality objectives. The goal is to have a detailed understanding of each initiative, including its financial requirements, to ensure seamless implementation and effective progress tracking.

### 2. Stakeholder Continuous Engagement Plan

Porto aims to cultivate ongoing stakeholder engagement within the framework of the CCC in parallel with the extensive work that has been developed with the Porto Climate Pact as a collaborative platform, uniting diverse stakeholders, including government bodies, businesses, communities, and non-profit organizations. So far 228 institutional signatories of the Pact have been gathered to support Porto's climate neutrality ambition, actively contributing to the city's efforts and aiding in achieving its goal of climate neutrality by 2030. Regarding the signatories who are committing to this CCC, the number and relevance of signatories' commitments is likely to increase over time. However, for both the Pact and the CCC it is necessary to develop a comprehensive plan with specific actions and timelines to keep securing more formal commitments from diverse entities and organizations within Porto. The plan should emphasize the importance of Letters of Commitment, fostering a dynamic and participatory environment through regular communication channels, periodic stakeholder meetings, and interactive workshops. Additionally, recognizing and rewarding stakeholders for outstanding contributions is crucial for maintaining enthusiasm and commitment, and providing transparent and comprehensive reports on CCC progress is very important to maintain accountability and build trust among stakeholders.

### 3. Interdepartmental Collaboration

Broadening interdepartmental collaboration to advance the implementation of the Action and Investment Plans is also fundamental. This entails promoting greater collaboration among different departments and work areas involved in the CCC's implementation to enhance overall coordination and effectiveness. The focus is on increasing the number of individuals engaged within municipal companies, the Municipality, and the transition team, fostering a more aligned approach and maybe to have closer collaborations with the Transition Team.

### 4. Tailored Monitoring Strategy

Creating a detailed Monitoring and Evaluation Plan tailored to Porto's climate challenges is essential. This involves identifying key indicators relevant to the city's context, specifying data collection methods, and defining reporting requirements. Effectively communicating the plan to participating actors and entities, along with providing guidance on data collection aligned with Porto's needs, ensures a robust and context-specific monitoring and evaluation process.

### 5. Iterative CCC Review

Following the evaluation process, Porto will review its CCC based on the results. This includes assessing the effectiveness of the monitoring and evaluation process within the city's context and identifying areas for improvement. The review aims to align the CCC with Porto's distinct climate journey, ensuring that the contract remains a dynamic and adaptive tool for advancing the city's climate goals. After this extensive work, Porto is more focused to take action and to accelerate the work that has been done. In this context, the city must work to attract and secure the necessary financial, human and knowledge resources to carry out real actions, while at the same time monitoring the outputs and changes in the city. This analysis of the city's progress will allow Porto to confirm the city's strategy or, if necessary, to correct the course of action in a positive, iterative process. This process will end when a new "normal" is reached, i.e., when the city's vision for 2030 is achieved:

![img-74.jpeg](img-74.jpeg)

Porto 2030 is a city that is moving towards energy self-sufficiency, where public and private buildings are mostly renovated and use more locally generated renewable energy (photovoltaic and solar thermal). Residences and businesses will come together to produce surplus energy resources, promoting sharing and storage, and creating positive energy districts. Equipment and lighting are fully efficient, thanks to a continuous process of incentives for their replacement and investment in new green technology.

![img-75.jpeg](img-75.jpeg)

The use of public, shared and zero-emission transport will be the "new normal", anchored in a mobility system powered by electricity and renewable gases, with a robust charging network. The citizen of Porto 2030 will be an active user of soft modes of transport and will have a strengthened and interconnected intermodal offer of metro, metrobus and electric buses, which will tend to be free. To this end, the city will continue to simplify fares and extend free transport to more groups of citizens, ensuring quality of service and contributing to the attractiveness of public transport.

![img-76.jpeg](img-76.jpeg)

In Porto, circular city 2030, water is supplied without energy consumption and the reuse of treated wastewater is promoted. Solid waste will be reused through a comprehensive and effective process of selective separation, recovery of organic matter and, at the end of the line, energy recovery. The food system will be in a process of decarbonization, facilitated by shorter distribution chains in which local producers will play a growing role.

![img-77.jpeg](img-77.jpeg)

In the field of urban logistics, a strategic plan capable of regulating and electrifying it will be crucial to the decongestion of Porto. Porto 2030 will have the most competitive companies due to reduced energy costs, whose investments will pay off. Climate change and decarbonization are opportunities for businesses, creating new green jobs, economic dynamism and social justice.

![img-78.jpeg](img-78.jpeg)

Porto in 2030 will be anchored on a strong component of digitization and dematerialization of services, aligning policy-based decisions on data shared by different organizations, loaded on an urban platform that promotes better management and consequent significant energy savings (e.g. access to real-time data on energy consumption, due to increasing sensing and smart metering as key to effective behaviour change). Porto will continue to benefit from the strong relationship and collaboration with the business ecosystem, research and associative centres in the implementation of decarbonization actions, and at the same time will play an active role in sharing its experiences and good practices in European networks.

boundaries were established for the baseline year of 2019. This baseline year was chosen because it was the last (and most recent) year with complete available information before the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Once the baseline year is established, data such as the resident population, land area and gross domestic product (GDP) are retrieved from national statistics. These data allow the calculation of per capita, per area unit and per monetary unit indicators. The Municipality and the city of Porto are coincident and despite being a relatively small territory  $(41,42\mathrm{km}^2)$ , Porto is a densely populated city (236 170 inhabitants in 2019) $^{19}$  and has an average GDP per capita $^{20}$  of 19 771,6 € (national GDP per capita in 2019 = 20 703,6 €).

Regarding the level of detail and depth of the inventory (GPC reporting level), the CIRIS platform allows the selection of different options ranging from a more simplified approach (BASIC) to a more detailed one (BASIC +). For the city of Porto, the BASIC+ option was selected, which includes the activities and scopes presented in Figure 51, covering all the relevant sectors and sources of GHG.

The next stage was to record activity data for the different sectors: Stationary energy, Transportation, Waste, IPPU (Industrial processes and product use) and AFOLU (Agriculture, forestry, and other land use).

Stationary energy refers to the energy consumed in buildings and facilities, through direct fuel combustion (e.g., natural gas) within the city boundary - scope 1, indirect use of grid-supplied electricity or heat (district heating/cooling systems are not a current practice in Portugal) within the city boundary - scope 2, and transmission and distribution losses from

grid-supplied energy – scope 3. The Portuguese Directorate of Energy and Geology (DGEG)²¹ publishes annual data on electricity, natural gas consumption and fossil fuels sales at the municipal level and segmented by economic activity. These data make it possible to assess how much energy is sold/consumed in each Municipality and by whom (residential buildings, industries, commercial buildings, transports, etc.), providing a comprehensive database for characterizing consumption and GHG emissions. In addition, local PV installed capacity is assessed from an open-data platform provided by the Portuguese distribution system operator (DSO) E-Redes²² and data from REN, the Portuguese transport system operator (TSO)²³, was used to assess the transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) losses from grid-supplied electricity (scope 3)²⁴. According to the technical studies released by REN, T&amp;D power network losses amounted to 11,3% in 2019. This source was also used to assess the fugitive emissions from natural gas networks. In this case, the losses are only around 0,7%.

For Transports, due to the lack of better information, a top-down fuel-sales approach has been adopted. For on-road transportation, all emissions from fuels sold within the city boundaries are considered as scope 1. Therefore, data retrieved from the DGEG database are used. Public reports of the city bus company (STCP)²⁵ and private records of the municipal fleet were then used to categorize the data according to the fleet type into public (buses), municipal (municipal feet) or private (the remaining). In the case of private transportation, information from the Porto's Metropolitan Area Mobility Survey²⁶ was also used to estimate the share of daily trips made in private vehicles within and outside the city: in Porto, around 60% of daily trips in private vehicles are for travels within the city. This information was used to distinguish between scope 1 (emissions from fuel combustion that occur within the city) and scope 3 (emissions from transboundary journeys that occur outside the city). Scope 2 refers to grid-supplied energy consumed in the city for on-road transportation. In this setting, data on the electricity consumed by the city bus company and at public electric vehicles' charging points were considered. These data were retrieved both from the bus company's annual reports and from the Portuguese Electric Mobility Management Entity (MOBI.E)²⁷, which provides information on public EV charging at the municipal level. For railways, DGEG data were considered, as well as the annual reports²⁸, the consumption data of the city tram²⁹. As these services are fully electric, scope 2 (grid-supplied energy consumed in the city for railways) was assumed. A residual consumption of electricity and diesel oil was also registered for waterborne navigation and aviation purposes. These data were also obtained from the DGEG public database.

Concerning Waste, both solid waste and wastewater data were analysed. As Porto is a residential and service city, the solid waste produced is classified as municipal solid waste (MSW), since it mainly includes food waste, garden and park waste, paper and cardboard, wood, textiles, disposable diapers, rubber and leather, plastics, metal, glass, etc. Municipal solid waste is collected by the municipal company Porto Ambiente³⁰. Thus, the consumption of electricity, natural gas, and lubricants (DGEG

Losses were only assessed for Electricity consumption provided by the grid. PV production was considered as self-consumption and, therefore, losses in T&amp;D power grids were not considered.

data) has been included as scope 1. However, solid waste disposal and treatment is done outside the city boundaries (scope 3) by LIPOR³¹, a waste management company responsible for the disposal and treatment of waste in Porto region. In its Waste Observatory³², LIPOR provides data on the amount of waste produced in the city and treated through each type of process (disposal in landfills or open dumps, biologic treatment, or incineration). Missing information can also be retrieved from the company reporting section. For wastewater, the CIRIS' wastewater calculator was used to estimate the concentration of methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) from the treatment of domestic, commercial, and industrial wastewater. This tool requires the upload of data on the city (including the number of inhabitants, the type of climate, the country for an estimation of the diet, etc.), as well as data on the type of process used in wastewater treatment plant (effluent's organic load, organic component removed as sludge, etc.). These data, gathered from the city, made it possible to estimate the corresponding emissions.

Lastly, the IPPU emissions generated in the city were also estimated, based on data from the DGEG. As a result of the shift observed from industry to the tertiary sector observed in the last century, the city of Porto does not have many emissions reported in the IPPU sector, limiting it mainly to the utilization of bitumen in the construction industry, which accounts for more than 70% of the total emissions reported in this sector. Other products include the use of lubricants for transformation purposes in different industries and bitumen and paraffin wax in the chemical industry.

# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

In January 2022, Porto applied to the EU Mission Cities initiative, “100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030”, with the aim of accelerating climate neutrality by 2030, having access to new financing and collaboration opportunities through the Horizon Europe program. As one of 112 selected cities, Porto, with its rich cultural heritage, embraces this transformative journey, acknowledging urban areas' crucial role in housing 75% of EU citizens and contributing to significant energy consumption and over 70% of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, cities must lead as hubs of innovation, aiding others in achieving climate neutrality by 2030.

The city of Porto, affectionately named "Invicta", carries profound cultural significance for its local identity. This nickname, translating to "Undefeated" or "Unconquerable", pays homage to a historical feat during which the city resisted conquest during the civil war and endured a siege of more than a year, embodying the community's will and strength. With the same tenacity with which we resisted sieges and faced adversities, today we position ourselves at the forefront of the fight against climate change, not because it is easy, but because it is imperative. This is our commitment to the Planet and to future generations. In this effort, everyone is called to become an agent of change, collaborating to transform the carbon neutrality by 2030 ambition into a reality. This call to action not only reflects our commitment to a sustainable future but also underscores our co-creative identity, essential in redefining what it means to be "Invicta".

In this context, we are mobilizing a diversity of stakeholders – from anonymous citizens to large corporations, including academic institutions and community organizations. Together, we are strengthening the fabric of our city with each initiative, each project, each collaborative action, collectively committing to forging a sustainable and resilient future. Through this union of efforts, we redefine what it means to be "Invicta" in the 21st century, fully embracing the challenge of leading by example in the transition to carbon neutrality.

At the beginning of 2022, the city of Porto had already, by its own will, began the path of bringing together multiple city agents – public and private organizations, as well as individual citizens – to establish commitments that are effective in decarbonizing the economy and consequently reducing greenhouse gases, with the launch of the Porto Climate Pact which currently has 228 institutional subscribers and exactly 538 individual subscribers. As part of this Pact, the city has set an ambitious target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2030, strongly showing its commitment to be a leader in climate action at both the national and European levels. This is a challenging goal, as municipal assets only account for a small portion (less than 5%) of the city's total GHG emissions.

Despite these challenges, Porto has made significant progress in recent years towards the goal of carbon neutrality. The city has achieved a 38% reduction in emissions in 2019 and 42% in 2021 compared to 2004 levels. Now, the goal of carbon neutrality by 2030 represents reducing emissions by 85% until 2030, compared to the new baseline of 2019. The remaining 15% will be offset. Porto's commitment to tackling climate change has shown a remarkable upward trend, consistently setting higher environmental objectives. Porto signed the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy in 2019 aiming to reduce 50% of GHG, and the Green City Accord in the same year, setting a clear goal for energy transition and decarbonization. In 2020, 2021 and 2022 Porto was distinguished as a leader in climate action by the "Carbon Disclosure Project" (CDP) awarding the A rating to the city among several cities around the world that take "a bold lead in environmental actions and transparency despite the pressures of a challenging global economic situation".

The city has been focusing on several key areas in its path towards climate neutrality, including the transition to clean energy production and consumption, the adoption of a circular economy measures and a sustainable management of the urban water cycle. In addition, Porto is prioritizing the conservation of green areas and biodiversity, as well as education for sustainability. The city is also committed to improving urban quality of life, as well as social and territorial integration, through investments in urban regeneration, sustainable mobility, and the regeneration of disadvantaged communities.

To further its sustainability efforts, Porto has implemented a range of measures with long-lasting impact on the community, including the continuous renewal of the city's bus fleet with eco-friendly vehicles run on electricity the ongoing expansion of Porto's metro network, the replacement of public lighting with LED technology, and the development of a roadmap for a circular economy with the aim of doubling the rate of circular material usage by 2030. The city has been using 100% renewable energy in all municipal facilities since 2021, invested in the improvement of energy efficiency in public buildings and social housing, and promoted the decentralization of renewable energy production in local communities, increasing local production and consumption, and improving monitoring systems to enable data-driven decisions.

In addition to these efforts, Porto is working to improve its urban water cycle management. The city's water utility company, Águas do Porto, is committed to the responsible management of water resources and has implemented a number of initiatives to reduce the energy consumption in water distribution, reduce water losses, increase water recycling, and improve the efficiency of its wastewater treatment plants.

To encourage sustainable construction, the Environmental Index of Porto is under development. This index, which is part of the city's new Municipal Master Plan (PDM), intends to encourage promoters of rehabilitation and construction projects to use sustainable construction solutions in their projects, improving the bioclimatic comfort of city buildings and reducing the vulnerability to extreme weather events. Porto is also actively working to promote biodiversity and work on climate change adaptation through the use of nature-based solutions. As part of this effort, the city is doubling its green areas by planting native trees, increasing soil permeability, and incorporating sustainable solutions in urban regeneration and construction.

Overall, Porto's efforts to become a leader in climate action and sustainability are significant, and the city is well on track to achieve its goal of carbon neutrality by 2030. Although there is evidence of a steady and positive reduction of GHG trend over the years, from energy consumption, mobility and circularity, the largest share of Porto's GHG emissions comes from transport and buildings (stationary energy). Hence, the Mission will help develop opportunities in terms of actions and partnerships with other city stakeholders on these sectors and reinforce the city's commitment to continue working and improving the plans and initiatives already underway.

The city takes on this endeavour with both confidence and humility. Together with its key partners outlined in this document, the city is determined to turn the Climate City Contract (CCC) commitments into a successful transition to climate neutrality by 2030. This journey is enhanced by the implementation of the Mission, making use of the new frameworks created for multi-stakeholder and multi-level collaboration. Thanks to the possibility of peer-to-peer collaboration provided by platforms such as NetZeroCities (NZC) at European level, synergies and exchange with other European cities that are also, like Porto, pioneers in sustainability will be facilitated. Likewise, thanks to the active connection between the European platform of the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, Porto will make use of the main instruments available at European level to put innovation at the service of the ecological and digital transition of cities.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

## Goal

Porto aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 in accordance with its application to the European Mission “Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030”, taking national leadership in this area and resulting in a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 85% by 2030 in relation to the base year of 2019 (the administrative territories included in the city’s 2030 target are the same as the city administrative boundary). This target is fully in line with the climate neutrality definition pursued by Mission as it means to achieve net zero GHG emissions, to be realised mainly by cutting emissions, investing in green technologies, and protecting/enhancing the natural environment.

This can only be achieved through a collective and widely participated effort, with the involvement of citizens and organizations, as well as the National Government and the European Commission, supported by initiatives that make this ambition possible. This ambition was firstly expressed in 2021 in the Expression of Interest (EOI) to the ‘100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities’ Mission, reinforced by the Porto Climate Pact, and since then, the city has been diligently working on this commitment. Being chosen as a "Mission" city by the European Commission is an important boost to accelerate the transformation process and achieve these goals through the creation of areas and environments where climate neutrality will be a reality by 2030.

The scope and definitions of “climate neutrality” follows the framework presented by the EU Cities Mission project and the Porto EOI:

Stationary energy (buildings)
Transport
Waste management
Industrial processes and product use (IPPU)

The city inventory of GHG emissions cover the entire administrative territory, sectors, sources and scopes, excepting Agricultural, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU) as Porto is a purely residential urban area, without agricultural activities developed in the city.

Porto is the 2nd biggest city in Portugal. It spans over 41.42 sq km and it is home to 231.800 inhabitants. Porto is the heart of a region with more than 1.7 million inhabitants – the Metropolitan Area of Porto. It is the 4th most populous Municipality and the 3rd most densely populated in the country. In the last few decades, the city is getting more attractive for living, studying, and hosting businesses. One in every five startups nationwide are in Porto and the city’s connection to academia and research centres contributed to the creation of a hub known for generating, attracting, and retaining knowledge. Porto is an ecosystem of innovation and environmental sustainability in areas as climate action, circular economy, and protection of natural heritage.

The Municipality of Porto has been monitoring GHG emissions since 2008, through the Porto Energy Agency (AdEPorto), and its role in the decarbonization of the city has been systematic, but limited, as municipal assets are only responsible for less than 5% of total GHG emissions. Most GHG emissions in the city come from the buildings, residential and services sectors (51%) and transports (42%).

Porto understands the stability of the global climate system is at risk because of the high concentration of GHG in the global atmosphere. Mitigating these emissions is urgently needed to avoid unpredictable consequences on the natural, economic, and social systems. The European Union has been leading the way: under European Climate Law – a key element of the European Green Deal, EU countries are now legally obliged to reach both the 2030 and 2050 climate goals, 55% reduction in 2030 and neutrality in 2050, respectively. At a national level, the Climate Framework Law of 2021 sets a reduction in emissions of at least 55% by 2030, 65% by 2040, and 90% by 2050. Reducing GHG emissions requires ambitious measures and high public and private investment, but at the same time represents an opportunity for competitiveness, employment, and social justice.

Hence, the collective action of the Porto Climate Pact and the city participation in the European Mission “100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities” is of great importance to accelerate the energy transition and achieve an emissions neutral balance by 2030. Carbon neutrality in Porto can only be achieved with specific actions carried out by all parties involved regardless of their dimension, previous action towards environmental sustainability or type of legal entity: all organisations and citizens have a role to play.

Carbon neutrality, poses a major challenge to the traditional status quo and potentially requires high investment, however this is not a stand-alone objective but connected to countless co-benefits for the city of Porto – improvement of air quality and citizen's health, protection of ecosystems and urban biodiversity, functionality of public spaces and increased access to green spaces, quality of housing (especially in the most vulnerable buildings and areas of the city), improved conditions of access to energy (reducing situations of energy poverty with a robust and low-cost energy system and supply), reduced use of raw materials and waste generation, stimulation of local economy and new economic opportunities, local innovation, digitalization of infrastructures and dematerialization of services, new jobs and green employment, as well as benefits associated with a reduction of costs – contributing to more prosperous, fairer society, attempting to improve the lives of Porto citizens without leaving anyone behind.

Overall, this is our summarized vision for Porto: A city that wants to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, taking national leadership in this area, through a collective and widely participated effort, with the involvement of citizens and organizations, as well as the National Government and the European Commission, supported by initiatives that make this ambition possible. A more resilient city that relies on efficient energy use, renewable energy production and energy storage to cope with unexpected situations. A city where circularity and decarbonisation processes play an important role in the economic activity and job creation. A fair city, where decarbonisation contributes to supporting the people and entities most affected by this energy transition, reducing energy poverty. A healthier city, with high air quality that enhances citizens' health and quality of life. An inclusive city, where all organisations and citizens are an active part of the decarbonisation process.

# 3 Strategic priorities

## Strategic priorities

In the past year and, leading by example, many projects and actions have been implemented in the Municipality of Porto in the most diverse areas – energy systems, mobility &amp; transport, waste &amp; circular economy, green infrastructure &amp; nature-based solutions, buildings &amp; heating – all towards the objective of decarbonization of the city. This goal requires a comprehensive set of policies that can be summarized into four major axes towards sustainability, mitigation and adaptation to climate change and protecting the environment to reach a climate-positive Porto by 2030. These priorities indicated below are the meaningful changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in the city and they are all interconnected, involving a large number of actors, policy measures and investments for their implementation. They are further explained and elaborated in the CCC Action Plan.

### I. Energy - Greater efficiency, lower consumption, clean production and less carbon.

The best way of reducing GHG emissions is to use energy rationally, increase energy efficiency and promote the use of alternative (renewable) energies whilst avoiding the use of fossil fuels.

Porto intends to be an energy efficiency benchmark for Portuguese cities and plans to be carbon neutral by 2030. Since the first quarter of 2020, the electricity purchased by the Municipality for its buildings and equipment has been 100% renewably generated.

With the aim of supporting the energy transition in private buildings and fostering the city's energy independence, Porto has outlined an incentive plan for the installation of photovoltaic panels in private buildings, totalling around 8 million euros by 2030. The Municipality's support is manifested through a reduction in the Municipal Property Tax (IMI) value for property owners investing in renewable energy production, and it is estimated to directly contribute to the energy transition of approximately 2 thousand installations, capable of generating around 23 megawatts (MW). With an investment of approximately 6 million euros, it is achieved that, by 2030, all municipal housing buildings will be producing 6 MW of renewable energy.

In order to help realise its transition to more efficient and sustainable energy systems, Porto set up AdEPorto (energy agency) in 2007. Both public and private entities are members of this private non-profit association, which currently covers the metropolitan area north of the Douro River. AdEPorto is a key player to support the climate ambition of Porto and other municipalities. It has developed several studies, plans and projects and as a result of this work and the increasing contribution of renewable energy sources to electricity generation, Porto has been managing to reduce its GHG emissions.

Examples of energy projects under way:

Porto solar sees the light of day: The "Porto Solar" project benefits 29 public service buildings and will continue to grow. There already are many public schools with photovoltaic (PV) panels installed and the number continues to increase. The ambition is to use the roofs of more than 50 municipal boroughs to produce 6 MW of renewable energy, directly serving almost 30 thousand people. There is also an incentive scheme for installing PV panels on private buildings, through a reduction in the IMI (Municipal Property Tax) to be paid by owners who invest in renewable energy production. Porto is still expanding the charging of electric vehicles (EV) and pilot schemes for local energy storage.

Renewable Energy Communities: The city will support new Renewable Energy Communities, following the example of Asprela+Sustentável, namely in the Bairro Agra do Amial, where clean energy will be produced for 181 houses and a school, encouraging local energy sharing. The theme of Renewable Energy Communities presents itself as a means to achieve goals in the fight against Energy Poverty, and as a complement to energy efficiency interventions at the level of the surroundings of these buildings. There are also private companies collaborating in these communities. It also promotes the development of business models that may allow accelerating the penetration of renewable-based energy, reflecting advantages in the population, particularly those in greater economic fragility.

More comfort and energy efficiency for residential buildings: Domus Social, the municipal company that manages public housing, is committed to increasing the thermal comfort of municipal tenants, allowing families to reduce their energy bills and ecological footprints. The extensive rehabilitation over the past years was responsible for the improvement that has been achieved through passive measures, such as the application of thermal insulation and the replacement of existing glazing, and active measures, such as the installation of solar photovoltaic panels for common areas in buildings and solar thermal panels for heating hot water.

100% LED street lighting: Porto is replacing all the existing public lights fittings with LED technology. Through this initiative, the Municipality of Porto will install around 26 thousand more efficient luminaires, in an intervention that will make LED technology 100% in the public lighting infrastructure in the territory. This measure, which is based on the Porto Public Lighting Master Plan (PDIP), and which has the monitoring and support of the AdEPorto (energy agency), will allow annual savings in CO2 and final energy consumption.

Saving energy when treating water: The municipal company Águas e Energia do Porto, which has pioneered the implementation of projects that have already led to a 95% reduction in its use of electricity, also participates in projects focused on optimising the energy consumed by wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and the emissions generated by this consumption. The project will lower GHG emissions in WWTP by more than 280 tonnes a year.

## II. Mobility - A city for its people.

Porto has invested in electric mobility, public transport and soft mobility, and has been gradually recovering public spaces for people use.

As the transport sector is responsible for a huge part of the city's greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), Porto is acting progressively in this area. Internally, the municipal fleet of light vehicles has already been renewed and it is 75% electric, and the fleet of municipal waste collection vehicles (from Porto Ambiente) is being upgraded to greener solutions. On the other hand, and aware of its responsibilities as regards changing behaviours, the Municipality has taken steps to improve, add value and encourage the use of public transport, namely the Metro do Porto responsible for the Light Rail Network with investments in its system, in terms of accessibility, fastness and reliability.

Porto Municipality (together with other 5 municipalities of Porto Metropolitan Area) owns the Sociedade de Transportes Coletivos do Porto (STCP), an intermunicipal bus company, and, thus, can more easily influence the prioritising of this mode of transport and ways of improving customer service. The renewal of the bus fleet, replacing diesel vehicles with electric and natural gas vehicles,
Porto.

is another measure that has been ongoing since 2018. In the area of mobility, it must be mentioned the Terminal Intermodal de Campanhã (TIC) which allowed the city's connectivity to increase, surpassing the milestone of five million passengers in the first year of activity. No less important has been Porto's investment in its recovery of public space. This has involved the expansion of the cycle-path network, the availability of free and safe bicycle parking and some experimental temporary closures to traffic of streets that are heavily used by both pedestrians and vehicles.

Examples of measures in place to decarbonise transport and promote the use of public transport and soft modes of travel:

A more ecological municipal fleet: Currently, 75% of the light vehicles in the municipal fleet are electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids. Additionally, Porto Ambiente and STCP fleets are moving in an increasingly naturally renewable way, using biomethane, a 100% renewable form of natural gas, produced from organic waste, that will supply the equivalent of 36 STCP buses and the municipal environment company's collection vehicles. Until 2027, 40% of the STCP bus fleet will be 100% electric with zero diesel buses.

Promotion of soft and active mobility: The Porto City Council will implement a network of priority routes for means of soft mobility that covers about 30 kilometres of streets and establishes, in some, a maximum speed of car circulation of 20 kilometres per hour. The program, entitled Rede 20, aims to prioritize the means of soft and active mobility: the bicycle, scooter and, above all, the pedestrian. With this network, the public space will have distinct streets: some intended for car traffic, which are part of the road network defined in the Municipal Master Plan (PDM), and others with limitations to road traffic, which will become part of Rede 20.

Improve and expand Porto Metro: The Porto Light Rail Network, which links seven municipalities along a 67 km network and has its centre in Porto is a key infrastructure to mobility in the city and a huge contributor to decarbonization. In March 2021, works started on the Yellow Line extension and the construction of the new Pink Line in the city, which aims to improve the city's metro service and connectivity. In September of the same year, the new design started for the Ruby Line – spanning 6 km in length, the line starts at Casa da Música (Porto) and reaches Santo Ovídio (Vila Nova da Gaia), the city's southern quarter. Currently under construction, this metro extension will support the city of Porto's efforts to cut emissions and fight climate change with enhanced public transport options for commuters. Plans are being developed for 4 more metro lines in the metropolitan area, expected to be completed by 2030.

Putting public transport first: Porto Municipality has been implementing priority measures to improve public transports and increase the number of public transportation users, namely extending bus lanes, optimising urban lines and relocating terminals. This includes free public transportation for individuals up to 18 years old, recently extended to those up to 23 years old, along with favoring means of transport that use cleaner, more energy-efficient propulsion technologies. Additionally, Porto Municipality is going to offer 22 free annual public transport trips to citizens of Porto. The new Bus Rapid Transit System will add eight kilometres of green mobility to the city of Porto. This new extension of public transport will link the roundabouts of the Boavista, Anémona and the Praça do Império, in an investment financed by the Portuguese Resilience and Recovery Funds (RRF).

## III. Circularity - A reference in neutrality and circular economy.

The Municipality has invested a substantial part of its efforts in the concrete actions found in the Roadmap for a Circular Porto by 2030 with the aim of doubling the rate of circular material usage by 2030.

The city is currently taking various steps to reduce waste, extend the useful life of resources and extract maximum value from them, in accordance with the principles of the circular economy and inspired by nature. The circular economy is one of the key strands of Porto's medium - and long -term municipal strategy for the environment, encouraging material circularity, greater reuse of materials, and greater repairability of equipment.

Porto Municipality believes that "leading by example" and encouraging best practices are good ways of influencing and inspiring change. This is why it has sought to align its goods and services procurement and its work on the ground with the guiding principles of circularity. It aims to motivate and empower companies to turn environmental and social challenges into circular business opportunities, bring together key players to co-create responses to the challenges and raise awareness among institutions and individual citizens, so that they can make more informed, conscious and sustainable choices.

Examples of steps being taken to reduce waste, extend the useful life of resources and extract maximum value from them, in accordance with the principles of the circular economy:

Waste collection and transformation: On waste management, Porto has several measures under implementation to turn waste into resources. City waste is sent for recovery (energy, organic or multimaterial), fulfilling with the zero-landfill policy. The main goal is to transform waste into resources by improving the separation of municipal solid waste - increase recycling rates, diversify separation flows by focusing on individualized flows of organic and textile waste. A pioneering household organic waste collection project, which is based on the recovery of compound returned to the soil to enrich it, already involves the participation of more than 40 thousand families, with the entire city coverage in mind.

Circular construction: Construction is a sector that consumes large quantities of raw materials and produces an equal amount of construction and demolition waste (CDW). Porto Municipality plans to introduce circularity into public works, by promoting, for example, the reuse of CDW in new works projects. Currently, the promotion of public certified projects with LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) or BREAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) standards is encouraged.

Less plastic, more Porto: The Municipality has consistently sought to discourage the use of single-use plastic. Whether in internal procurement processes or in demands made on its partners operating in the city, there has been an effort to reduce tons of plastic from the waste cycle every year.

Food waste reduction: Since 2016, Porto Ambiente and LIPOR (Association of Municipalities for the Sustainable Waste Management of Porto) have been running a food waste reduction project aimed at restaurants and their clients - Embrulha (Wrap it up). The project involves distributing free sustainable packaging to restaurants for them to give to their customers so that they can safely take their leftovers home. The city has been promoting the

reduction in food waste and the decrease the ecological footprint of food, not only in production but also in transportation, encouraging local purchasing and consumption.

## IV. Green areas – A vast and growing asset

Porto's new Municipal Master Plan includes a target of doubling the number of public green areas in the city over the next decade.

Porto aspires to be a greener city. Strategic concerns regarding the planning of the city's green areas currently include ensuring a connection between new spaces and recovering existing spaces in the form of green corridors, as well as creating local gardens close to where people live and work. Porto green areas expansion, already underway, includes the requalification of the Tinto River and the expansion of Parque Oriental, Parque Central da Asprela, Terminal Intermodal de Campanhã, Escarpa das Fontainhas, Parque da Lapa, Parque da Alameda de Cartes and Parque de S. Roque, amongst others. The Municipality has implemented a series of initiatives to restore and improve the city's parks and gardens, utilizing more natural-based solutions. It has also taken steps to conserve and protect trees, increase the wooded area and consequently, the carbon sequestration capacity. Private spaces are also part of the city's green infrastructure. They have an important role in the benefits they provide the city, and Porto Municipality counts on the collaboration of residents to enhance their gardens, terraces and patios by planting indigenous trees and shrubs, to promote better quality of life for all citizens and for the city.

Examples of Porto Municipality programmes to maintain existing green spaces and to create new spaces wherever possible:

Plan where to plant: The Municipal Tree Planting Plan is setting out a planting and replacement programme for the short-, medium- and long - term, that will help the ecosystem functions and services generated by the trees (support, provision, regulation and cultural), and to actively contribute to the process of adapting the city to climate change.
If you have a garden, we have a tree for you: This programme supports organisations and residents in planting trees and expanding the city's green structure in private spaces. These plants are grown in Porto's municipal nursery, with the collaboration of municipal employees, specialists and countless volunteers. Additionally, the FUN Porto Project - Florestas Urbanas Nativas do Porto (Active Urban Forests in Porto) keeps a duly attested production of trees and native bushes for the planting of BioSpots (next to road sections and traffic routes) or for the purpose of tree offering to residents with private yards or gardens. Approximately 13 000 plants have already been planted the context of these initiatives.
Roofs in bloom: The Porto Fifth Façade Project (PQAP) is a partnership between the Municipality and the National Green Roofs Association (ANCV). The project's objective is to ensure green roofs remain part of the city's strategy. Green roofs are natural roofs, with plants, that improve the thermal insulation of buildings, retain water during peak rainfall, store carbon, promote biodiversity and improve the urban landscape.

Although there is evidence of a steady and positive reduction trend over the years, the largest share of Porto's GHG emissions comes from transport and buildings (stationary energy), hence the

actions and partnerships with other municipalities should be focused on these sectors, complemented with a commitment to digitalization, innovation and circularity.

The involvement of the population and its commitment to these topics has been notorious due to Porto's initiatives to interact with residents and encourage dialogue. The city decided to launch the "Porto Towards Carbon Neutrality 2030" Talk Series, following the Porto Climate Pact launch and to also maintain its engagement. This series of sessions had the goal of encouraging thought, reflection, and discussion about the future of the city within different groups, aiming to align the city's future with sustainability, decarbonisation, and achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. The series, conducted over three months, invited specialists in diverse fields of climate action. The top ten subjects were energy, mobility, construction, food systems, community involvement, carbon sequestration, the just transition, data, financing, and nature-based solutions. These events brought together more than 500 participants and 40 speakers. There are also other strategies being developed to further engage citizens in this transition.

The desire expressed by the community to make a commitment to deal with climate changes is clear and is also reflected in the increasing number of subscribers to the Porto Climate Pact. Besides citizens, critical stakeholders from various sectors are needed to bring accelerated change for climate neutrality in Porto, namely:

Local Government: Porto's municipal authorities play a crucial role in formulating and implementing climate policies, setting regulations, overseeing local initiatives and leading by example. The local government can exercise its influence to enforce and implement regulations that promote renewable energy use, energy efficiency, and sustainable urban planning. Also, municipal authorities can invest in and expand public transportation networks, making sustainable mobility options more accessible, as well as implement and enforce green building codes to ensure that new constructions adhere to environmentally friendly standards.
Regional and National Government: Coordination with regional and national authorities ensures alignment with broader climate strategies and access to supportive policies and funding resources. Regional and National Government can advocate for and secure regional or national funding for climate projects and initiatives in Porto and collaborate on regional or national policies that complement Porto's climate goals and enhance the overall impact of climate actions.
Local Businesses: Engaging businesses in sustainable practices, renewable energy adoption, and eco-friendly operations contributes significantly to the city's climate goals. Local businesses can encourage the adoption of green procurement practices, sourcing goods and services from sustainable suppliers. They may collaborate with businesses to implement energy-efficient technologies and practices within their operations and promote waste reduction and recycling programs within its organization and among other local businesses.
Industry Leaders: Collaboration with industry leaders can drive innovation and influence sustainable practices across sectors, crucial to make a real transition with positive synergies with the economic sector. Implementing energy-efficient technologies and practices within industrial operations can significantly reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Industry leaders can invest in research and development of innovative technologies that contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation, such as cleaner production processes and sustainable materials. Establishing partnerships with local universities and research institutions fosters innovation and supports the development of climate-friendly

solutions. Industry leaders can also showcase their commitment to sustainability by transparently communicating their environmental initiatives and achievements, inspiring others to follow suit, and by engaging with local, regional, and national authorities to advocate for supportive policies and regulations that incentivize sustainable practices in industries.

Universities and Research Institutions: Academic institutions provide valuable research, expertise, and innovation to inform and enhance climate initiatives in Porto. They can collaborate on research projects related to climate change impacts, mitigation, and adaptation, develop educational programs that integrate climate-related topics and sustainability into the curriculum, and establish innovation incubators to support students and researchers working on climate solutions.

Technology Providers: Partnerships with technology companies can facilitate the implementation of cutting-edge solutions for energy efficiency and environmental monitoring. The Municipality can collaborate with technology providers to implement smart city solutions, such as IoT-based environmental monitoring and data analytics, to integrate renewable energy solutions into the city's infrastructure and also to implement digital platforms for citizens and businesses to access real-time information on energy consumption and environmental data.

Civil Organizations: Civil organizations, including environmental NGOs and community groups, play a crucial role in advocating for climate action, raising awareness, and mobilizing communities. They can advocate for stronger climate policies and sustainable practices and raise awareness about the impact of climate change. By organizing local events, workshops, and awareness campaigns, civil organizations can engage the community in climate-related discussions and initiatives. Collaborating with civil organizations allows the city to tap into community knowledge, leverage grassroots support, and implement projects with wider public acceptance.

Students and Youth Organizations: Youth and student associations are powerful advocates for climate action, often bringing fresh perspectives, energy, and innovative ideas to the forefront. They can actively involve young people in climate initiatives, fostering a sense of responsibility and commitment to sustainable practices from an early age. Initiating educational programs in collaboration with schools and communities can instil awareness about climate change and inspire young people to adopt eco-friendly habits. Leveraging social media and online platforms, juvenile associations can run campaigns promoting sustainable lifestyles, influencing not only their peers but also reaching a broader audience.

# 4 Process and principles

## Process and principles

The Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CNAP) and its subsequent Climate Neutrality Investment Plan (CNIP) have been carried out following the preparation of a diagnosis of the city's emissions situation, in which the main challenges posed by the different policies, plans, programmes and actions were identified and analysed. The CNAP identifies and proposes the articulation of a series of actions in a planning that integrates financing, governance, citizen participation and exchange within the framework proposed by the platforms of Climate Neutral and Smart Cities. The integrated approach pursued by this CCC and its different dimensions are the key to achieving the sustainable development of the city.

Moreover, the city has worked on the implementation of new **sustainability governance approach** that allows for a more effective and coordinated management of resources and public policies. To build a strong mandate on the city climate transition and following the Porto Climate Pact, a Transition Team composed by 11 entities (from several departments of the Municipality and other public entities) was formally created. These 11 entities are committed to allocating human resources to be part of this new sustainability governance model, that includes in its core competences to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. They are:

Porto Municipality
Porto Ambiente (waste company)
Águas e Energia do Porto (water and energy company)
Domus Social (social housing company)
Ágora (sports, culture and entertainment company)
GO Porto (municipal construction company)
Porto Vivo (urban rehabilitation company)
Porto Digital (digital transformation association)
AdEPorto (energy agency)
STCP (intermunicipal bus company)
LIPOR (intermunicipal waste management association)

Figure 1. Porto Transition Team structure.

The Municipal Assembly also approved a formal mandate for Porto Ambiente to lead and coordinate the municipal efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2023. Furthermore, there is a Carbon Neutrality Direction to align these activities under the political portfolio and leadership of the Vice-Mayor of Porto, the main sponsor of Porto Climate Pact. The City Council not only aims to fulfil its leadership role in this city journey to climate neutrality, but also serves as a catalyst for other entities and stakeholders, as the success of Mission goals depends on collective efforts. This ensures a strong political alignment and commitment to achieve Porto's ambitions towards climate neutrality and represents an important improvement in governance as it involves the work of many areas of Porto Municipality with a holistic and transversal approach.

Aware of the need to include everyone in this journey and of the difficulty of involving individuals, Porto has developed structural processes that aim to involve citizens in decision-making and in the implementation of public policies to achieve a fairer and more sustainable city. Porto has been promoting the creation of various mechanisms for consultation and dialogue with citizens, mainly through the creation of events for public participation. In this way, it seeks to foster citizen co-responsibility in the management of the city, and to promote transparency and accountability.

Accordingly, Porto has been developing several citizen-centred approaches, promoting the integration of different profiles. The following three examples reflect the identification of challenges and the strategies that have been created as opportunities to include everyone:

In a broader approach, it became necessary to create a joint effort, combined with the sense of community that is so characteristic of Porto. This is how the Porto Climate Pact came about, integrating everyone in this joint effort and which, in addition to institutions, already has more than 500 individuals as signatories who are now more aware of the environmental cause and the need for action. The Porto Climate Pact maintains continuous communication with its network of subscribers, primarily using the Porto Climate Pact website as the main contact point and information dissemination medium. This website features a section that is consistently updated with news from the numerous subscribers, aiming to disseminate and publicize results and best practices that can engage the community and create contagious dynamics of knowledge within the broader community.
The Transition Team also felt the need for a more personalized approach. For this reason, the Talk Series was created to bring citizens and experts together to debate ten essential
Porto.

topics for the climate transition. Similarly, training and co-creation sessions are planned in the Municipality's parish councils, promoting a community approach to the issue, the search for solutions based on the reality experienced locally and benefiting from everyone's participation due to the geographical proximity and the positive pressure everyone can exert on their neighbours to raise awareness and increase participation.

Porto goes even further and identifies audiences that are socially and/or economically vulnerable, promoting their involvement and creating opportunities for participation. The ComEC0 project is a clear example of the identification of an opportunity to involve a specific group in the city, the entrance managers of social housing blocks. The aim is for these people, who are already recognized by the community as points of contact between the Municipality and the population and who look after everyone's well-being, to be able to gain knowledge and share it with their peers. A change in behaviour is expected not only from these more than 900 individuals spread throughout the city, but also from their neighbours, involving a local community.

Also, within the framework of this Contract, Porto considers **climate justice** an important factor in its political agenda and will encourage the creation of spaces for citizen participation to promote participatory and sustainable environmental management.

Recognizing its limited sphere of influence, the City Council is committed to involving all stakeholders towards carbon neutrality. **Multi-stakeholder collaboration and community involvement** have been a key elements in the preparation of the Municipal Climate Action Plan, encouraging the active participation of diverse social actors, such as businesses, universities and civil organisations, in the construction of a more fair, sustainable and climate neutral city. Over 200 entities from diverse sectors, including academia, justice, education, NGOs, and hundreds of individual citizens, have already subscribed to the Porto Climate Pact, demonstrating a collective will and joint effort to decarbonize Porto, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance overall quality of life. With the Porto Climate Pact, the city aims to guide this path for impact through co-creation processes and the participation of all signatories and other stakeholders in this transformative journey. The current 228 institutional signatories are already engaged for the work being done and are committed to the city's climate target as reflected in the Climate City Contract. Part of the work currently being developed, contributing to the CCC, is defining each stakeholder's specific contributions as concretely and specifically as possible towards the carbon neutrality goal for 2030.

Thus, this Commitments document include all signatories of the Porto Climate Pact, forming the core reference group for detailing specific commitments. In this first iteration, the signatories of the CCC are a subgroup of the Porto Climate Pact subscribers, and in future iterations, more organizations will sign the CCC, committing more specifically. We expect some current signatories to even raise their commitment levels. This is an iterative process, always with the same goal in mind: achieving carbon neutrality by 2030, engaging the city's active forces and leaving no one behind.

Porto's city management model also prioritizes people, especially vulnerable groups, involving them in the sustainable development journey. Looking at the global reality, it is clear that the most vulnerable populations are typically those who suffer the most from climate change, and in large urban centres this reality persists. For a **fair climate transition** where no one is left behind and equitable access to opportunities are provided, Porto's strategies include increasing literacy and supporting citizens in mitigation but also in adaptation measures. Aligned with this, two concrete examples of measures that aim reduce the impacts of climate change, specially related to adaptation:

The homeless population is the most exposed to extreme weather conditions, phenomena that have been occurring more frequently in the city. With this in mind, Porto has developed a Cold Weather Contingency Plan for Homeless People which guarantees shelter and overnight stays in closed, air-conditioned spaces.

Heavy rainfall events have become increasingly frequent in the city of Porto, leading to more complicated situations. Part of the eastern area of the city, in "Ilha dos Moinhos – Fontainhas", has been particularly affected over the last few years, forcing the evacuation of families due to real danger. The Municipality has found an effective solution to the problem. The families have been relocated, the land has been acquired by the Municipality, and a green space will be built adopting a nature-based solution capable of flooding and absorbing water, which will naturally be directed to the aquifers. This type of city management, becoming more demanding due to extreme weather phenomena, is a very challenging issue in the context of climate change.

These are examples of measures that are also being reflected in the Municipal Climate Action Plan, which is currently being developed alongside with the update of the Municipal Climate Change Adaptation Strategy.

Likewise, the implementation of this Contract seeks to be based on a principle of transparency, whereby the plans, programmes, strategies, initiatives and instruments adopted to achieve climate neutrality and the energy transition towards a low-carbon economy are carried out through open formulas and accessible channels that guarantee the participation of the social and economic agents concerned as well as the general public, through the relevant channels of communication, information and dissemination of the city of Porto.

On the other hand, the process will also follow a series of measures related to monitoring and tracking progress, which will be mainly based on measurable and verifiable climate action planning based on Porto's baseline inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. A clear identification of the main actions and their descriptions within each action sector will be set and carried out, including interim indicators in line with their investment and capital needs, which will serve as a preliminary step to the creation and implementation of additional fundraising and financing measures in addition to the Investment Plan. In other words, all climate neutral action planning in Porto will be based on co-creation processes: mobilising key stakeholders, involving citizens in decisions that affect them and aligning actions to bring about a systemic change that leads to the rapid decarbonisation of the city.

It is worth noting that this is a completely open process, in which regular revisions will have to be made according to the reality and conditions of the continuously evolving city. Recognizing the need for ongoing assessment and improvement, the plan follows a robust review cycle with revisions at least every two years. This iterative approach ensures that the city remains responsive to the latest scientific advancements, technological innovations, and changes in the local and global climate landscape. The ability to demonstrate clear progress and quantify the benefits of climate action can also lead to greater access to monetary funds for climate action from national and international sources and secure more support from key stakeholder groups in the city.

Therefore, a monitoring, evaluation and reporting system for climate action planning is fundamental for the city of Porto to review and analyse the results and real progress of the commitments present in the CCC. The system proposed is based on the methodology published by C40 Cities in the document C40 City Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting Guidance, and allows Porto Municipality to:

Improve accountability and transparency;
Provide relevant information to a wide range of stakeholders and citizens;
Continue to make the case for other possible climate actions;
Assess progress and effectiveness and adapt.

![img-82.jpeg](img-82.jpeg)
Figure 2. Methodology for future CCC iterations.

This methodology ensures that in every 2 years it is possible to measure results and impacts, inform the review and update of actions and guarantee the effective and efficient allocation of resources. Below are described each of the seven steps:

Define Actions: Set the targets, and identify the transformational actions and strategies needed to achieve the climate goals of the CCC, followed by an action selection and prioritisation process to define the final transformational climate actions;
Define governance and structure: Establish a coordination team, roles, responsibilities and organisation for the Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting system and define a climate action reporting strategy linked to data collection and stakeholder mapping;
Define the intervention logic: Develop an intervention logic for all climate actions described in the Action Plan and identify and regularly review critical assumptions;
Define indicators: Select indicators to measure progress on all goals in coordination with municipal departments and national agencies. Agree on processes and selection of inclusive indicators, developing methodologies for them and identifying their respective sources;
Monitor: Complete a data needs assessment and establish quality controls on the data obtained. Develop and regularly update the city's climate action information inventory;
Evaluate: Define purposes, types and timings of evaluations to be done, select realistic research questions according to evaluation purpose and check if evaluation findings can be implemented;
Report: Draft reporting plan, including resources, audiences, timings and report formats.

To conclude, for a successful climate transition in Porto, it is therefore not a matter of just "working through" the measures, but of establishing processes and structures that allow for flexible action and reaction. The learnings from monitoring the city's progress towards climate neutrality will be processed and shared within the Municipality and all stakeholders, to build a common understanding of how the Climate City Contract can be improved in future iterations. In this regard, close collaboration with the European Commission through NetZeroCities will also be of vital importance in this learning journey.

The analysis of the city's progress will allow Porto to confirm the city's strategy or, if necessary, to correct the course of action in a positive, iterative process. This process will end when a new "normal" is reached, i.e., when the city's vision for 2030 is achieved, a new carbon-neutral "Invicta" by 2030.

![img-83.jpeg](img-83.jpeg)

Porto 2030 is a city that is moving towards energy self-sufficiency, where public and private buildings are mostly renovated and use more locally generated renewable energy (photovoltaic and solar thermal). Residences and businesses will come together to produce surplus energy resources, promoting sharing and storage, and creating positive energy districts. Equipment and lighting are fully efficient, thanks to a continuous process of incentives for their replacement and investment in new green technology.

![img-84.jpeg](img-84.jpeg)

The use of public, shared and zero-emission transport will be the "new normal", anchored in a mobility system powered by electricity and renewable gases, with a robust charging network. The citizen of Porto 2030 will be an active user of soft modes of transport and will have a strengthened and interconnected intermodal offer of metro, metrobus and electric buses, which will tend to be free. To this end, the city will continue to simplify fares and extend free transport to more groups of citizens, ensuring quality of service and contributing to the attractiveness of public transport.

![img-85.jpeg](img-85.jpeg)

In Porto, circular city 2030, water is supplied without energy consumption and the reuse of treated wastewater is promoted. Solid waste will be reused through a comprehensive and effective process of selective separation, recovery of organic matter and, at the end of the line, energy recovery. The food system will be in a process of decarbonization, facilitated by shorter distribution chains in which local producers will play a growing role.

![img-86.jpeg](img-86.jpeg)

In the field of urban logistics, a strategic plan capable of regulating and electrifying it will be crucial to the decongestion of Porto. Porto 2030 will have the most competitive companies due to reduced energy costs, whose investments will pay off. Climate change and decarbonization are opportunities for businesses, creating new green jobs, economic dynamism and social justice.

![img-87.jpeg](img-87.jpeg)

Porto in 2030 will be anchored on a strong component of digitization and dematerialization of services, aligning policy-based decisions on data shared by different organizations, loaded on an urban platform that promotes better management and consequent significant energy savings (e.g., access to real-time data on energy consumption, due to increasing sensing and smart metering as key to effective behaviour change). Porto will continue to benefit from the strong relationship and collaboration with the business ecosystem, research and associative centres in the implementation of decarbonization actions, and at the same time will play an active role in sharing its experiences and good practices in European networks.

# PORTO CLIMATE PACT

PACTO DO PORTO PARA O CLIMA

![img-89.jpeg](img-89.jpeg)

Towards a carbon neutral, resilient, competitive, fair, and inclusive city.

Porto Climate Pact

# Acknowledging that:

→ The current and projected climate changes in the short- and medium-term demand high public and private investments in adaptation measures for the future, both for territories and infrastructures as well as economic activities.

→ The stability of the global climate system remains at risk because of global warming caused by the continued emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) from human activities.

→ To avoid a breakdown of the planetary climate system, with unpredictable consequences for ecosystems and social and economic activities, there is an urgent need for a rapid relief of GHGs in the global atmosphere.

→ We face a global challenge that demands disruptive and visionary, transformative and ambitious actions, that drastically decrease GHG emissions, ensuring the path towards carbon neutrality in societies.

→ Carbon neutrality can only be successfully addressed through cross-cutting and multi-level interventions, from the personal, organisational, local, regional, national to global levels, highlighting the current socio-environmental responsibility of many organisations and the growing environmental awareness of the citizens.

→ The European Union has taken the lead in this issue, with Member States setting a target of 55% decarbonisation by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050.

→ At a national level, the Climate Framework Law (Lei de Bases do Clima), approved by the Parliament in November 2021, establishes a reduction of emissions of at least 55% by 2030, 65% to 75% by 2040 and at least 90% by 2050 (with possible anticipation to 2045).

→ As central spaces for human activity, cities are key levers to ensure the achievement of decarbonisation goals, so local authorities, as the level of governance closer to citizens, are the main drivers of articulation of local actors for decarbonisation.

→ The city of Porto has maintained, since 2008, a detailed monitoring of GHG emissions in the city and their respective origin, and has followed and exceeded the national and European decarbonisation goals, having established the commitment to reduce GHG by 60% by 2030.

→ The estimated reduction of GHG in the city of Porto has reached 52,2% in 2020 (compared to the 2004 base year), partly because national measures to decarbonise electricity production, which puts the city close to reaching the target set for 2030.

→ The role of the Municipality of Porto in the decarbonisation of the city has been systematic but limited, as municipal buildings/ assets are only responsible for 6% of total GHG emissions.

→ The majority of GHG emissions in the city come from the buildings, residential and services sector (approximately 50%) and transport (approximately 40%), and these are the areas that will require the most intense decarbonisation effort.

Porto Climate Pact

→ Carbon neutrality is an opportunity for a fair and equitable transition, while mitigating energetic poverty and universal access to clean and sustainable transport systems.
→ Porto was selected by the European Commission to participate in the EU Mission Climate Neutral and Smart Cities until 2030, which along with one hundred other cities will lead the energy transition and climate action in Europe.

## And trusting that:

→ The National Roadmap for Carbon Neutrality (Roteiro Nacional Para a Neutralidade Carbónica) 2050 includes a set of measures to be implemented that allow the municipality of Porto, given its specificity, to achieve carbon neutrality in the next decade.
→ Carbon neutrality, while posing a major challenge to the traditional status quo and potentially requiring high investment, brings countless benefits – increased security and resilience, new economic opportunities, and new jobs – contributing to more prosperous, fairer societies that live within the physical limits of the planet.
→ Carbon neutrality in Porto can only be achieved with specific actions carried out by all parties involved regardless of their dimension, previous action towards environmental sustainability or type of legal entity: all organisations and citizens have a role to play.
→ A common vision and goal for decarbonisation can help everyone move in the same direction towards a common purpose.

## We share the vision of Porto as:

→ A city that wants to anticipate carbon neutrality by 2030, taking national leadership in this area, through a collective and widely participated effort, with the involvement of citizens and organizations, as well as the National Government and the European Commission, supported by initiatives that make this ambition possible.
→ A more resilient city that relies on efficient energy use, renewable energy production and energy storage to cope with unexpected situations.
→ A city where circularity and decarbonisation processes play an important role in the economic activity and job creation.
→ A fair city, where decarbonisation contributes to supporting the people and entities most affected by this energy transition, reducing energy poverty.
→ A healthier city, with high air quality that enhances citizens' health and quality of life.
→ An inclusive city, where all organisations and citizens are an active part of the decarbonisation process.

We also note the opportunity that this pact provides for:

→ Demonstrate our leadership in terms of initiatives to promote the decarbonisation of our activity, contributing to local and national targets.
→ Reinforce our commitment to action in favor of the economic and social development of the city.
→ Qualitatively and quantitatively assess the results of the proposed decarbonisation measures.
→ Cooperating regularly with a network of ambitious players, with common goals, sharing experiences and establishing partnerships to take better advantage of opportunities, namely by promoting the co-creation of innovative solutions and business models.
→ Gain local, national and international recognition in the area of sustainability and climate action, especially by reducing GHG emissions.

By signing this Pact we commit to using all our means to:

→ Establish and share targets and specific measures, already developed or to be developed, tending to a reduction of GHG emission aiming at carbon neutrality.
→ Involve our network of players in the process of reducing GHG emissions in Porto.
→ Cooperate with local and national government to set an enabling environment for decarbonisation.
→ Monitor and report the progress and impact of implemented actions in reducing GHG emissions.
→ Announce the progress achieved in meeting the targets and actions developed, contributing to increased public awareness.
