# Summary

## Textual element

Bordeaux Métropole is taking the opportunity of the Climate City Contract initiative to challenge its greenhouse gas reduction scenarios using the various tools proposed by Mission '100 Villes'. Our aim is to learn as much as possible from experience, our current policies and actions. The action plan component of the CCC will therefore be based on a selection of actions from our Metropolitan Climate Plan, adopted in September 2022 in accordance with French law, but integrated to the "Climate city contract" with raised ambitions.

The iterative work of the "Climate city contract" will enable us to seek to accelerate as far as possible the actions already launched or planned by Bordeaux Métropole, and also to imagine with local stakeholders other levers for decarbonization. In fact, the drafting of this first version of our Climate city contract is an opportunity to identify the regulatory and political obstacles and the investments needed to successfully implement our policy in favor of the climate and decarbonization of our territory.

Bordeaux Métropole took the opportunity offered by Mission 100 Villes to challenge the estimated reduction in greenhouse gases (scope 1 and 2) in its current policy, by seeking to remove the obstacles and barriers identified in collaboration with local stakeholders. Thanks to this collective effort involving all levels of governance, Bordeaux Métropole aims to accelerate decarbonization as much as possible and hopes to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

This document follows on from the commitment plan. It reports on the GHG Emissions Inventory (2019) in GPC (scope 1,2,3), but only scope 1 and 2 count towards the trajectory towards climate neutrality. This document shows the GHG emissions gaps between the current plans and strategies, as well as the systemic obstacles, opportunities and levers for moving towards climate neutrality towards 2030. The impact pathways are presented, along with a portfolio of actions and monitoring indicators. Finally, the governance and cross-cutting methods used with the various stakeholders in the region are also explained.

It should be noted that the carbon assessment standard required by Climate City Contract, namely the GHG protocol (or Greenhouse Gas Protocol), differs somewhat from the method and breakdown used in the 'Bilan des émissions de gaz à effet de serre du territoire métropolitain'. Work has been carried out to bring the two into line. In addition, no exclusions have been made in the scope of the greenhouse gas inventory for the reference year (2019). The European Emissions Trading System (ETS) has been included in the scope of the GHG inventory. Given that our territory is taking ambitious action to support economic and industrial players in decarbonizing their activities, we felt that it made sense to keep the GHG emissions generated by these players within scope of the GHG inventory.

It is important to stress out that this strategy towards 2030 climate neutrality has been established building up as much as possible on the preexisting PCAET strategy features, to facilitate its understanding and appropriation by Bordeaux Métropole stakeholders. Including the ETS and choosing 2019 as the reference year is consistent with this strategy.

In addition, all the greenhouse gases included in the infokit are used in the calculations, which are as follows:
Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)
Methane (CH₄)
Nitrous Oxide (N₂O)
F-gases (hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons)
Sulphur hexafluoride (SF₆) and
Nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃).

The local energy agency of Gironde carries out an annual assessment of GHG emissions on scopes 1 and 2 of Bordeaux Métropole. The data is entered on the MyCovenant platform. In addition, the Métropole regularly carries out a complete territorial GHG emissions report, integrating scope 3. However, the treatment of associated items (food, purchasing and construction) is based on average values and ratios. Uncertainty is currently very high, which makes it difficult to implement and quantify actions. Initially, the community wishes to refine its collection and processing method for these items before including it in the scope of its CCC. The latest available inventory relates to data for the year 2021. However, the CCC is based on a reference year of 2019 to be consistent with the metropolitan current Climate action Plan.

For the CCC, the operational objectives set as part of the Climate Plan were taken up and translated into the impact pathways. Indeed, the inventory of emissions produced by the ALEC (Agence Locale de l'Energie et du Climat) is sufficiently precise and disaggregated to highlight the most impactful sectors and sub-sectors, on which priority action must be taken. For example, less in-depth work has been carried out in the agricultural and waste treatment sectors because these are areas with little impact compared to transport or energy consumption in buildings.

The potentiality of developing carbon sink inside Bordeaux Métropole were estimated for its current Climate action plan. It includes forestry and agriculture, land use, wooden product consumption and urban trees. This calculation shows that only a small part of the emissions can be compensated by local actions.

Buildings are the main consumers of energy (65%). Residential buildings first, then office and commercial buildings and finally industries. Gas and electricity are the two energies most consumed by buildings. Then, we find the transport sector (35% of energy consumed). This sector consumes almost exclusively petroleum products for road transport.

Road transport is the main producer of greenhouse gases (43%). It is directly linked to the energy consumed: diesel and gasoline, whose emission factor is very high. The buildings sector comes next: industries first (21% of Bordeaux Métropole emissions), then residential buildings (17%) and 14% for tertiary buildings (office and commercial buildings). The emission of industrial sector increases because of direct emissions caused by the processes, in pink. Those emissions are difficult to reduce because that implies a deeper update of productions systems. The annual carbon sinks cover only 1,2% of the emissions.

# Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

# A-2.1: Description &amp; assessment of policies

# National low-carbon strategies and laws

The energy transition law for green growth (LTECV, 2015) requires France to draw up a roadmap to fight global warming. The French climate plan (2017) strengthened targets of the energy transition law for green growth, to be compatible with the Paris agreement (carbon neutrality in 2050). The national low-carbon strategy (SNBC, 2015 - SNBC 2, 2020) is the French roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and reducing the carbon footprint of French consumption. It sets out guidelines for implementing the transition to a low-carbon, circular and sustainable economy. The SNBC defines a trajectory in all sectors of activity for reducing greenhouse gas emissions until 2050 and sets short- and medium-term targets (carbon budgets). It has two ambitions: to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and to reduce the carbon footprint of French people. The national low-carbon strategy must be taken into account by local decision-makers at every scale, particularly when drawing up local climate plans because it is a legal obligation for local authorities. This national strategy also is the reference base to build the multi-annual energy plan (PPE, 2016 - PPE 2, 2020).
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

In addition to the low-carbon strategy, a national climate change adaptation plan (PNACC) defines concrete actions to adapt French territories to climate change.

## Regional low carbon strategies

The regional scheme for planning and sustainable development of territories (SRADDET) is the main document for French regions concerning ecological transition. The SRADDET is elaborated and voted by the regional council but the regional prefect (representative of the State in each region) must approve the document. It defines mid-term and long-term targets in many areas, including air quality, the fight against climate change, energy management and recovery, the development of renewable and recovered energy sources, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity. The SRADDET must follow the national low-carbon strategy.

![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)

## Local existing plans and policies

In September 2022, Bordeaux Métropole adopted a new Territorial Climate Air and Energy Plan (PCAET), it aims at achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This planning document is in line with French regulatory expectations under the National Low Carbon Strategy (SNBC) and the Regional Plan for Development, Sustainability and Territorial Equality (SRADDET).

The PCAET contains detailed energy planning measures. It also connects with most other metropolitan plans and strategies, which contribute to achieving its climate neutrality targets:

Urban master plan
Transportation master plan, as well as dedicated plans for urban logistics roadmap, cycling, and walking Plan
Biodiver'City Plan
Housing energy retrofit Roadmap
Economic development plan
Sustainable tourism roadmap
Strategic waste plan
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Social and solidarity economy roadmap
Master plan for metropolitan rivers and infrastructure
Aquatic environment management and flood prevention strategy
Territorial Food Project
Responsible digital strategy
SPAZER

The portfolio of actions in section B-2 includes several actions from the PCAET and other strategies listed above. However, the work of the Impact Pathways has enabled other levers of change to be considered in relation to existing actions or those already planned before the CCC.

# Climate targets and emissions gaps

Bordeaux Métropole's current climate-action plan (PCAET 2023) aims to reduce Bordeaux Métropole's carbon footprint (scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions) by 79% between 2019 and 2050. Its target scenario also halves total energy consumption and doubles the production of renewable and recovered energy by 2050. These targets were produced using detailed cross-sector modelling.

This PCAET scenario provides the basis for the "business as planned" (BAP) scenario for the CCC. Using unchanged hypotheses, results were modelled in terms of direct territorial emissions (scopes 1 and 2). This BAP scenario puts Bordeaux Métropole on a trajectory to reduce its territorial GHG emissions by 45% by 2030—already an ambitious target in the city's context of economic and demographic growth. This new modeling exercise produced detailed emissions gaps by sector and key actions, summarized above.

New pathways targeting climate neutrality by 2030 were modelled and debated with city officials, informing the climate neutrality scenario and pathways presented below (B-1).

Scenario modelling revealed several key conclusions that informed pathway design:

Most of the local actions required to achieve net zero by 2030 already appear in the current climate-action plan. The key challenge will be scaling them up rapidly enough to hit targets initially planned for the 2035-2050 horizon within the next decade.
A similar acceleration of national action is indispensable to achieve climate neutrality locally. All credible pathways to net zero in Bordeaux include decarbonizing the national electricity and gas networks at a rhythm that brings 2040 targets closer to 2030. National policy and markets must also quickly provide the conditions for accelerating electric vehicle adoption for transportation uses that cannot be covered by transit and active modes. The upcoming revision of France's national low-carbon strategy (SNBC) and related legislation will provide a key opportunity to push this ambitious agenda.
The shortened timeline for full decarbonization highlights certain tensions between reducing Bordeaux Métropole's territorial emissions (scopes 1 and 2) and reducing its overall carbon and material footprint (imported emissions). The PCAET scenario places a particular emphasis on energy and material efficiency measures that, over time, can reduce the volumes of new vehicles, building retrofits and other equipment required to reduce local emissions. While energy and material efficiency remain at the forefront of our CCC pathways, the accelerated timeframe does substantially increase the role of technological interventions in achieving climate targets.
Such an unprecedented acceleration of climate action raises questions not only about the technical feasibility, but also the equity and acceptability of several key policy measures.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The deployment of a low-emissions driving zone, of building-retrofit targets that go beyond already ambitious national norms, and of large-scale biomethane facilities are all examples of actions whose calendars must be accelerated without sacrificing the time inherently necessary for consensus-building and adapting results to local conditions.

In sum, while Bordeaux Métropole has already initiated most actions required to decarbonize, closing the emissions gap will require at once an unprecedented scaling up of local measures and changes, a similarly ambitious national acceleration, and continuous monitoring and dialogue to ensure that deep decarbonization policies also provide for an environmentally responsible and socially just transition.

The Climate action plan of Bordeaux Métropole should allow to reduce by 45% the greenhouse gas emissions, which is already ambitious.

We have used the economic model proposed by NetZero city to determine the greenhouse gas reduction potential by 2030. This enabled us to model a -64% reduction in emissions between the BAU (Business as usual) scenario and 2030. If we exclude the other sector (including IPPU and AFOLU) (see table above) we arrive at a reduction of -68% by 2030. As mentioned above, the CCC action plan does not allow to reach the -80% objective. The reminding gap is due to the carbon intensity of French electricity and gas which should decrease faster than the objectives of the current national strategy (SNBC – National low carbon strategy). It is important to stress out that this strategy towards 2030 climate neutrality has been established building up as much as possible on the preexisting PCAET strategy features, to facilitate its understanding and appropriation by Bordeaux Métropole stakeholders. As a result, Bordeaux Métropole chose 2019 as a baseline and included the heavier industry and the ETS in the strategy. These choices can be regarded as a testimony of Bordeaux Métropole's level of ambition towards neutrality.

Regarding baseline, Bordeaux Métropole considers that choosing 2019 is quite ambitious, as it is the last available greenhouse gas inventory that was not affected by the drop-in activity due to the 2020-2021 pandemic. As mentioned in the Commitment Plan, Bordeaux Métropole's territorial emissions had already fallen by 11% between 2010 and 2019. Choosing an earlier baseline would have gotten us much closer to the 80% emission reduction target.

# 1.2 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

# A-3.1: Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

The Bordeaux metropolitan area is a dynamic, growing agglomeration, with a dense transit-oriented center. Bordeaux Métropole has recently developed a full range of pro-climate strategies, programs, partnerships, and outreach initiatives for businesses and residents, outlined in its recently revised climate-action plan (PCAET, 2023).

As such, Bordeaux faces similar challenges as many other large, environmentally progressive European cities:

Reconciling demographic growth and decarbonization.
Operating an unprecedented acceleration of public and private initiatives across all emissions domains to hit targets initially planned for 2040-2050 by 2030.
Effectively reducing emissions in domains that have traditionally been hard to reach by city policy—such as medium-distance car traffic that operates beyond public transit networks, or private freight and industrial processes.
Coordinating policy across multiple administrative scales.
Initiating rapid changes to the built environment, lifestyles and business models without provoking counterproductive resistance or placing an unfair burden on poorer households and businesses.

Bordeaux Métropole's relatively comprehensive set of pro-climate policies provide much of the local toolbox for the acceleration needed to achieve climate neutrality in the next decade. Recent European and national policies, responding to the European "Fit for 55" climate targets, have created new regulatory, financial, and operational tools in several key sectors. In the past few years, businesses and residents have demonstrated their ability to rapidly shift away from long held-practices towards new ones—as in the case of reduced building energy consumption and widescale adoption of telework and teleservices.

|   | Systemic barriers | Opportunities  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Global | - Strong demographic and economic growth. Bordeaux is an attractive metropolitan area, with population growth estimated at 1.34%/year through 2030. In addition to having to decarbonize the existing urban system, Bordeaux will also have to respond to additional needs in terms of housing, mobility, services, etc. | - Growth and denser land use also provide opportunities for key climate-friendly policies, such as mixed-use and transit-oriented development (TOD), the rehabilitation of vacant housing and offices, market trends favoring collective housing and smaller average dwelling units, and the redevelopment of brownfield sites.  |
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

|   | - Limited land availability.
Largely developed, Bordeaux has few remaining land opportunities and has to drastically reduce new land consumption by 2030, in line with recent national policy (zéro artificialisation nette). climate-friendly infrastructures, industries and services are in land-use competition with other urban priorities (housing, natural spaces, etc.). | - The new metro climate-action plan (PCAET) has helped consolidate a cross-sector approach to environmental transition, both in terms of planning and administration. The CCC will build on this framework to consolidate a systemic approach to urban transitions.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | - The multiplicity of ecological transition plans and resulting silos between plans and services (mobility, housing, energy, etc.). | - Recent European and national initiatives have provided strengthened climate commitments and support for local action. France's new environmental planning package, “France Nation Verte,” is built around clear 2030 carbon targets. This trend will continue, with the upcoming revision of the national low-carbon strategy (SNBC) and related legislation to meet “Fit by 55” targets. As a vanguard of French climate action, Bordeaux will continue to push for climate-friendly legislation and seize on new opportunities afforded by national and European programs.  |
|   | - Key national and European policies must be accelerated, compared to current government targets, especially in the realms of national energy grids, building energy regulations and support for retrofits, heavy industry, and long-range transportation (see below). | - The new metro climate-action plan (PCAET) has clarified different stakeholders’ responsibility for implementing planned measures. Citizen engagement has also been strengthened, with the creation of a "citizen climate council" and crowdfunding schemes that allow citizens to contribute to the implementation of climate positive projects (e.g. photovoltaic production unit, urban farms, etc.).  |
|   | - Uneven stakeholder engagement. Bordeaux Métropole only controls a minority of the levers necessary for local decarbonization. The Bordeaux PCAET contains numerous key measures whose implementation depends on businesses and other scales of public administrations (municipalities, Department, Region), in cooperation with civil organizations and citizens. | - Local policy also responds to real demand for urgent climate action and a greener urban model. Decarbonization will provide tangible co-benefits for many sectors of society: reduction of air pollution, energy poverty, and of dependence on fossil fuels, as well as more active lifestyles and lower energy bills.  |
|   | - Renewed questions about the social acceptability and equity of a rapid transition to a low-carbon urban model. Key measures will involve fundamental shifts in current |   |
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

|   | lifestyles and business models, with a risk of local reluctance and even opposition. | Maximizing and promoting these co-benefits will make it easier to engage stakeholders and citizens.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | - The financial cost of rapidly scaling up climate action. Very significant public and private investments need to be front-loaded to accelerate key policies, such as the massification of building retrofitting, the decarbonization of industrial processes, the deployment of new transit infrastructure and services, etc. Climate investments will generate financial savings and other cobenefits for administrations, businesses, and households—in the end generating net savings for Bordeaux—albeit probably over a longer timeframe. | - European, national and regional programs all provide public financial support that can be mobilized for locally beneficial programs—such as aid for housing retrofitting, low-emissions vehicles, public transit and district heating.  |
|   | - A rapid evolution of jobs, skills and training needs. Scaling up climate policy will create unprecedented demand for qualified personnel in key sectors, some of which are already confronted with a penury of skilled workforce. This is particularly true for the buildings sector and for workers specialized in carbon-free industrial processes. | - Strong job creation and investments are among the key tangible benefits of accelerated climate action for Bordeaux area residents and businesses. The 2020s will be a key decade for demonstrating that a low-carbon transition can be a net contributor to city prosperity and well-being.  |
|   | - Inertia in key technological and urban systems. Certain technologies, such as decarbonized industrial processes, are either not yet mature or have incompressible roll-out timeframes incompatible with a 2030 net zero target. Many planned changes to land use and the built environment are also medium-term levers, whose impact may be observed after 2030. | - Recent crises—especially Covid-19 and energy cost inflation—have demonstrated the capacity of local stakeholders to quickly adopt new practices and sustain them over time (for instance, the widespread adoption of teleworking, energy sufficiency in building heating practices, etc.).  |
|   |  | - Bordeaux Métropole has invested heavily in research and innovation partnerships. As part of the POPSU transitions program, several research projects have started. Among these, work on developing more reliable methods for calculating local GHG inventories will begin in collaboration with Bordeaux Sciences Economiques (BSE) and A-Urba. Bordeaux Métropole has established a partnership with the Transitions Institute of the University of Bordeaux, with the goal of disseminating knowledge on  |

|   |  | ecological transition, with a particular emphasis on behavioral sciences.
Internationally, Bordeaux Métropole plans to strengthen its support for the development of solidarity and decentralized cooperation projects, especially with local areas vulnerable to climate change.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Energy System | - It will be difficult to cover all the metropolitan area’s energy needs with locally produced renewable energies. The deployment of solar rooftop and building heat pumps face difficulties in terms of local heritage-site protections in central Bordeaux. Larger PV installations have run into a lack of available land. And despite technically favorable conditions, wind units have encountered strong local resistance. Even with the most ambitious energy savings and renewables programs, Bordeaux will need to import some renewables from regional sources.
Bordeaux’s district heat network—which has traditionally been a key public lever for injecting renewables into the local energy mix—has an already ambitious development program, which cannot be amplified or accelerated on a 2030 timeframe. | - Bordeaux Métropole benefits from good sunshine conditions conducive to the development of solar-based energy production.
Local household demand for PV installations is increasing sharply.
Discussions are accelerating for the deployment of large-scale PV on parking lots and commercial roofs.
Bordeaux Métropole is studying the feasibility of even more ambitious PV projects such as the deployment of solar panels on key road transport routes (metropolitan ring road, national highways).
Bordeaux Métropole is launching the “Bordeaux Solar City” Project, which aims to forge new partnerships with energy companies and investors to support renewables development on city property and partner sites.
France’s new national program of "renewable energy acceleration zones," created in 2023, will help streamline renewable energy (RE) projects. The program will identify areas that municipalities deem preferential for new RE installations—signaling local support for these installations.
Bordeaux Métropole is increasingly supporting the development of renewable energies in the areas surrounding the metropole, through direct-purchasing mechanisms by energy consumers and the recently created metropolitan carbon  |

|   |  | cooperative. These initiatives foster a new form of cooperation between Bordeaux and its hinterland, while providing metropolitan businesses and residents concrete opportunities to support climate action.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Mobility and transport | **Passenger traffic:**
Medium-range commuting, which straddle the metro area’s administrative boundaries, count for a major portion of car-related GHG emissions. Bordeaux Métropole only has part of the levers in hand for addressing this traffic, for which traditional transit solutions only solve partially the issue.
Bordeaux Métropole already has a well-developed transit system, with nearly 80 km of tramway lines complemented by numerous bus routes. Planned tram extensions and new service offers will add capacity over the next decade, but then might reach full capacity—even a tipping point where new lines could prove counterproductive—without achieving the modal share targeted in the climate-action plan. Any new extensions would take up to a decade to come to fruition.
Walking and biking are widely practiced, but promoting further active mobility remains an uphill battle. Current walking rates are already high. The metro area’s current and planned bike network includes 1,000 km of bike-friendly roads. Yet not all residents take advantage of the new bike infrastructures for short-range commuting or short trips. Further development of walking and biking is limited by distance and influenced by a variety of | - More restrictive land use (zéro artificialisation nette) will encourage transit-oriented development and shorter commuting.
As part of its 2020-2030 mobility plan, the metro transit network will be further enhanced by regular inter-urban links comprising express buses and regional express trains (RER métropolitain). These extensions will provide a new impetus to ridership and help structure an intermodal transportation offer for medium-range travel.
Active modes are an increasingly attractive alternative to car use for many residents and even businesses. The future bike network (ReVE) will provide complete, high-capacity coverage for the metro area. New urban design and road retrofits are making urban space more amenable to active modes, even outside the metropolitan center.
More and more private individuals and businesses are adopting electric vehicles. There has been a sharp increase in demand for the installation of recharging points in the region, and nationwide support for leasing electric vehicles has met with considerable success.  |
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

|   | factors (quality of urban space, vehicle speeds, etc.). And the ageing of the metro population could make the adoption of active modes even more complex.

There is strong attachment to individual car ownership, some local resistance to actions limiting car use and insufficient adoption of low-emissions vehicles. Adoption of electric vehicles is closely linked to household purchasing power. The models offered by manufacturers tend to be top-of-the-range, and it is difficult for low-income households to afford electric vehicles.

Freight and urban logistics:
City authorities’ role in decarbonizing urban logistics is particularly complex, as the sector is mainly in the hands of private operators over which the territory has little control. The rapid development of e-commerce has added to the urgency of finding new solutions for “last mile” urban deliveries. | - Recent initiatives seeking to limit the place of car traffic (parking and speed limitations, etc.) have demonstrated tangible cobenefits in terms of more attractive public space.

National mandate for the implementation of low-emissions driving zones in most French agglomerations has created a common framework, mandate to act and tools for accompanying new measures limiting the most polluting car traffic.

Bordeaux Métropole recently launched a new sustainable logistics roadmap, associating key stakeholders from different freight sectors. This initiative will provide the much-needed governance and policy framework for provoking positive movement on the subject.

The low-emissions driving zone will provide an impetus for adoption of decarbonized vehicles, especially for urban deliveries.  |

|  Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions | During heatwaves, 42% of the population of Bordeaux population is considered highly vulnerable.

The public resources currently available to help households and businesses renovate their buildings are insufficient to cope with a sharp increase in demand for renovation.

The lack of a skilled building working force is particularly crucial. The number of craftsmen in the region is not sufficient to meet renovation needs, and the creation of a suitable sector is realistic in the long term.

Major parts of the metro area are covered by a heritage protection plan (PSMV), where heritage protection rules often limit retrofitting and heat pumps.

Bordeaux will grapple with increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves. Widespread adoption of individual air conditioning is a significant risk for hitting 2030 energy-reduction targets. | powerful incentive for owners to renovate their properties. Bordeaux’s new climate-action plan aims to hit mandated targets sooner than national deadlines.

The energy-saving efforts made by households and businesses during the energy crisis have demonstrated their ability to rapidly reduce its energy consumption.

Bordeaux Metropole is increasingly adopting a global approach to building issues, favoring quality renovation over new construction, while integrating the issues of adapting to climate change (summer and winter comfort) and combating fuel poverty.  |

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

Several key principles guided pathway design :
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

6

Build on existing climate strategies and action plans, focus on closing the 2030 emissions gap, anticipate longer term targets. Bordeaux Métropole's 2023 climate-action plan contains a pathway for achieving climate neutrality by 2050. Our CCC pathway builds on this existing scenario, but with much earlier dates for achieving targets (exploratory scenario). New pathway design focused on actions needed to achieve an unprecedented effort on a much shorter timeframe, whether in terms of scaling up technical interventions such as retrofitting building; accompanying major shifts in residents' and businesses' behavior and choices; or engaging partners and consolidating effective governance and partnerships. While focusing on 2030 targets and available technologies, our CCC pathways address synergies with measures aimed at achieving Bordeaux Métropole's longer-term outcomes—especially in terms of land-use levers and fostering future technological innovations.

Adopt a systems approach, activating a maximum number of available levers. Bordeaux Métropole has adopted ambitious climate targets and action plans for most emissions domains. Pathway design thus put particular emphasis on connecting the dots to achieve systemic change. For each emissions domain, our pathways activate multiple systemic levers identified in the NZC Theory of Change. They also adopt a "reduce-improve-switch-generate" approach to energy systems and emissions reductions, aligned with Bordeaux Métropole's choice to prioritize the reduction of energy and material needs as the guiding principle for local climate action. Since the Bordeaux urban system expands well beyond metropolitan administrative boundaries, pathways include levers requiring cooperation with neighboring cities and regional authorities—particularly for generating renewable energy and addressing medium-distance car traffic. Among the individual projects presented in module B.2, some projects are tagged as "priority projects". It does not mean that these projects are more important than others in terms of 2030 outcomes, but only that they require more massive or urgent investment or action from Bordeaux Métropole's team to make sure to achieve our ambitious carbon reduction targets.

Capitalize on new climate opportunities. Work on the current state of action (part A above) underscored just how quickly the context for French climate action is evolving, creating exciting new opportunities for accelerating local decarbonization. Recently announced demonstrator projects for industrial decarbonization and metropolitan-scale rapid transit ("RER métropolitain"), new national initiatives on building retrofits and low-emissions driving zones, and widespread adoption of teleworking are among the levers whose potential for meaningful emissions cuts by 2030 has grown dramatically in just a few years. Our pathways emphasize the importance of capitalizing on these new opportunities to ensure they translate into rapid and durable climate-friendly trends.

Aim for meaningful, observables outcomes. Emphasis has been placed on identifying intermediary outcomes that will provide Bordeaux Métropole with regular feedback on action implementation, direct results, and systemic impacts for each emissions domain. This mix of quantitative and qualitative targets will help Bordeaux navigate the "messy middle" of an accelerated transition to climate neutrality, while also communicating with stakeholders and citizens about the tangible changes they should see resulting from collective climate action.

|   |  Description | The full production costs of the various renewable energy sources are already competitive with those of historical sources, and they are profitable both when fed into the grid and when distributed and self-consumed in tertiary or residential buildings.
The development assumptions only consider projects that are economically balanced.
Given the urban context of the Metropolis, and in particular the large areas of car parks and, above all, roofs that have been artificialized, photovoltaic energy is the main resource to produce renewable electricity (with an overall production target of almost 265 GWh by 2028). In the longer term, the diversification of renewable sources will have to be considered (biomass cogeneration, hydroelectricity, wind turbines) to have a complementary, secure and continuous production over time. Bordeaux Métropole wants to promote photovoltaic solarisation with stakeholders of the territory and has launched a new project “Bordeaux Solar City Project” (60,000 m² by 2026).  |

|   |  Action description | There is no definition of renewable energy imports from a physical point of view. A "legal and financial" approach to defining the territorial import of renewable energies is proposed, considering the ownership of production units, the legal and financial mechanisms for their construction, and the purchasing circuits for their production.
In France, 27% and 0.5% of the national electricity and gas mix are of renewable origin, and are therefore imported by the metropolitan territory, independently of any voluntary local action.
In addition, 11% and 1.4% of residential electricity and gas consumers respectively have already subscribed to a "100% green" offer (CRE, 2020, France-wide data), and are thus voluntarily importing energy. The goal is for all consumers in the metropolitan area (residents, businesses, etc.) subscribe to energy supply offers from the most local renewable sources possible (metropolis, department, region).  |

|   |  Action description | Bordeaux Métropole's 2020-2030 mobility plan sets out a series of actions aimed at developing this type of public transport (to gain 5 points in modal share by 2030). An analysis of the travel situation reveals that 22% of road journeys come from outside the city and account for 58% of the kilometres travelled: these journeys are therefore a particular focus of the plan's actions. A network of express bus lines is under study. The first Bordeaux-Créon line, due to open in 2019, is already exceeding forecasts for the number of passengers per day. Other lines have been studied in 2022: Bordeaux / Blaye, Bordeaux / Médoc and the south-western belt of the Metropole, then in 2023: Bordeaux Bassin Nord and Bordeaux / Belin Beliet. Bordeaux Métropole also wants to consolidate its rail services by developing the metropolitan RER.  |

|   |  Action description | Two initial Bordeaux-wide cycle plans have doubled the length of the cycle network from 750 km to 1,500 km between 2010 and 2021. A third cycling plan was therefore adopted on 10 November 2021. Its aim is to increase the modal share of cycling to 18% by 2030, compared with 8% in 2017. This new cycling plan aims to improve the quality of cycling facilities to make them safer, and also to improve their continuity and signposting in order to further develop active modes of transport. It comprises 16 actions organised into 4 areas.

The modal share of walking currently represents 29% of journeys made in the metropolis, and offers significant potential for development over short distances, as 30% of journeys made by car are still less than 2 km away. On 10 November 2021, the Bordeaux Metropolitan Council adopted its first metropolitan walking plan. The aim of the plan is to provide a calmer living environment while helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants linked to road transport. Drawn up in consultation, the plan proposes 19 actions grouped into 5 areas.  |

|  Action description | The road network in the conurbation remains particularly congested at peak times, and the pollutant emissions generated by this road traffic remain too high. On the ring road, the occupancy rate is only 1.2 people per vehicle, and for the conurbation as a whole, it is 1.34 people per vehicle. Car-sharing, such as car-pooling, is an important way of relieving congestion on the roads. To mobilize and encourage this practice, a coordinated multi-partner carpooling plan will be drawn up by 2022. In addition, given that metropolitan vehicles are on the road less than 5% of the time, car-sharing services will also be developed to free up public space for little-used vehicles and reduce the GHG emissions of road transport. A car-sharing vehicle could replace up to 7 vehicles, which would reduce the need to build vehicles and the associated emissions, and would make it possible to limit the automatic use of cars.  |   |

|   |  Action description | There is currently very little diversity in road transport motorisation, with petroleum products accounting for the vast majority. As a result, they are responsible for a third of the region's greenhouse gas emissions and a third of its energy consumption. In order to meet climate and air quality objectives, a diversification of motorisation methods is essential, at a time when carbon-free thermal and electric solutions are being developed. Each of these solutions has its own range of relevance and corresponds to different uses; decarbonised mobility therefore requires the consideration of a multitude of options adapted to each context. Through its 2020-2030 Mobility Plan, Bordeaux Métropole aims to support the deployment of low-carbon vehicles and thus to support the electrification targets set for the vehicle fleet at national level.
Bordeaux Métropole manages a network of 253 recharging points for electric vehicles, with 91 stations on the city's roads. These charging stations are accessible to all users. From 2024 onwards, the Metropole will therefore undertake a plan to renew its equipment at all stations, in order to replace the most dilapidated charging points. At the end of 2022, Bordeaux Métropole voted in favor of its Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Master Plan (SDIRVE), a plan for the deployment of on-street charging facilities, in addition to the other charging facilities available to the public (notably parking lots and private facilities). This gradual increase is expected to reach 20 to 25 stations/year, with a target of 70 stations by the end of 2025. Some twenty sites have already been validated and are scheduled for 2024.  |

|   |  Action description | Freight transport (excluding air transport) accounts for around 14% of energy consumption in 2019, and could increase by 10% by 2030 in a business-as-usual scenario (source: SDE). The objective set out in the current climate strategy (PCAET) is to reverse the upward trend in energy consumption in the freight transport sector, excluding air transport, and the associated greenhouse gas emissions, and to reduce them by 24% and 96%.
Bordeaux Metropole will therefore be implementing a low-carbon urban logistics plan for the whole city and its neighboring areas, incorporating in particular the role of river freight in the city center and supporting rail freight in order to limit the use of road transport, particularly heavy goods vehicles.  |

B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Despite very ambitious hypothesis for reducing carbon emissions on its territory, Bordeaux Métropole will most likely still have an emission gap in 2030. According to the strategy presented above, the gap is estimated to  $473,000\mathrm{tCO_2}$  of which  $75\%$  can be explained by heavy industry and transports.

Bordeaux Métropole's strategy presented above pushed ambitions as far as possible for these categories of emissions but does not control all levers regarding these sectors' decarbonation. Due to the presence of an highway on the territory, and heavy industries from big national or international companies, the stakeholders responsible for these residual emissions will be very difficult to reach at the local level. Going further will imply to also raise ambitions for heavy industries and long-distance road transport at the national level.

However, Bordeaux Métropole clearly stated its commitment towards climate neutrality in its 2022 action plan and is maintaining this ambition with the CCC. To that extent, Bordeaux Métropole is both counting on its carbon sinks and on carbon compensation outside the territory.

![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)
Figure 11- Target value - breakdown of carbon storage by soil type and reservoir

The potential for developing carbon sinks within the territory is very low, as shown in the graph above (76 ktCO2e by 2030). Thus, Bordeaux Métropole will have to go through compensation for its remaining emissions.

Bordeaux Métropole has been working on its strategy for compensating remaining emissions since 2022. Even though this strategy is not finalized yet, it can be expected to be voted in the next few years. At the moment, the most likely outcome will be to integrate the already existing Carbon cooperative of La Rochelle, an other communality of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. This Carbon cooperative finances carbon compensation projects in Nouvelle-Aquitaine, all being certified by a Label bas carbon controlled by the French ministry of ecological transition. , it is estimated that the participation of Bordeaux Métropole to the Carbon cooperative could finance the compensation of up to  $80,000\mathrm{ktCO_2}$  outside its territory, preferably in Gironde or within neighboring departments with projects mostly centered on reforestation.

Teams from Bordeaux Metropole keeps working on the characterization of this compensation strategy and will integrate it in following versions of the CCC.

## 2.2 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

We are working closely with Bordeaux Métropole's administrative departments to analyze and improve the reliability of our indicators. In this first version of the CCC, we are integrating only the mandatory indicators (GHG emissions indicators) provided by NetZero city. Nevertheless, here is the list of indicators below, which will enable us to monitor and steer the implementation of the action plan. We will identify target values for 2027 and 2030 in the very near future to be able to integrate these indicators to future iterations of the CCC.

Modal share of public transportation
Modal share of bikes
car occupancy rate
electrification of the private vehicle pool
Number of charge points (IRVE)
Tertiary private buildings benefiting from public support for retrofitting
Tertiary public buildings in a process of retrofit
Installed PV power
Share of agricultural surfaces labelled organic or in process of labelling
Number of new planted tree
percentage of tree canopy within the city
number of cooling islands
Weight of non-recycled household waste
Grid supply heat

On a more middle term perspective, Bordeaux Métropole is working on establishing and generalizing a more comprehensive approach of climate and environmental policies evaluation and monitoring. At the moment, the priority is strengthening the financial and economic aspects of this monitoring. However, on a longer term, estimating and measuring other co-benefits than the air quality will become part of this strategy and will be integrated to future iterations of the CCC.

# 3 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

## 3.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

### C-1.1: Description or visualisation of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

Bordeaux Métropole takes a global, collaborative approach to achieving its climate objectives, both internally and in collaboration with local stakeholders. The metropole integrates climate considerations into all its policies, ensuring a holistic and inclusive approach to ecological transition and climate resilience.

To build a solid contract and achieve its ambitions, Bordeaux Métropole has drawn on the recommendations of Net Zero City's "Transition Map and experience". Bordeaux Métropole intends to involve both the economic sector (public and private) and civil society organizations and citizens in the transition to climate neutrality for the territory.

### Monitoring within the administration

The transition team is coordinated internally by the ACTE Division (Climate Action and Energy Transition) within the DGTERE (Department of Ecological Transition and Environmental Resources), with support from the DRI (Direction des Relations Internationales) and the TATC Department (Future of Territories, Territories in Cooperation). The Finance and Procurement
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Department and the Economic Development Department have joined the transition team to contribute their respective expertise to the CCC. The transition team comprises around ten in-house staff.

Within the ACTE department, two divisions are working on the implementation of the region's energy transition, the renovation of residential and office and commercial buildings, as well as on GHG assessment, and the monitoring and coordination of partnerships with local actors on low-carbon ecological transition issues.

The current Climate Plan includes a technical committee made up of all those involved in implementing metropolitan actions, as well as a monitoring committee made up of all elected representatives. Monitoring and evaluation of the CCC will be organized in the same way, within the framework of existing committees. In fact, the types of action and the contacts involved coincide. Each year, the Transition team will identify the progress of planned actions using a grid of indicators. A collaborative effort to improve the reliability of indicators has been initiated with teams from the various departments. For overall CCC monitoring, the transition team will meet on a monthly basis.

As regards monitoring the actions of partners and stakeholders, the department will also keep track of the progress made by CCC signatories. An annual event will be organized to bring together all signatories. A quarterly follow-up will enable more individualized monitoring with each partner.

# The necessity to involve all territorial stakeholders

As an administration, Bordeaux Métropole only accounts for 6% of the territorial GHG emissions. It means that most of GHG emission reduction by 2030 will involve other stakeholders.

The main actions to be implemented by these stakeholders can imply heavy investments, behavioral changes, or competency building:

Citizens are mostly expected to adopt behavioral changes with limited investments, specifically for their transport habits or waste production. However, some heavier investments are also expected from them, in housing retrofit, or electric vehicles for example.
For tertiary companies (including the public tertiary sector) the main expectation is investing in building retrofit, energy and mobility decarbonation, and renewables production. They will also need to adopt less intensive changes, such as energy sobriety. As employers, they also have a responsibility in fostering and facilitating changes for citizens, through teleworking and teleservices for example.
Major industries will mainly need to invest in decarbonizing their process.
Some economic actors are also strategic for building and publics works included in the action plan, for example in building retrofit, transport infrastructure building, or renewables installation. It is important to make sure they all have the skills to do these works in the most efficient and decarbonize way, including new low carbon and reused material.
Other economic actors, such as banks and insurance companies will also be involved to enable the investments necessary to the action plan. The main challenge regarding these stakeholders will be connecting them with other stakeholders in need of financing or insuring.

Bordeaux Métropole's strategy to involve all these stakeholders in the action plan will be different for citizens and for other economic players. In both cases, Bordeaux Metropole's strategy is focused
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

on animation (consultation, organizing events and workshops) but with the clear objective of fostering behavior changes and investments necessary to the action plan.

## Multi-level governance citizens, non-governmental and academic organizations

Citizen participation is an integral part of the territory's operations. To this end, various entities have been set up to encourage citizen participation and inclusion in the life and policies of their region. The Sustainable Development Council (C2D) is a group of volunteer citizens committed to Bordeaux Metropole. It is a citizens' consultation organization that enables all those who wish to do so to participate in the development of metropolitan projects. The C2D is made up of a Council and a Forum. In 2025, a working group dedicated to climate contributing policies will be created within the C2D, in order to facilitate citizen consultation on Bordeaux Métropole's global climate strategy and feedback on more specific policies. This climate policies dedicated working group, that will be called the « Comité citoyen Climat » (Climate Citizen's Comitee), will meet twice a year.

In 2023, the City of Bordeaux launched its first Great Citizen Dialogue: a participative and collaborative process which, every two years, explores an important issue for the city's future, and considers solutions, ideas, directions and strategies. In 2023, the topic was "The City of Bordeaux and the climate emergency". Organized in three stages, this tool for citizen participation enabled the group of participants to formulate an opinion and recommendations on the issue of climate emergency in Bordeaux. The metropolis is currently working closely with these two entities to improve the structuring of governance (participation in decision-making on climate policies) over the coming months. The idea is not to remain with simple consultation, but to really involve citizens and associations in decision-making and monitoring the implementation of specific subjects.

The Metropole will coordinate its climate action plan with the various citizen participation mechanisms mentioned above. The aim is to fully integrate citizens into the decision-making and monitoring process for climate policy. We are working closely with these entities to improve the structure of governance and the participation of citizens and associations over the coming months. These two systems will help to involve citizens and build a common understanding and support for the climate agenda and its co-benefits.

Moreover, strengthening the links between Bordeaux Métropole, the academic world and citizens is a major lever to be activated to accelerate the deployment of change management solutions. The University of Bordeaux has an important role to play in governance, in terms of both research and training. The ABCD project, proposed as a submission to the "pilot cities" call for projects, will help strengthen the links between metropolitan services, citizens and the academic world in the definition and implementation of innovative measures to accelerate the transition. The outcome of this collaboration will be concrete results:

# Partnerships to strengthen private-sector action

Private and public stakeholders have an important role to play in reaching climate neutrality. Our strategy is to engage key economic actors through the Climate City Contract of Bordeaux Métropole, leveraging their flagship status to accelerate towards climate neutrality. We aim to gather partners' needs related to ecological transition and connect them with existing solutions within the territory.

Bordeaux Métropole acts as a catalyst, ensuring that the solutions provided address partners' needs and benefit to others facing similar challenges. This approach also helps identify unmet needs, such as significant financing need for building renovations and tools to measure impact of projected and implemented actions. Additionally, it connects actors who typically do not interact, despite having common interests.

Many partners have expressed the need for opportunities to meet and exchange ideas. Therefore, we will organize gatherings to share best practices, inspire each other, and foster connections that could lead to collaborative projects.

STRENGTHEN TERRITORIAL COOPERATION TO ACCELERATE DECARBONIZATION

Several initiatives to support economic players exist in the region. Some examples below.

# ZIBAC Network

For example, as part of the national call for projects (low-carbon industrial zone), of which the Metropole is the winner, some thirty private, public and associative structures are participating in the project to decarbonize industry. The decarbonization of industries in a 900-hectare zone primarily dedicated to petrochemicals, but not only, poses major challenges, particularly in terms of in terms of GHG emissions (2.6 million tons of CO2 emitted, including manufacturers from outside Metropolitan France, who are partners in the project). It is also crucial to strengthen the circular economy and industrial ecology to optimize the region's resources (water, electricity, etc.).

The consortium will set up the "Bees ZIP" association (Bordeaux energy Water Environment and Synergies in Industrial and Port Zones), which will carry out these studies, and will also act as a catalyst to animate, federate and structure local players in the region wishing to embark on an ambitious and sustainable environmental transition.

Bees ZIP comprises 21 actions to be carried out over 2 years, with a budget of 3.1 million of euros. In particular, they aim to :

Develop the energy mix and promote synergies between players
Preserve water and pool resources
Capture, store and reuse CO2 emissions

Develop employment and training
Preserve biodiversity
Working with and for citizens
Welcoming new virtuous industries by optimizing industrial real estate
Developing infrastructures and logistics
This ambitious project aims to meet the climate challenge by decarbonizing the region's industries
accelerating the ecological transition of the metropolitan industrial basin, and anticipating
and anticipating future employment and training needs.

&gt; Transition support kit for businesses

![img-18.jpeg](img-18.jpeg)

Bordeaux Métropole offers all entrepreneurs a transition support kit to help them become responsible players in the territory. This kit provides expert, free, independent support make business activities part of a low-energy approach and ecological transition; structure and develop your CSR policy; promote ethical environmental values; and offer employees optimized travel and working conditions; and anticipate future regulatory obligations. Link

&gt; Ecological charter for the « Opération d'Intérêt Métropolitain » (OIM) Bordeaux Aéroparc

Created in 2015, the Opération d'Intérêt Métropolitain (OIM) Bordeaux Aéroparc is a land development operation located in the three communes of Mérignac, Le Haillan and Saint-Médard-en-Jalles. Within this area, three ecological and energy transition charters are being implemented. The aim of each is to support the various stages in the life of a project, in order to manage a real estate or development project in a more ecological and responsible way. three charters have been defined:

A charter for a virtuous project at the design stage;
A charter for a virtuous construction site during project creation;
A charter for virtuous practices throughout the company's activity.

&gt; The ZIRI ("Zone for the Integration of Intelligent Networks")

This network aims to facilitate and support synergies between companies based on the principle of industrial ecology: "one company's waste becomes another company's raw material". The ZIRI network currently has 90 members in Blanquefort, Mérignac, Le Haillan, Artigues-Près-Bordeaux and Bassens. The ZIRIs network provides two levers for action:

Pooling synergies: energy purchases and waste collection are pooled, as are services (fire safety, cleaning of premises, regulatory controls, mobility passes, health insurance, etc.), and substitution synergies are identified and supported during synergy search workshops.
But the ZIRI network is also about facilitating and bringing together member companies through monthly meetings, workshops and working groups.

mobilization, social cohesion and solidarity, etc) aimed to address the systemic barriers and leverage the opportunities identified in Module A-3². It also includes:

## C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

Bordeaux Métropole is stamped with a culture of collaborative partnership with the actors in its territory. Collaboration with the various stakeholder communities is based on participation, social inclusion and innovation. Local stakeholders are consulted (through surveys, consultations or participatory budgets such as the “1Millions of Trees” project), but also supported by various mechanisms (such as employment center or the renovation of commercial buildings). The idea is for the Bordeaux metropolitan authority to act as a catalyst for change towards an ecological transition that benefits everyone. The long-term viability of most initiatives is crucial to ensuring that they are effective and achieve their objectives.

## Revitalization of economically disadvantaged neighborhoods (Quartier prioritaire)

Bordeaux Métropole is leading and coordinating the urban renewal of 11 neighborhoods in 8 communes. Urban renewal aims to improve housing, promote social diversity, open up neighborhoods and stimulate economic development. It involves rehabilitation operations, sometimes destruction-reconstruction, and the rehousing of residents.

Bordeaux Métropole's ambition is to take comprehensive action to improve the quality of life of residents, strengthen social ties, enhance the assets of neighborhoods and better integrate them into the urban area. Urban renewal has an ecological dimension, as it involves rebuilding the city on itself and reusing its built and land resources.

## Ecological transition dimension of Bordeaux's neighborhood centers (Maison de quartier)

There are 8 « maisons de quartiers » in Bordeaux. Each is run by a different association. The associations reach a variety of audiences. The association is committed to reinforcing its action toward ecological transition. The association develop ecological awareness among the public by various actions. For example, to develop biodiversity by participating in greening the city, promoting eco-friendly mobility, sustainable food, and setting an example in terms of waste reduction, reuse and recycling.

## Super Challenges to raise awareness and change practices

Bordeaux Métropole organizes Super Challenges every year on different themes. In 2023, 44 households participated in the Super Water-Energy Challenge, 120 households in the Super Waste Challenge, and 121 households in the Super Food Challenge. These challenges aim to raise awareness and support metropolitan households towards consciousness and changes in practices: significant reduction in energy and water consumption, waste production; and the adoption of healthy, local, and seasonal food.

For the 2021-2022 school year, 4313 students in the metropolitan area benefited from educational interventions by local associations around the challenges of ecological and social transition. In partnership with GRAINE Nouvelle Aquitaine, the “Juniors du Développement Durable” scheme offered four training courses for professionals to develop participants' knowledge and skills on the following themes: reducing waste and plastic in leisure centers, including biodiversity in educational projects, preserving water resources, and improving children's well-being and health in their structure.

## House of employment and companies (Maison de l'emploi et de l'entreprise)

Bordeaux's "house of employment and enterprises" offers a center dedicated to small businesses. In 2021, a support unit on ecological transition for small businesses was opened. This system has made it easier for 350 small businesses in Bordeaux to obtain assistance and link up with their operators. Through an approach that goes straight to the professionals, a face-to-face interview and a free diagnosis are carried out, in order to assess individual issues and needs covering high-value levers in the current economic, regulatory and environmental contexts, namely: energy, mobility, digital sobriety, raw materials supply, CSR, waste management.

## Support for energy-efficient retrofits of commercial and offices buildings

Bordeaux Métropole has set up a program to support the energy-efficiency renovation of tertiary buildings, by carrying out energy studies and providing project management assistance. This support is not limited to companies subject to the "Décret tertiaire", but applies to all companies wishing to implement energy efficiency measures in their buildings. The scheme may concern owner-occupiers, owner-landlords or tenants. Bordeaux Métropole can finance certain studies (diagnostics or energy audits) as well as support for renovation work (advice, project management assistance). Bordeaux Métropole does not finance any of the work: the company bears the entire cost of the project. Membership of the charter enables companies to join a network of players mobilized around energy efficiency issues, to exchange best practices and thus benefit from appropriate support tools. Today, the charter has 22 signatories. This support enables beneficiaries to make the trade-offs necessary to optimize their energy expenditure and reduce the environmental footprint of their real estate assets.

## A citizens' experiment to reduce advertising prints

« OuiPub » is an experiment run by 14 municipalities in France, including Bordeaux. This innovative approach involves prohibiting the distribution of ads in house mailboxes unless there is consent from the owner, represented by a « OuiPub » sticker. It is a major step forward for citizens, allowing them to choose whether they still wish to receive ads, instead of being exposed to them without agreeing. After 2 years of experimentation, less than 1% of mailboxes are covered with a « OuiPub » sticker, resulting in a reduction of ads delivery and therefore a reduction of paper waste to be collected.

As part of the study, a survey shows that 96% of citizens are no longer willing to receive ads, with 75% citing ecological reasons. This indicates that citizens are ready for major changes towards more sustainability.

Project Pilot ABCD
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

1

A collaboration between Bordeaux Métropole and the University of Bordeaux (The Institute of transitions). This project named ABCD (Acting By Collaborating Differently) aims at strengthen collaboration between metropolitan services, citizens, economic players and academia in defining and implementing innovative schemes to accelerate the ecological transition.

The expected results are structuring and leading stakeholder networks of urban and ecological transition. A major annual event will be organized to promote co-construction and the sharing of bast practices. These meetings will lead to new collaborative projects co-lead by the networks. A major event is scheduled for October 2024.

# 4 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the CCC Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for refining the CCC Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract in future iterations.

## Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iteration

The development of the Climate Contract has raised important methodological questions in the elaboration of sectoral greenhouse gas reduction trajectories. The ambitious assumptions for achieving climate neutrality by 2030 are a way of highlighting the colossal efforts required to accelerate current policies.

As previously mentioned, Bordeaux Métropole has voted ambitious GHG emissions reduction targets for its PCAET. Thanks to the CCC's iterative exercise, Bordeaux Métropole is committed to accelerating as much as possible, with the help of the territory's stakeholders, towards achieving climate neutrality. The CCC action plan is largely based on the policy of the PCAET voted in 2022. The next steps in monitoring and updating the CCC will therefore follow that of the PCAET.

Final approval of the PCAET is expected by the end of 2024. Indeed, following the project's approval in September 2022, the associated public entities (State, Environmental Authority, etc.) and the general public (via Bordeaux Métropole's participation platform) were called upon to issue opinions during 2023. These comments will be taken into account in the final version, which will be put to the vote of the Metropolitan Council in 2024. The final version will also be used to consolidate the indicators. The mid-term review is scheduled for 2025, and the revision of the PCAET is planned for 2028.

Progress on the action plans will be monitored annually via the indicators and operational feedback from Bordeaux Métropole's departments.

# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

With the "Fit for 55" program, the EU has committed itself to reducing its emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990, and to achieving climate neutrality by mid-century. In this context, cities and Metropolises have a key role to play in making a substantial contribution to the implementation of the European Green Deal. They have the opportunity to accelerate the decarbonization of territories and ensure a fair and equitable transition.

Bordeaux Métropole includes 28 municipalities over an area of 578.3 km², with a population of 814,049 (INSEE, 2019). The administration is involved in a wide range of areas, including mobility, economic development, metropolitan spatial planning, environmental policies. Committed to the ecological and energy transition since 2009 with its first Climate action plan, Bordeaux Métropole has made climate emergency one of its top priorities.

![img-20.jpeg](img-20.jpeg)

Between 2010 and 2019, local greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1 and 2) fell by 11% (source: ALEC). The current metropolitan team wishes to reinforce and accelerate the low-carbon transition and resilience in the face of climate change. In September 2022, Bordeaux Métropole adopted a new Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan (Plan climat air energie territorial PCAET), aimed at achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This ambitious planning document is in line with the French regulatory expectations of the National Low Carbon Strategy (Stratégie nationale bas-carbone - SNBC) and the regional plan for regional planning, sustainable development (Schéma régional d'aménagement, de développement durable et d'égalité des territoires - SRADDET). The PCAET aims to achieve carbon neutrality by offsetting 100% of its residual emissions (scope 1 and 2). The Metropolis also aims to reduce the territory's carbon footprint (scope 1, 2, 3) by 79% between 2019 and 2050, cut by 2 energy consumption and almost double the production of renewable and recovered energy. The PCAET also plans a 100% compensation of residual emissions (scope 1,2).

It turns out that only 6% of the territory's carbon footprint is emitted by Bordeaux Métropole as a local authority. Reaching the goal of carbon neutrality is therefore absolutely dependent on the involvement of all local players (businesses, institutions, civil society, citizens, etc.). That's why the strategy of the PCAET is based on a founding principle: to promote ownership of the challenges of ecological transition by local stakeholders. The goal is to encourage local players to act in their own fields (energy, production, consumption, mobility, infrastructure, etc.), to bring about significant, systemic changes across the metropolitan area. Climate neutrality can only be achieved through cross-sectoral, multi-level collaboration.

Bordeaux Métropole is involved in various European Commission programs and missions, notably the "Adaptation to Climate Change" mission. It is also a signatory to the Covenant of Mayors and the Green City Accord. Aware of the urgent need to accelerate the implementation of high-impact actions to reduce GHG emissions, Bordeaux Métropole is delighted to have been selected as one of the EU's "100 Intelligent and Climate Neutral Cities" consequently to applying in January 2022. Participation in
the network of the mission cities enables the Metropolis to take part in exchange networks with other European local authorities on common issues (methodology, reporting and monitoring tools, partnerships, climate democracy, etc.) and to spread best practices that can be replicated. Finally, this is a real opportunity to better identify the systemic obstacles to achieve its climate ambitions the sooner possible.

The objective for the Metropolis, beyond meeting its regulatory targets is to go further an accelerate the energy and ecological transition, by identifying the levers required to reach climate neutrality by 2030. Drawing up the Climate City Contract is therefore an opportunity to raise the region's ambitions for 2030 and provide an answer to these various challenges.

# 2 Articulation between PCAET and CCC

## Link with the Climate Air Energy Territorial Plan (PCAET)

The challenge will be to coordinate the pre-existing regulatory Climate Plan in France with the new European Climate City Contract initiative. Bordeaux Métropole is taking the opportunity to challenge its greenhouse gas reduction scenarios using the various tools provided by the "100 cities" Mission. Our aim is to learn as much as possible from experience, our current policies, and actions. The action plan component of the CCC will therefore be based on a selection of actions from our Metropolitan Climate Plan, adopted in September 2022 in accordance with French law.

Firstly, the iterative work of the "Climate city contract" enables us to seek to accelerate as far as possible the actions already launched or planned by Bordeaux Métropole. One of the advantages of building the CCC Action plan on our pre-existing strategy is to easily identify the changes and raised ambitions working with currently implemented actions that are already understandable for our stakeholders but imagining going further, as the work on the CCC is an opportunity to imagine other levers for decarbonization with local stakeholders. As a matter of fact, the drafting of this first version of our Climate city contract has been an opportunity to identify the regulatory and political obstacles to lift and the priority investments to successfully implement our policy in favor of the climate and decarbonization of our territory and to accelerate these policies towards a 2030 climate neutrality.

Secondly, the CCC meets our need to quantify more precisely the financing required to reach metropolitan climate path. Bordeaux Métropole is already working on different national and international investments programs. The iterative work around the CCC and more particularly the investment plan will allow us to strengthen our first estimate of the costs corresponding to the scenarios of greenhouse gas reduction towards carbon neutrality. The Metropolis will be able to better pilot and adjust its investment plan.

# 3 Towards a resilient, carbon neutral, 100% renewable energy territory

## 2050 target and 2030 target

Bordeaux Métropole Climate Air Energy Territorial Plan regulatory objective is already to become carbon neutral. To do so, the target is to reduce the carbon footprint by 79% (scope 1,2,3) between 2019 and 2050, divide by two the electrical consumption while an expected population increase of 25%. According to this plan, the aim is to reduce by 45% territorial emissions (scope 1, 2) by 2030. Bordeaux Métropole is taking the opportunity of the "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" mission to challenge his estimated reduction of greenhouse gas emission (scope 1, 2) by identifying more ambitious levers, and new ways of collaborating in its territory.

Within the framework of the NetZeroCities economic modeling, and according to the most ambitious hypothesis, pursuing and accelerating our politics would allow 64% reduction of greenhouse gas between 2019 and 2030.

![img-21.jpeg](img-21.jpeg)

Thanks to this collective work involving all organization levels, Bordeaux Métropole aims to accelerate as much as possible decarbonization and get as close as possible to neutrality by 2030.

It is important to stress out that this strategy towards 2030 climate neutrality has been established building up as much as possible on the preexisting PCAET strategy features, to facilitate its understanding and appropriation by Bordeaux Métropole stakeholders. As a result, Bordeaux Métropole chose 2019 as a baseline and included the heavier industry and the ETS in the strategy.
This perimeter can be regarded as a testimony of Bordeaux Métropole's level of ambition towards neutrality.

Regarding baseline, Bordeaux Métropole considers that choosing 2019 is quite ambitious, as it is the last available greenhouse gas inventory that was not affected by the drop in activity due to the 2020-2021 pandemic. As already mentioned in the introduction, Bordeaux Métropole's territorial emissions had already fallen by 11% between 2010 and 2019. Choosing an earlier baseline would have gotten us much closer to the 80% emission reduction target.

Regarding perimeter, only scope 1 and 2 are taken into account in the CCC greenhouse gas inventory. It should be noted that the carbon accounting standard required by the Climate City Contract, namely the GHG Protocol (Greenhouse Gas Protocol), differs from the breakdown we use in french GHG inventory, Bilan carbone® method. Work has been carried out to adapt to the GPC Protocol. Furthermore, no exclusions have been made in the scope of the GHG inventory for the base year (2019). The European Emissions Trading System (ETS) has been included in the scope of the GHG inventory. Given that our territory is taking ambitious action to support economic and industrial players in decarbonizing their activities, we decided to continue considering the GHG emissions generated by these industrial actors on a local scale. Excluding the whole industrial sector, the reduction in GHG emissions would be as high as 68% in 2030 compared with 2019.

Finally, decarbonization will bring concrete benefits to many sectors of society such as:

Reduced air pollution, fuel poverty and noise through decarbonation of heating and mobility;
Increased property value and employment due to retrofit work;
Increased health and safety due to the reduction of motorized transportation need;
Increased water quality, eco-system health and community asset through circular economy, nature based solution and waste reduction;
Increased collaboration between stakeholders to generate new synergies and added value for the territory.

By encouraging and valuing these co-benefits, it will be easier to involve stakeholders and citizens in the decarbonization process.

## 4 Strategic priorities

### Strategic priorities

The pre-existing PCAET (2022-2028) is based on the triptych "Think differently, do differently, live differently" and promotes a balanced approach between projects falling within the direct remit of the Metropolis and territorial animation actions. The first axis, "Penser autrement" ("Think differently"), includes actions designed to encourage training and awareness-raising, develop cooperative practices, steer and make visible the territorial trajectory, and accompany all publics through the process of change. The second area, "Doing things differently", includes actions aimed at developing low-carbon economic sectors and activities or those with sequestration potential, as well as supporting the transition of businesses towards a lower environmental impact. The third theme, "Living differently", covers actions aimed at transforming the behavior of all those involved, in the areas of everyday life - travel, housing or business premises, consumption (of food and other
products). It also addresses the structuring issue of spatial planning, as a factor in balanced resource management and health promotion. These three themes are broken down into objectives.

To bring our actions into line with the Climate Contract reference framework, five strategic priorities have been identified between now and 2030 to accelerate progress towards climate neutrality:

) Generalize low-carbon mobility across the region

The Metropolis already has a substantial public transport network. However, it will seek to improve it and further develop TRAM lines (B to Gradignan and D to Saint Médard). The Metropolis will gradually replace the TBM (local public transport operator) fleet of internal combustion and hybrid buses with electric and bioGNV buses.

Bordeaux Métropole will continue to implement its third Bicycle Plan, notably with the development of the REVE network (Express Bike network). This will extend over 275km and includes 14 routes serving the territory's main centers of activity and employment, a cycling network that will be connected to other major transport networks. The Metropolis municipalities will be supported in their efforts to further develop cycling and walking among residents, in collaboration with local associations. In terms of medium and long-distance car-sharing, a coordinated, multi-partner car-sharing plan will be developed, along with various incentive measures.

) Decarbonize and massively renovate the region's building

Bordeaux Métropole wants to accelerate the current residential renovation program as much as possible, by working alongside government schemes to support households in the high-performance renovation of their homes. Particular attention needs to be paid to the most vulnerable households, especially those in fuel poverty. According to the latest roadmap, Bordeaux Métropole is aiming to achieve annual energy savings of 60 GWh by 2026, resulting from the energy-efficient renovation of 11,500 homes per year across the territory, and ultimately to reach 100% of renovated homes. At the same time, the aim is to reduce fossil fuel consumption in buildings by developing heat pumps, district heating and so on. It would be desirable to achieve zero oil-heated housing by 2030. It is an extremely ambitious goal, but one that seems unavoidable in the context of an accelerated scenario of climate neutrality by 2030.

The Metropolis will also do its utmost to accelerate the implementation of the "Decret tertiaire" (Tertiary decree) in the region. In France, the Tertiary decree applies to owners and tenants of establishments housing commercial or office activities (public or private buildings with a surface area over 1,000 m² are subject to it). The Tertiary decree requires those subjects to the law to reduce their final energy consumption by 40% by 2030, compared with a reference year that cannot be earlier than 2010. We'll be helping to build a network of players in the construction industry, to increase skills and employment in the field of energy-efficient building renovation. Finally, we will actively work to reduce the environmental impact of construction, by promoting reuse and recyclability in the building and public works sector, and by developing a sustainable construction approach with industry players.

) Develop local production and consumption of renewable energies

Over the next three years, we will be studying heating networks in all neighborhoods with sufficient thermal density and defining a strategy and specific action plan for cooling networks, adapted to the different types of neighborhoods and buildings. The plan is to locate industrial sites whose processes release large quantities of heat (furnaces, boilers, incinerators, turbines, etc.), in particular as part of a global partnership with the area's biggest energy consumers (the "top 10") located mainly along the Garonne river (Ambès, Bègles, Bassens): aeronautics, space and defense industries, pharmaceutical industry, food industry, etc. We will then carry out specific feasibility studies for each industrial site, in line with the heating network development plan and the industrial needs of the site's neighbors.

The Metropolis wishes to promote photovoltaic solarization of the territory. In April 2024, the Bordeaux Solar City Project was launched. The aim of this project is to publicize the projects currently underway on its own property (60,000 m² by 2026), as well as those of its partners in order to create a

8
momentum for photovoltaic development. By 2030, Bordeaux Métropole aims to have developed around 150 MWc of photovoltaic installations on shaded areas and on the roofs of public and private buildings throughout the territory, with a view to achieving an installed capacity of 300 MWc.

In terms of energy recovery, the Metropolis will be developing the first methanization projects: wastewater treatment plants, biowaste recovery, the first industrial methanization plant, etc. Through our semi-public company “Bordeaux Métropole Énergies”, we will support regional renewable energy projects. We will study and initiate the development of two methanization projects with neighbouring territories.

Finally, we will begin structuring and setting up a monitoring system to purchase renewable energies in partnership with existing observatories (ALEC, AREC, etc.), to collect and process data on the supply of green gas and electricity to local authorities, businesses and households, with a view to developing direct purchasing mechanisms.

## 4) Developing a low-carbon, circular economy for all the economic and industrial sectors

Bordeaux Métropole wishes to promote less carbon-intensive processes among the region's industrial players. This will involve strengthening partnerships with industries through a variety of mechanisms (notably the ZIBAC project described in the “Procedures and implementation” section). It will be possible to use Bordeaux Métropole's public procurement contracts to encourage the use of locally sourced bio-based materials (environmental clauses in metropolitan purchases and calls for tender).

The Metropolis will make its connections, networks, assets and land available to work towards the rapid and sustainable development of the region's ecological transition sectors and support the emergence of new players.

In terms of waste, with the local program for the prevention of household and similar waste, the Metropolis is aiming for a 15% reduction in per capita household and similar waste by 2030, thanks to reduced consumption and improved recycling facilities.

By 2028, the Metropolis plans to set up six ephemeral reuse areas installed at regular intervals in the heart of neighborhoods and towns. By 2026, Bordeaux Métropole will also have a fully-fledged circular economy plan for its territory.

## 5) Protecting residents and building resilience to the effects of climate change

The new “cooling Metropolis” program is a territorial strategy to meet the crucial challenge of adapting the metropolitan area to heat waves. The program has several focuses:

Proximity to cool spaces, water and shade;
The redevelopment of living soil;
Greening the canopy;
Thermal comfort in public buildings and housing.

By 2026, Bordeaux Métropole will reinforce or reveal 100 urban “cool islands” reachable by walking distance. Other actions linked to climatic hazards (flooding, landslides, fire) are subjects of specific action programs, but are not detailed in the Climate Contract.

Bordeaux Métropole has also adopted its Agricultural and Food Resilience Strategy (Stratégie de Résilience Agricole et Alimentaire - SRAA), certified as a Territorial Food Project (Projet Alimentaire Territorial - PAT) by the French Ministry of Agriculture and Food Sovereignty. The main aims of the agricultural component are to encourage the adaptation of farming practices to climate change by promoting the development of environmentally-friendly urban and peri-urban agriculture, based on the sustainability of farms and the quality of production.

# 5 Process and principles

## Process and principles

Bordeaux Métropole takes a global, collaborative approach to achieving its climate objectives, both internally and in collaboration with local stakeholders. The Metropolis integrates climate considerations into all its policies, ensuring a holistic and inclusive approach to ecological transition and climate resilience.

To build a solid contract and achieve its ambitions, Bordeaux Métropole has used the recommendations of Net Zero City's "Transition Map and experience". Bordeaux Métropole intends to involve both the economic sector (public and private) and civil society organizations and citizens in the transition to climate neutrality.

![img-22.jpeg](img-22.jpeg)

## Setting up a "transition team"

The transition team is coordinated internally by the Climate Action and Energy Transition Department (ACTE), with support from the International Relations Department (DRI) and the Territories of Tomorrow, Territories in Cooperation Department (DTATC). The Finance and Purchasing Department and the Economic Development Department (DDE) have also joined the transition team to contribute their respective expertise to the CCC. The transition team comprises around ten in-house staff.

Within the ACTE division, two departments – “Animation of transitions” and “Energy strategy and action” – are working on the implementation of the territory's climate and energy transition, the renovation of residential and tertiary buildings, as well as on carbon accounting and the monitoring and management of partnerships with local players on low-carbon ecological transition issues.

DTATC is developing partnerships with neighboring regions. Each territory has its own specificities, but also interdependencies. The Metropolis embodies the political will to work towards reducing territorial fractures. Inter-territorial cooperation is a strong lever for territorial rebalancing and solidarity. We work together on a wide range of issues, including mobility, urban logistics, agriculture and food, economic development and more. The energy and ecological transition is also a major challenge for these territories.

The DRI enables the Metropolis to cooperate on a European and international scale, to keep abreast of existing best practices and to promote metropolitan know-how. It ensures Bordeaux Métropole's coherent presence in the various networks dealing with climate change issues, in addition to the European Commission's "cities" and "climate" missions (Eurocities, Energy cities, etc.).

## The necessity to involve all territorial stakeholders

As an administration, Bordeaux Métropole only accounts for 6% of the territorial GHG emissions. It means that most of GHG emission reduction by 2030 will involve other stakeholders.

The main actions to be implemented by these stakeholders can imply heavy investments, behavioral changes, or competency building:

Citizens are mostly expected to adopt behavioral changes with limited investments, specifically for their transport habits or waste production. However, some heavier investments are also expected from them, in housing retrofit, or electric vehicles for example.
For tertiary companies (including the public tertiary sector) the main expectation is investing in building retrofit, energy and mobility decarbonation, and renewables production. They will also need to adopt less capital-intensive changes, such as energy sobriety. As employers, they also have a responsibility in fostering and facilitating changes for citizens, through teleworking and teleservices for example.
Most of the major industries have already started to invest in their decarbonization process (scope 1,2) but will have to even further accelerate (scope 3).
Some economic actors are also strategic for building and providing the public works included in the action plan, for example in building retrofit, transport infrastructure building, or renewables installation. It is important to make sure they all have the skills to do these works in the most efficient and decarbonize way, including innovative low carbon and reused material.
Other economic actors, such as banks and insurance companies will also be involved to enable the investments necessary to the action plan. The main challenge regarding these stakeholders will be connecting them with other stakeholders in need of financing or insuring.

Bordeaux Métropole's strategy to involve all these stakeholders in the action plan will be different for citizens and for other economic players. In both cases, Bordeaux Metropole's strategy is focused on animation (consultation, organizing events and workshops) but with the clear objective of fostering behavior changes and investments necessary to the action plan.

## Strong citizen involvement

Citizen participation is an important part of the region's operations. Various committees have been set up to encourage citizen participation and inclusion in local life and policies. The Sustainable Development Council (C2D) is a group of volunteer citizens committed to Bordeaux Métropole. It is a citizens' consultation body that enables all those who wish to do so to participate in the development of metropolitan projects. The C2D is made up of a Council and a Forum. The Council comprises as many "permanent" members as there are elected representatives (104), who serve for three years. C2D members work in small groups on specific topics (housing, transport, waste, the environment, regional planning, etc.). Topics are proposed by the Metropolis or chosen by the C2D itself, as appropriate. In 2025, a working group dedicated to climate contributing policies will be created within the C2D, in order to facilitate citizen consultation on Bordeaux Métropole's global climate strategy and feedback on more specific policies. This climate policies dedicated working group, that will be called the « Comité citoyen Climat » (Climate Citizen's Comitee), will meet twice a year.

At a communal level, the City of Bordeaux launched its first Great Citizen Dialogue in 2023: a participative and collaborative process which proposes to explore every two years an important issue for the city's future, and to consider solutions, ideas, directions and strategies. In 2023, the topic was "The City of Bordeaux and the climate emergency". Organized in three stages, this tool for citizen participation led to the creation of a Citizens' Convention made up of 100 randomly selected citizens representative of the Bordeaux population, who met several times over several months to formulate an opinion and recommendations on the issue of the climate emergency at Bordeaux level.

The Metropolis intends to build up on this preexisting communal experimentation and coordinate its climate action plan with the various citizen participation entities mentioned above.

Moreover, strengthening the links between Bordeaux Métropole, the academic community and citizens is a major lever to be activated to accelerate the deployment of solutions to accompany change. The University of Bordeaux has an important role to play in the transition team, in terms of both research and training. Our ABCD project, submitted as a candidate for the "pilot cities" call for projects, will help strengthen the links between metropolitan services, citizens and academia in the definition and implementation of innovative measures to accelerate the transition. The outcome of this collaboration will be concrete results:

The structuring and animation of networks of players and the acceleration of meetings to create the conditions for sharing and co-constructing solutions for the territory's transition. A major annual event will be organized to promote the co-construction and shared deployment of solutions.
These meetings will lead to projects co-sponsored and co-lead by the networks, making them gas pedals project.

# Strengthening the involvement of public and private players

Private and public stakeholders have an important role to play in achieving climate neutrality in our territory. Most major players have already adopted a strategy to reduce their carbon footprint. We are working to network them so that they can share best practices, capitalize on successful experiences, foster cooperative practices and engage their ecosystems to accelerate the transition. These key players will be able to create a ripple effect across the region. The CCC partnership scheme is an excellent way of formalizing and highlighting their commitments, in order to give impetus to a wider dynamic in favor of climate neutrality.

Several business support schemes are active in the region. For example, as part of the national call for projects (low-carbon industrial zone - Zone industrielle bas carbone (ZIBAC)), of which the Metropolis is winner, some thirty private, public and associative structures are taking part in the BEES-ZIP project ("Bordeaux energies water environment and synergies in industrial and port zones"). The strength of this project lies in the fact that it brings together so many players from all walks of life. This combination has made it possible to build a global project that approaches decarbonization from different angles, whether socio-economic or technological, depending on the case. This approach has been co-constructed with all local players (industrialists, local authorities, clusters, residents' associations, consular authorities, etc.) to ensure a 360° approach to decarbonization, with spin-offs in terms of employment, reindustrialization, economic development, land optimization, adaptation to climate change and biodiversity preservation.

# Setting up a shared assessment and monitoring system

The pre-existing Climate Plan provides for a technical committee bringing together all those involved in implementing metropolitan actions, as well as a steering committee comprising all the relevant elected representatives. Monitoring and evaluation of the CCC will be organized in the same way, within the framework of existing bodies. In fact, the types of action and the contacts coincide. Each year, the Transitions Management team will identify the progress of planned actions using a grid of indicators. A collaborative effort to improve the reliability of indicators has been initiated with teams from the various departments.

Monitoring of the CCC investment plan will also be carried out within the framework of existing bodies. Indeed, Bordeaux Métropole has a steering committee for green budgeting and green finance, which brings together all the relevant elected representatives who are also involved in monitoring the CCC action plan. For overall monitoring of the CCC, the transition team will meet on a monthly basis.

As regards monitoring the actions of partners and stakeholders, the management team will also keep track of the progress made by CCC signatories. An annual event will be organized to bring together all signatories. A quarterly follow-up will enable more individualized monitoring with each partner.

The already planned annual monitoring exercises of the CCC will also be an occasion to assess the other changes to be implemented (e.g.: regarding co-benefits estimation, financial monitoring and the carbon compensation strategy).

# 6 Signatories

## Process and principles

The list of signatories below is not complete. Other signatory partners are expected to join the process by the time the Climate Contract is submitted in September 2024. After submission of the Climate Contract, the approach may be joined by other committed players wishing to contribute to the region's decarbonization ambitions.

Mission UE 100 villes climatiquement neutres en carbone et intelligentes d'ici 2030 - Contrat climatique (Climate city contract) - Décision - Adoption

Madame Claudine BICHET présente le rapport suivant,

Mesdames, Messieurs,

En 2021, avec le programme "Fit for 55", l'UE s'est engagée à réduire ses émissions d'au moins 55 % d'ici à 2030 par rapport à 1990 et à atteindre la neutralité climatique d'ici au milieu du siècle. Dans ce contexte, les villes et Métropoles ont un rôle majeur à jouer, pour contribuer de manière substantielle à la mise en œuvre du Green Deal européen.

Bordeaux Métropole a été sélectionnée dès 2022 par la Commission européenne dans le cadre de la Mission "100 Villes climatiquement neutres en carbone et intelligentes d'ici 2030". 112 villes et métropoles européennes en ont été lauréates dont neuf en France (Paris, Angers Loire Métropole, Dijon Métropole, Dunkerque, Grenoble-Alpes Métropole, Lyon, Marseille, Nantes Métropole et Bordeaux Métropole).

Grâce à cette Mission 100 Villes, Bordeaux Métropole est au cœur d'un réseau de collectivités européennes pionnières qui serviront d'exemples pour accélérer la transition écologique et énergétique et tenter d'accélérer vers la neutralité climatique à l'échelle de ces territoires.

Dans ce cadre, les villes lauréates doivent rédiger un Contrat Climatique, ou Climate City Contract (CCC) qu'elles doivent soumettre en septembre 2024 à la Commission européenne. Le contrat climatique est une démarche itérative qui comprend un plan engagement, un plan d'action et un plan d'investissement associés. L'engagement autour du Contrat climatique est l'objet de la présente délibération.

La Commission européenne attribuera ainsi un label aux collectivités lauréates ayant soumis un contrat climatique qui, au-delà de la visibilité ainsi donnée au territoire à l'échelle européenne, donne accès à des accompagnements techniques pour mener sa politique climatique et pourrait aussi faciliter l'accès à des investissements privés.

Le contrat climatique constitue également une opportunité d'identifier et faire remonter les freins opérationnels et financiers des villes et métropoles, dans la mise en œuvre des politiques actuelles en faveur du climat, pour inciter la Commission européenne à aider davantage les collectivités et adapter leur dispositif.

Engagements de Bordeaux Métropole dans le cadre de son Contrat climatique

Bordeaux Métropole a adopté en septembre 2022 un Plan Climat Air Energie Territorial (PCAET), qui vise la neutralité carbone d'ici 2050. Ce document de planification, déjà ambitieux, s'inscrit dans le cadre des attentes réglementaires françaises de l'actuelle Stratégie Nationale Bas Carbone (SNBC).

Bordeaux Métropole a alors saisi l'opportunité de la Mission 100 Villes et du Contrat climatique pour modéliser une accélération de sa trajectoire de réduction des gaz à effet de
serre de son territoire en cherchant à identifier les potentiels leviers d'accélération de la décarbonation. Contrairement au PCAET qui ne dispose pas d'un volet de financement, l'exercice itératif du Contrat climatique permettra dans les mois et années à venir de travailler sur un chiffrage plus précis des coûts d'investissement publics et privés nécessaires à la décarbonation des secteurs les plus émissifs (bâtiments résidentiels et tertiaire, transport routier, industrie, etc.).

L'objectif de Bordeaux Métropole est de tenir ses objectifs réglementaires conformément à son PCAET, et grâce à la Mission européenne des 100 villes, et à l'action conjointe des acteurs économiques (privé, public) et de la société civile, la Métropole espère accélérer d'ici 2030 vers la neutralité climatique du territoire.

Le plan d'engagement est décliné en un plan d'actions, lequel s'adosse aux actions du PCAET. Ce plan d'action est complété par un plan d'investissement. Les services métropolitains ont été accompagnés par NetZéroCities pour l'utilisation d'un modèle économique permettant d'estimer les investissements nécessaires à la mise en œuvre des politiques et actions permettant l'accélération de la décarbonation du territoire. Ce premier travail exploratoire sera complété de façon itérative dans les mois et années à venir. Il sera également nourri par d'autres travaux menés en parallèle sur cette thématique d'investissement climatique.

Le document annexé à cette délibération sera soumis à la Commission européenne en septembre prochain, il reprend ces objectifs et décline les intentions de Bordeaux Métropole pour y parvenir.

## 2. Démarche partenariale avec les acteurs du territoire

Le Contrat climatique est pensé comme un instrument d'innovation en matière de gouvernance pluri-acteurs. Or, la volonté d'engager le plus concrètement possible les acteurs du territoire (entreprises, acteurs parapublics, communes, associations, citoyens) par différentes instances d'échange et de co-construction, est déjà une volonté du Plan Climat actuel (2023-2028) et du projet de mandature.

Une dizaine d'acteurs (privés, parapublics et publics comme le CHU, Enedis, le Groupe Sud-Ouest, l'Université de Bordeaux, etc) ont d'ores et déjà manifesté leur concours au CCC et à l'objectif commun d'une décarbonation du territoire à un horizon aussi proche que possible. Ces derniers ont transmis des courriers de soutien qui seront annexés au plan d'engagement soumis à la commission européenne. Les services métropolitains préciseront d'ici fin 2024 les modalités de collaboration.

Ainsi, le Contrat climatique permet aux acteurs du territoire d'être co-signataires du plan d'engagement et de manifester leur volonté d'agir pour contribuer à l'atteinte des ambitions climatiques du territoire. Le CCC constitue donc une opportunité complémentaire pour formaliser l'engagement de ces acteurs dans la transition écologique bas carbone au regard de cette Mission européenne. Enfin, elle permettra indirectement de valoriser l'ensemble des dispositifs métropolitains partenariaux déjà existants, sur les questions liées à la transition écologique.

Ceci étant exposé, il vous est demandé, Mesdames et Messieurs, si tel est votre avis, de bien vouloir adopter les termes de la délibération suivante :
