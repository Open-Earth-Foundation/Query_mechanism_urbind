Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

The Action Plan of the city of Parma contains a detailed analysis of the strategies and actions necessary to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

The document, to be considered as a live and continuously updated tool in future years, was drawn up in full synergy with the NetZeroCity guidelines and in particular with the Action Plan guideline https://netzerocities.app/resource -2910.

The document therefore follows the logical approach suggested by NZC whose main cornerstones are:

) Measurable, communicable and verifiable climate action planning starting from a baseline inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. The actions, collected and planned, are divided by sector – following the subdivision suggested by NZC – by typology – e.g. measurable, guidelines, governance, behavioural - and described not only from the point of view of their direct impact on the reduction of climate-changing emissions but also taking into consideration the indirect impacts (ref. NZC Impact Pathways model). Where possible, the necessary investment was associated with each action, the details of which are given in the Investment Plan document.

) Adoption of a strategic approach, based on NZC's Theory of Change, which puts social innovation and innovative governance models, including multi-level ones, first, as enabling factors for the entire territory's path towards climate neutrality.

) Involvement of all local actors both internal and external to the municipal administration. Citizens, private companies, subsidiaries, trade associations, research institutions and universities, hospitals, the banking sector, etc (non-exhaustive list) are involved in the process of co-creation of the action and investment plan, reinforcing their commitment with the signing of the Climate Contract.

The Action Plan is the result of a constant and continuous involvement of the internal ecosystem of the city, an integral part of the Mission. Actions, strategies, challenges, barriers, guidelines and indicators have been identified and carried forward in the analyses in an integrated way. After identifying the sectors most exposed to emissions thanks to the SECAP monitoring (without neglecting the other sectors), we proceeded on the one hand to collect actions by stimulating external and internal stakeholders, and on the other to refine strategies and governance within the Municipality to facilitate the abatement of barriers over time, meet the challenges and increasingly stimulate the whole territory for a just transition to zero emissions. The core of the activities were the implemented social innovation and active citizenship measures. The multi-level governance, created ad hoc and strengthened in some cases in its existing relationships, is of great importance. The large number of municipal resolutions connected to Net Zero City and the entire internal structure that has been set up demonstrate the strong involvement of the Municipality of Parma and its ability to actively and proactively influence the entire territory.

The interconnection with the other two components of the Climate City Contract, namely the Investment Plan and the Commitment, is therefore clear: the three documents are not separate but consequential, and reinforce each other. If the Action Plan illustrates, for example, the portfolio of actions and the strategies put in place for climate neutrality, dividing them by sectors and introducing the quantification of the reduction of emissions, in the Investment Plan we will find greater detail from the financial-economical point of view of the individual investments and the "total cost" of climate neutrality. What is collected in these two documents is presented in the form of a contract in the
中

Commitment where the stakeholders formally undertake with the Mayor and the city to carry out the selected actions.

The starting point of the Action Plan is the SECAP 2021 Monitoring document, elaborated thanks to the support of the Territorial Agency for Energy and Sustainability of Parma (ATES), a document that suggests the reference baseline for the path towards climate. The reference year taken for the CCC - which according to the NZC guidelines must be no earlier than 2018 and which, in the case of the Municipality of Parma, corresponds to the year of the updated SECAP monitoring inventory - is 2019.

The total  $\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{eq}}$  emissions values in the 2019 SECAP monitoring, i.e. the Monitoring Emission Inventory (MEI SECAP 2019) are equal to 981,864 tCO $_2$ . In order to define the Baseline of CCC emissions (hereinafter BEI CCC) it is necessary to add to the MEI SECAP 2019 what was not then accounted for in terms of, for example, missing sectors $^1$ . We therefore arrive at a definitive BEI CCC of 1,126,647 tCO2eq. This value is defined as the amount of emissions to be reduced to achieve climate neutrality. A part of these emissions, and exactly  $43.9\%$  (equal to 494,418.4 tCO $_{2\mathrm{eq}}$ ), can be reduced in 2030 thanks to actions considered within the SECAP. The remaining value will have to be reduced thanks to specific actions identified in this Action Plan.

In drafting the document, the Municipality of Parma received support from the Agency for Sustainable Energy and Development (AESS) for the elaboration and drafting of the documents, for the phase of gathering and analysing the data, for the structuring of internal governance and the activation of the local ecosystem, according to the methods that will be described in detail in chapter 2.1 and in line with the lines of action expressed by NCZ.

A detailed description of the PAESC data is in Form A-1 of this document.

The construction of a solid mandate for the transition to zero emissions by 2030 depends on the involvement of the entire territory. Many actors, both internal and external to the Municipality, have been involved in the process. The first step taken by the Municipality of Parma was the establishment of the Transition Team.

## The Transition Team:

Resolution n. GC-2022-362 of 28/09/2022 defines the governance of the Mission within the municipal administration, made up of a political Steering Committee composed of the Councillors responsible for the issues most involved in the Mission, and by a technical working group including representatives of 7 Sectors of the Municipality with the necessary skills to define the commitments and the action portfolio of the Administration.

Specifically, the working group is coordinated by the General Management Department and is made up of representatives from the following sectors: Public Works, Territorial Planning and Development, Digital Transition, Mobility and Transport, Maintenance and Facility Management, Ecological Transition.

## The working group corresponds with the Transition team within the Municipality.

The Municipality of Parma also made use of the external support of the NetZeroCities Platform and AESS.

NetZeroCities experts provided support in the envisioning phase in order to understand the overall logic of the transition towards climate neutrality, in particular in the activation and understanding of the development process of the Transition Team and of the overall local ecosystem

AESS, the Agency for Energy and Sustainable Development, fractional in-house of the Municipality of Parma, has been given the task of supporting the implementation of the Action and Investment plan, including all those actions necessary for drafting the documents such as, for example, one-to-one meetings with internal and external stakeholders, collection of the portfolio of actions and their analysis in terms of emissions reduction and investments needed, identification of barriers and opportunities for the transition to zero emissions, identification of governance lines and overall planning, also in terms of strategy, for climate neutrality, analysis of impact pathways. The list is not exhaustive.

## The overall ecosystem:

The ecosystem of the City is represented by the Transition team and by the other actors of the city: citizens, the public and private sector, trade associations, the world of research and education who have been involved by the Transition Team in various modalities such as in workshops and thematic tables.

Figure 4 The overall ecosystem

It is only thanks to the ecosystem of the city and the interaction with the other institutions at a regional and national level (e.g. RER, MASE, etc.) that it has been possible to draw up this plan.

## The involvement of the ecosystem:

In order to involve and activate the entire ecosystem, the Municipality of Parma has carried out the following macro steps:

Public launch of the Parma Climate Neutral 2030 initiative (December 2022)
Workshops aimed at internal sectors and investee companies of the Municipality of Parma (February-March 2023)
Workshops with external local actors (March - June 2023)
One-to-one meetings with internal sectors (May – June 2023)
One-to-one insights with external stakeholders (April – June 2023)

# Understand the system through

|  Understand the system through | Data | GHG emissions inventory  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |   |  Analyse actions and gaps needs  |
|   |  Connections, relationships | Map the system and resources flows  |
|   |   |  Identify key obstacles  |
|   |  Future scenarios | Identify levers of change  |
|   |   |  Model options, capital formation, funding strategies  |

To carry out the second step of the Transition Map, "understand the system", we also worked together with ATES in order to find the points of contact between the monitoring of the SECAP and the CCC.

The technical activities related to the identification of the baseline, the calculation of the emission gap, the identification of possible scenarios for climate neutrality, the analysis of possible innovative governance models, the identification of levers and barriers, were carried out by AESS in close collaboration with the Municipality of Parma.

# Co-create a portfolio

|  Co-create a portfolio | Explore actionable pathways | Clarify possible actions and financing / funding options  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |   |  Estimate co-benefits and impact  |
|   |   |  Select impact indicators  |
|   |  Connect interventions across... | Actions with quantified impact  |
|   |   |  Policy  |
|   |   |  Finance  |

The co-creation of the actions portfolio, as mentioned above, was carried out with the overall ecosystem.

The Municipality of Parma has activated a co-planning process with the stakeholders in order to create collaborative networks and identify actions and investments. Indeed, one of the objectives of the 100 Cities Mission is to stimulate multilevel and multi-sectorial collaboration, stimulating public and private investments for climate neutrality.

The co-planning process made it possible to involve around 40 representatives of public bodies, private companies, research bodies and local associations, which represent the local ecosystem, to obtain a joint definition of commitments, functions and investments at the local level, co-plan the actions to be implemented to achieve the objective with a short, medium and long term time horizon.

In addition to face-to-face meetings, in order to compile the city's portfolio of actions, all external stakeholders were given an action collection questionnaire that allowed to gather the main data required in the Action Plan. The actions collected were then included in the Action Plan in the different tables of the NZC model.

## 2.2 The sustainability of the Action Plan to 2030

September 2023 establishes the date of the first delivery of the CCC of the City of Parma to the European Commission via the NZC platform.

Since, as also explained to all the parties involved in the contract, the Mission to achieve climate neutrality is a real path towards 2030, it is of fundamental importance that the work carried out for the drafting of the first CCC is considered as an initial milestone for the achievement of the 2030 goals.

Both the Action and the Investment Plan will be constantly updated in future years, continuing to involve not only the signatory stakeholders but also trying to widen the audience of local players as much as possible. In fact, on the one hand, another set of 30 local realities (business and associations) have already been identified to broaden the audience of stakeholders to be involved in the process of the Parma Climate Neutral 2030 initiative, on the other hand a communication strategy has been developed for the direct involvement of citizens in the choices for climate neutrality.

In future years, the involvement of external stakeholders will be increasingly stronger, also in order to create more and more synergies between all the players in Parma; this cooperation will be aimed to foster the co-creation of the portfolio and to create an overall ecosystem capable to face the barriers and opportunities towards climate neutrality. The stakeholder base will also be expanded. Trade associations, non-profit sector and trade unions have already been identified to be involved in the near future.

It is expected that the resolutions and guidelines of the Municipality of Parma, connected to the CCC and illustrated below, will see more and more actions for neutrality in future years, not only within the Municipality but also outside it.

The Steering Committee of the Municipality, a key element of the Transition Team, will continue its work of dialogue and continuous updating, involving the internal sectors of the Municipality which have already actively contributed to the identification of actions and strategies for neutrality and further extending it to others sectors that initially have participated on a simple occasional basis. This will broaden the pool of change makers within the Administration and make structural the changes for neutrality at the governance level.

The future acts of the Municipality Council and Administrative Board (see A-2), linked to the reduction of emissions, will continue to have a direct reference to the Mission.

To make local-level efforts more effective, multi-level governance is a key element of the process; this aspect too will therefore be strengthened over the next few years. At the regional level, the relationship already started with the Emilia-Romagna Region on the Mission will be of fundamental importance. In fact, the Emilia-Romagna Region has in turn begun a journey towards zero emissions and moments of discussion and collaboration have already been part of this first year. In the following years, the working tables and specific meetings related to climate issues will continue.

The working tables and agreements with national and regional authorities - see for example the Memorandum of Understanding between the 9 cities and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Sustainable Mobility described in A2.2 - launched in this year of the beginning of the path towards neutrality, will continue until 2030 in line with the path of the Mission.

Similarly, in this launch year of the Mission, the 9 Italian cities have organised themselves in an informal network to carry forward common issues in a synergistic way, such as, for example, the transition towards electrification and the consequent need to strengthen the infrastructure of the electricity grid. Also this path and the participation in the related tables will not see an interruption with the delivery of the first CCC. Furthermore, thanks to the Let'sGOv Pilot Project, of which the Municipality of Parma is a partner together with the other Italian cities selected for the mission, AESS, the University of Bologna and the Energy Center, it will be possible to understand how to best set up the work of engagement, data collection and innovative financial models to facilitate energy transition in the years to come. Within Let'sGOv, and in particular working in the thematic clusters "engagement", "data", and "finance", specific toolkits will in fact be drawn up to support the 9 cities in future data collection, the continuous involvement of the actors useful to reach the Mission goals and the definition of new financial instruments to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

# 3 Part A – Current status of climate action

## 3.1 Form A-1 Baseline GHG Emissions Inventory

The baseline below refers to the following documents:

Monitoring of the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) of the Municipality of Parma of June 2023, which updates the Monitoring Emission Inventory as of 2019, drawn up by ATES PARMA, Energy and Sustainability Territorial Agency.
Greenhouse Gas Report of the Province of Parma for the year 2019, drawn up by the University of Parma, Department of Chemical, Life and Environmental Sustainability Sciences and by the University of Siena, Department of Physical Earth and Environmental Sciences, containing the estimated emissions in the AFOLU and WASTE sectors, for the territory of the Municipality of Parma.

Furthermore, AESS developed some additions in order to complete the emission framework in accordance with the indications of the "Infokit for cities" document.

Note that table A-1.1, in order to contain all the energy carriers considered, has been split and therefore consists of two tables A-1.1.a relating to Scope 1 emissions and table A-1.1.b relating to scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions.

On the other hand, as regards the IPPU sector, net of the glass production ETS plant, the emissions linked to the pharmaceutical industry sector were considered, which, thanks to the information retrieved from discussions with stakeholders, is estimated at 22,338 tCO₂eq, as the sum of process emissions and refrigerant gas (F-gas). The company used DEFRA and IEA factors to calculate these emissions.

The baseline developed for this document refers to the following documents:

Monitoring of the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) of the Municipality of Parma of June 2023, which updates the Monitoring Emission Inventory as of 2019, drawn up by ATES PARMA, Energy and Sustainability Territorial Agency;
Greenhouse Gas Report of the Province of Parma for the year 2019, drawn up by the University of Parma, Department of Chemical, Life and Environmental Sustainability Sciences and by the University of Siena, Department of Physical Earth and Environmental Sciences, as regards the estimated emissions in the AFOLU and WASTE sectors, for the territory of the Municipality of Parma.

Furthermore, for some sectors AESS carried out some further elaborations in order to integrate the available data.

# Differences between Monitoring 2019 emissions inventory and CCC baseline

As regards **the end uses of energy**, the consumption data in MWh contained in the 2019 emission inventory template developed as part of the SECAP Monitoring were used.

For the calculation of the baseline of this CCC, the following differences are highlighted with respect to what was elaborated in the 2019 Secap monitoring:

The IPCC emission factors in tCO2eq/MWh proposed by the Covenant of Mayor Office (COMo), in ANNEX 1 – Fuel Emission Factors Database, were applied to consumption in MWh. In fact, it should be noted that the methodology of the SECAP and related monitoring referred instead to the emission factors relating to the standard IPCC for CO₂ only.

For electricity consumption, the national emission factor for 2019 was used, equal to 0.282 tCO2eq/MWh; in the SECAP monitoring instead, in accordance with the methodology proposed by the COMo, the emission factor used was equal to 0.342 tCO2/MWh obtained as a recalculation of the regional emission factor in 2004 (SECAP baseline) taking into account the production of electricity at local level.

Moreover, the following additions were made to the final energy consumption considered in the monitoring inventory:

a) **Heat from district heating**: heat from the city district heating network managed by IREN Spa was added, fuelled by waste and 30% by methane gas. Additional heat: 179.395 MWh as of 2019.

b) **Electricity and diesel consumption of the railway in the transport sector**: the electric consumption of the railway section which insists on the Municipality of Parma has been estimated, organised on four different lines: Milan-Bologna section (electrified), Parma - La Spezia section (electrified), Parma - Brescia (diesel) and Parma - Suzzara section (diesel). Overall, the consumption of 80 trips/day on the Milan-Bologna section and 60 on the section was estimated for a total electricity consumption of 2,179 MWh/year. On the other hand, as regards the diesel sections, consumption was estimated at 788.18 MWh of diesel. Both quantities were considered additional to LPT consumption.

# Additional sectors taken from the Greenhouse Gas Report of the Province of Parma for the year 2019

The data used in the CCC baseline from the Greenhouse Gas Balance of the Province of Parma for the year 2019 refer to the Waste sector and the AFOLU sector. Namely:

a) Direct emissions of CH₄ and N₂O from the **Waste sector**. They have been divided into Scope 1 (management of waste water, as the 4 purification plants that serve the city are located within the city limits) and Scope 3 (composting, landfill and organic stabilisation, as these processing phases take place in plants located outside the Municipality of Parma).

b) Direct emissions of CH₄, of CO₂ and N₂O from the **AFOLU sector**. All the emissions estimated in Scope 1 were considered, as they are produced by the farms present in the Municipality. In particular, the emissions deriving from enteric fermentation, manure management, use of urea as fertilizer, direct and indirect emissions of N₂O from the soil were considered, instead the estimate of the negative change in CO₂ emissions «change in the CO₂ stock of the soil» was omitted, postponing the assessment of the absorption potential of the various natural ecosystems to a later stage.

As far as the IPPU sector is concerned, the Greenhouse Gas Inventory of the Province of Parma for the year 2019 estimates the contribution of the production plant belonging to the glass and crystal

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

industry sector located in the city. However, it appears to be included in the ETS system and therefore to be excluded from the present baseline.

The IPPU sector instead includes the direct emissions of the pharmaceutical plant located in the Municipality of Parma.

## Baseline results

The baseline of the Parma CCC in 2019 was quantified at 1,126,647 tCO₂eq.

The general framework presents the majority of emissions, around 71%, in Scope 1 emissions generated directly within the municipal boundaries. Scope 2, on the other hand, covers 28% of emissions and is populated solely by the final uses of electricity. Instead, as regards Scope 3, equal to only 1% of total emissions, it exclusively includes emissions from the "Waste" sector as regards a small portion of waste sent to the Monte Ardone landfill, in the Municipality of Fornovo (in the province of Parma), the composting phases, and organic stabilisation. Wastewater management, on the other hand, takes place in city purifiers located within the municipal boundaries.

It should be noted that at the moment the emissions inventory considered does not include emissions from vehicular traffic outside Parma but produced by vehicles registered in the Municipality.

As regards the sectors, however, most of the emissions (about 670,316 tCO₂eq) are included in the "Buildings" category. It corresponds in fact to the Stationary Energy sector, which together with the Transport sector cover, except in some cases, the emissions of the 2019 inventory of the SECAP monitoring.

In the "buildings" sector, most of the emissions are attributable to the industrial and residential sectors.

|  BASELINE - 2019 EMISSIONS | tCO₂eq | %  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  BUILDINGS: public | 11.380 | 1%  |
|  BUILDINGS: tertiary | 151.904 | 13%  |
|  BUILDINGS: residential | 254.394 | 23%  |
|  BUILDINGS: industry | 252.639 | 22%  |
|  BUILDINGS | 670.316 | 59%  |
|  TRASPORT: municipal fleet | 282 | 0%  |
|  TRASPORT: public transport | 15.259 | 1%  |
|  TRASPORT: private and commercial transport | 229.259 | 20%  |
|  TRANSPORT | 244.800 | 22%  |
|  WASTE | 34.052 | 3%  |
|  IPPU | 22.338 | 2%  |
|  AFOLU | 155.142 | 14%  |
|  TOTAL | 1.126.647 | 100%  |

Secondly, the AFOLU, Agriculture, Forestry and other Land Uses sectors, with approximately 155,000 tCO₂eq, and the Transport sector, with approximately 133,000 tCO₂eq, are those that include the majority of emissions. Followed by the Waste sector with around 34,000 tCO₂eq, and the IPPU sector with around 22,000 tCO₂eq.

The results of the SECAP monitoring not only illustrate the baseline from which to start for the CCC but also identify the sectors of reference and to act more on to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

The "buildings" and transport sectors are those with the highest percentage of emissions in the area. Without neglecting AFOLU, IPPU and waste, the plans, strategies and all-round governance of the Municipality have concentrated and will concentrate, in these years of the Mission process, on facilitating the reduction of emissions on the territory from these two sectors.

# 3.2 Module A-2 Analysis of existing policies and strategies

For several years the Municipality of Parma has introduced a series of policies aimed at reducing emissions and climate-altering gases which have in fact made it possible to apply for the European EGCA - Green Capital Award 2022 in 2019. It can be said that the process began in 2005 with the Municipal Energy Plan, a document which provided an estimate of the main energy consumption in the city area. This estimate was the fundamental yardstick for joining the Covenant of Mayors, which requires the quantification of emissions corresponding to energy consumption.

In 2019, the Municipality adhered to the New Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, which involves a significant change compared to the previous initiative: by joining the Covenant, the signatory is no longer limited to intervening only in the energy sector, but to implement actions related to adaptation to the most extreme climatic events, such as flood risk, heat waves and droughts. Unlike previous plans, the Climate City Contract required a 360° involvement of the entire city ecosystem which includes public and private stakeholders, administration sectors, investee companies, who collaborated by sharing actions underway or to be implemented on the municipal area.

The preparation of the plan was an opportunity to align all the main municipal planning documents that could have an impact on local climate-changing emissions such as, for example, the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) and the General Urban Plan (PUG).

To give an overall picture of the work that underlies the compilation of this document, both at local, regional and national levels, a list of the policies, regulations, strategies and plans that have contributed and all is presented below. Today they contribute directly to the drafting of the CCC (Table A 2.1). The objective of this document is not the mere collection of pre-existing strategies but the need to create even greater synergies between central and local administrations for an ever stronger multi-level governance, necessary for the achievement of the climate neutrality objective.

Table A 2.2. instead shows the most recent policies and strategies in which the Municipality of Parma is even more directly involved. These policies and strategies are a key integral part of the City's strategy towards neutrality as will be further explained in Part B of this document.

Note: for easier reading of the document, table A-2.3 Emission Gap has been moved to Part B of this document.

# 3.3 Module A-3 Systemic barriers and opportunities for climate neutrality in 2030

The involvement of external stakeholders by the Municipality, including investee companies, consistently follows a co-planning process mainly in the areas of Energy, Mobility, Waste and Circular Economy, Buildings and Transversal Projects. Therefore, these actors should not be seen as individual entities involved but as part of a territorial ecosystem of subjects active in the plan to reduce climate-altering emissions. The same actors, during the co-planning phase, have also given a very significant contribution to the identification of the barriers and opportunities encountered both in some individual actions and in the sectors mentioned above.

The table below shows the reference system to which each individual stakeholder belongs, the reference network and the respective sphere of influence and interest.

Since the internal stakeholders all belong to the same "system", i.e. to the technical and/or administrative structure within the Municipality of Parma, the "system description" column has been eliminated in this case.

Similarly, considering the individual internal sectors as an integral part of a single actor, the Municipality of Parma, the influence is described through those tools that the Municipality of Parma has the ability to set up to positively affect the achievement of the zero target: definition and/or updating of Urban Plans (e.g. SUMP, PUG2050, etc.), guidelines and specific actions.

From now on, the name of the stakeholders will be anonymised with the wording "Stakeholder n°": the reference number does not identify a specific stakeholder. This choice is dictated by the need to preserve the actors involved from the dissemination of relevant sensitive information.

## A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers

The analysis of the systemic barriers encountered has been divided according to the sectors expressed by NZC.

## Efficiency improvement of municipally owned buildings

The real estate assets of the Municipality of Parma are restricted by the Superintendency to Cultural Heritage which carries out inspection and surveillance activities according to its competence, aimed at verification of the state of conservation and decorum of cultural heritage and the protection of the historic environment. The efficiency of buildings often involves massive interventions that are considered illegitimate by the institution itself. These interventions do not only concern historic buildings but also the modern ones: in this case the main barrier is represented by the cost of the intervention, often higher than the available budget or the construction of a new entire building. The inflation phenomena that has hit the Eurozone following the Covid pandemic has brought the cost of materials of the construction sector as high as many projects already in progress have been cancelled or changed in their effectiveness planning.

## Energy production

From an energy point of view, our country has faced important challenges, especially in the last year, that have directly affected local administrations. Energy is become such a strategic variable that the Municipality of Parma itself has been involved for several years in the realization of projects which have as their aim the partial energy independence of the entities involved, looking for sustainable solutions linked to photovoltaic panels and renewable energy generation plants. The geopolitical conjuncture generated by the war in Ukraine erupted in February 2022, led to a substantial increase in prices not only for raw materials relating to photovoltaic and agri-voltaic systems: many projects have seen their own expenditure budget increased to such an extent that they have been overturned or completely abandoned, despite the presence of substantial funding at European level aimed directly at this type of project and known as the acronym of PNRR. As a further limitation in the development of these projects, we should mention the legislative gaps on the subject that is still on its way of being defined: for example, the topic related to the Renewable Energy Communities (CER in italian) for which the ARERA resolution is still awaited after the most recent implementation in December 2022 of the Integrated Text on Widespread Self-Consumption (TIAD) which implements the provisions of legislative decrees 199/21 and 210/21 on renewable energy community. Furthermore, the local and national bureaucracy relating to the start of the installation of the systems, discourage good practices towards the ecological transition individual and collective. This issue is combined with the problem relating to the development of the electricity grid: for several years the operators in the sector have not concentrated actions and investments on upgrading the electricity grid which today would require important interventions and investment to support the massive electrification need of the consume.

## Mobility and transport

Within the transport sector, the most substantial issue seems to be linked to the habits of the users of the LPT (local public transport), i.e. the citizens. The lack of awareness about the transport customs by of citizens remains an issue that public entities, assisted by companies in the sector, should take into consideration if they want to achieve broad-based impact from their operations. The goal is starting from the younger generation followed by an intensive work of cross-generation involvement. This process also has to address crowding, safety and regularity issues which represent the first signs of intolerance

from the citizens side who, for these reasons, do not chose public transport. The alternatives to public transport (such as, for example, shared cars, bikes and scooter) are not exempt from problems such as, for example, availability during the hours of tip, the integration in the use of IT platforms, the road safety. Between incentives directly aimed to citizens, the one for the purchase of pedal assisted electric bikes has had some success despite, according to those who have used it, the price of the product which is excessively high despite the presence of the incentive. Therefore, the price is an important barrier for the spreading of this way of transport among citizens as an alternative choice to the city traffic. Lastly, it should be underlined the unwillingness of the transport companies on the renewal of their fleet of vehicles, given the high renewal rate that these vehicles need, above all those with electric traction with battery disposal: the replacement that is closely related with technological innovation, particularly productive in recent years, and which often risks being higher than the- normal maintenance of less technologically advanced vehicles.

## Green infrastructure

Within the projects of the Urban Greening sector, the main barrier for the development of new spaces green is the large presence of trees and woods within the Municipality with a high average age that involve an onerous maintenance plan both economically and in terms of working hours.

## Circular Economy

In the context of circular economy projects, the biggest issue remains high technology needs in the processes for the saving materials. A problem that also persists in the spreading of these innovative products that do not prevail in the market of consumers because the individual citizen is not always willing to assume its high price. Furthermore, the trend towards recovery practices is gaining ground among citizens from the bottom: these are practices at the initial phase, which involve the younger layers of the population, more sensitive to ecological issues, and more familiar with the use of digital platforms which these realities are often based on. In addition, barriers across sectors have been identified. These barriers are represented in the graph together with the barriers identified by external stakeholders, as a result of the workshop organized on 28 April 2023.

# A-3.3: Description of the participatory model for the climate neutrality of the city

The first milestone of the roadmap of the Municipality of Parma towards climate neutrality began with the city's candidacy to become European Green Capital 2022, in June 2019. Such an acknowledgement brings many benefits, including increased attention to environmental projects, increased international media coverage of the city, a boost to local pride and increased foreign investment. The winners and finalist cities also gain access to the unique European Green Capital Network, a network of 28 cities that share environmental knowledge and best practices and discuss the challenges they face and how to overcome them.

In 2017, the Municipality of Parma also launched the Parma Futuro Smart initiative, created with the aim of triggering a virtuous process with the main local stakeholders (companies, associations, universities and research centres, innovative start-ups) to co- design, co-develop and co-manage the Parma of the future: systematising the various skills and initiatives, developing a vision of the city, a roadmap and a plan of initiatives and investments to achieve the objectives of sustainability, innovation and inclusion identified in the participation process are the main drivers of this initiative which place Parma among the most modern European cities in terms of social commitment and social innovation.

In the wake of these shared processes to define a vision and strategy for a green, sustainable, intelligent and accessible city, the Municipality of Parma, together with 9 other public bodies, research bodies and associations, signed a protocol on 15 December 2020 of understanding for the birth of a territorial alliance for carbon neutrality in the entire province of Parma.

The participatory and multi-sectoral model for achieving climate neutrality was therefore already widely shared with all public and private stakeholders in the area when the city was selected among the 112 European cities that will have to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The cross-sectoral

participation of all stakeholders within the process of implementing the objectives of the Mission is the fundamental element played by the main responsible for implementing the plan, i.e. the municipality itself. The phase of involvement of the city ecosystem started with the actors who represent the industrial and economic fabric of the city but no actor has priority over another: coordination among all the elements involved represents the most correct criterion for proceeding efficiently and achieve the set goals.

The Municipality first promoted a call addressed to public bodies, associations, research centres, investee companies, private individuals, trade associations: the first held on 15 December 2022 saw the participation of 62 companies operating in the municipality of Parma. On that occasion, the municipal administration presented the "Climate Neutral City and Smart Cities" mission and collected the first feedback from the individual realities. The subsequent meeting on 28 April 2023 consolidated the key stakeholders in the project to achieve climate neutrality, as shown in table A-3.1. This was followed by various events organised by the Municipality and by the Departments involved with the aim of raising awareness about the issues and projects covered by the Plan. Among these "Fa la casa giusta", workshop organised by the Municipality of Parma in the field of social housing with the aim of presenting the state of the art on the subject and the projects in progress, held in May 2023.

The involvement of economic actors goes hand in hand with the direct involvement of citizens through thematic roundtables in the individual districts of the city: the goal is not only to make citizens aware of the administration's efforts but it must also be an opportunity to gather operational tips. The Neighbourhood Meetings organized with citizens are giving 10 councillors the opportunity to meet citizens residing in 10 different neighbourhoods. There are also numerous initiatives for the direct involvement of citizens among private stakeholders: Credit Agricole, for example, has organised a corporate volunteering group developed in collaboration with various local entities of the non-profit sector, which stimulates bank employees to carry out activities for the purpose of environmental and social protection within the territories; the Kilometro Verde Consortium involves schools of all levels with the We Tree project deals with environmental education and training. Confagricoltura too implemented a project for the dissemination of agricultural policies aimed at farms and the agrifood sector.

The Association Parma io ci sto! involved its 120 associates in a series of workshops aimed to define a concrete action plan to face the challenges of the coming years, including sustainability: the meetings took place in February and April 2023 with a final return to the city in the autumn of the same year.

# 4 Part B – The path to climate neutrality

## 4.1 Module B-1 Climate neutrality scenarios and impact scenarios

The following chapter presents, on the basis of the Theory of Change (NZC), the actions put in place by the Municipality of Parma to achieve the climate neutrality objectives. The theory serves as a source of inspiration and a tool for understanding all kinds of technological and non-technological pathways within the equity portfolio.

The actions presented in the following table have been classified on the basis of the reference field of action which corresponds to the sector they belong to, on the basis of which the individual actions in table B 2.2 and B2.1 are classified. The following list is not meant to be exhaustive of all the actions and initiatives collected: in fact, it represents a collection of macro-actions and guidelines that characterise the entire work of the stakeholders involved in achieving climate neutrality.

The classification on the basis of systemic levers highlights the impact paths that each measure can generate: this different perspective allows to evaluate the efforts sustained by all the actors involved towards a complete and integrated evaluation.

# B-1.2: Description of the impact pathways

Below are the flows of the impact pathways as per the NZC Theory of Change guidelines. The systemic levers are the starting point of the analysis and each diagram represents the impact pathway connected to a single lever. Also indicated in the single diagram:

The sectors involved for the specific systemic leverage (e.g. buildings, transport, waste, etc).
Challenges to achieve neutrality, linked to portfolio actions
Long and short term changes
Impacts and co-benefits.

Alongside the short- and long-term changes, impacts and co-benefits, there are coloured circles that represent the correspondence between the challenge and the change/impact/co-benefit.

For greater readability, the flow charts are also present in the attachment in A3 format.

In the following chapter, "Design of the climate neutrality portfolio", the challenges are resumed and associated with each individual action in order to give continuity to the application of the Theory of Change in the City's path towards neutrality. In this way it is possible to analyse the actions of the portfolio linked to the identified challenges and to the systemic levers in an integrated way.

# 4.2 Module B-2 Design of the climate neutrality portfolio

In the context of the Municipality of Parma, the working group was able to collect from the stakeholders involved a series of actions to reduce and mitigate $\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{eq}}$ emissions. The individual actions divided by type of stakeholder are presented below: the presentation of the actions is divided by internal and external stakeholders, as already presented in the previous paragraphs.

The portfolio of actions was created following a process with the stakeholders made up of public meetings, specific workshops and one-to-one insights. This has led to reasoning with the stakeholders in a synergistic way, also identifying together barriers and opportunities for the various sectors without limiting to the mere identification of the reduction of emissions and the investment of the single action.

Overall, 130 actions were collected from all the stakeholders involved, both internal and external. These actions are divided into two different types: present and future quantifiable actions and behavioural actions. Actions classified as guidelines should also be mentioned: these include actions defined by strategic plans, research and feasibility studies aimed at an action program, not yet defined and concrete but long-range and wide-ranging.

The collection of actions starts from the stimulus given by the Municipality to concentrate on the most "critical" sectors identified by the SECAP monitoring without excluding the other sectors. The most exposed sector is that of Buildings which, with the multiplicity of projects put in place by the Administration, covers a large percentage of the total actions, showing a vocation oriented towards urban regeneration based on the redevelopment of the built environment, postponed in previous years in the name the preservation of Parma's historical and artistic context. Even considering buildings with industrial and commercial purposes, we can recognise a decisive number of interventions aimed at the self-sufficiency thanks to the local production of electricity through renewable sources, thus internalising a resource, energy, which is increasingly strategic for the market.

Thanks to the presence of two investee companies of the Municipality of Parma very active in the area, TEP and SMPT Spa, the Transport sector sees important contributions aimed at the re-modernisation of the LPT fleet and citizen involvement projects for its re-appealing. Actions in this area are not unique to the stakeholders most directly involved: the renewal of the car fleet is one of the objectives of the Municipality of Parma (through the direct management of car leasing by the Maintenance sector) and of various private entities including Chiesi, as well as the presence of a consolidated network for over a decade of company Mobility Managers coordinated by the Area Mobility Manager, with the aim of coordinating municipal public actions and those of other external stakeholders, both private, corporate and public.

Furthermore, a not extremely high contribution emerges for the interventions relating to the IPPU (Industrial Processes and Product Use) area, confirming the modest industrial presence within the municipal area of Parma.

As part of the actions on AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use) it should be emphasised that the Municipality of Parma has 1,730 hectares of public green, corresponding to 88.5 square meters of green per inhabitant, managing a tree stock of over 42,000 trees: these numbers are well above the national average which, for most cities, remains below 20 trees for every 100 residents. The presence of such a large pre-existing tree and woodland allows a residual development of the projects from scratch, given the huge amount of resources already allocated for its maintenance. Therefore, with the exception of the forestation projects which will be implemented thanks to the collaboration between the Municipality and Kilometroverde, the projects submitted are mostly addressed to guide the future developments.

Finally, the actions relating to the Waste sector, due to their specificity, are mainly presented by the stakeholders who directly act in the field.

If the calculation methodology for reducing the emissions of actions is concerned, the calculation presented below refers to the same methodology used in the SECAP, net of some differences presented in the paragraph "Differences between the inventory of emissions of 2019 monitoring and CCC baseline" of Module A. The conversion factors from the so-called "activity data" to the related tCO₂eq value derive from the Covenant methodology and are also present in part A of the Action Plan.

It should be emphasised that the value of the investment per single action refers to the indicated intervention time frame which roughly corresponds to the implementation times of the project/initiative itself. Otherwise, the calculation of the CO₂eq reduction refers to the time period considered by the entire document in tonnes: the time window reaches up to 2030, therefore the reduction goes from the date of construction/implementation of the intervention up to 2030. The monitoring that will be implemented in the coming years relating to the Climate City Contract will make it possible to constantly observe the progress of all the actions and their respective impacts in terms of emissions.

Below are the tables that summarise the actions collected divided into internal, external and behavioural actions - including governance actions - of both stakeholders.

Where a N.A. (Not Available) field is filled it means that the calculation of CO₂ and/or the value of the investment has not been made available by the competent sector and/or stakeholder: the actions have in any case been considered because they are relevant. The monitoring of these projects up to 2030 guarantees their validity despite the lack of some elements detected during the Action Plan drafting.

It is important to remember that the governance actions of the Municipality of Parma are listed and described in Module A.2, in particular in table A.2.2. In Module C.1 table C-1.1 the interventions of organisational innovation and governance are presented. Both types of actions must be considered as an integral part of the Municipality of Parma's effort towards climate neutrality.

By linking to the Impact Pathways illustrated above, the individual actions of the stakeholders have been related to the systemic levers and challenges in such a way as to also illustrate their contribution to the challenges to be faced on the path towards neutrality. The challenges have been numbered from 1 to 11 and will be indicated in the following tables with their corresponding numbers. It is important to underline that some challenges (i.e. challenge # 1,2,3,4) are tackled with governance and behavioural actions in general. Challenge 5 is mainly tackled with the path started by the City on social innovation (see dedicated chapter) while challenges 10 and 11 are mainly tackled thanks to the training, information and capacity building actions already present in the area.

The data on the reduction of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{eq}}$  were provided directly by the competent offices within the Municipality of Parma.

Overall, the table shows the contribution of the public sector to the reduction of carbon dioxide equivalent in the time interval from the present drafting of the document up to 2030. The corresponding investment value for each listed action will be detailed in the Investment Plan.

The table below shows the actions for each external stakeholder involved in the emission reduction plan: given the presence of sensitive information on the projects and the consequent reduction of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{eq}}$ , the name of the stakeholders has been anonymised reporting only a non-identifying number. The same logic will also be applied in the Investment Plan. For external stakeholders, all actions, net of the first two actions of stakeholder 15 which are "carried out", have an approval level of "approved". The "approval level" column has therefore been deleted in this table.

The path towards climate neutrality, to be achieved by 2030, that the Municipality of Parma has undertaken foresees, as already seen in the previous chapters, the compulsory use of Renewable Energy Sources. Among the most immediately implemented investments, the Municipality has chosen to invest in the Renewable Energy Communities (CER) as an initial response to the problem.

A pilot project within the municipal area is the CER located in the Lubiana district which involves the following structures: Comprehensive school Albertelli-Newton as a prosumer, the Tartaruga nursery school as a consumer, the Pavese library as a consumer, the Mappamondo nursery school as a prosumer, the Residenza Anziani G.Sidoli house as a consumer and other social hosing buildings as a consumer with the possibility of new openings for the future both to public and private bodies. According to the feasibility study, the plant to be installed at Albertelli school would have a power of 224 kWp, capable of producing approximately 246,400 kWh annually, thus avoiding annual emissions of over 90 tons of CO2. Among the stakeholders involved in the project as members of the CER there are currently Proges, Azienda Casa Emilia-Romagna and any private individuals belonging to the social housing buildings. The economic framework of the intervention estimates a total of €660,000: the main share is estimated equal to €616,000 for the costs of supplying and installing the system.

Among the measures shared by stakeholders that have not been integrated to avoid double counting of emissions with respect to the SECAP, we mention the following, according to the size of the investment and the pervasive effect that these interventions entail:

In 2020, an action was launched for the installation of a trigeneration plant with an investment of around €20,000,000. The benefits relating to the environmental impacts on the area are not counted either in this document or in the SECAP update (June 2023) because it is a plant whose calculation is included in the ETS.
for the period 2021-2025 it was planned to replace 116 vehicles with vehicles powered by low-impact energy sources (methane and electricity) and with more efficient technologies in terms of consumption (Euro 6): this investment and the respective reduction in terms of CO2 has already been counted within the SECAP.
the investment for a new district heating plant of around €50,000,000 with an estimated reduction of 160,000 kWh/year was calculated in the SECAP monitoring.
For the 2020-2025 period, the SECAP included redevelopment interventions on municipal public buildings (mainly schools and sports facilities) for an overall estimated reduction of 13 tonnes of CO2 per year.

# The actions of the enhanced SECAP

For the purpose of the overall annual calculation of emissions reduction, the possible actions of the "Enhanced SECAP" were also considered (i.e. those actions of the SECAP analysed for climate neutrality by 2030 but not considered in the SECAP) which are explained below. The economic effort of each action will be specified in the Investment Plan.

Efficiency improvement of municipal buildings and public lighting

The strengthening measure to achieve the new Net Zero City objectives involves purchasing electricity only from sources with a guarantee of renewable origin and thereby encouraging the installation of new RES plants at municipal level. The reduction estimate is around 3,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.

Efficiency of the non-municipal tertiary sector

The Administration considers the electrification of heating systems for tertiary sector users and the consequent development of building envelopes as a strategic action. These interventions envisage savings of 1,020 tonnes of CO2 per year within the 2023-2030 time frame.

Efficiency of the residential sector

This strengthening action reflects the characteristics of the previous one with the exception that the field of action is that of residential buildings. In this case the estimated reduction in enhanced energy saving is equal to 48,000 MWh which includes thermal energy for cooking and diesel for heating. The reduced tons of CO2 are around 6,000 per year.

Development of renewable sources

In quantitative terms, a reduction of 221,208 tonnes of CO2 is expected.

# Behavioural and governance measures as a contribution to reducing emissions:

Behavioural actions have a significant impact on consumption, can be applied on a large scale and often do not require an initial economic investment. Thanks to behavioural change, new spaces can be created where the various actors are able to collaborate synergistically for the transition. Behavioural actions are for example training/information and awareness-raising interventions of citizens, strategies of the Municipality, etc. These represent a fundamental element in changing the mentality of citizens and making them aware of the issue of energy and environmental sustainability. It is commonly believed that this role should be played mainly by the public administration but the role of the private sector and the synergy of the actions put in place with respect to the public sector represents an important added value that guarantees greater participation and awareness of all citizens.

As shown in the table below (ref. European Environment Agency) the potential energy savings due to behavioural measures can vary from a minimum of 2% to a maximum of 20%. The governance actions of the Public Administration are considered behavioural actions.

Considering the actions of the Municipality of Parma and the additional behavioural actions of external stakeholders, it has been estimated, based on the table below and following the item "combination of interventions", that the contribution to the reduction of climate-altering emissions in the area could be equal to 12% of the baseline value.

# The strategies of the Municipality of Parma for residual emissions

In order to reduce the so-called residual emissions$^{6}$, the Municipality of Parma will pursue, in future years, the following strategies already started and partly presented in the framework of governance measures, directly quantifiable measures and behavioural measures.

We want to underline that Parma is planning to identify the ways to abate the residual emissions in the future Action plans by 2030 identifying additional actions within the following seven main strategies.

Electrification of the territory
Planning
Mobility
Resource circularity
Food policy
Forestation
Education and training

# Overall tables and diagrams of emissions reduction

The overall results of the action portfolio for the reduction of climate-changing emissions are represented in diagrams and tables below.

The values of the "Emission gap" are also presented, as per table A-2.3 inserted here to facilitate the reading of the document.

As regards the overall Emissions Gap, the scenario of "residual emissions" was taken into consideration: NZC defines a maximum of residual emissions - considered as those emissions that cannot be abated by the territory - of 20%.

Considering the "15% residual emissions" scenario, the emission gap to be addressed in the Action Plan is equal to 41% compared to the baseline emissions. The remaining 44% is already addressed in the existing SECAP strategy.

Considering the portfolio of actions for climate neutrality and the contribution, in terms of reducing emissions, given by behavioural actions, the remaining delta of the emission gap is zero.

This means that to date, the first year of the CCC process, the emissions still to be abated are a total of 15% of the baseline and exactly the residual ones defined by the CCC.

Strengthened by the results obtained and the strategies identified for residual emissions (see previous paragraph), the Municipality of Parma feels it can at this point become a Net Zero City by 2030. This also considering any increases in emissions of the BAU scenario for the next few years.

|  Emission Gap | Total tCo2eq/year | Value in percentage  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Baseline emissions | 1,126,647.43 | 100%  |
|  Residual emissions/compensation | 168.997,11 | 15%  |
|  Baseline emission reduction target | 957,650.32 | 85%  |
|  Emissions reductions in existing strategies | 494,418.40 | 44%  |
|  Emission gap to be addressed in the Action Plan | 463,231.92 | 41%  |
|  Emission gap addressed in the Action Plan | 466,467.93 | 41%  |
|  Delta GAP | -3,235.72 | 0%  |

# 4.3 Module B-3 Indicators for monitoring, evaluation and learning

This chapter presents a follow up of the analysis included in the Impact Pathways section by highlighting a set of metrics and indicators useful for monitoring and evaluating the actions implemented by the Municipality of Parma.

The approach follows the definition of the macro-actions exposed on the basis of the systemic levers defined by the Theory of Change: 28 KPIs have been defined whose current reference values are partially available to date since they are mostly recent actions, implemented in the light of the guidelines defined by the NZC. The added value of this section lies precisely in its future usability for the years to come: the reference target values reported for the years 2025, 2027 and 2030 represent an estimate of what can be expected in terms of technological improvements, infrastructure and sensitivity of the entire city ecosystem towards the issues of carbon neutrality.

The distinction between direct or indirect impact refers to a direct reduction of climate-changing emissions, therefore quantifiable in tons of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, rather than its indirect reduction, through transversal actions and interventions such as behavioural ones which aim at a greater awareness about environmental and sustainability issues. As can be seen from the following report, most of the indicators to be monitored are of an indirect and transversal type: in fact, the aim was to diversify the indicators subject to monitoring with respect to those already present in the SECAP so as to avoid double counting on different databases.

The availability of data, especially for qualitative data, represents an important challenge for all public administrations in Italy: the objective of this document and of the indicators themselves is precisely to sensitize the public administration itself directly to the importance of collection, analysis and continuous monitoring of data referring to the actions put in place, in order to ensure continuous improvement of the interventions and the overall perceived benefits. It is important that the awareness-raising process also touches all the stakeholders involved so that there is coordination and agreement in the collection of data and synergy in the medium and long-term objectives.

Attached is a summary table of monitoring indicators according to the NZC model.

# 5 Part C – Making climate neutrality possible by 2030

Part C "Enabling climate neutrality by 2030" aims to outline the enabling interventions, i.e. related to organisational or collaborative governance models, or to social innovation, designed to support and enable the climate action portfolios also described in the Module B-2, and to achieve the co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Form B-1).

# 5.1 Module C-1 Organisational innovation and governance interventions

With reference to chapters A-2 and B-2, the organisational and governance interventions put in place by the Municipality of Parma as complementary to the directly quantifiable emissions mitigation actions are presented below. These actions should not be underestimated in their effectiveness as they demonstrate the emission reduction path that the city is undertaking. Given the temporal horizontality of the project, their transversality is of great importance for a global involvement of the entire city ecosystem. The co-benefits that these actions bring with them go far beyond the single action, also and above all with a view to cultural change in the habits of individual citizens. In the framework of Module B, these actions fall within the set of behavioural/governance actions that contribute to the reduction of emissions.

# C-1.2: Description of the organisation and governance interventions - textual and visual elements

In addition to the interventions described above which have a purely local level of governance, we recall the table in chapter A-2 in which the strategies were presented at a regional, national and transversal level in which the administration participates, being able to have a direct impact.

If at the local level the horizontal governance starts from the Municipality of Parma and affects either within it or towards all citizens and the various sectors of the city, multi-level governance sees the inter-relationships between the Municipality itself and: the Emilia-Romagna Region, the other Italian cities that applied for the Mission, the central administrations, and other relevant institutions at regional and national level (e.g. GSE, ANCIER, etc.).

# 5.2 Module C-2 Social and other innovative interventions

In the path towards climate neutrality it is important that the actors in the forefront of the implementation of the plan recognise the need to develop strategies that adapt to the local context in which they operate, also favouring the participation of citizens themselves, developing and promoting tools, resources and skills that constitute a stimulus. In line with this logic, the Municipality of Parma dedicated an entire day of workshops to social innovation in which various actors already involved in the ecosystem of the mission took part.

The main socio-cultural factors on which social innovation is called to answer are:

Greater attention to the events organised by the Public Administration and by the city government bodies in the role of facilitator and enabler; with this in mind, rethink the methods of involvement (more captivating and aimed at segments of the young population..)
Attention towards a conscious use of natural resources and dissemination of good recycling, recovery and saving practices
Inclusion towards marginalised social groups through events that bring together different cultures and underline the aspects of closeness.

In order to develop specific strategies for the City of Parma and support the development of capacities to stimulate systemic change, on 22 June 2023 the Municipality of Parma and Net Zero Cities organised the event "Towards the Climate Contract of the City of Parma". In addition to exposing the current state of affairs with respect to the elaboration of the CCC of the City of Parma, the event was aimed at:

exploring the concept of social innovation for climate neutrality;
clarifying the crucial role that social innovation plays in drafting climate contracts.

The event was structured with a first part of a presentation that illustrated the process of drafting climate contracts, the actions undertaken and future ones, by the Municipality of Parma, followed by a presentation on social innovation by the representatives of Net Zero Cities. After this first session, the workshop continued with a second part of work on four separate tables, whose discussions and exercises were facilitated by the experts. A third part of results sharing and conclusion by the Councillor for Environmental, Energy and Mobility Sustainability Gianluca Borghi.

We attach the results of the workshop, to be considered as part of module C-2.

As an integral part of the social innovation interventions implemented this year, it is good to also remember what has been illustrated in the previous paragraphs, namely in chapter A-3.3 "Description of the participatory model for climate neutrality in the city" Module C-3 Financing of the portfolio of actions

Table C-3.1 of the Action Plan model, has been eliminated in order not to complicate the reading since the investment values of the individual actions have already been presented in Module B.

The Investment Plan will resume these values by analysing the complex framework of the costs and investments necessary for climate neutrality by 2030 in depth.

# 6 Outlook and next steps

## Plans for the next CCC iteration and Action Plan – text elements

As already presented in chapter 2.2., the sustainability of the Action Plan to 2030 will see some key points which we list below:

The Municipality of Parma will continue to strengthen the path towards climate neutrality both through new measurable actions and thanks to the continuous and ever greater alignment of governance towards a zero-emission city. It will also keep its pivotal role in the involvement of external actors, including citizens. The path of social innovation already started will continue in future years bringing even more results from the point of view of citizens' involvement.

As far as the portfolio of actions is concerned, Parma will continue both with an enlargement of the audience of CCC players - and therefore with the collection of new and further actions - and with the monitoring of the actions presented to date. Continuous dialogue with stakeholders will be essential for the success of the Plan also in future years.

Parma towards the Climate City Contract

NET ZERO CITIES

# 1 Introduction

The Net Zero Cities project aims to support European cities in drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions through climate actions aimed at achieving 'climate neutrality', one of today's major societal challenges. Net Zero Cities recognizes the need for cities to develop specific strategies that adapt to local and regional challenges, for this reason they support and promote tools, resources and skills. In short, it is necessary that the city recognizes social innovation as a key element in the path towards climate neutrality. A key element to achieve climate neutrality is the development of climate-neutral citizen contracts (CCCs) including plans for social innovation. This processing can be developed:

Create enabling platforms and access points for different stakeholders to contribute to the transition towards sustainability, making the achievement of the mission a distributed social outcome.
Responding to emerging needs of communities, for example through policies that include vulnerable social groups in renewable energy schemes.
Integrate social innovation into the city's portfolio to ensure inclusiveness.

In order to develop specific strategies for the City of Parma and to support the capacity building to stimulate systemic change, on 22th June 2023 the Municipality of Parma and Net Zero Cities organized the event "Towards the Climate Contract of the City of Parma". The event, beside an update about the status of the elaboration of the CCC of the City of Parma, was aimed at:

exploring the concept of social innovation for climate neutrality;
clarifying the crucial role that social innovation plays in drafting climate contracts.

The first part of the event was devoted to a presentation of the process of drafting the city climate contract, the actions undertaken and future ones, by the Municipality of Parma, a first glimpse of social innovation by the representatives of Net Zero Cities consortium; a second part of work on four separate tables, whose discussions and exercises were facilitated by the experts; a third part of results sharing and conclusion by the Deputy Mayor for Environmental sustainability, Energy and Mobility Sustainability Gianluca Borghi.

This document summarizes the findings of the four round table session. On the tables, the first part of the discussion was focused on deepening the concept of social innovation by developing a shared definition. The second part was focused on defining a specific challenge "How can the city of Parma include the path towards climate neutrality?"

# 2 Shared definition of social innovation

The tables defined the concept of social innovation as a cultural transition that must take place at a systemic level for the city of Parma. Those present at the various tables described social innovation as a process that can and should be used to produce crucial changes for climate neutrality. For the development of this transition, the participants identified some crucial strategies such as the engagement of various stakeholders, the co-planning of the process with the citizens also aimed at identifying what are the concrete actions that the citizens themselves can undertake. Furthermore, it was indicated that guidance on these actions through clear and easy to capture communications is crucial for the transformation that must occur through the described transition.

# LOCAL LEVEL: CHALLENGE DEFINITION

## CHALLENGE

Which is the local challenge?

How can the city of Parma include social innovation in the path towards climate neutrality?

Systematize all existing projects in the area
communication between subjects (not just companies)
sharing good practices
organize sustainability clubs

Bureaucracy slows down change; difficulty in realizing projects (e.g. energy communities)
it can be used in networks to bypass bureaucracy (e.g. PPP, University of Parma, activate citizens through structured voluntary activities)

## NEEDS

Which are the main social needs to deal with?

Explain why needs are important and to whom they are relevant

Supporting companies in workers' training (they are already aware): a change in production and/or reconversion of the business is needed:
costs
time
disruptions during change (e.g. schools)

We need the involvement of citizens/collaborators/consumers:
measure impacts and communicate them emotionally (CO2 Kg=# trees)
measure participation in change
view consumption e.g. home footprint app to understand how much CO2 you save for each action)
project sustainability report

## SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ISSUE

Which are the main social and cultural issue based on this challenge?

Socio-cultural issues are the lifestyles and values that characterize a community. For example education, language, law and politics, religion and beliefs, social organizations, technology and material culture, values and attitudes.

Citizens are not very involved:
starting from schools to being part of the cultural change
pilot projects (living labs) in universities
policies are needed even if initially not popular (traffic and parking restrictions, credits for those who use public transport)
It is necessary to underline the awareness-raising and structured sharing of good practices in the company (e.g. when to open/close, access/turn off
leave employees/users a margin of choice (e.g. thermostat +/-2 degrees)

# 1 Introduction

The City of Parma embraced the ambitious challenge of the European Mission of the 100 climate neutral and smart cities by 2030 as the natural evolution of the growing commitment and figures of initiatives and investments aimed at sustainability and the reduction of emissions of the Municipality of Parma and its community of citizens, and social, economic and research organizations.

Parma sees the effects of climate change, and feels the urgency to act: there is a clear and unique vision that the whole territory needs to pay more and more attention on the importance and urgency of adopting policies, actions, investments and behaviors, both individual and collective, aimed at greater respect for the environment and a reduction of emissions.

Parma is based in the Po Valley, featuring an intense human activity that contributes to the high concentration of polluting sources. The joining of the Covenant of Mayors in 2013 and the implementation of SEAP 2014 was a key turning point for Parma in applying the green principles to the entire governance action. Since then, Parma decided to start a series of wide-ranging measures and actions, actively involving civil society and businesses, which led ten years later to join the Mission in order to intercept the efforts of an entire territory already devoted to green and sustainability, creating a solid foundation to achieve the radical transformation we need in the next seven years.

The Mission is intended to become an instrument to promote and accelerate in a coordinated way a further effort by the community within the major areas of intervention: the decisive reduction (up to zero) of the consumption of fossil fuels for transport, industrial uses and air conditioning of buildings; a sharp increase of the production of energy from renewable sources; the strengthening of the paths already started in urban forestry and biodiversity, in energy efficiency of buildings and production processes and in circular economy, with the aid of digital transformation on the transition of entire sectors.

This commitment therefore wants to highlight the joint effort of the Municipality of Parma and its stakeholders in accelerating the pace towards climate neutrality by 2030 through policies, actions, investments, in a shared governance of responsibilities and efforts.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Climate neutrality is a goal Parma intends to tackle immediately, inspired by the vision of a conscious, attractive, efficient, and competitive city. Becoming a climate-neutral city is hence regarded as a critical effect of a broader vision and not an isolated aim; it requires painstaking efforts to enhance cultures, capacities, processes, infrastructures, and technologies.

Parma aims to reach a reduction of the 41% thanks to the actions contained in the Action Plan by 2030 (and additional to the ones already included in the SECAP). This is a long-term commitment, fully supported by the Municipality and around 50 organisations which collectively gathered more than 130 different action to have an impact on the emissions produced by the whole city.

Parma focus is not only the emission reduction: the advantages of the climate transition are not confined solely to the environment, yet sustainability creates value for the economy and society. The paradigm shift of climate transition offers a huge opportunity to boost economic well-being, employment growth, and the social development of our local community. The highest goal of our climate neutrality strategy remains in the well-being of the community, allowing Parma to be greener,

smart and accessible to all. Enabling citizens to benefit from transition opportunities will mark the success of our efforts and the future of our city.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

A coordinated and strategic approach among different actors is necessary in order to prioritize these actions across different scales. The key systemic priorities that Parma needs to face to speed up climate transition are:

the development of local production of renewable energies: electricity generated by renewables is the pivotal energy vector in leading the energy transition towards decarbonisation;
the increase of buildings energy efficiency: in a densely built urban area, the increase of the rate of renovations of private, public and industrial buildings is key to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions
the raise of a circular paradigm: a responsible approach to the use of resources accelerates processes such as digitalization and electrification, makes consumption more efficient and develops innovative services to reduce environmental impact.
the promotion of a systemic education to sustainability: an informed, active and engaged community is the enabler of a maximised impact of energy efficiency measures, therefore a cross cutting priority is provide training and skills development programmes to equip all citizens to participate in the net zero economy.

The Action Plan of the City of Parma comprises all the priorities as well as further actions that will enable our city to reach climate neutrality by 2030.

# 4 Principles and process

Three cardinal principles are driving our joint efforts towards climate neutrality:

Shared responsibility: public and private sector actors need to be systemically brought together to create the local ecosystem to further catalyse sustainable and socially acceptable projects and investments;
Innovation: today's early stage technologies will further amplify the impact climate transition projects, therefore the deployment at scale of a range of climate-neutral technologies will enable a rapid, sustainable and deep energy transitions across all sectors in the medium and long run
People-centred and inclusive transition: sustainability is the best approach through which to improve people's health and wellbeing, improving both the quality of air and life in our city. This includes social, environmental and economic impacts on individuals and communities, as well as issues of affordability and fairness.
