Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# 1 Introduction

The introduction should outline the local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and describe the gap it is addressing in broad terms.

With its climate protection concept adopted in 1992, the city of Heidelberg was one of the first cities in Germany to have a systematic plan for climate protection at the local level, backed up by measures. Under the motto "think globally - act locally," decisive steps were taken in the 1990s to set the course for municipal climate protection. In 1997, this also included the establishment of a local energy consulting service, which today has expanded its sphere of activity as the Heidelberg and Rhine-Neckar District Climate Protection Agency and supports municipalities and the citizens of the entire region in their climate protection efforts.

Influenced by the international sustainability debate, the Enquete Commission of the German Bundestag, and the conferences in Aalborg and Rio, the goals of Heidelberg's climate protection and CO2 reduction were also incorporated into the city's sustainability strategy, the Urban Development Plan, in 1997.

Supplemented by the energy concept and the transport development plan, as well as numerous updates, Heidelberg has succeeded in anchoring climate protection programmatically and financially in many of the city's departments, as well as motivating external actors to actively protect the climate. Most recently, the establishment of a separate department for climate protection, the environment and mobility in 2020 strengthened the organizational anchoring of climate protection in the administration.

An important milestone in Heidelberg's climate protection process is the "100 % Climate Protection Master Plan" adopted by the municipal council in 2014 and updated in 2019. In this approach to climate neutrality 2050, which was funded by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment and developed in exchange with 40 municipalities, Heidelberg was able to adopt climate protection strategies as a model municipality, which had previously been developed in a comprehensive participation process.

Other innovative approaches and bundles of measures complement Heidelberg's efforts towards climate protection and sustainability. These include, for example, the Sustainable Business Network with its focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, the city administration's energy concept for its own properties, the heat transformation path, and green district heating.

In 2019, the climate emergency was declared and the Climate Action Plan 2020 was adopted. This accelerated the implementation of measures and politicians set the financial course for consistent climate protection.

Heidelberg started the process of "Green recovery" as part of the C40 network 2020.

Heidelberg's brought-forward climate neutrality target arose from the target debate surrounding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 and the updated neutrality targets of the German federal government and the state of Baden-Württemberg. The climate protection law of the Federal Republic of Germany was brought forward to the year 2045 with the decision in June 2021. The climate protection law in Baden-Württemberg aims to achieve net greenhouse gas neutrality gradually by 2040.

In July 2022, the Heidelberg City Council passed the following resolution: The City of Heidelberg undertakes to work consistently towards the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 in all fields of action and to give priority to climate protection in line with its participation in the EU mission "climate-neutral and smart cities". Complete climate neutrality according to the municipal BISKO accounting is to be achieved by 2040 at the latest. For the city administration, in particular the municipal properties, the aim is to achieve the greatest possible climate neutrality by 2030.

Heidelberg's climate neutrality policy is embedded in the historical and environmental policy context described here, on which the membership and activities in the EU mission project "100 climate-neutral and smart cities" are based.

The decision of the municipal council to participate in the EU-Mission project leads to an acceleration of the implementation of measures in the municipality, the closing of ranks of local actors, the linking of fields of action and thus a restructured and systematic approach to the transformation of society combined with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

# 2 Work Process

This section should list the working steps carried out, for example along the NZC Climate Transition Map, or related steps planned as well as outline timeline and milestones for future iterations for the continuous development of the Action Plan.

## Build a strong mandate

The City of Heidelberg has a long history of climate action since its first climate protection concept in 1992. However, being part of the EU Mission “100 climate neutral and intelligent cities” is of great importance for the City to accelerate climate action. The first step was the council’s decision in June 2022 to work consistently towards the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 in all fields of action and to give priority to climate protection. After that, the municipality was in a position to start. The first step was to set up a steering committee within the city administration to ensure that climate protection is mainstreamed across key departments. The steering committee now meets on a regular basis. Secondly, the already existing Mayor’s Climate Action Group, which includes some of Heidelberg’s key stakeholders, was informed and involved in the mission’s process. In addition, a broader range of companies and organisations are planned to be involved in the mission’s process. Therefore, the city offered the opportunity to sign a cooperation agreement to be part of the mission and to signal the will to pull together.

The City of Heidelberg is active in many networks on regional, national and international levels, such as for example Städtetag Baden-Württemberg, deutscher Städtetag, Klimabündnis, C40, GCM or Energy Cities (https://www.heidelberg.de/hd/HD/Leben/Netzwerke.html). The exchange between these cities is important to learn from each other and to have a political representation at different levels of government. The EU Mission is another essential network that allows Heidelberg to build strong relations with other European and German lead cities, especially on the Mission Platform and at personal meetings. The nine German cities have set up a bi-weekly call in order to share their experiences and progresses in the mission. Moreover, there is an exchange between the German mission cities and the German Government.

## Understand the system

The City of Heidelberg monitors its GHG emissions on a regular basis by a BISKO CO2-balance. For the Climate City Contract, Heidelberg uses the data from 2019 to not take advantage of the outlier Corona-years. The CO2-balance shows the gap of the different sectors to reach climate neutrality.

As climate protection had been a major topic in Heidelberg since the 1990s many connections and relationships have been made across administration departments and other stakeholders. However, there still exist some systemic barriers that need to be unveiled. This is what the climate city contract is helpful for. Furthermore, Heidelberg will identify within the contract the most important levers of change to reach climate neutrality by 2030. The contract also unpacks the strategy for financing the actions needed.

## Co-design a portfolio

Cities and municipalities play an important role in the development and implementation of climate protection measures. This applies to their own administrative organisation, but also to other areas within their own sphere of influence.

There are many fields of action that municipalities can influence directly and indirectly, for example in the area of municipal infrastructure or municipal enterprises. Furthermore, municipalities are the interface to citizens, the local economy or social and cultural institutions. In addition to their own climate neutrality, the provision of climate-friendly supply and transport infrastructures, urban development, refurbishments or information and funding offers are possible levers. Overall, municipalities have a great influence on greenhouse gas emissions. They occupy a key position in climate protection.

Within the fields of action in climate protection, a municipality can take on various roles. They can be active as consumers and role models, suppliers and providers, planners and regulators, as well as advisors and promoters. Depending on the role of the municipality, its influence on greenhouse gas reduction potentials differs: as a consumer, for example, it is the cause of greenhouse gas emissions and can exert direct influence on the future consumption of its own properties, while in other areas it can exert influence more through regulation and consultation.

O

In July 2022, the municipal council passed a resolution for a climate-neutral administration for Heidelberg in 2030.

In the case of city properties such as schools, administrative buildings, day-care centres and other operational facilities such as the professional fire brigade, the positive effects of Heidelberg's climate protection over many years are becoming apparent. Final energy consumption has already been reduced by 65 percent.

The EU Mission is thus not a task only for the municipality but also for all civil stakeholders, organisations and companies in Heidelberg. Therefore, there will be an accompanying transition group with all these stakeholders to start and implement climate protection measures and interventions. The contract shows financing options and allows to estimate co-benefits and impacts. To ensure long-term implementation it is important that Heidelberg simultaneously adapts policies and regulations.

The Climate City Contract is regularly updated so that an iteration process takes place every two years. By regularly renewing the Climate City Contract, new findings, adapted framework conditions and regulations as well as technological developments can be taken into account. In particular, measures from other planning processes, such as the Climate Mobility Plan, are incorporated. In this way, a dynamic plan is created that can be developed together with existing and new actors and citizen participation.

The map below shows Heidelberg's city boundaries, covering around  $109\mathrm{m}^2$ . This area is addressed by the action plan. Moreover the land use is pictured (subdivided into Power plant, railroad facility (existing), area for fillings and excavations (existing), area for protection, maintenance and development measures, area for supply and disposal (existing), area for public use (existing), mixed construction area (existing), commercial construction area (existing), green area (existing), harbor/water management, special construction area (existing), special construction area (planning), traffic area (existing), residential construction area(existing), residential construction area (planning)).

For the year 2030 0.270 t CO2 equivalent per MWh final energy is assumed (https://www.kea-bw.de/waermewende/wissensportal/technikkatalog). Based on historical data and forecasts, assumptions are made about how the energy mix for electricity generation will evolve by 2030. This includes expectations for increased use of renewable energy sources (wind, solar, hydro) and reduced use of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas). Nevertheless, this is accompanied by risks in case the assumption is not being met. If the emission factor remains higher than expected Heidelberg's climate neutrality goals might not be met. Therefore it might become indispensable to reevaluate the city's emission reduction strategies to still meet the goal. Moreover, if the city relies on country-wide renewable energy sources, a failure to achieve the emissions factor target may require a reassessment of the feasibility of local sufficiency concepts. Consequently, Heidelberg has to reassess its renewable energy potential and consider expanding renewable energy capacity to compensate for higher emissions from grid electricity.

## A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

The majority of Heidelberg's GHG emissions are energy-related and fall into the areas of buildings (65%) and transportation (33%). Heidelberg's electricity supply accounts for 37% of emissions and its heat supply for 29%. Fuels are responsible for 31% of emissions. Waste and Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) account for a total of 2.5% of Heidelberg's emissions.

## A-2.2: Description &amp; assessment of policies

Federal and state regulations provide the framework for municipal action. Climate protection and climate adaptation must be given strong weight in all sectoral laws and planning directives, with clearly defined goals and instruments to support municipal efforts and enable legally secure implementation. An intensive dialogue between the federal, state and local governments on the legal framework and legal changes in sectoral laws and ordinances is necessary for the reduction of barriers and effective climate protection.

# A-3.2:

A significant increase in population is forecast for the city of Heidelberg. More than 25,000 additional citizens are expected by 2035.

The city of Heidelberg decided on the future development of housing construction with the Building Land Programme Housing (2017). This programme sets a target of 800 flats per year. The areas actively controlled by the city include the former military properties as well as Bahnstadt. In total, more than 12,000 new flats are planned. This means that significant increases in residential space can be expected in the coming years compared to the years before.

One important reason why absolute CO2 emissions in Heidelberg are not falling more significantly is precisely this growth in population. It is obvious to analyse this by looking at the per capita emissions. In 1987, these were just under 9.8 tonnes per capita, in 2017 they were 6.8 tonnes per capita. This corresponds to a reduction of 30 %. A great success, but it must be taken into account that CO2 emissions do not increase or decrease linearly with the number of inhabitants. The number of public facilities, such as the size of the university, municipal buildings, such as the state buildings, or the number of commercial and industrial enterprises is also responsible for the level of CO2 emissions, and does not directly depend on the influx of new citizens. Furthermore, all sectors continue to be equipped with electrical consumers. Increasing air-conditioning of buildings and increasing digitalisation with decentralised IT equipment are still causing a slight increase in electricity consumption. Nevertheless, the high per capita reduction also shows the success of Heidelberg's climate protection policy to date.

An increase in the number of inhabitants from 2017 by a further 15,000 to 175,000 would, according to a simple calculation, cause an additional 100,000 tonnes of CO2. After differentiated consideration (taking into account efficient housing), there would still be approx. 38,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions if calculated on the basis of 2017. The additional emissions of new residents can only be drastically reduced through consistent plus-energy standards for new neighbourhoods and flats, reduction of living space and extensive use of environmental transport.

Necessary framework conditions for successful climate protection in municipalities

In order to achieve the goal of climate neutrality, the creative power of municipalities is not sufficient. Additional support from outside is necessary, and framework conditions must be created by the EU level, the federal government and the federal states to support municipalities in effective climate protection. Targets for energy and environmental policy are set at the EU level. Clear, reliable regulations help national policy and thus also the municipalities. Beyond the targets, various directives also set the course for climate protection at the municipal level. At present, the EU's framework is still quite broad; significantly more ambitious targets for the EU member states would lend greater weight to climate protection.

The German government advocates a target triad of greenhouse gas reduction, expansion of renewable energies and energy efficiency. A climate policy should strengthen the municipalities in their role as central shapers of the energy transition. The federal and state governments should support municipal decision-makers in consolidating the success of municipal climate action. It needs political willingness and explicit support at all political levels - without bypassing the principle of subsidiarity. This manifests itself not only in long-term goals, but also in concrete measures that set the energy and climate policy framework.

Tax incentives for investments in energy efficiency and renewable energies create suitable economic incentives in conjunction with a further design of the financial support programmes. This benefits energy efficiency in particular (e.g. building renovation), which has so far lagged significantly behind the targets. The promotion of renewable energies should be given a reliable long-term framework. At the municipal level, the simplification for owner-users of solar electricity is a driver for the further expansion of solar energy. There is still a lot of potential here. An amendment to the Renewable Energy Sources Act is needed that abolishes the burden on self-consumption of renewable electricity. A federal climate protection law is urgently needed that gives climate protection a clear legal position in all relevant fields of action and provides for interactions with existing laws in the building sector, urban development and spatial planning, the energy industry, mobility and agriculture.

The federal states can make specifications through state legislation that directly affect municipalities and cities. For example, they could declare climate protection as a goal for municipalities within the framework of municipal ordinances (or municipal constitutions) or within the framework of state climate protection concepts (NRW, Baden-Württemberg). It would be possible and sensible to stipulate climate protection as a mandatory task (at least for precisely defined areas) at the state level, but in the political discussion the danger is often pointed out that federal funding programmes (municipal guidelines) can then no longer be used, as mandatory tasks may not be funded.

case of wind power, on the one hand the obstacles in the approval procedures are too high, on the other hand the resistance from the citizens is a great challenge. Here, a simplified participation model for citizens' wind farms and guaranteed financial returns for site communes could ensure new acceptance.

Achieving the climate protection goals does not only depend on the municipality. An interplay of different levels (EU, federal government, state, municipality) is necessary to achieve climate neutrality in Heidelberg. As part of a research project commissioned by the Federal Environment Agency on the impact potential of municipal climate protection measures, ifeu investigated the possibilities for municipalities to influence CO2 reduction. The research project showed that the proportion of emissions that can be influenced depends strongly on the circumstances of the municipality, e.g. its size, existing actors (e.g. municipal utilities, housing associations) and the energy infrastructure. Within the framework of the project, four areas of influence were defined, each of which was graded by the strength of the possibility of influence.

However, it is essential for municipalities to better assess in the future which possibilities they have to reduce their own energy and CO2 balance.

![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)

percent of the emissions are in area 4 (advising &amp; motivating). The emissions in this sphere of influence can be addressed in particular through measures such as neighbourhood concepts, information campaigns and support programmes. Around 1/4 of the emissions are in area 2a (supply &amp; offer). The implementation of heat planning is the central measure to reduce CO2 emissions in this area. Another 4% of the emissions are in areas 1 and 1a (consumption and example). The total emissions in these areas can be directly influenced by the energy refurbishment of the municipal properties and the residential buildings of the GGH..

# A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

## Successful participation in climate protection

To achieve sustained success climate protection needs to be an integral aspect in all decisions on investment, purchase and management of companies, public organisations and private households. This needs knowledge and awareness about relevance and chances of individual action. Opportunities for climate protection include, in particular, cost savings, security of supply, improvements in the quality of life, employee motivation, public image and new market opportunities. Thus awareness raising and participation processes play a key role in the successful planning and implementation of municipal climate protection measures in Heidelberg. The main goals are motivating for climate action, develop common strategies, identify best solutions and develop new business cases for sustainable products and services.
Heidelberg

Furthers aims are to integrate the technical and economic know-how of selected social stakeholders in order to close knowledge gaps and improve the quality of concept and measure planning. On the other hand, the active involvement of the various stakeholders raises awareness of the municipality's climate protection goals and measures at an early stage, and their concerns and suggestions are incorporated into the design of the measures. In this way, the subsequent implementation of the measures is promoted. Acceptance or even identification with the climate protection goals and measures of the municipality are thus central goals of participation processes.

For the selection of the formats and the addressing of the actors it is also important, which motivation / which self-interest has the target group

in the topic of climate protection? For example:

Cost savings through energy efficiency measures,
positive image in the public,
Increase of awareness,
improvement of their own quality of life

When addressing stakeholders, Heidelberg prioritises according to the following criteria.

![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)

# High relevance / High interest:

These stakeholders are closely involved in the process, as described below. The cooperation in the different formats builds on close contacts and a trusting cooperation in which objections or wishes are taken seriously and discussed together.

High relevance / Low interest: As this group of actors is crucial for the success of the project, this group of actors is specifically addressed with topics through which they can gain access to climate protection. It is also important to develop an awareness of which of their interests are contrary to the municipality's climate protection efforts and why this is the case. one example is the Climate Action Group led by the Mayor is the Goal. He is a door opener and motivator for participation, especially for this group of actors. Stakeholders with high interest but low relevance are regularly informed by the City of Heidelberg about climate protection activities (e.g. climate protection newsletter) and have the opportunity for low-threshold participation in suitable circumstances. Examples here are events with participatory offers (e.g. quizzes). This ensures that they feel included and recognised as actors in the process. This in turn helps to prevent any resistance to planned measures.

Low relevance / Low interest: For these actors, we make a point of keeping them in mind and informing them about the process or project as soon as they show interest.

Depending on the competencies and responsibilities, stakeholders are involved in accelerating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors,. This means:

Emissions from fossil fuel combustion in all buildings and facilities (so-called "stationary energy"). This includes residential, commercial and industrial buildings as well as municipal buildings, properties and

public lighting within the city limits; climate neutrality, as defined by ifeu, requires the complete replacement of all fossil fuels for heat supply, primarily through district heating and heat pumps.
Emissions from fossil fuel combustion for all vehicles and transport within the city limits; a focus must be on measures to reduce emissions from commuter traffic, especially a strong expansion of public transport in the region, incentives to switch to zero-emission drives and bicycles, but also city tolls or vehicle/parking space levies must be investigated.
Emissions from consumption of electricity and district heating/cooling within the city boundary, from power plants within or outside the city boundary;
Massive expansion of renewable energies for electricity and heat production.
in the following, priority is given to formats in which the actors are addressed as consumers and are to learn about and learn behavioral changes via the various methods. We also attach great importance to target-group-specific stakeholder participation. For this purpose, some formats are presented under A-3.1.

## Social innovation through stakeholder participation

The current ecological, economic and social challenges necessitate a comprehensive societal transformation toward sustainability. It is now clear that committed goals, scenarios and individual Instruments and technological developments alone are not enough. A process of adaptation and change is required throughout society.

One important contribution, as described, is the participation of those affected in the implementation of climate protection measures. However, far-reaching social changes are also necessary. Energy cooperatives are a good example here. They bring together what often falls apart in our society: entrepreneurial commitment on the one hand and measures for environmental and climate protection on the other. Energy cooperatives benefit from their local roots, often in the form of the voluntary commitment of their active members. It is therefore natural to ask whether energy cooperatives Energy cooperatives can strengthen their impact for climate protection by developing further climate-relevant business areas and by winning over their members and the public for concrete climate protection measures.

Heidelberg energy cooperative builds and operates climate-friendly infrastructure (especially photovoltaic systems) and thus makes climate protection a local experience. It offers commercial and non-commercial non-commercial services that enable climate-friendly lifestyles.

It participates in cooperations and promotes the transfer of knowledge between actors in order to bring climate protection out of the niche and into the mainstream. The cooperative thus performs its original tasks of managing the economy for its members and, in addition, sets itself forward-looking goals with a clear focus on with a clear focus on shaping a future worth living.

## Participation formats in Heidelberg

Citizens and civil society actors are important sources of ideas for the specialised administration and for the municipal council. They are also important actors in the implementation of measures. The city of Heidelberg therefore aims to strengthen citizen participation far beyond the legal framework. It wants to involve all interested and affected parties in current urban projects such as sustainability, climate protection and mobility. In the Heidelberg Guidelines for Co-designing Citizen Participation, citizen participation is reliably and bindingly regulated. This was unanimously adopted by the municipal council in 2012.

The origin of this was the Aalborg Charter, on the basis of which Heidelberg began participatory co-creation of development processes in many administrative areas as early as the 1990s. The participatory culture created on this basis in administration, politics and society also led to the participatory

development of the climate protection and energy transition with the citizens and experts.

Interaction between citizen and stakeholder participation

Administrative participation

Interdisciplinary cooperation in the administration of the City of Heidelberg is part of the successful administrative reform of the past 30 years. In project or agile groups, groups in the area of environment and climate protection also work together on an ad hoc basis for a project. This is also the case with the "100 % Climate Protection Master Plan" and the Climate Protection Action Plan or in the preparation of the new Urban Development Plan 2035.

Working groups on various topics bring the expertise of the specialised departments and the municipal enterprises into the planning process.

The management of the city administration also has the administrative conference as a steering instrument. All managers meet once a week and, if necessary, issues relevant to climate protection are discussed at topic tables and implementation options are sought. In special cases, task force groups are also set up.

„Masterplan 100 % climate protection“

During the development of the strategy and measures package of the "Master Plan 100 % Climate Protection", the involvement of the city society was a condition set by the Federal Ministry for the Environment for project participation within the framework of the National Climate Protection Initiative Program.

The environmental office of the city of Heidelberg implemented this process in two ways: on the one hand, experts from business, science, finance, the energy industry, churches, and associations were involved in the result-finding process in the "Heidelberg Climate Protection &amp; Energy Circle" throughout

The Masterplan process at a glance

In addition, a multi-stage participation process for citizens took place, which had a significant influence on the packages of measures. Young people were also able to contribute their concerns to the Master Plan and beyond, through the regularly held Youth Climate Summits.

One challenge of multi-year processes is to maintain the commitment of all stakeholders. After the motivating work of developing visions and ideas, the phase of concrete implementation of projects is characterised by detailed work and overcoming hurdles. In addition, there are externally induced processes that challenge the city of Heidelberg, such as conversion, general economic development and political decisions.

In the process, the topic of climate protection expanded to other areas of action. In particular, the role of consumption and nutrition play a major role in the public discussion. The number of initiatives dedicated to these issues has risen sharply. Due to this expansion, some actors who are active in the "classic" areas such as energy supply and efficiency no longer feel exclusively addressed. The city of Heidelberg faces the challenge of permanently uniting, motivating and integrating all important and newly added actors. One strategy of the city administration is to involve important actors such as the housing associations, the crafts community and the university by directly addressing them in a thematically focussed way.

measures. This was successful with the Stadtwerke Heidelberg, the churches and the environmental associations.

Climate Emergency and Climate Action Plan

Following the declaration of a climate emergency in May 2019, the administration was commissioned to draw up a climate protection action plan.

Building on the experience gained from the "Master Plan 100 % Climate Protection", the identification of measures that contribute significantly to the reduction of CO2 emissions and resource consumption was carried out by involving key organizations from the energy industry, administration and science. The climate protection action plan also incorporates many proposals and measures from the political arena.

An action group headed by the Lord Mayor was set up in 2019 specifically for the Climate Protection Action Plan. Department heads, managing directors of municipal companies, and representatives of the university, business, and research have since been exchanging ideas and making strategic decisions regarding the goals and implementation of climate protection in Heidelberg. Civil society groups are also represented.

A steering committee made up of representatives of the departments that are particularly affected by the climate protection action plan is adjusting the implementation and further development of strategies and measures..

Participation process in the urban development concept 2035

The urban development concept for sustainable development in Heidelberg forms the umbrella for all development processes in the city and is currently being updated in line with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

Like the STEP, the STEK 2035 is also being developed in a participatory manner. The entire Heidelberg citizenry is given the opportunity to participate in the development of the new concept. Non-governmental organizations have joined forces under the leadership of the One World Center, the Adult Education Center and the Paritätischer Wohlfahrtsverband to form an action alliance "Sustainable Heidelberg" in 2019 and are actively contributing to the design of the urban development concept.

The STEK is being developed in two phases: First, the status report will be prepared (phase 1). This is followed by the development of a catalog of objectives (phase 2). Citizens and other key stakeholders are involved in both phases, both in the preparation of the status report and in the formulation of goals for the urban development concept. The participation format was adopted by the municipal council in May 2020 and is currently being implemented.

|   |  Action description | Agri-PV represents the combined use of agricultural land for the benefit of both target fields of food supply and electricity generation. Very suitable for the use of photovoltaic are the roofs of greenhouses and the combination of photovoltaic as a superstructure of espalier orchards. The promotion of the city should be extended to this in order to be able to use this potential as a priority (potential of espalier fruit: 11 MWp; greenhouses: 2.4 MWp). The use of Agri-PV in the area is a high overbuilding of classically used fields (e.g.: cereal cultivation), whereby a good dual use of agriculture and power generation is aimed for as an overriding goal. This reduces the pressure to use agricultural land for pure open space photovoltaic systems. In close cooperation with the agricultural sector, the pilot project will examine in detail the economic conditions of both types of use as well as the advantages and disadvantages of this still new technology.  |

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

(Detail how residual emission will be offset, if applicable)

Offsetting: GHG offsetting is a market-based instrument that aims to compensate for GHG emissions "cost-effectively" through reduction measures or CO2 storage elsewhere. Against the background of the Paris target, however, it is necessary that all nations follow the ambitious abatement path. Moreover, studies show that many projects would have been implemented even without "compensation subsidies". The offsetting measures therefore rarely fulfil the criterion of additionality (meaning that the reduced emissions would not have been saved without the offsetting payment). Support for the countries of the Global South should be provided anyway, without

offsetting in the industrialised countries (offsetting takes away the pressure to act, even though everyone has to reduce their GHG emissions locally).

However, the opportunities and barriers to reducing greenhouse gas emissions vary greatly from sector to sector. Taking sectoral differences into account would allow global governance and international cooperation to identify the most promising course of action. particularly important are regulations with the following characteristics: orientation and signalling, establishment of rules to facilitate collective action, and means of implementation,

# C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions – textual and visual elements

## Umweltgerechtigkeit - Sicherung sozialer Frieden

An environmental justice policy combines elements of social policy, health care and ecology. It strives to ensure that all citizens, regardless of their income, origin and place of residence, have equal protection rights against harmful environmental influences and health risks.

In socio-spatial terms, the strategic approach of environmental justice aims to avoid or reduce a concentration of environmental burdens in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods and residential areas, and to provide their residents with access to environmental resources.

District or neighborhood solutions for redevelopment in Heidelberg are already being implemented in some areas. Neighborhood and redevelopment management already exists in various parts of the city. This approach will be increasingly implemented in a redevelopment campaign.

Quantifiable solutions are to be found in the Hasenleiser neighborhood in the south of Heidelberg. Through the ICLEI project ICLUDE, a citizen participation process will begin in June 2023. Measurable variables can be long-term investments made in renovations or solar installations..

Offers such as help with energy poverty from the municipal utilities and the consumer center in Heidelberg help to secure social peace by helping those in need with climate-related problems. The same applies to the Caritas project Stromsparcheck Plus. Indicators of success here are the reduced number of electricity blackouts and the evaluation of the Stromsparcheck for Heidelberg and nationwide (see also https://www.stromspar-check.de). The projects in the municipalities were evaluated over their entire duration, e.g. by means of the savings in energy consumption, the number of emergency aids installed and the resulting CO2 reductions).

At this point, the global view of climate protection is appropriate as it is practiced in the One World Center. Climate impacts trigger migration movements worldwide through climate flight. Climate

protection in the countries of origin, e.g. in the global South, can thus reduce migration movements. Less migration alleviates social conflicts caused by lack of resources globally and locally.

## Climate protection as a social movement and an opportunity for co-design

The participation wave triggered by Fridays for Future in many population groups (Parents for Future, Scientists for Future...) led with great dynamics to a new social movement and to more citizen engagement and participation in climate-relevant policy areas.

The goal of transformation unites social groups and drives dynamic change for more climate protection. Viewed as part of a democracy movement, this helps local authorities to achieve greater transparency and proximity to citizens - the classic advantages of a culture of municipal participation such as Heidelberg has already been practicing for many years.

## Climate-neutral mobility as an opportunity for all

Mobility that puts people first is based on emission-free and safe road traffic. People can use public transport because it is barrier-free and well connected. Cost-effective public transport reduces social and economic differences and leads to greater satisfaction and participation.

People can travel on equal terms, independently, safely and comfortably, regardless of their social background or economic situation.

In addition, the use of environmental transport has proven health benefits. Exercise on foot, by bicycle, or walking to the bus stop provides long-term protection against illnesses caused by lack of exercise and reduces susceptibility to infections.

For this reason, among others, Heidelberg offered free public transportation on weekends in spring 2022 and a heavily discounted ticket for students and seniors since September 2022. An evaluation will be carried out by means of the tickets sold (hd4mobility).

The expansion and optimization of the environmental network thus also has a social objective. In Heidelberg, therefore, comprehensive bus and rail access is guaranteed (radius around stops &lt;500 m). The most recent surveys in this regard were conducted as part of the introduction of flexible, individual passenger shuttles (fips) in selected Heidelberg districts. The densification and expansion of the bus stop network can be quantified.

## Renovated living and working space as a climate opportunity

Energy deep building retrofits can be used as a policy measure to simultaneously achieve multiple community policy goals. Improving the energy efficiency of the building stock offers the opportunity to reduce emissions, lower health care costs, and combat energy poverty.

Viewed in this way, retrofits also help to maintain the health of residents and ensure their participation in society. The same applies to the refurbishment of office buildings and workplaces. Healthy workplace conditions reduce sick leave, relieve the burden on the healthcare system, and maintain or increase economic strength.

Access to low-cost energy sources or energy self-sufficiency should not be reserved for homeowners alone. For this reason, the City of Heidelberg's subsidy program explicitly provides greater financial support for low-income households in the photovoltaic balcony module subsidy, among other things. The subsidy program provides a continuous record of the installed PV power, the renovation and the number or power of the balcony modules - including those to households with social support needs. The Heidelberg housing association GGH (17% of all rental apartments in Heidelberg) has committed itself to the climate protection goals of the city of Heidelberg with the GGH Strategy 2035. They make an active contribution to climate protection and sustainability but also to social responsibility. In doing so, it is aware of the challenge of designing climate protection in such a way that it is also affordable for lower- and middle-income households. The guiding parameter for evaluating energy supply and building standards is CO2 emissions. Evaluation on refurbished housing was carried out at GGH.

# 6 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for further refining the Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract.

## Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration – textual elements

The goal of climate neutrality by 2030 is very ambitious. The path consists of many challenges and is constantly being adapted. In principle, the goal is achievable - but it requires an effort by society as a whole: The cities, their entire urban society and the business and scientific communities must pull together with the EU, the federal government and the federal states. With the Climate City Contract, the cities want to set the strategic basis for this process of change in motion.

Heidelberg has set out to make the most innovative possible progress towards climate neutrality locally and to define implementation paths along the transition map of the accompanying NetZeroCities Platform. As part of the EU mission "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", Heidelberg will act as a role model for other European cities by developing and implementing action-oriented, innovative solutions with the entire urban community.

# 1 Introduction

Explain your city's motivation to join the EU Mission “100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030” and highlight your city's present commitments to climate action. You may also want to include the aims of this document.

Heidelberg has a long history of climate protection since the 1990s, with the first climate protection concept in 1992 as one of the first cities in Germany. Since then, climate protection became more and more important. In 1997, the City Development Plan 2010 set the frame for sustainable development including climate protection as one of the guidelines for Heidelberg. The City Development Plan is currently updated as the City Development Concept 2035. The Traffic Development Plan was first established in 1994 with several updates over the years. Currently, it is updated as the Climate Mobility Plan 2035, focussing on the reduction of emissions in the transport and mobility sector. In 2014, the Masterplan 100% Climate Protection has been developed in a broad participation process with the administration, major city stakeholders and the civil society. The masterplan provides an important road map of climate actions. It was updated in 2017. In 2019, the city council declared climate emergency, leading to the Climate Action Plan in 2020 with 30 specific measures. An overview of all major milestones to climate neutrality in Heidelberg are presented in figure 1.

Despite all these actions the CO2 balances show that the greenhouse gas emissions reduce slower than expected and do not meet the previously set goals. Therefore, it is clear that goals need to be re-sharpened and emissions have to be drastically reduced in the following years. The EU Mission was seen as a great opportunity to accelerate Heidelberg's endeavours and actions to reach climate neutrality faster with support from EU-level and keep Heidelberg in a frontrunner position. However, implementing the actions remains the major challenge. Heidelberg's expectation of the EU Mission is to not longer discuss about the target year for climate neutrality but instead to find innovative ways to implement climate actions. The acceptance to the EU Mission led the city council to the decision to work consistently towards the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 in all fields of action and to give priority to climate protection. Thus, being part of the EU Mission enables Heidelberg to accelerate climate actions that already started as well as creating innovative approaches for the urban transition.

The Climate City Contract creates a structured plan that works consistently towards climate neutrality in 2030. It helps to reveal and analyse barriers that impede climate action. This is a further big step to identify where systemic changes are essential to overcome these barriers in the future. Furthermore, developing the Climate City Contract now builds a framework for continuing the process towards climate neutrality with the entire civil society including the city administration, companies, scientific institutions, NGOs etc. in a co-creative approach. Stakeholder engagement has been one of Heidelberg's principles to reach climate goals in the last years, especially with the Masterplan 100% Climate Protection. However, it is difficult to keep up the good work over this long-lasting process. Individual projects are important to keep up the collaboration. The EU Mission is a great opportunity to bring together all stakeholders and set a common goal.

The City of Heidelberg is active in many networks on regional, national and international levels, such as for example Städtetag Baden-Württemberg, deutscher Städtetag, Klimabündnis, C40, GCM or Energy Cities, in which the Lord Mayor of Heidelberg is president, (https://www.heidelberg.de/hd/HD/Leben/Netzwerke.html). The exchange between these cities is important to learn from each other and to have a political representation at different levels of government. The EU Mission is another essential network that allows Heidelberg to build strong relations with other European and German lead cities, especially on the Mission Platform and at personal meetings.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Articulate your 2030 climate neutrality ambition, as expressed and defined in your Cities Mission Expression of Interest (EoI). This should include your ambition and commitment to a 2030 horizon as a whole city, as well as describe any exclusion areas and summarise how these areas would be addressed beyond 2030. (A more detailed plan for exclusion areas should be included in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.) Your 2030 ambition should be supported at a minimum by a Council decision, and it is recommended that it is also supported by a wider stakeholder group. We also recommend you to list other co-benefits you aim to achieve when working towards the climate neutrality goal, like wellbeing, health, equity, justice, financial savings.

# Your text

In July 2022, the Heidelberg City Council passed the following resolution: The City of Heidelberg undertakes to work consistently towards the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 in all fields of action and to give priority to climate protection in line with its participation in the EU mission "climate-neutral and smart cities". Complete climate neutrality according to the municipal BISKO accounting is to be achieved by 2040 at the latest. For the city administration, in particular the municipal properties, the aim is to achieve largely climate neutrality by 2030.

According to the expression of Interest from 2022 Heidelberg follows the Cities Mission's climate neutrality definition to address GHG emissions within the city boundaries from stationary energy including buildings and transport (Scope 1) as it is also stated in the BISKO CO2-balance which is the standard for German cities. Additionally, waste is also included as stated in Heidelberg's CDP report. Indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) outside the city boundary due to the consumption of grid-supplied electricity and grid-supplied heat or cold are taken into account in Heidelberg and are also part of the BISKO CO2-balance. Out-of-boundary GHG emissions due to disposal and treatment of waste generated are not part of Heidelberg's main climate neutrality goals until 2030. While Heidelberg excludes some of the emission domains, instead a citizen CO2-Balance is calculated to take Scope 3 emissions such as outbound travelling, consumption of product and food etc. into account.

Heidelberg is a growing city with the challenge to meet the increased number of citizens, building spaces and services with energy efficiency and transformation to renewables. The City is committed to making all necessary efforts to become climate-neutral and is prepared to mobilize all its resources to this purpose. However, the city has only limited influence on the CO2 emissions. Therefore it is important to build a strong network with major stakeholders and the citizens to reach climate neutrality. The key levers in Heidelberg are the decarbonisation and expansion of district heating, the development of renewable energies (solar, wind), the increase of energy efficiency and implementing a sustainable transport and mobility system. Still, the influence of these emission domains is limited. Heidelberg is a commuter city, therefore it is important to think more regionally to transform mobility not only within the city boundaries but on a larger scale. Collaboration with the neighbouring cities is crucial. Moreover, Heidelberg is geographically and spatially limited for renewable energies. High wind velocities are only available in few areas that are located in forest land. Therefore only few wind power plants will be able to be implemented. Solar power will be focused on roofs, open space solar plants and agri-photovoltaics.

Heidelberg commits itself to become climate neutral in 2030 with all necessary strengths but also to transform the city socially just. Climate action also provides some positive co-benefits for the city and its residents concerning social, economic, and ecological issues. Social benefits include the improvement of well-being and health conditions by clean air, the reduction of energy poverty by providing green energy and refurbishments as well as affordable public transport. The participation of the citizens plays a major role in creating acceptance for climate actions. These measures will create continuing equity, justice and peace for all residents of the city. Economically, climate action creates opportunities for new jobs for example in craftsmanship, renewable energy systems or science. Furthermore, investing in climate action in the long-term is less expensive than costs for damages due to climate change. Climate action measures also protect the natural environment and improve habitats for flora and fauna. Climate adaptation and the conservation of biodiversity are also important to be considered in all climate activities.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

This is the core section of the Commitments document that should summarise at least 3 or 4 systemic strategic priorities that need to be implemented for your city to become climate neutral by 2030. These should be meaningful changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in your city, like decarbonising the heating system in the city or generating 100% energy from renewables. The individual commitments between your city and other stakeholders should address these key priorities and contribute to reaching them. The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan should describe the all interventions, including those to reach your priorities as well as all further actions, in detail and describe how your city plans to implement them.

## Your text

Based on the CO2-balance Heidelberg has analysed the state of current affairs and identified key priorities that needs to be urgently addressed in order to achieve 2030 climate neutrality goal:

Decarbonising the heating system in the city by 2030
Generating 100% energy from renewables
Increasing energy efficiency by retrofitting buildings
Transformation to sustainable mobility and transport
Reducing emissions from commerce and industry

## Decarbonising the heating system in the city by 2030

The City of Heidelberg has worked out a renewable heat supply concept for the whole city, called municipal heat planning, completely abandoning coal-CHP, heating oil and natural gas. This will be published in fall 2023. The most important pathway for Heidelberg's heat supply are an expansion of the district heating grid, run by the municipal energy company, with simultaneous transforming to "green" district heating. Green district heat will cover about 70% of the heat demand. Those buildings located in city areas, that are not appropriate for district heat (30%), will be supplied
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

decentrally mainly by electric heat pumps, assisted by solar home systems. A limited share of small scale neighbourhood heat grids, biomass or H2 heaters will be completing supply. For this to succeed, heating consumption must be significantly reduced through appropriate energetic retrofit measures.

## Generating 100% energy from renewables

A huge expansion of renewable energies is needed nationwide to achieve a climate neutral heating and electricity system. Heidelberg can contribute to this by exploiting all potential as far as possible. This applies to the expansion of photovoltaics, the construction of wind turbines, using environmental heat by heat pumps and the development of deep geothermal potential. The federal government and, to some extent, the state of Baden-Württemberg must create the appropriate framework conditions: strict requirements for the installation and replacement of heating systems, legal foundations for the dismantling of gas grids, funding measures, the creation of legal requirements that remove existing hurdles, simplified procedural paths for the expansion of renewable energies.

## Increasing energy efficiency by retrofitting buildings

The renovation rate for buildings could hardly be increased in the past. Climate neutrality can only be achieved if the heat demand of all buildings is massively reduced and the remaining demand is covered by renewable energies. The corresponding regulatory framework (energy quality of the refurbishment) must be set up by the federal government. The city of Heidelberg will continue to apply the already stricter limits for its own buildings. For private households or public buildings of the country it lacks the direct access. A policy of direct contact, campaigning and advertising with the city's own standards has to be pursued here.

For the planned new buildings on the conversion areas as well as in the Patrick Henry Village, it is essential that no additional CO2 emissions are generated. The building standard and use must therefore be planned in such a way that energy production (from renewable energy sources) and energy consumption balance each other out. For the demand that cannot be met on the site, additional renewable generation facilities must be built elsewhere, preferably by the municipal utilities or energy cooperatives.

## Transformation to sustainable mobility and transport

Compared to the rest of Germany, Heidelberg already has an exemplary proportion of environmentally compatible modes of transport (walking, cycling, public transport). A high proportion of traffic-related CO2 emissions is caused by commuter traffic. In addition to the electrification of the motorized individual traffic, a significant reduction by half of the car traffic within the city limits of Heidelberg is necessary with a simultaneous doubling of the public transport (rail passenger transport and regular bus service). In order to make environmental transport more attractive than car use in this sense, a combination of pull (improvement of environmental transport) and push measures (reduction of the attractiveness of car use) is essential.

Push measures are particularly necessary because the expansion of the environmental alliance is limited due to the associated costs and the space requirements. Moreover, a pure expansion of the environmental alliance mainly leads to newly induced traffic without significantly reducing car traffic. Therefore, for an effective modal shift, the attractiveness of car traffic must be reduced. The decisive factors here are pricing and the amount of space available.

The tasks at EU and federal level consist of improving the framework conditions (CO2 fleet regulation, purchase premiums). Heidelberg alone cannot increase the share of electric cars to the required level. However, the city can contribute to an adequate charging infrastructure, which is essential for the changeover.

## Reducing emissions from commerce and industry

In the commercial sector, the City of Heidelberg has for many years relied on the exchange of information between companies and the Sustainable Business Network for small and medium-sized enterprises in Heidelberg. The network provides support for environmental and sustainability management and concrete assistance in identifying potential for optimization. In 2021, the total number of participating companies was 147 with a total of around 10,500 employees. This number is to be increased significantly by 2030.

The next few years will be crucial to creating the fundamental planning for achieving climate neutrality. This applies particularly to the major measures in the expansion of renewable energies, especially wind power, as well as the climate-neutral heat supply, for which the 2023 heat planning is the basis. In addition, the expansion of PV-plants will continue to be pushed strongly and the expansion rate of the last few years will be further accelerated. The Municipal Energy Concept and other planning strategies will be designed to ensure that future new districts are developed in a climate-neutral manner. Energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies will play a decisive role here. In the area of transportation, the climate mobility plan, which will be completed at the end of 2023, will be the decisive planning tool for redesigning Heidelberg's transportation infrastructure for sustainable mobility.

In order to implement these plans, there needs to be a high level of acceptance among political decision-makers and the involvement of all the key players in the local society. The next city council elections will take place in early 2024, which will be a 5-year legislative period. The composition of the political parties plays a role in how climate protection measures are implemented by 2030. For the planning and implementation of climate protection measures, various departments have to be involved in order to jointly identify conflicting goals at an early stage. A transformation can only be successful if the entire city administration pulls together and declares climate protection to be a priority. However, since the city itself has only a partial direct influence on CO2 emissions, e.g. in its own buildings, it is necessary to involve further emitters in the process on the way to climate neutrality. Therefore, the city acts together with the university, large and medium-sized companies as well as NGOs and other organizations. The citizens of Heidelberg should also stand behind the city's mission and make their contribution. To ensure equitable participation for all, the city plans to organize various formats for specific target groups and according to their particular topics. It is important to give people the opportunity to contribute their own ideas and initiatives in adequate networks, from which the city benefits at all times. In a process that runs over several years, the challenge will be to keep the motivation of the stakeholders high over the long term and not to lose sight of the common goal.

## 4 Principles and process

Highlight the key principles that will guide your city as it implements its Climate City Contract, like accountability, transparency, or an open attitude to new approaches. The process should encompass principles like co-creation, innovation, multi-actor and citizen engagement, and should be systemic and demand-driven in nature. It should also be based on monitoring and joint learning. The Commitments Guidance document provides more specific guidance on how integrate these principles into your own process.

## Your text

The Climate City Contract forms the framework for all existing concepts and strategies in climate protection in Heidelberg and maps the most relevant priorities on the way to climate neutrality. Plans like the Masterplan 100% Climate Protection and its updated version as well as the Climate Action Plan including studies on the measures and goals are brought together in the Climate City Contract. The result of the Climate City Contract is a holistic plan showing the pathway to climate neutrality aligned to Heidelberg's political goals, C40 requirements and the EU Mission's conditions. The Climate City Contract guarantees the consistency of Heidelberg's ambition to climate neutrality. Priorities lie in the fields of action with the highest emissions, namely heating, electricity, transport and commerce/industry. These priorities are guiding goals to which all individual climate protection measures must contribute. Summarizing targets, strategies and priorities in the Climate City Contract emphasises Heidelberg's continuing responsibility for managing climate action in order to transform the city sustainably.

Based on the past CO2-balances, it is clear that the speed of action to reduce emissions must be significantly accelerated. This means that previously effective measures must be further expanded and enhanced, but also that the city must create the right framework conditions for new approaches and promote innovative solutions. These innovations need to be facilitated in all sectors, buildings as

well as mobility, and include technical, digital and social dimensions. The complexity shows that interdisciplinary approaches are crucial for succeeding this challenge. This can only be achieved by multi-actor and citizen engagement including all relevant administration departments and stakeholders with high economic and/or political power.

Within the administration climate action can only succeed if it is addressed as a cross-sectoral task in all departments as a matter of priority. To this end, the silo thinking that is still widespread has to be overcome and agile working has to be promoted. In the long term, it would be helpful if climate protection was established as a mandatory task in municipalities by federal law in order to secure human and financial resources permanently.

Politically and economically influential stakeholders can substantially shape the urban environment and willingness to sustainable urban transformation. Therefore, they will be involved in the process to climate neutrality. Target group-specific participation formats for companies and organisations play an important role in the EU Mission in Heidelberg in order to give them the opportunity to participate in shaping the project, but also to increase acceptance of the implemented measures. Over 30 stakeholders followed the Heidelberg mayor's invitation to join the EU Mission by signing a cooperation agreement including their ambition to contribute to the City's objective to climate neutrality and individual back-up measures. New forms of collaboration are intended to be developed over the next years in order to co-create the process.

Citizens play an important role in the implementation and acceptance of climate action. Therefore, citizens must be involved in processes at an early stage and on an on-going basis to give them the opportunity to help shape them. The impetus from the citizens is very valuable for the administration and ensures that climate action is anchored throughout society. The City of Heidelberg therefore aims to strengthen citizen participation beyond the legal framework. The Heidelberg Guidelines for Co-Creative Citizen Participation regulate citizen participation reliably and obligatorily. In addition, target group-specific and topic-specific participation formats will be offered in order to reach as many citizens as possible. In the future, even groups that tend to rarely engage in participation formats will be addressed through outreach programs. This ensures that there is an equitable participation opportunity for all and thus, in a broader sense, also contributes to climate justice by taking into account the concerns of all and leaving no one behind.

The key principle on the way to climate neutrality is to promote the collaboration and participation of all stakeholders. Joint learning and mutual understanding are the drivers for developing new measures. The EU Mission helps the administration to identify barriers that still hinder these collaborations and to find ways to create structures to foster them.

Comprehensive and transparent monitoring will be established in order to regularly review target achievement. This includes both the development of CO2 emissions and the current status of climate protection measures. On the one hand it is necessary to show the progress of the implementation, on the other hand continuing greenhouse gas inventories validate the reduction in emissions. A comparison between the targets and the actual progress of the measures ensures that the targets are kept in view and enables readjustments to be made if necessary. The monitoring results help to identify successes that can thus be replicated and up-scaled, while obstacles can be revealed and be avoided in the future. In monitoring and evaluation, it is important to ensure that both quantitative and qualitative indicators are used. Quantitative monitoring is possible for the implementation of technical measures, for example through direct measurements of energy consumption data. Other measures, on the other hand, are difficult to measure and the actual impact on CO2 emissions is therefore difficult to estimate. Nevertheless, such measures are also relevant because, for example, citizens' behaviours and attitudes can change.

Based on the monitoring the Climate City Contract will be updated on a regular basis, creating an iteration process every two years. The regular renewal of the Climate City Contract enables new findings, adapted framework conditions and regulations as well as technological developments to be taken into account. In this way, a dynamic plan is created that can be developed together with existing and new stakeholders and citizen participation.

# Successful participation in climate protection

To achieve sustained success climate protection needs to be an integral aspect in all decisions on investment, purchase and management of companies, public organisations and private households. This needs knowledge and awareness about relevance and chances of individual action. Opportunities for climate protection include, in particular, cost savings, security of supply, improvements in the quality of life, employee motivation, public image and new market opportunities. Thus awareness raising and participation processes play a key role in the successful planning and implementation of municipal climate protection measures in Heidelberg. The main goals are motivating for climate action, develop common strategies, identify best solutions and develop new business cases for sustainable products and services. Further aims are to integrate the technical and economic know-how of selected social stakeholders in order to close knowledge gaps and improve the quality of concept and measure planning. On the other hand, the active involvement of the various stakeholders raises awareness of the municipality's climate protection goals and measures at an early stage, and their concerns and suggestions are incorporated into the design of the measures. In this way, the subsequent implementation of the measures is promoted. Acceptance or even identification with the climate protection goals and measures of the municipality are thus central goals of participation processes.

For the selection of the formats and the addressing of the actors it is also important, which motivation / which self-interest has the target group

in the topic of climate protection? For example:

Cost savings through energy efficiency measures,
positive image in the public,
Increase of awareness,
improvement of their own quality of life

When addressing stakeholders, Heidelberg prioritises according to the following criteria.
Heidelberg

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

O

![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)

High relevance / High interest:

These stakeholders are closely involved in the process, as described below. The cooperation in the different formats builds on close contacts and a trusting cooperation in which objections or wishes are taken seriously and discussed together.

High relevance / Low interest: As this group of actors is crucial for the success of the project, this group of actors is specifically addressed with topics through which they can gain access to climate protection. It is also important to develop an awareness of which of their interests are contrary to the municipality's climate protection efforts and why this is the case. one example is the Climate Action Group led by the Mayor is the Goal. He is a door opener and motivator for participation, especially for this group of actors.

Stakeholders with high interest but low relevance are regularly informed by the City of Heidelberg about climate protection activities (e.g. climate protection newsletter) and have the opportunity for low-threshold participation in suitable circumstances. Examples here are events with participatory offers (e.g. quizzes). This ensures that they feel included and recognised as actors in the process. This in turn helps to prevent any resistance to planned measures.

Low relevance / Low interest: For these actors, we make a point of keeping them in mind and informing them about the process or project as soon as they show interest.

Depending on the competencies and responsibilities, stakeholders are involved in accelerating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors,. This means:

Emissions from fossil fuel combustion in all buildings and facilities (so-called "stationary energy"). This includes residential, commercial and industrial buildings as well as municipal buildings, properties and public lighting within the city limits; climate neutrality, as defined by ifeu, requires the complete replacement of all fossil fuels for heat supply, primarily through district heating and heat pumps.

Emissions from fossil fuel combustion for all vehicles and transport within the city limits; a focus must be on measures to reduce emissions from commuter traffic, especially a strong expansion of

public transport in the region, incentives to switch to zero-emission drives and bicycles, but also city tolls or vehicle/parking space levies must be investigated.

Emissions from consumption of electricity and district heating/cooling within the city boundary, from power plants within or outside the city boundary;
Massive expansion of renewable energies for electricity and heat production.

in the following, priority is given to formats in which the actors are addressed as consumers and are to learn about and learn behavioral changes via the various methods. We also attach great importance to target-group-specific stakeholder participation. For this purpose, some formats are presented under A-3.1.

# Social innovation through stakeholder participation

The current ecological, economic and social challenges necessitate a comprehensive societal transformation toward sustainability. It is now clear that committed goals, scenarios and individual Instruments and technological developments alone are not enough. A process of adaptation and change is required throughout society.

One important contribution, as described, is the participation of those affected in the implementation of climate protection measures. However, far-reaching social changes are also necessary. Energy cooperatives are a good example here. They bring together what often falls apart in our society: entrepreneurial commitment on the one hand and measures for environmental and climate protection on the other. Energy cooperatives benefit from their local roots, often in the form of the voluntary commitment of their active members. It is therefore natural to ask whether energy cooperatives Energy cooperatives can strengthen their impact for climate protection by developing further climate-relevant business areas and by winning over their members and the public for concrete climate protection measures.

Heidelberg energy cooperative builds and operates climate-friendly infrastructure (especially photovoltaic systems) and thus makes climate protection a local experience. It offers commercial and non-commercial

non-commercial services that enable climate-friendly lifestyles.

It participates in cooperations and promotes the transfer of knowledge between

actors in order to bring climate protection out of the niche and into the mainstream. The cooperative thus performs its original tasks of managing the economy

for its members and, in addition, sets itself forward-looking goals with a clear focus on

with a clear focus on shaping a future worth living.

# Participation formats in Heidelberg

Citizens and civil society actors are important sources of ideas for the specialised administration and for the municipal council. They are also important actors in the implementation of measures. The city of Heidelberg therefore aims to strengthen citizen participation far beyond the legal framework. It wants to involve all interested and affected parties in current urban projects such as sustainability, climate protection and mobility. In the Heidelberg Guidelines for Co-designing Citizen

Participation, citizen participation is reliably and bindingly regulated. This was unanimously adopted by the municipal council in 2012.

The origin of this was the Aalborg Charter, on the basis of which Heidelberg began participatory co-creation of development processes in many administrative areas as early as the 1990s. The participatory culture created on this basis in administration, politics and society also led to the participatory development of the climate protection and energy transition with the citizens and

experts.

Interaction between citizen and stakeholder participation

Administrative participation

Interdisciplinary cooperation in the administration of the City of Heidelberg is part of the successful administrative reform of the past 30 years. In project or agile groups, groups in the area of environment and climate protection also work together on an ad hoc basis for a project. This is also the case with the "100 % Climate Protection Master Plan" and the Climate Protection Action Plan or in the preparation of the new Urban Development Plan 2035.

Working groups on various topics bring the expertise of the specialised departments and the municipal enterprises into the planning process.

The management of the city administration also has the administrative conference as a steering instrument. All managers meet once a week and, if necessary, issues relevant to climate protection are discussed at topic tables and implementation options are sought. In special cases, task force groups are also set up.

"Masterplan 100 % climate protection"

During the development of the strategy and measures package of the "Master Plan 100 % Climate Protection", the involvement of the city society was a condition set by the Federal Ministry for the Environment for project participation within the framework of the National Climate Protection Initiative Program.

The environmental office of the city of Heidelberg implemented this process in two ways: on the one hand, experts from business, science, finance, the energy industry, churches, and associations were involved in the result-finding process in the "Heidelberg Climate Protection &amp; Energy Circle" throughout the entire duration of the project.

![img-16.jpeg](img-16.jpeg)

The Masterplan process at a glance

In addition, a multi-stage participation process for citizens took place, which had a significant influence on the packages of measures. Young people were also able to contribute their concerns to the Master Plan and beyond, through the regularly held Youth Climate Summits.

One challenge of multi-year processes is to maintain the commitment of all stakeholders. After the motivating work of developing visions and ideas, the phase of concrete implementation of projects is characterised by detailed work and overcoming hurdles. In addition, there are externally induced processes that challenge the city of Heidelberg, such as conversion, general economic development and political decisions.

In the process, the topic of climate protection expanded to other areas of action. In particular, the role of consumption and nutrition play a major role in the public discussion. The number of initiatives dedicated to these issues has risen sharply. Due to this expansion, some actors who are active in the "classic" areas such as energy supply and efficiency no longer feel exclusively addressed. The city of Heidelberg faces the challenge of permanently uniting, motivating and integrating all important and newly added actors. One strategy of the city administration is to involve important actors such as the housing associations, the crafts community and the university by directly addressing them in a thematically focussed way.

The three-stage model of citizen participation in the "Masterplan 100% Klimaschutz" (100% Climate Protection Master Plan)

(see also final report on the "Masterplan 100% Klimaschutz" 2014)

After the adoption of the "Master Plan 100% Climate Protection" in 2014, attempts were made to involve the Heidelberg Climate Protection &amp; Energy Group and the citizens in the implementation of the measures. This was successful with the Stadtwerke Heidelberg, the churches and the environmental associations.

Climate Emergency and Climate Action Plan

Following the declaration of a climate emergency in May 2019, the administration was commissioned to draw up a climate protection action plan.

Building on the experience gained from the "Master Plan 100% Climate Protection", the identification of measures that contribute significantly to the reduction of CO2 emissions and resource consumption was carried out by involving key organizations from the energy industry, administration and science. The climate protection action plan also incorporates many proposals and measures from the political arena.

An action group headed by the Lord Mayor was set up in 2019 specifically for the Climate Protection Action Plan. Department heads, managing directors of municipal companies, and representatives of the university, business, and research have since been exchanging ideas and making strategic decisions regarding the goals and implementation of climate protection in Heidelberg. Civil society groups are also represented.

A steering committee made up of representatives of the departments that are particularly affected by the climate protection action plan is adjusting the implementation and further development of strategies and measures..

Participation process in the urban development concept 2035

The urban development concept for sustainable development in Heidelberg forms the umbrella for all development processes in the city and is currently being updated in line with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

Like the STEP, the STEK 2035 is also being developed in a participatory manner. The entire Heidelberg citizenry is given the opportunity to participate in the development of the new concept.

# Climate Protection Action Plan
# Background and Introduction

At the municipal council meeting on May 9th, 2019 Lord Mayor Prof. Dr. Eckart Würzner declared the climate emergency for Heidelberg. He thus emphasized the necessity and urgency of committed and concrete action to limit the climate crisis.

As a result, measures have been collected within the administration and with key social and economic players in a climate action group to promote climate protection in Heidelberg faster and more ambitiously.

Heidelberg is one of Germany's pioneers in municipal climate protection. One of the first comprehensive climate protection concepts was adopted back in 1992. Since then, Heidelberg has established climate protection as a voluntary task in a variety of ways in administration, business and society.

It has since been updated several times and last adopted in 2014 as the "Master Plan 100% Climate Protection" with new fields of action and measures.

On November 21st, 2019 the municipal council approved a new update of the "Master Plan 100% Climate Protection" on the basis of the current CO₂ balance. This confirms once again that Heidelberg is striving to reduce CO₂ emissions by 95% and reduce final energy consumption by 50% until 2050.

At the same time, a 30-Point-Plan, the Climate Protection Action Plan, was adopted by the local council (see appendix). It contains the targets, focal points for action and concrete measures that have been collected since the climate crisis was declared, as well as proposals from the Heidelberg municipal council.

These 30 points, in combination with the strategies of the "Master Plan 100% Climate Protection", are intended to enable Heidelberg to achieve the 1.5 degree target of the Paris Climate Protection Conference more quickly.

In this context, the administration was commissioned to allocate the measures to the respective objectives and programmes of the departments, to review them and to submit them to the local council for decision within the framework of the decision-making authority.

The points are therefore not definitively decided, but must be examined with regard to the necessary financial and personnel resource requirements and, if necessary, adapted to the existing possibilities.

With the Climate Protection Action Plan, Heidelberg has once again shown that combating climate change is a central task at local level.

## 30-Point-Plan in Fields of action and strategies

## Field of Action Energy-Efficient Construction and Retrofits

100 % climate neutrality for the growth of the city - PHV as well as all new quarters from 2020 on will be PlusEnergy quarters. Since, from today's perspective, it is not possible to achieve a full coverage of energy needs in the urban districts, this means that, in addition to the decentralised use of solar energy, renewable potentials will be tapped elsewhere in the course of territorial development. The creation of 40% subsidised rental housing, 30% threshold households, where no more than 30% is paid for rent including heating, and 30% apartments available on the free market should continue to be implemented.

Doubling the retrofit rate for old buildings by 2030. Immediately plan and implement by 2040 an increase in the retrofit rate for Heidelberg private real estate to at least 2.5% annually and for urban real estate to at least 3% and a comprehensive renovation timetable for urban buildings (including the municipal housing company GGH and if possible GGH investments), including reviewing PV retrofitting options. The costs of energetic retrofitting must not increase the rent including heating.

## Field of Action Energy Supply, Energy Infrastructure and Renewable Energies

50% "green", carbon neutral heat for all district heating customers by 2020 and a largely CO₂-neutral approach to district heating in Heidelberg by 2030. No further district heating from hard coal after 2030.

One third self-generated district heating in Heidelberg by 2025.

25 megawatts of additional installed photovoltaic power in Heidelberg by 2025. For this purpose, the City of Heidelberg, the municipal utilities and cooperation partners are developing an active advertising strategy, through which a solar system can easily be installed on one's own roof.

100% "green", carbon neutral electricity until 2025 for the citizens who are obliged to be supplied by the municipal utilities.

## Field of Action Mobility

Increase passenger numbers in public transport by 20% until 2025. The city is also seeking negotiations with the state of Baden-Württemberg to create the legal basis for ticketless public transport.

Introduce the Job Ticket in 50% of Heidelberg companies by 2025 and application as model city for the introduction of the 365€ ticket at the Federal Government.

Extend four further bicycle expressways in the region.

Establish 4 or more special bus lines for the reduction of the MIV share of commuter traffic on the basis of a task force consisting of the City of Heidelberg, the surrounding municipalities and the major employers in Heidelberg and the surrounding area, which will record the actual commuter flows and develop the necessary relocation measures towards public transport and cycle traffic.
Continue the constant transformation of public and private car parks and underground parking garages into bicycle parking facilities or bicycle traffic facilities.

Pavement parking is prevented throughout the city so that people can be safe on the pavement. Misconduct will be consistently punished.

Free public transport in the RNV area will be introduced on weekends. At the same time the parking fees for the city car parks and the public space will be increased by 50%.

A local transport fee of 365€ will be implemented as soon as the state government has created the legal conditions for this. The association of cities and towns will be responsible for promoting this. The local transport fee will provide all payers with an annual public transport pass.

Introduction of a parking space management system that better reflects the costs for the provision of parking space than before and punishes incorrect parking more consistently.

## Field of Action Consumption and Food

Gradual increase in the share of organic lunch options in schools and kindergartens in Heidelberg from 30% to 50% by 2022, without having to increase the parents' share. Due to the declaration of a climate emergency, at least one vegan meal should be offered daily in all public facilities and canteens.

Sustainable event management and climate-friendly catering at city festivals, sports events and public festivals: choice of climate-friendly venues incl. climate-friendly energy supply, high proportion of plant-based, regional, seasonal and organic products in catering, avoidance of packaging, communication of climate-friendly offers.

## NEW Field of Action Green Spaces and Climate Adaption

Plant a "climate forest" in each city district - 3000 trees by 2025 (500 trees per year), in particular for currently sealed areas.

Expansion of the "Green Belt" in Heidelberg.

Implementation of climate change adaptation measures for public buildings by 2025.

## NEW Field of Action Agriculture

Establishment of an urban dialogue with citizens who use the land in Heidelberg for private or commercial agricultural purposes. Within the framework of this exchange, assistance will be developed and implemented to help people switch to a more ecologically and climatically compatible agricultural use.

## NEW Field of Action Urban Development and Urban Land-Use Planning

All future development concepts will focus on climate protection, climate adaptation and biodiversity conservation. Areas with high ecological value would have to be fixed bindingly in the spatial order model, in the land use plan and in the urban development concept. This could establish a so-called "green belt" for Heidelberg.

## NEW Field of Action Industry and Commerce
Participation of 20% of all small and medium-sized enterprises in Heidelberg in the "Sustainable Management" network.

## Process and Structure

Establish
a climate protection review for all municipal decisions based on indicators determined in cooperation with a scientific institution,
an environmental expert committee, advised by association and scientific experts, which must decide on all climate-relevant municipal proposals,
a mandatory submission of measures for participation and social balance in all municipal climate protection decisions in the municipal decision-making process,
a participatory instrument that gives voice to future generations.

Further development of the "Master Plan 100% Climate Protection" and adoption of a long-term course of action in cooperation with - as before - an independent scientific institute, which describes how the Heidelberg climate targets can be reached. This includes a concrete timetable for measures and a sequence of measures, ensures traceability and verifiability and is regularly evaluated, adapted and made available to the public online.

The administration is given the task of allocating the various measures to the specific sectors.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

Review of Heidelberg's climate protection targets by commissioning an independent scientific institute to present a report on the measures that would be required to achieve more ambitious climate protection targets, such as accelerating Heidelberg's commitment to climate neutrality from 2050 to the end of the 2030s.

The city administration presents a CO₂ balance of the transport sector for Heidelberg and the Rhine-Neckar region, from which the significance of Heidelberg as a regional centre and the interactions between Heidelberg and the surrounding communities in the transport sector can be seen.

A study on how a CO₂-neutral heat supply in Heidelberg can best be achieved from a cost perspective must be conducted out immediately.

A prognosis should be given as to how much CO₂ reduction the individual measures will cause. In addition, an indicator set for all implemented climate protection measures is to be developed to show the effectiveness of the measures.
