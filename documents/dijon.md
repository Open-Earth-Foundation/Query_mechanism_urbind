# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CCC Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses, and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

Dijon has set itself the goal of being carbon neutral. The city has been implementing an ambitious policy to fight climate change since 2008. In these past years Dijon has involved local actors to co-construct this strategy and has mobilized national and European funds and initiatives to help the city achieve carbon neutrality. The selection of Dijon in several H2020 initiatives like REPONSE is a clear sign of the city's determination to reach the targets. The climate objective is central in Dijon's municipal policy.

Dijon Metropole has exceeded the -20% in 2020, a target set in 2009 as part of the Covenant of Mayors and reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 23% between 2010 and 2022. Building on this momentum, Dijon Metropole now has the political will to accelerate its energy transition, which is well underway, and is putting in place the necessary policies and tools to achieve its objectives by relying on its ongoing solutions while continuing to innovate.

An ambitious policy for the development of renewable energies is beginning to bear fruit with the largest urban solar farm in France and a methanization site. Building on this experience, a strategy for the deployment of new production sites is being realized.

The development of the hydrogen vector is a major turning point.

A study is also underway on urban logistics, which should lead to the definition of concrete solutions. In the building sector, renovations are accelerating. By 2030, 100% of energy-intensive social housing, which represent nearly 22% of the housing stock, will have undergone energy-efficient refurbishment. Technical and financial support is also being offered for co-ownerships, which represent 75% of the housing stock.

The experimentation of the two Positive energy blocks (PEBs), which should lead to a 75% reduction in GHG emissions, will be inaugurated in 2025. The PEBs are located in a working-class neighbourhood where all the buildings built in the 1960s will be refurbished by 2025. Finally, the site, which is connected to the heating network, has great potential for solar development on roofs or car parks.

Dijon Metropole also relies on a sustainable food project for 2030 to act on food-related emissions which represent 25% of the French emissions. The project relies on partnerships with the private sector, in the framework of the VITAGORA network, as well as scientific partnerships with the research centre INRAE. Dijon is renowned for gastronomy and has a double UNESCO classification and since 2024, Dijon has been home to the headquarters of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine, making this project particularly important.

This new dynamic will be based on the new digital tools which are being developed to monitor the carbon footprint of the city month by month and to achieve the objectives while maintaining an ambitious trajectory.

Because the objectives cannot be reached without a strong mobilization of the territory's inhabitants and partnerships, Dijon Metropole is committed to co-construct and monitor the implementation of its climate and biodiversity plan. Relying on a dynamic and diverse network of actors in the territory, from industry, the service sector, associations, institutions, education and research, many of them active in RESPONSE and other projects, Dijon has created strong local dynamic at the service of the fight against climate change.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Dijon Metropole has been fully committed to the 100 Climate Neutral and Smart cities Mission since 2021.

The work on the CCC was carried out in conjunction with Dijon Metropole's Climate and Biodiversity Plan, in line with French regulatory frameworks and the development of our Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan (PCAET).

This commitment has acted as a catalyst for accelerating the planning of our climate neutrality policies to meet the project's standards, namely an 80% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030.

In addition, the NetZeroCities expert network allows us to address new challenges or go further in some areas, such as indicators, GHG monitoring, financing options, stakeholder engagement and multi-stakeholder commitment. The international network exchange also provides valuable insights through best practices implemented by other mission cities, offering concrete ideas for advancing toward climate neutrality.

In drafting the Climate City Contract, Dijon Metropole is committed to assuming its share of responsibility to attempt the neutrality in 2030. However, Dijon Métropole can act directly on less than 10% of the emissions emitted in the area, and achieving this highly ambitious goal requires the active involvement of various stakeholders both within and beyond the Metropolis:

Citizens and businesses to renovate buildings and adopt changes in mobility and consumption habits. More broadly, related sectors (e.g., construction) must keep pace with the necessary transitions in renovation and mobility.
The French government to enhance support for residential and tertiary building renovation, foster more sustainable mobility, and, more broadly, initiate major changes in laws and regulations across all levels to prioritize climate issues fully.
The European Union to further its efforts, not only by increasing financial support but also by implementing stricter climate regulations across all sectors and drastically limiting the use of fossil fuels.

There are several major barriers to be removed. These include:

The financial resources needed for the transition and the development of business models that make projects profitable,
The availability of human resources and the skills needed to carry out the projects,
The time needed to complete projects,
Social acceptability
More favourable regulations.

Our Metropole is committed to working closely with the stakeholders and institutional partners listed above to achieve the 100 Climate Neutral and Smart cities Mission objectives. However, given the current lack of guarantees from these stakeholders and institutional partners, Dijon Metropole has decided to exclude the industry, the agriculture and waste from its CCC to ensure a transparent and sincere commitment to achieving neutrality by 2030. Dijon Metropole will focus on the mobility, building and energy industry sectors, which account for more than 80% of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions. However, a strategy and an action plan have been defined for the other sectors up to 2030 in order to make progress in these sectors too.

In addition, Dijon Metropole has chosen to:

place the collapse of biodiversity on the same level as climate change.
DJON Alphaprote

address both mitigation and adaptation to climate change.
include sustainable food, the emissions from which come under scope 3.
include air quality issues.

If we want to achieve the climate and biodiversity transitions in a socially just and economically sustainable way, we need to be able to take account of the complexity of the issues to be addressed.

The complexity of the issues to be addressed and the need to take account of the interdependencies between multiple stakeholders require a systemic approach.

This systemic logic associates, groups and considers elements, focusing on interactions, unlike Cartesian analytical logic, which breaks down and compartmentalises by focusing on the detail and isolation of variables.

The systems approach is not based solely on the past but looks to the desired future to influence the present. It is based on key principles:

Interdependence, where each element is understood in its overall context.
Feedback or circular causality, where elements act on each other in a positive or negative way.
Resilience, which enables the system to return to its state of equilibrium after a disturbance.
Equifinality, which means that the same result can be achieved by different routes, even from different initial conditions.

New forms of cooperative working enable us to provide effective responses to systemic issues of general interest.

The effectiveness of new forms of cooperation will be demonstrated by observing the collective, environmental, social and economic benefits.

# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

With almost 260,000 inhabitants, Dijon metropole is seeing its population grow slowly. Comprising 23 communes, Dijon metropolitan area is located between Paris and Lyon on the Rhine-Rhone axis, close to Germany and Switzerland. It is a densely populated, urban area with 1,078 inhabitants per km2 and a central city with 1,468 inhabitants per km2.

Dijon Metropole has a wide range of skills that enable it to act directly or indirectly on its territory by mobilising local actors and inhabitants to massively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The main areas of responsibility are development and management of industrial and commercial zones, metropolitan spatial planning (territorial coherence plan (SCOT), local urban planning (PLU)), development operations of metropolitan interest, land reserves, organisation of mobility, development and maintenance of roads, car parks), housing policy (housing policy, financial aid and actions in favour of social housing and disadvantaged people), management of public services (water and sewerage, household waste collection and treatment, air pollution control, noise abatement, support for energy demand management, development and management of heating and cooling networks, electricity and gas distribution concessions, creation and maintenance of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, development council (a forum for consultation with local residents and socio-economic players)...

The Climate and Biodiversity Plan and the CCC are a single public policy implemented by Dijon Metropole. The form of the former has been adapted to comply with French regulations, while the latter has been adapted to meet the expectations of the European Commission as part of its mission to achieve 100 climate-neutral and intelligent cities by 2030.

The work carried out by Dijon Metropole to draw up its CCC and its Climate and Biodiversity Plan has benefited greatly from the 'double dynamic' to which the local authority is committed: that of the 100 climate-neutral and intelligent cities mission and that of FAASST, a project selected as part of the Pilot Cities Program.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Territorial diagnosis is the first stage of a Climate and Biodiversity Plan (PC&amp;B) and a CCC. The aim is to identify the territory's situation with regard to energy, climate and air quality issues. Dijon Metropole has chosen a methodology that enables the PC&amp;B to be drawn up on the basis of a diagnosis shared with and enriched by local players and residents.

The issues identified in this diagnosis have been enriched to define a local strategy based both on quantitative findings (analysis of air-energy-climate data) and local feedback from stakeholders.

The research dimension has therefore been fully embraced by a deliberately heterogeneous group of local players, from both the public and private sectors, who are highly motivated by the significance of the approach. The fact that the Dijon commitment was totally co-constructed and signed off by the partners is undoubtedly a unique feature.

This local combination of exploratory thinking and practical applications has enabled the group to seize on the framework proposed by Europe and adapt it finely to local realities to produce a new framework for cooperation, driven by a shared ambition to decarbonise our economy and combat the collapse of biodiversity.

On more regulatory aspects, with a constant concern for consistency between its policy documents, Dijon metropole has also endeavoured to assimilate its obligation to produce a PCAET (Plan Climat Air
Dijon Metropole

C

Energie Territorial - Territorial Climate and Energy Plan) into the dynamic pursued through the 100 cities programme.

For over a year and a half, Dijon has been working to ensure that all its actions are consistent with each other, and to structure the following three key documents:

The Climate and Biodiversity Plan, and its appendices meeting French regulatory requirements (technical and vulnerability assessments, trajectory, etc.), and those specifically structured to steer the transition operationally; The action plan, restructured to meet the European format, is a faithful reproduction of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan voted on.

Metropolitan Climate and Biodiversity Contract, our commitment, which will bring together the first twenty or so socio-economic players in the region to aggregate the actions planned by each and to measure their overall financial impact and the expected results in terms of the objectives of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan.

Territorial investment plan, prospective modelling of the financial trajectory of decarbonisation of the metropolitan area, etc.

Each document was the subject of a specific deliberation report, debated and voted on at the Metropolitan Council meeting in September 2024. This choice is strictly educational. The density of the subjects is such that it was deemed necessary to offer the assembly some breathing space to enable it to better grasp the approach and objectives. There were therefore 3 separate votes, but the overall coherence was ensured to steer the transition in a systemic way and to be able to be supported politically over time. The debates were of a very high quality.

Dijon Metropole's CCC is structurally based on the concatenation of these three deliberations.

The methodology deployed aims to synchronise expectations at national and European level, while preparing an operational framework for steering and monitoring the Climate and Biodiversity Plan. This innovative approach needs to be strengthened. It defines the methodological organisation of the work, from the design of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan to the steering of actions and monitoring. We see this document as a tool to facilitate the sharing of our experience at both national and European level.

Dijon Metropole's CCC aims to radically transform the projects carried out in the area in order to enhance their impact on the various objectives set out in the climate and biodiversity plan. The aim is to develop a methodology for the systemic challenge of projects based on:

the 14 expected systemic effects defined in the Climate and Biodiversity Plan, which are the operational expression of the objectives set,

the 5 systemic levers defined by NetZeroCities

the stakeholders to be mobilised and the possible forms of cooperation

the expected benefits defined by NetZeroCities: GHG &amp; energy, health &amp; environment, social, economic, resources and biodiversity the development of new economic models.

The aim of this approach is to develop portfolios of local projects.

DIJON METROPOLE

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Like all inter-municipal public bodies with more than 20,000 inhabitants, Dijon metropolitan area is required by law to draw up a 'Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan (PCAET)'. PCAETs must address both mitigation and adaptation issues, in the areas of climate, air and energy.

On 23 March 2023, the Metropolitan Council set the framework for the development of the 2024-2030 Climate and Biodiversity Plan: 'Dijon has been selected to take part in the Mission 100 climate-neutral and intelligent cities initiative, which aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. This is both European recognition of all the work undertaken by Dijon Metropole, and a clear political will to accelerate the energy transition in the region to combat climate change. The creation of the Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan (PCAET) is therefore an opportunity for our region to pursue this ambition and collectively build, with the residents and stakeholders, a desirable low-carbon city, while considering the economic and social challenges and relying on innovation'.

The objective of accelerating decarbonisation by 2030 also responds to the challenge of emitting as few greenhouse gases as possible and as soon as possible to reduce the cumulative effect of these gases in the atmosphere and thus increase the chances of keeping the rise in global temperatures below 2 degrees.

The major work carried out following the decision of March 2023 quickly confirmed the local authority's determination to consider the issues of global warming and the collapse of biodiversity on the same level and in the same way.

Dijon Metropole, with its pioneering commitment to climate change and biodiversity, has chosen to go far beyond French regulatory requirements to develop a global strategy that meets the challenges of climate change and biodiversity.

This strategic document integrates energy issues in an operational way, via the Energy Master Plan, to prefigure the management of transition projects.

It is also characterised by the importance of food. The food transition, through ProDij, is now one of the major policies supported by the city.

The Climate and Biodiversity Plan is built around three strategic axes - mitigation, adaptation and cooperation - and defines thirty strategic objectives that have been agreed and developed with a group of elected representatives responsible for the Climate and Biodiversity transition.

Following the deliberation in March 2023, a phase of consultation with the public will begin, with the gathering of opinions from the prefecture, the environmental authority, the Bourgogne Franche Comté region, NetZeroCities and the European Commission before a final vote scheduled for June 2025.

The local authority's priority was not to dissociate the different approaches and to present an overall strategic construction embodied by the Climate and Biodiversity Plan. The description of this political commitment ('Mandate to Act') has therefore been substantiated and constructed in a manner consistent with previous deliberations, and in line with the applicable regulatory constraints and the commitments made to the European Commission. This is why it was decided to draw up a single document with a structure adapted to all the issues at stake.

It is also why it was decided, in the context of the commitments made by Dijon Metropole to the European Commission, to structure an ambitious policy of accelerating and massifying actions built in cooperation with the players in the area, with an operational vision.

- Considering the results of the Pilot Cities project 'FAASST' (Facilitate, Accelerate, Support and Monitor the Transition) and the working dynamic with local stakeholders
DJON MERTOPOLE

The Climate and Biodiversity Plan's action plan will be continually enriched as part of the management of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan. The structure of the plan will also allow for the overall monitoring and evaluation of the large number of actions to be carried out under the plan, and particularly those resulting from the cooperative initiatives that will be launched and that will be a key factor in achieving the objectives. In this respect, the actions carried out by the socio-economic players involved in the Metropolitan Contract for Climate and Biodiversity will typically enrich the overall action plan.

This is entirely consistent with the iterative working framework implemented with the region's partners as part of the '100 Cities' and 'Pilot Cities' action research programmes. Ultimately, being able to objectify the financial amounts committed to the ecological transition on the scale of a significant number of players and relate them to an overall measurement of the carbon impact, or even the biodiversity impact, will make it possible to enhance the territorial dynamic and make it even more attractive to skills and investors.

As part of the governance aspect of the transition and the mobilisation of all the stakeholders expected in the Climate City Contract, Dijon metropole therefore wanted to explore new forms of cooperation with socio-economic players.

On this basis, an initial twenty or so socio-economic players from a wide range of backgrounds, influential in their sector and with strong local roots, were asked to commit themselves to a very pragmatic project with Dijon metropole: aggregating the actions envisaged by each of them in order to measure their overall financial impact and the expected results in terms of the objectives of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan. On this basis, the Metropolitan Climate and Biodiversity Contract is intended to be extended to new players who were mobilised as part of the call for low-carbon initiatives launched in February 2024.

The Metropolitan Climate and Biodiversity Contract has been structured and guided by the development of this kind of leadership approach. The description of this operational dynamic, 'Commitment', was therefore supported and built in line with the results of the discussions held with the area's socio-economic players, who ultimately formalised their interest by declaring actions and agreeing to have their actions compared with the expectations of the Climate Plan.

The development of new forms of cooperation aims to go beyond the sum of individual interests to collectively achieve the general interest objectives set out in the Climate and Biodiversity Plan.

- Considering programmatic expectations concerning public finances (constitution of a green budget) and regulatory expectations concerning extra-financial reporting for companies (compliance with the CSRD - Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive)

It is relatively complex to list, measure and quantify precisely the actions that contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, and/or to adaptation to changes in the climate and biodiversity, and to the fight against the collapse of biodiversity carried out by the players in the metropolitan area, including the actions carried out by Dijon Metropole.

To get around this difficulty, Dijon metropole has initiated an exploratory evaluation and costing method based on simplifying working hypotheses, founded on a scoring system for direct actions (works, investments, etc.) and indirect actions (communication, awareness-raising, etc.) weighted according to the systemic effects sought in the action sheets of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan.

This method differs from other costing methods available on several points
DIJON Metropole

It is a global approach: both climate and biodiversity are considered. Most of the figures available relate only to actions that contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This financial costing work is carried out in conjunction with the Climate and Biodiversity Plan's action plan.

It is an integrated approach: all costs are considered, including related costs that often add significantly to the cost of operations (landscaping of the project, treatment of rainwater, maintenance of ecological continuity, measures to support changes in use, etc.).

It's a bottom-up, iterative approach: the rating system is based on the operating costs observed by local players. It is not based solely on macro data broken down by region.

This method differs from other costing studies available, even though all the headings of the Investment Plan framework proposed by NetZeroCities have been studied. Nevertheless, it is a forward-looking exercise that fits in perfectly with the research-action dynamic supported by the European Commission.

It should be noted that this approach was the subject of a presentation and discussions with I4CE - Institute for Climate Economics and with its president Jean Pisani-Ferry, French economist and author of the report on the economic impact of climate action submitted to the Prime Minister in 2023, and aroused interest.

As part of the iterative approach proposed for both the Climate and Biodiversity Plan and the Metropolitan Contract for Climate and Biodiversity, the parameters and calculation method will be discussed on an ongoing basis, to regularly consolidate the assessment of the financial trajectory.

The aim of the method is to create a systemic tool that can be used to put an approximate but coherent figure on the actions to be carried out in the metropolitan area by all the stakeholders, and to give an idea of the financial efforts made and to be made, their scope and their effectiveness in achieving the objectives set out in the Climate and Biodiversity plan.

For example, it will make it possible to estimate the costs that could be borne over time by residents, socio-economic players and local authorities, and to identify the associated funding requirements. It will also provide a means of comparing actions against the objectives of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan.

This tool is in no way to be compared with budgetary programming but rather is intended to be a decision-making tool for steering and coordinating the metropolitan area's Climate and Biodiversity Plan. This is how it differs from the Investment Plan proposed by Net Zero Cities. It attempts to take a global approach to the issue, making the financial trajectory a lever for action rather than a brake.

The investment plan is based on private investment initiatives, the pace of which depends on the standard of living, purchasing power, financial capacity and national policies. The results have a de facto impact on the targets set for 2030.

# 5 - 2030 climate neutrality target

To meet the commitments made as part of the 100 climate-neutral and intelligent cities by 2030 mission, Dijon Metropole will focus on the mobility, building and energy industry sectors, which account for more than 80% of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions.

DIJON METROPOLE

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

Dijon Métropole is a predominantly urban area whose economic activity is mainly in the tertiary sector. This is why the three main sectors together emit more than 80% of the area's greenhouse gas emissions.

The targets take account of the low population growth, which has an impact on the residential, tertiary and transport sectors.

Two scenarios have been developed:

an ambitious scenario: the entire CCC has been built on the basis of this scenario, which is the result of a co-construction process involving local players and residents.

a neutrality scenario: In drawing up the Climate City Contract, Dijon Métropole undertook to assume its share of responsibility in an attempt to achieve neutrality by 2030. However, Dijon Métropole can act directly on less than 10% of the emissions emitted in the area, and achieving this very ambitious objective requires the active involvement of various players inside and outside the Metropole. Although it has not yet been possible to draw up an action plan to meet this objective, the neutrality scenario has been quantified and Dijon Métropole undertakes to work on consolidating it and implementing it as soon as possible.

The reasons for excluding 3 sectors are:

Agriculture: This sector accounts for very little greenhouse gas emissions in the metropolitan area, due to the small proportion of the territory devoted to agriculture. Dijon metropole is committed to an ambitious policy on sustainable food for 2030, which covers all sectors of food, from producer to consumer, and aims to increase the consumption of local regional products. It turns out that the metropolitan area's scope is too narrow given the consumption issues involved, which is why the objectives are set at regional level.

Industry: This sector accounts for 13% of employment, with almost 12,000 salaried jobs, and has a moderate impact on the region's greenhouse gas emissions. Jobs are mainly distributed around 40 main production sites (Safran, Schneiders, Urgo, Chocolotaterie de Bourgogne, Tetrapack, etc.). The rest of the jobs are very fragmented. Three sectors predominate: health, agri-food, electrical engineering and electronics. Industrial companies are grouped together in 6 business parks in the area. In this sector, Dijon Metropole has very few levers for action on industrial processes, the products of which benefit a much wider area than the metropolitan area. However, priorities have been identified in this sector around the issues of mobility and the production of renewable and recycled energy, sectors covered by the CCC. In addition, the energy efficiency policy for industrial buildings, which account for little of the emissions from this sector, has been included in the action plan due to the creation of a joint action sheet for the tertiary and industrial sectors in this area. Finally, the two sectors of health and agri-food are the subject of ambitious policies: agri-food, already mentioned in the context of the agriculture sector, and health, with a strong focus on the development of biotechnologies.

Waste: France has developed a policy of closing household waste dumps in favour of incinerators. Dijon Metropole, which has a high environmental performance incinerator, has developed several partnerships with neighbouring areas to enable them to have their waste incinerated while limiting the construction of new incinerators. In addition, the Dijon metropolitan area incinerator treats all the region's medical waste. As a result, greenhouse gas emissions from the waste sector far exceed the emissions linked to the region's activities. And while greenhouse gas emissions from the waste sector are increasing in the Dijon metropolitan area due to the treatment of waste from neighbouring areas resulting from new partnerships, on a regional scale it is reducing the impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and promoting numerous co-benefits in terms of biodiversity, soil, waste management, etc.

Although the neutrality objectives relate to the three sectors identified, as part of Dijon metropole's climate and biodiversity plan strategy, whose scope is broader than that of the Climate City Contract, a strategy and quantified objectives have been set, and action sheets have been produced.

# 6 - key stakeholders to be mobilised to achieve climate neutrality by 2030

To achieve the objectives of carbon neutrality, Dijon metropole wishes to involve the main players concerned by the territory's carbon neutrality objectives, grouped into 5 categories:

Communes and institutional players: this includes the 23 communes that make up the metropolis, public-sector players, the Département, the Region, government departments, etc.
Private socio-economic players: including businesses, trade unions and professional organisations, associations, etc.
Residents and users
Communes and extra-territorial institutional players: this includes the communes and intercommunal bodies of the urban area, which represents Dijon metropole's catchment area, European Union, and so on.
Extra-territorial private socio-economic players: this includes companies, associations and private structures from outside the metropolis, but which may have an impact on the decarbonisation of the Territory.

# A cooperation strategy has been drawn up to accelerate the region's climate transition

Cooperation is one of the 3 pillars of the climate and biodiversity plan.

Dijon Metropole, a local authority facilitating the transition

The global dimension of the climate and biodiversity crises, and their profoundly systemic causes, justify an appropriate positioning of the metropolis.

As an organization, it must naturally commit to reducing the impact of its own activity on global warming and biodiversity loss. Its status encourages it to set an example, but also to research and innovate in ways of limiting this impact.

As a public institution with numerous powers and prerogatives, it has the capacity to act, whether directly in organizing its service offering, or more indirectly by adopting rules and regulations that constrain or accompany change, or by developing information and awareness-raising efforts aimed at the general public.

But however important our commitment may be in these two areas, they will only be part of the region's response to the many challenges it faces, which require everyone, from residents to socio-economic players, to get involved to the best of their abilities.
DIJON Metropole

The metropolis must also act on these capacities. First and foremost, it must help to make everyone aware of these capabilities, and then it must strive to make the most of them, by creating links between players, supporting initiatives and promoting them.

It is the combination of these roles that makes Dijon Metropole a facilitator of the transition.

It is this approach that has attracted the attention of Europe as part of the "100 towns" and "Pilot towns" programs, of which Dijon Metropole is a stakeholder.

The idea is to consider that local authorities will only have control over part of the transition levers, and that it is only through a strong and coordinated mobilization of all players, public and private, that the human, technological and financial challenges will be met in an efficient and sustainable way.

## Data, research and innovation at the heart of cooperation

Embarking on a path to transform our lifestyles and economic models cannot be done without knowledge, benchmarks and guidelines.

Knowledge, research and innovation are essential to guide our decisions and pursue our progress.

The phenomena involved are highly complex. Nevertheless, everyone - elected representatives, socio-economic players and the general public - needs to be able to understand them.

Data is essential to objectify trajectories, measure the effects of policies and better understand phenomena. Sharing it is essential.

Innovation is not just technological, it's also social. We need to develop new technical solutions to problems as much as we need to create new forms of social cooperation. 77

## Shared governance

**Objective 1: Develop and strengthen forums for cooperation and the construction of responses**

With the development of this climate and biodiversity plan and the European 100 Towns and Pilot Town programs, the metropolis has set in motion an unprecedented movement of local socio-economic players and residents.

This dynamic needs to be nurtured and structured so that it produces responses.

Beyond the desirable, consultation must bring out the possible. Concertation must have an operational focus, concentrating as often as possible on impact-related issues with tenable objectives.

However, we also need to explore new forms of cooperation and links between players, in order to tap new potential and boost efficiency. This is particularly true of partnerships between the public and private sectors.

This is the ground on which we need to build a genuine shared engineering approach to transition in our region.

**Objective 2: Support public policy through science, research and innovation**

Today, our region benefits from a long tradition of cooperation between the community and places of knowledge and research.
Dijon Metropole

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

It's an asset we need to cultivate if we are to preserve our ability to base public policy choices on a solid knowledge base.

Science and innovation are essential to human progress. The challenges of the ecological transition also bring us back to these fundamentals.

It is with this in mind that Dijon Metropole is involved in European research and innovation programs and national university research programs.

These programs nurture knowledge and support a spirit of openness and innovation that must be widely shared.

## Extra-territorial coopération

Dijon Metropole, the regional capital, occupies a unique position within the department and the region.

Its dynamic population, economy, university and top-ranking schools are major assets for the region.

Urban, peri-urban and rural areas interact very strongly on a daily basis. Far from the oppositions that are artificially maintained, the reciprocities are real. We need to bring them out into the open and reinforce them.

Food, energy, waste treatment, ecological continuity and mobility (particularly commuting and logistics) are major priorities for our regions, and we need to know how to tackle them within a broad, structured partnership framework.

For these issues, which in reality know no administrative boundaries in the day-to-day lives of local residents, the State, Region, Département, SCOT, EPCI and Metropolis must be able to engage in closer cooperation.

Similarly, when it comes to economic and industrial development, alliances need to be forged with a broader territorial vision, as in the case of the "Bourgogne Industrie" project, to pool engineering resources and carry out projects on a larger scale - this is the whole point of the metropolitan engine.

**Objective 1: Build strategic alliances for the gradual relocation of certain sectors of economic activity**

The global economy's long-standing trend towards relocation is being called into question by the challenges posed by the ecological transition. However, ecological transition can also be an opportunity to strengthen the resilience of territories and relocate part of their economic flows.

This general trend towards relocation of all or part of the production process has led to a major disconnect between our metropolis and local production capacity. This is particularly true in the food sector, but other sectors could benefit from a reorientation of demand coupled with a reorganization of supply. The development of renewable energies is one example, the data economy another.

**Objective 2: Strengthen reciprocity between territories**

Sharing value around the challenges of food, ecological continuity, energy, construction and mobility must drive and guide the strengthening of cooperative approaches already underway.

The development of short food circuits, renewable energies, short bio-sourced materials chains and new mobility solutions, are subjects of common interest shared by urban, peri-urban and rural areas
Dijon Metropole

which are intrinsically a source of reciprocity. Stimulating and enhancing this dynamic will also contribute to social cohesion. 79

In this respect, Dijon Metropole would like to work on a more regular basis with the territories of the urban area that are affected by its policies, in order to reinforce mutual benefits. This is particularly true in the areas of food and mobility.

## Mobilization

Residents are naturally at the heart of our concerns, and therefore of our approach.

They need to be informed, made aware, trained, mobilized, involved... and listened to. Visions are necessarily diverse, if not divergent, but they need to be understood and taken into account, in order to set the best trajectory, one that offers everyone the possibility of committing themselves in their own way and building their own path.

This free will must be respected, this power to act must be stimulated, but it must also be nourished with the knowledge necessary for everyone to fully grasp the issues at stake, based in particular on the principles of popular education.

Finally, the commitment and involvement of local residents must be expressed in a wide variety of settings, from the most formal to the most informal, in order to maintain an ongoing dialogue that drives change.

**Objective:** To inform, report on and actively mobilize all residents and socio-economic players in order to consolidate actions on the territory and increase their impact.

Faced with the reality of eco-anxiety or feelings of powerlessness, it's essential to make visible the reality of the progress that is being made every day, by everyone, and which places our territory among the leading territories in the transition at European level.

Regularly reporting on the concrete results of our policies, which can lead to new constraints in the daily lives of residents and stakeholders, is also essential if changes are to make sense.

We therefore need to make a special effort to produce and share reliable, easy-to-read data that shows the concrete results of our actions and the overall trend in which the metropolitan area is moving.

## Sharing knowledge and skills

**Objective 1:** Build and share a common culture of climate and biodiversity in the Territory

Working to ensure that the technicality and complexity of the issues at stake do not make them a subject for specialists only is a major democratic challenge.

Clearly, the issues of global warming and the collapse of biodiversity are particularly demanding in terms of scientific knowledge. What's more, this knowledge is constantly evolving and progressing.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

This knowledge must be made accessible to the general public. The metropolitan area has all the assets needed to achieve this ambition: a history that sets the standard for the popularization of science through the invention of the "experimentarium", a rich and active network of researchers involved in the fields of ecological transition, and an extensive network of popular education players.

A constant effort must be made to ensure that a common culture of transition is established and disseminated. The creation of a popular university on climate and biodiversity will meet this objective.

In this respect, the world of culture undoubtedly also has a major role to play. Through storytelling, aesthetics, the diversity of media and the sensitive approach it offers, culture has always had a place in human societies, helping them to get through crises. The commitment of local cultural players, for the benefit of as many people as possible, will be an essential resource in accelerating the transition.

## Objective 2: Share and promote experience to accelerate the transition

There are many positive and virtuous initiatives in the region. The need for acceleration encourages greater pooling and sharing of experience.

In fact, showing what's being done is a powerful mobilizing force, and better knowledge of what's being done can help improve the ability to measure overall results.

The sheer number and diversity of projects means that new cooperative tools need to be deployed to link players and aggregate technical and financial data relating to project implementation.

Such tools have two main benefits: they help to bring people together and pool resources (particularly technical and financial), and they generate a knock-on effect by showing what's possible.

## Steering the climate and biodiversity plan

The principle of federative governance is enshrined in the metropolitan project. The Climate and Biodiversity Plan will be implemented within this framework and mindset.

The Metropolis is rich in the diversity of the players who make it up, who live it and make it live. The spirit of cooperation, collective intelligence and the ambition to live well together will be the main drivers of the ecological transition.

Finally, governance means dialogue, with everyone and between everyone. It was at the heart of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan, and will be at the heart of its implementation.

## Internal management

Internal governance, both political and administrative, and the link with all local elected representatives, takes climate and biodiversity issues into account in a structured way.

The community's administrative organization has been adjusted, as has its political governance, to give greater strength and scope to this plan.
DJON Alphaprote

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

In 2023, a general direction delegated to the climate transition has been created. Its mission is to create the conditions for the coherent implementation of all the city's sectoral policies. To this end, it is piloting the biodiversity strategy, the food strategy and the European 100 Cities and Pilot Cities projects, in view of their systemic dimension.

Implementation of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan will be monitored by this department through three bodies set up and mobilized during the plan's development phase: the Group of elected representatives, the Climate and Biodiversity Technical Committee and the internal Steering Committee.

The Group of elected representatives meets before each meeting of the Metropolitan Council. It is chaired by the vice-president in charge of ecological transition and brings together elected representatives whose delegations are directly linked to ecological issues (biodiversity, water, food, etc.). Its scope may, however, vary according to the issues addressed. During these meetings, a link is established between elected representatives and the executive management team in charge of climate transition. In particular, strategic orientations are discussed before being proposed to the executive. A progress report on work and actions in progress is also provided. The Climate and Biodiversity Technical Committee, which also meets three times a year, is a cross-functional technical body chaired by the Executive Vice President for Climate Transition, and comprising directors and department heads representing all the local authority's delegated departments. It is at the technical heart of the emergence and consolidation of a systemic vision of the local authority's actions.

The Climate and Biodiversity Plan Internal Steering Committee meets once a year, two months before the Monitoring Committee. This internal Steering Committee ensures that technical information is effectively fed into the local authority's management, enabling informed strategic decision-making.

In addition to these bodies, the position of the executive vice-president in the organization chart provides a continuous link with general management as a whole, the executive and the various political bodies.

The mutualization scheme also needs to be strengthened in terms of climate and biodiversity, so that all the communes making up the metropolis can benefit from common engineering, shared experience and skills, and can cooperate to bring projects to fruition. The management of the region's vulnerabilities must also be structured within this framework.

## Attention paid to the involvement of local players

The involvement of every player, every inhabitant, in his or her own way and with his or her own capacities, is essential to make the transition a success and preserve the quality of life and economic dynamism of our metropolis and neighboring areas.

The metropolis intends to make this commitment possible for everyone, and to make the most of it by creating links, making some a resource or a source of inspiration for others, and supporting pooling, partnerships and cooperative ventures...
Dijon Metropole

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

But this involvement must be structured and controlled.

Dijon Metropole's determination to mobilize a wide range of people around the development and implementation of the ecological transition is bearing fruit. The circle of players involved is now significantly enlarged around a number of flagship projects, in particular:

The Metropolitan Contract for Climate and Biodiversity (European 100 cities program)
The European Pilot City program
The food transition strategy, ProDij

These three policies, which are structuring for the region, have in common that they pay particular attention to mobilizing local residents, involving research players and bringing together the public and private sectors.

Many other projects mobilize a broad partnership around the metropolis, and such mobilization calls for a high level of vigilance when it comes to managing all these bodies and the "dialogue of productions".

The purpose of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan Monitoring Committee, a very broad and open body, is to synthesize all this work and action, and to contribute to its sharing. The Monitoring Committee meets annually and brings together local experts, qualified individuals, companies, socio-economic players, civil servants, elected representatives and local authority managers. Its aim is to inform and share information on the progress of cooperative ventures, while addressing both Territorial Engineering and concrete projects. The meeting offers a global and inclusive vision of climate and biodiversity actions, combining the local authority's in-house expertise with that of external local players.

A detailed list of the various bodies and their participants can be found in the appendix. In addition to these meetings, ongoing communication must also be organized.

Stimulating these cooperative ventures, crossing certain boundaries (public/private in particular), is an essential resource for the transition.

## Financing the transition

In its report of April 17, 2024, the Inspectorate General of Finance estimates the cost of the investments needed to make the ecological transition a success at 21 billion euros a year between now and 2030 for local authorities; 6 billion euros a year for adapting and preserving ecosystems, 15 billion euros a year for reducing emissions.

In this scenario, the cost of the transition would represent 40% of the community's capital expenditure, according to the same report.

While work is progressing on quantifying the expenditure involved, the methods of financing such amounts remain unclear, at a time when local authorities' room for manoeuvre has been steadily

shrinking in recent years, and access to State and Regional funding has become more complex overall.

While this situation reinforces the local authority's determination to strengthen the region's ability to attract private funding, it also calls for great caution in the choice of priorities and, to this end, for the ongoing strengthening of its financial management and assessment tools.

With this in mind, Dijon Metropole has set up a consultancy and evaluation department which integrates both environmental management control (2024 Innovation Prize on environmental management dialogue) and public policy evaluation functions.

What's more, the Finance Department has already been able to experiment with budget rating tools, which puts the metropolis in a very favourable position for the forthcoming implementation of green budgets. In view of its level of maturity in this field, it is also regularly involved in work carried out by various private and public bodies on the subject.

The Climate City Contract

The Climate City Contract, which will be proposed to the European Commission as part of the "100 climate-neutral and intelligent cities" program, is a document that combines:

The climate and biodiversity plan, which presents the metropolitan strategy and specifies the conditions for mobilizing residents
The metropolitan contract for climate and biodiversity, which represents a first level of shared commitment between the metropolis and socio-economic players. It is an experimental approach that is intended to be operational and to be extended to other willing socio-economic players.
Assessment of a territorial financial trajectory for the transition. Based on all our work, this is an attempt to territorialize a possible financial trajectory for a successful transition, at the level of all players.

Based on the 100 Climate City Contracts it receives, Europe will have an improved vision of the role of cities in the transition, enabling it to better guide its support measures.

# 2.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

# GhG Emissions Baseline inventory

The scope 1 and 2 emissions inventory of the climate and biodiversity plan covers the entire metropolitan area and all sectors: buildings, mobility, energy industry, industry, waste and agriculture.

The methodology used is issued by the national taskforce for the standardization of territorial emission inventories ("Pôle de Coordination national sur les Inventaires d'émission Territoriaux - PCIT). This taskforce is managed by the department of Energy and Climate from the ministry of environment (Direction Générale de l'Energie et du Climat (DGEC) and is composed mainly of the ATMO federation (national federation of air quality monitoring networks), the CITEPA and the INERIS. The guides produced by this taskforce ensures the proper application of the reference methods form the IPCC in the production of local / territorial data and the consistency of the GHG emissions between regional districts and the national scale.

The inventory of greenhouse gas emissions covers all areas of the metropolitan's activities, including scope 1 and 2: buildings (tertiary &amp; residential), mobility, energy industry, manufacturing industry, waste and agriculture. This inventory is completed by the production of a carbon footprint, known as the Territory's carbon balance, incorporating scope 3.

The transport, buildings and energy industry sectors will account for 80% of the region's greenhouse gas emissions in 2022.

Between 2010 and 2022, greenhouse gas emissions will have been reduced by 23%. However, there are major disparities between sectors. The residential sector has seen its greenhouse gas emissions fall by 41%, while the transport sector has seen its greenhouse gas emissions stagnate.

The Dijon Metropole's carbon footprint, including direct and indirect emissions linked to the region's activities (scopes 1, 2 and 3).

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Bilan carbone du territoire de Dijon Métropole : 5 187 féqCO2

The Territory carbon footprint has been assessed for the year 2022. Its aim is to go beyond the cadastral vision of the territorial inventory of direct emissions and identify the territory's dependence on "imported emissions". The aim is to identify additional levers for action by integrating the complete life cycle of products, so as to be able to act on all our activities.

The carbon footprint therefore includes not only the greenhouse gas emissions emitted directly on the site, but also all the greenhouse gas emissions directly linked to the company's activity and for which it has a significant share of responsibility. In this way, indirect greenhouse gas emissions, known as Scope 3 emissions, are included:

Travel outside our territory (e.g. our air travel for vacations or the transport of goods we buy).
The manufacture of our goods outside our territory (e.g. the manufacture of our washing machine and our car in Asia),
The production of our food (for example: the production of the Spanish vegetables we eat, the industrial manufacture of our yoghurts...).
DIJON Metropole

The scope is detailed as follows:

Direct emissions, divided into 8 sub-items. These include all the emission categories of a regulatory PCAET: road transport, non-road transport, residential, tertiary, industry, energy industry, waste treatment and agriculture;
Indirect emissions, divided into 6 sub-items: "upstream energy" GHG emissions, due to the extraction of materials (oil, gas), their transport and processing; transport outside Dijon Metropole with a link to the territory (cars and trucks to and from the metropolis); building construction (in 2022); amortization of road construction; emissions outside the metropolis due to food; emissions linked to the various consumption habits of residents.

% of our greenhouse gas emissions are emitted outside the region. Emissions linked to the transport of goods to Dijon Metropole represent almost half of the territory's overall carbon footprint, and 62% if we add the transport of people by car or plane.

We can immediately see that freight represents a major challenge for decarbonization.

With a share of 10% and 8% respectively in the overall balance sheet, food and consumer goods are the two largest emission sectors after transport.

These three sectors are as much a part of our everyday purchasing habits as they are of supply, but they are as dependent on demand as they are on supply.

It should be noted that construction accounts for only 2% of total emissions in mainland France.

To built the ambitious scenario, 3 trajectories have been drawn up:

The co-constructed trajectory resulting from the workshops and co-constructed and technically consolidated by the various internal bodies of the metropolis

The trajectory of regional objectives

The trajectory of national objectives, in line with the European objectives of -55% greenhouse gas emissions by 2030

The trajectory has been constructed on the basis of actions to be implemented, in order to make it as realistic as possible, even if it is already extremely ambitious.

For each sector, levers have been identified and their impact quantified in terms of both energy consumption and greenhouse gases.

To achieve our mobility objectives, we will need to:

Reduce mobility flows by 10%, while maintaining heavy goods vehicle flows, which are currently forecast to increase by 10% if we follow the trend.
Reduce commuter traffic by 10,000 vehicles per day (construction of transport hubs, etc.).
15% modal shift to cycling, walking and public transport
10% conversion to electro-mobility
Smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles are favoured over SUVs
Improving heat engines

To achieve our buildings objectives, we will need to:

15% renewable energy in the gas network
25% reduction in gas consumption (thermal renovation, condensing boilers, etc.).
5% reduction in electricity consumption (uses other than heating) including electrification of uses

DIJON
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

20% reduction in energy consumption for heating purposes
Elimination of petroleum products for heating purposes

To achieve our energy industry objectives, we will need to:

16% increase in energy consumption by the district heating network and 10% increase in the proportion of renewable energies.
Massive development of renewable energies (all the region's major projects have been identified, listed and assessed in terms of their impact on the climate)

The costed levers were then reallocated to each action sheet.

On this basis, the action portfolios are then drawn up with the local players. The main actions identified were included in each action sheet, along with an assessment of their quantified impact. (see table of expected impacts by action sheet page 233)

The work of quantifying the actions must continue in order to complete the portfolios of actions drawn up.

# 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

Dijon Métropole places cooperation at the heart of its action to promote climate change.

This is why Dijon Métropole has decided to apply consecutively to two programmes:

The European '100 climate-neutral and intelligent cities' programme, to benefit from the framework and expertise needed to structure our actions.
The Pilot Cities programme, to work on cooperation mechanisms to create new territorial engineering and new territorial governance.

Cooperation is built within a structured framework that is conducive to innovation and 'action research', making Dijon Métropole a centre for experimentation and innovation.

# Systemic obstacles and opportunities to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 and reduce pressure on ecosystems

Climate issues, like biodiversity issues, are systemic in nature. In other words, they involve a considerable number of factors and an equally considerable number of interactions between these factors.

Territorial scales are extremely intertwined (from local to global), institutional competencies overlap, multiple players are involved and social and economic sensitivities are very high, not to mention the intergenerational nature of an issue for which today's actions will most of the time only have a real effect on the next generation.

Faced with such complexity, there are many obstacles to overcome. The following table highlights some of the obstacles identified, and suggests levers for action.

|  Barriers | Levers  |
| --- | --- |
|  Financing actions: Implementation by the city, local players or residents | Development of innovative financing solutions, particularly in partnership with private investors  |
|  Silo structure prevents the emergence of partnership projects between players and a systemic approach to the area. | Strengthening cooperation  |
|  Project completion times difficult to reconcile with the short times required by climate and biodiversity issues | Anticipate the launch of major projects Phasing major projects and highlighting perceptible milestones  |
|  The limit of human capacity to absorb major changes | Diversify transition solutions and evolve practices over time  |
|  Partial understanding and complexity of local issues and actions | Sharing knowledge Strengthen communication and awareness-raising and help practices evolve over time  |
|  Complexity of implementation due to different political decision-making levels (Communal, Intercommunal, Departmental, Regional, National and European) | Strengthening links and cooperation between different decision-making levels  |
|  Density of projects to be completed in a short space of time | Implement realistic project planning  |

|  Difficulty of access and lack of skills linked to data, methodological differences between players, construction of different indicators which makes it difficult for players to work together. | Development of shared solutions  |
| --- | --- |
|  Importance of the number of players and residents involved in the climate transition to achieve objectives | Rely on volunteers and implement a long-term commitment strategy, diversifying mobilization partners and approaches.
Developing shared solutions  |
|  The climate transition requires a great deal of research and innovation. | Strengthen capacity to work on innovative projects  |
|  A number of issues go beyond the geographical boundaries of the region | Developing extra-territorial cooperation  |
|  A system of standards that has not been updated, slowing down the deployment of high-impact actions (e.g., the sizing of installations must now take into account the climatic rigor defined several years earlier). | Lobbying for changes to current standards  |
|  Instability and volatility of energy prices | Mutualized approach, setting up collective self-consumption systems, with long-term purchase contracts, storage systems and energy management systems.  |
|  Recruitment difficulties in the transition professions | Attractiveness and training of new professions or evolution of existing professions  |
|  National regulations | Lobbying to change laws  |
|  Public procurement contracts do not allow us to promote the purchase of local products and to work on local and sustainable supply chains (e.g. food products). | Allow local authorities to make food purchases by mutual agreement, using short, sustainable channels.  |

# Systemic transition management:

On regulatory aspects, Dijon métropole has endeavored to assimilate its obligation to draw up a PCAET into the dynamic pursued through the 100 towns program.

The work of aligning all actions has resulted in the structuring of the following three key documents:

Climate and Biodiversity Plan, and its appendices meeting French regulatory expectations (technical and vulnerability diagnosis, trajectory, etc.), and those specifically structured to steer the transition operationally (energy master plan, etc.),

Metropolitan Climate and Biodiversity Contract, which federates the first twenty or so socio-economic players in the region to aggregate the actions envisaged by each and to measure their overall financial impact and expected results in relation to the objectives of the Pan Climat et Biodiversité,

Plan d'Investissement Territoriale (Territorial Investment Plan), a forward-looking model of the financial trajectory of decarbonization in the metropolitan area.

The link between the approaches are organized as follows:
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Dijon métropole's CCC is structurally based on the concatenation of these three documents.

Dijon Métropole's CCC aims to transform the projects carried out in the area in order to enhance their impact on the various objectives set out in the Climate and Biodiversity Plan. The aim is to build a **systemic project challenge** methodology based on :

the 14 expected effects defined in the Climate and Biodiversity plan :

The expected effects represent all the concrete transformations that the region aims to achieve through its climate and environmental strategy. They are expressed through fourteen areas of intervention in the ecological transition.

Identifying and analyzing expected effects plays a crucial role in understanding and optimizing the territorial approach. By systematically examining the potential impacts of each action, this approach **highlights the co-benefits** that may emerge from different interventions.

This systemic vision of effects enables us to **identify and maximize synergies** between different actions, optimizing the overall effectiveness of the regional strategy. It also helps to justify investments by demonstrating the multiplicity of benefits generated, over and above direct climatic impacts alone.

The 5 systemic levers represent the driving forces capable of initiating and sustaining territorial transformation.

Systemic levers are the fundamental transformation mechanisms that make the ecological and climate transition a reality. They manifest themselves through five complementary dimensions: technological solutions, which provide concrete technical answers; governance, which establishes the regulatory and political framework; social innovation, which encourages the adoption of new behaviors; economic and legal models, which ensure the viability of projects; and the development of sectors and capacities, which guarantees the sustainability of transformations. These levers do not operate in isolation, but work together to create a multiplier effect on local transformation.

The purpose of these systemic levers lies in their ability to **structure territorial action in line with strategic reference documents**. They serve as a reading and analysis grid for assessing the robustness of projects with regard to the objectives of the climate plan and other structuring policy frameworks. By examining each project through the prism of these five levers, territorial players can ensure that their initiatives mobilize the dimensions required for sustainable transformation.

This approach also makes it possible to **consolidate an overall vision of territorial projects**, by identifying how each initiative contributes to the various dimensions of transition, and by pinpointing any gaps that need to be filled. Systemic levers thus act as an interface between the strategic vision conveyed by framework documents and the operational implementation of projects on the ground.

This multi-levers approach recognizes that the ecological transition cannot succeed through technical innovation or regulation alone, but requires the coordinated activation of different modes of transformation. Levers act as catalysts which, together, remove barriers to implementation and create the conditions for systemic change.

The expected benefits defined by NetZeroCities: GHG &amp; energy, health &amp; environment, social, economic, resources and biodiversity

The quest for carbon neutrality is not just an environmental constraint, but generates multiple, mutually reinforcing benefits. Identifying and highlighting the benefits transforms the perception of the ecological transition, from a binding obligation to a genuine opportunity for more balanced and resilient territorial development.

The expected effects, systemic action levers and expected benefits of NZC are integrated into a systemic transition management system.

# - The systemic transition management system

The strength of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan, and thus of the CCC, lies in its systemic approach, which articulates these different components in a coherent overall logic. By linking strategic and domain objectives to concrete actions through expected effects and systemic levers, it creates a solid and comprehensive approach to action. The results of the latter are monitored and evaluated, enabling the approach to be adjusted on an ongoing basis.

In this way, we can move beyond traditional sectoral approaches to adopt a systemic vision of the climate transition. On this basis, the actions needed to achieve the CCC's objectives are designed and implemented.

These different stakeholders all play a part in achieving the objectives of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan. All the stakeholders in each of these categories can be considered partners in the climate transition, the Transition Team. The following diagram (D2) highlights the mapping of key players in the climate transition in the categories identified in Diagram 1 (D1: Categories of players involved).

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
D2: Mapping of key players

The different categories and mapping of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan's partners in the two preceding diagrams (D1, D2) provide a clear representation of the governance framework set up to design and implement the Plan.

Several levels of governance are involved, from local to regional and European. Through various bodies - Cosui, Copil CMCB, POC and workshops - all territorial and extra-territorial players participate in the governance of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan (represented in blue). Dijon métropole has its own internal governance and steering bodies (shown in pink). All the key bodies are presented in part C-1.

The PC&amp;B governance framework is complex. It brings together different levels of players and decision-making structures, with a view to multi-level coordination and cooperation. Dijon métropole is determined to involve all stakeholders in the development and implementation of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan, to ensure its appropriation and effectiveness across the metropolitan territory, and to continually challenge and enrich this approach.

In terms of internal governance, within Dijon metropole, the Executive Directorate for Climate Transition (DGD) plays a central role in the governance and management of the PC&amp;B. This DGD brings together several key departments that play an essential role in the effective implementation of the Plan.

The project team brings together a wide range of complementary expertise to coordinate and lead strategic actions, while ensuring a cross-functional approach. The DGD also works closely with other metropolitan departments to ensure that climate and biodiversity objectives are integrated into all public policies and metropolitan projects.

In conclusion, the implementation of Dijon Métropole's Climate and Biodiversity Plan (PC&amp;B) is based on organized, systemic management, involving a variety of players and skills to meet the complex challenges of ecological transition. The approach implemented highlights strategic goals, expected results, systemic levers and expected benefits, while encouraging cooperation between various decision-making scales and partners on the territory. This dynamic ensures coherent, global action in line with the objectives of carbon neutrality and safeguarding biodiversity.

Given the complexity of the challenges and the interdependence between the various players and scales involved, the option of cooperaiton has emerged as a strategic requirement. The next section will explain in detail why this cooperative approach was chosen.

# A systemic and cooperative climate and biodiversity plan

To achieve socially just and economically sustainable transitions in climate and biodiversity, we need to take into account the complexity of the issues involved.

The complexity of the issues to be addressed, and the need to take into account the interdependencies between multiple stakeholders, require a systemic working approach.

This systemic logic associates, groups and considers elements as a whole, focusing on interactions, unlike Cartesian analytical logic, which breaks down and compartmentalizes, focusing on the detail and isolation of variables.

The systemic approach doesn't just draw on the past, but looks to the desired future to influence the present. It is based on key principles:

Interdependence, where each element is understood in its overall context;
Feedback or circular causality, where elements act on each other in positive or negative ways;
Resilience, which enables the system to return to its state of equilibrium after a disturbance;
Equifinality, which enables the same result to be achieved via different paths, even from different initial conditions.

New forms of cooperative work enable us to provide effective responses to systemic issues of general interest.

The effectiveness of new forms of cooperation will be demonstrated by observing the collective, environmental, social and economic benefits.

Thus, for a socially just and economically sustainable transition, cooperative working is a strategic choice. This choice has nevertheless been studied in order to identify the barriers it helps to overcome and the benefits it brings.

## Obstacles overcome by cooperative work

Cooperation overcomes a number of structural barriers that currently restrict the effectiveness and scope of measures and actions taken.

First, cooperation overcomes the lack of coordination between the various players involved in the PC&amp;B, which is often limited by a silo-based organization. By encouraging the creation of networks and dialogue between stakeholders, it optimizes communication, reduces misunderstanding and accelerates the transmission of information. It also helps to prevent duplication of effort, harmonize priorities and ensure that decisions are relevant and consistent.

Cooperation also helps to overcome competition between projects and encourages synergies between existing initiatives. The coordination of actions and the pooling of resources, particularly financial resources, enable a more efficient use of resources. This global approach amplifies the effect of measures, while extending their scope and relevance.

Finally, cooperation simplifies the monitoring and evaluation of measures and actions. Exchanging data, tools and skills facilitates the collection of essential information for monitoring indicators and assessing results. This makes it easier to demonstrate the impact of the measures taken, and to make any adjustments required to ensure that established objectives are met.

## Benefits of cooperation

By removing systemic obstacles, cooperation is already showing its first benefits. In addition, other complementary benefits have been identified:

Bringing a global vision:

This working approach promotes a global perception of the region's climate and biodiversity challenges. The synergy created by sharing expertise, skills and resources enriches the capacity for collective action. The result is a clearer picture of the interdependencies between processes, players, etc., making it easier to coordinate activities and anticipate risks. The result is a more efficient and sustainable organizational approach.

Enhanced resilience

The distribution of financial, technological and operational risks among the various partners reduces individual exposure to these risks.

Strategic anticipation enables us to prepare for environmental regulatory requirements, respond to future vulnerability, anticipate risks and so on. Failure to take these issues into account is a major obstacle to building an effective long-term strategy.

Turning constraints into opportunities

Meeting legal and regulatory obligations, such as the CSRD, makes it easier to identify risks and opportunities in the face of climate and biodiversity challenges. These requirements help reinforce the relevance, compatibility and adaptability of a company's or organization's strategy to a low-carbon world.

Increased innovation:

Cooperative work is based on collective moments that stimulate collective intelligence beyond the simple addition of individual contributions. These privileged moments of sharing enable players and partners to exchange experiences, express their needs and identify obstacles and opportunities together. This cooperative dynamic encourages the emergence of innovative solutions tailored to the challenges of climate change and biodiversity.

# 3 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

## 3.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

### B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

#### Presentation of diagnostic elements

The diagnosis carried out during the first phase of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan (January - September 2023) comprises 2 parts :

**1er Mitigation section**: this section comprises 2 parts. A first **technical part** covers the fields defined by Decree no. 2016-849 of June 28, 2016 on the PCAET, namely an inventory of territorial greenhouse gas emissions (cadastral inventory), territorial emissions of atmospheric pollutants, the territory's carbon dioxide sequestration capacities, the territory's final energy consumption, electricity, gas and heat distribution and transport networks, and the territory's renewable energy production. Unless otherwise stated in the diagnosis, the **reference year is 2022**.

This section also includes diagnostic elements that go beyond regulations, in line with the systemic approach of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan. In this technical section, fuel poverty is analyzed. This section also includes a Bilan Carbone Territoire. This is a global approach to accounting for all GHGs emitted by and for the territory ("dependency" or "flow" approach and accounting for direct and indirect emissions, which account for the vast majority [84%]). This approach complements the regulatory territorial or cadastral inventory, which records only the GHGs emitted directly on the territory.

**2ème Adaptation section**: this section meets the regulatory requirement for an analysis of the area's vulnerability to the effects of climate change. It is detailed, and comprises 5 parts: a description of the observed climate, a prospective vision of future trends, an analysis of risks, impacts and, finally, existing measures to deal with climate hazards.

The full diagnosis is available in appendices 6 (mitigation) and 8 (adaptation) of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan.

The approach implemented as part of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan is based on three complementary axes.

On the one hand, **mitigation** of climate impacts (Attenuate), structured around a technical diagnosis and mitigation objectives, integrates regulatory data (GHG emissions, energy consumption, carbon sequestration) as well as in-depth analyses such as the Bilan Carbone Territoire.

On the other hand, **adaptation** (Adapt), guided by a detailed analysis of climatic vulnerabilities, includes an assessment of risks, impacts and existing measures in the face of climatic hazards.

Finally, **cooperative action** (Cooperate) mobilizes players around a collective strategy, consolidated by a Metropolitan Contract for Climate and Biodiversity, to guarantee a shared ambition and concrete commitments. These approaches converge towards an operational action plan and a structuring investment plan.

Still within the framework of the systemic management system for transitions, the various fields of activity are identified below. These are grouped according to the three strategic axes detailed above: mitigation, adaptation and cooperation.

With regard to mitigation, the areas of intervention concern mobility, the production and consumption of goods and services, as well as agriculture and nature, energy production and housing and construction.

With regard to adaptation, the fields of activity identified concern water management, food, as well as health, the environment and quality of life, social justice, economic mutations and services provided by nature.

Finally, the cooperation axis is broken down into actions linked to shared governance, mobilization, extra-territorial cooperation and sharing knowledge and skills.

The general framework of the Agenda Climat implemented by Dijon métropole comprises four key components: Diagnosis, Strategy and objectives, Levers and Action plan.

The overall approach begins with a comprehensive diagnostic phase, which helps to clarify and support decision-making in defining the Plan's ambitions, strategy and objectives.

The strategy is then translated into Levers. These are then used to structure the action plan and the actions it contains, which will be implemented to achieve the defined objectives.

It is important to note that the framework includes continuous evaluation and learning cycles, both in terms of the triennial mid-term review and the annual monitoring and adjustment of the action plan. This iterative approach ensures that the climate agenda remains responsive to changing circumstances and opportunities.

Finally, at the end of the six-year period, the whole process must be reviewed, with a new diagnostic phase to ensure that the strategy remains adapted to changing conditions and challenges.

|  description |   | The development of a coordinated transport offer across an urban area involves harmonizing and integrating the different modes of transport (TER, bus, streetcar, train, bike) to offer users a fluid, coherent mobility system. This includes synchronizing timetables, creating efficient transfer points, and introducing a single or simplified fare structure. The aim is to improve accessibility and connectivity between neighborhoods, facilitate daily travel, and promote the use of public transport while reducing dependence on the private car.  |   |   |   |   |   |

description

Action description

Decarbonizing and reducing energy consumption in existing housing aims to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings. This includes actions such as thermal insulation, replacing heating systems with less polluting solutions (such as heat pumps or biomass boilers), and integrating renewable energies (such as solar panels). The aim is to make homes more energy-efficient, reduce energy bills for occupants, and contribute to the fight against climate change while enhancing residents' comfort.

# Trajectory

description

The decarbonization and reduction of energy consumption in the commercial and industrial sectors (excluding processes) aims to optimize the energy efficiency of office buildings, retail outlets and industrial facilities, excluding energy requirements linked to production processes. This includes measures such as improving insulation, installing more efficient heating and cooling systems, LED lighting, and integrating renewable energies. The aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, cut energy costs, and promote a more sustainable and comfortable working environment.

description

Action description

Encouraging the consumption of local products and supporting changes in behavior involves promoting the purchase of products grown or produced locally, in order to support the local economy, reduce the carbon footprint linked to transport, and reinforce sustainability. This can include awareness-raising campaigns, local market promotion events, educational workshops on the benefits of local produce, and initiatives to encourage consumers to change their purchasing habits. The aim is to create a culture of responsible and committed consumption, while strengthening links between producers and consumers.

# Action description

This aims to ensure sustainable and equitable water use in the face of the challenges posed by climate change. This includes assessing available water resources, protecting aquatic ecosystems, and setting up integrated management systems. Infrastructures, such as dams, pipelines and irrigation networks, need to be modernized and adapted to withstand extreme climatic events, such as floods or droughts. The aim is to secure water supplies, protect vulnerable populations and ensure the resilience of territories to the impacts of climate change, while promoting a participatory approach involving local stakeholders.

description

Action description

This involves protecting, restoring and managing natural habitats to promote species diversity and ecosystem health. This can include initiatives such as the creation of protected areas, the restoration of degraded environments, and the implementation of sustainable agricultural and forestry practices. Awareness-raising and education programs can also be set up to involve local communities in biodiversity conservation. The aim is to preserve essential ecosystem functions such as pollination, water regulation and carbon sequestration, while ensuring a balance between human development and nature conservation.

#

|  Fields of Action | Action / Indicator | Main Risk Identified | Description of Risk | Risk Priority | Mitigation of Risk  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Mobility | Developing active mobility and encouraging calmer public spaces | Safety | If the infrastructure is not adapted, this can lead to accidents, particularly between cyclists, pedestrians and motor vehicles.In addition, there is a risk of inequality of access: certain populations may not benefit from the facilities if they are not designed with their needs in mind. Finally, resistance to change may also emerge, particularly from users accustomed to the car, which may complicate the transition to more sustainable modes of transport. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Do a global combination of: improving Infrastructure actions, traffic Calming measures, urban planification, public awareness campaigns  |
|   |  Developing public transport services | Public acceptance | The main risk associated with developing public transport services in urban areas is the issue of public acceptance. If new lines or services do not meet the needs of users or are not perceived as reliable, this can lead to low usage, which compromises the economic viability of the system.What's more, major investment is often required to develop this offer, and if users fail to turn up, this can lead to financial losses and political tensions.

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

Carbon sequestration is the long-term removal of carbon from the atmosphere to prevent it from contributing to climate change. This subject has taken on new importance with the 2015 Paris Agreement and the French Climate Plan, which aim to achieve carbon neutrality in the long term. This implies that residual greenhouse gas emissions that cannot be eliminated will have to be captured.

Carbon sequestration refers to the capture and storage of CO2 in ecosystems (soils and forests) and in wood products.

% of Dijon Metropole's land has been artificially developed, while 57% remains undeveloped.

In 2018, the metropolitan area captured 13,400 tonnes of CO2, or 1.6% of 2018 total greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1 &amp; 2).

Land use change was a net greenhouse gas emitter of 498 teCO2 in 2018. This means that artificial surfaces release more CO2 than CO2 captured by the development of meadows. However, this relatively low figure is the direct result of controlled urban sprawl.

The target for 2030 is to achieve 27,800 tCO2 sequestered, for all land uses combined, by maintaining agricultural and natural areas and changing farming practices.

# The challenges of project portfolio management :

Dijon métropole has adopted a comprehensive approach to manage its portfolio of climate and biodiversity transition projects. This systematic framework encompasses several key elements :

Project Portfolio Management
Robust project management methods and tools are utilized to coordinate the diverse project mix, allocate resources effectively, and mitigate risks across the portfolio.

Opportunity identification and project selection
New project ideas are proactively scanned to identify opportunities for multi-stakeholder cooperation that align with strategic objectives. Rigorous selection criteria are applied to choose the most impactful initiatives.

Project maturity assessment and financing
The readiness and feasibility of project proposals are carefully evaluated. Suitable funding sources and financing mechanisms are identified to ensure the viability of each project.

Impact and co-benefits evaluation
Peer review sessions are conducted to assess the expected impacts and synergies of projects. The contributions of individual initiatives towards the overarching Action Plan objectives are quantifies.

Legal structuring
Dedicated legal entities are created and managed to facilitate project implementation, with appropriate governance, contractual frameworks and financing arrangements.

The following SWOT analysis completes the review of key elements for the systemic management of Dijon métropole's transition project portfolio.

It highlights the strengths on which the metropolis relies, as well as the weaknesses and threats it must overcome if it is to manage its portfolio of transition projects systemically and effectively. It underlines the importance of a cooperative approach, financial innovation and consolidation of resources to meet these complex challenges.

In order to optimize the opportunities identified during the identification of projects relating to climate transition and biodiversity, an evaluation table has been drawn up. This method favors the prioritization of actions according to two essential factors: the impact level of the opportunity on strategic goals, and the probability that the opportunity will be realized.

This matrix guides the setting of strategic priorities and implementation plans, identifying high-impact, high-probability opportunities as essential catalysts for accelerating the transition :

Once the opportunities to be maximized have been identified, it is equally important to manage the risks that could impede the realization of climate and biodiversity projects. To this end, a specialized matrix, based on the same model as the first, has been designed to classify risks according to their probability and possible impact on global goals.

This approach makes it easier to focus action on the most crucial risks, while favouring a systematic approach to minimizing their adverse impacts.

## Strategic objective of SEM ENERGIES
Dijon

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

The project to create a SEM ENERGIES is part of the European Pilot Cities project, which aims to classify and accelerate the implementation of energy transition projects in the region.

Based on the work carried out in the Energu Master Plan (Schéma Directeur des Energies), a potential for additional energy production of around 500 GWh/year has been identified, mainly in photovoltaic and urban heat production.

Dijon Métropole therefore intends either to invest directly, or to facilitate private investment, so that SEM ENERGIES will be responsible for managing a portfolio of energy production projects on a territorial scale, representing a potential of around 350 GWh/year, divided into around 60 projects.

# 3.3 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

In the application file, we distinguished between two types of monitoring: Dijon Metropole General Indicators Set and the Project Indicators Set.

As a reminder, here is the proposal.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Based on your model, we have developed the Dijon Metropole General Indicators Set.

While all of these indicators are annual, not all of them are produced every year: often because they are complex to construct, or require data that is not readily available, and so on.

You will find below tables of indicators with the proposed frequency of production, but also when they can be constructed (for example, an indicator $Y+1$ will be produced the following year, $Y+2$ it will be produced two years after the year in which the data is required, and so on.). Finally, we have specified the sources of the indicators which allows us to update our products more regularly and more quickly.

# B-3.1: Impact Pathways

Dijon Metropole has chosen to put the two major environmental crises on the same level: biodiversity and climate.

Moreover, in the Climate and Biodiversity Plan, a large number of co-benefits have been treated at the same level as the climate transition, so that the systemic approach can be used to take account of the various issues. This enables us to avoid duplicating costs and procedures, over-mobilising human resources and exhausting stakeholders.

The results monitoring system currently under construction will enable annual monitoring to be set up:
Monitoring of the territory at an annual time scale, with data available 6 months later for air-climate-energy data only (currently being consolidated).
Monitoring at a finer temporal scale (monthly) for certain indicators, with delivery at a tighter time step (4 months later) (currently being consolidated).
Get as close as possible to the action, with annual building data to monitor the impact of systemic action groups. (currently being tested)
Annual monitoring, excluding air-energy-climate data, is to be set up but will depend on data availability.

Means indicators to verify the actions implemented will be evaluated every 3 years:
Means indicators will be available at variable time steps depending on data availability.
Monitoring indicators to assess project progress, which can be tracked on an annual basis.

The climate plan is monitored over three main periods:

Annual monitoring of the Climate City Contract (annual): during this phase, only energy production, consumption and greenhouse gas data will be updated from the indicator table.
Mid-term evaluation (3 years): during the mid-term evaluation, all data whose production recurrence is  $&gt;3$  years will be updated, as well as all data for which it has been possible to collect more recent data.
Revision of the climate and biodiversity plan (6 years): all data will be updated. In addition, the indicator table will be revised to check that new data of interest for monitoring purposes cannot be updated.

## Workshops and working groups

Introduction

Workshops and working groups are spaces for collective reflection that can be flexibly integrated into territorial climate governance. They can either fit into the framework of existing bodies, or be organized independently according to identified needs. Their purpose is to examine specific subjects requiring particular expertise, such as the analysis of transition management practices within Dijon metropole.

Structure and organization

The composition of these groups can be adapted to the topics addressed, and can mobilize a wide range of expertise. At local level, experts from the metropolitan and extra-territorial areas, both public and private, can be called upon to contribute their expertise. International expertise is also provided in certain workshops by the Twin Cities project teams, the project teams of committed European cities with which Dijon metropole collaborates (Bristol, Lund, Leuven, Barcelona), accompanied by GNE Finance.

Strategic impact

Workshops enable local authorities to benefit from complementary approaches and expertise. These forums for exchange help to challenge Dijon's practices in terms of transition management. The collective expertise mobilized helps identify areas for improvement and refine the systemic approach to implementation.

|  Fields of Action | Action / Indicator | Main Risk Identified | Description of Risk | Risk Priority | Mitigation of Risk  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Mobility | Developing active mobility and encouraging calmer public spaces | Safety | If the infrastructure is not adapted, this can lead to accidents, particularly between cyclists, pedestrians and motor vehicles.
In addition, there is a risk of inequality of access: certain populations may not benefit from the facilities if they are not designed with their needs in mind. Finally, resistance to change may also emerge, particularly from users accustomed to the car, which may complicate the transition to more sustainable modes of transport. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Do a global combination of: improving Infrastructure actions, traffic Calming measures, urban planification, public awareness campaigns  |
|   |  Developing public transport services | Public acceptance | The main risk associated with developing public transport services in urban areas is the issue of public acceptance. If new lines or services do not meet the needs of users or are not perceived as reliable, this can lead to low usage, which compromises the economic viability of the system.
What's more, major investment is often required to develop this offer, and if users fail to turn up, this can lead to financial losses and political tensions. Problems with intermodality and connections with other modes of transport can also reduce the system's effectiveness. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Do a global combination of: various mode of transports integration, high quality infrastructures investments, user centric services design, real-time information system development, safety and security enhancements, keep fares affordable, settle public engagement  |
|   |  Development of low-carbon and carbon-free vehicles | Technological transition and the infrastructure needed to support it | Inadequate infrastructure: A lack of charging points for electric vehicles or appropriate facilities for other types of carbon-free vehicles may limit their uptake.
Initial costs: Decarbonised vehicles may have higher purchase costs, which may deter some consumers, especially if financial incentives are not sufficient.
Supply of materials: Increased demand for battery materials (such as lithium or cobalt) may lead to supply problems and raise ethical issues relating to extraction.
Industry transition: Traditional manufacturers of combustion vehicles will have to adapt, which may lead to job losses and economic tensions in certain regions.
Public acceptance: There may be reticence or concerns about the performance and reliability of these new vehicles. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Create a supportive ecosystem that encourages adoption and infrastructure development by charging infrastructure development, public transport electrification, Research and Development funding, public awareness campaign  |
|   |  Developing sustainable urban logistics | Complex coordination between the various players involved. | Intermodal collaboration: The need to synchronise different modes of transport (electric vehicles, cargo bikes, public transport) can be difficult, especially with private and public players.
Implementation costs: The development of suitable infrastructure (such as specific delivery zones or collection points) can require considerable investment, which may hold back the initiative.
Resistance to change: Companies may be reluctant to change their logistics practices, particularly if they fear it will affect their efficiency or costs.
Fairness: Ensuring fair accessibility for all players, including small businesses and underserved areas, can be a challenge.
Regulation: Unstable regulations can create uncertainty for businesses, making long-term planning difficult. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Integrated and collaborative approach  |
|   |  Developing a coordinated transport offer for the urban area | Harmonise the various existing transport systems, which may belong to several authorities or operators | Organisational complexity: Coordination between several players, such as municipalities, regions and private operators, can lead to conflicts of interest and communication difficulties.
Disparate infrastructures: Differences in infrastructure and technology can complicate the integration of transport systems, making the user experience less seamless.
Funding and budget: Securing adequate funding and allocating costs between different entities can be complex, especially if the benefits are not immediately visible.
User acceptance: Users may be reluctant to change their transport habits if the new offer is not perceived as more convenient or advantageous.
Risk of inequalities: Poorly managed coordination could create disparities in access to transport between different areas of the urban area, exacerbating socio-economic inequalities. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Eligorous planning and close collaboration between all those involved  |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Housing and Buildings | Decarbonising and reducing energy consumption in existing homes | Financial accessibility | Cost of works: The renovations required to improve energy efficiency can represent a substantial investment, which can be a barrier for many homeowners, particularly those on low incomes.
Appropriateness of support: Subsidies and financial incentives must be sufficient and well-targeted to encourage renovations, but there are often gaps in their availability or effectiveness.
Regional disparities: Household resources and capacities vary considerably from one region to another, which can lead to inequalities in access to low-carbon housing.
Complexity of the work: Managing renovation projects can be complex and require specific skills, making it difficult for some homeowners to navigate the process.
Temporary disruption: Renovation work can cause inconvenience to occupants, and poor management can lead to delays or extra costs. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Implement comprehensive energy retrofit programs with: financial incentives, home energy audits, targeted programs, training and certification, awareness campaigns and community Engagement  |
|   |  Decarbonising and reducing energy consumption in the tertiary and industrial sectors (excluding processes) | Managing the costs and investments required to implement effective solutions | High levels of investment: Energy retrofits, the adoption of new technologies (such as more efficient heating or lighting systems), and the integration of renewable energy can require significant investment, which can be difficult to justify for some businesses.
Uncertain returns on investment: Energy savings can take time to materialise, and businesses may be reluctant to commit to expenditure with no guarantee of a quick return, especially in an uncertain economic climate.
Technical complexity: Implementing decarbonisation solutions may require specific technical skills, and companies may not have the necessary resources to manage these changes.
Operational disruption: Renovation work or the installation of new technologies can lead to business interruptions, which can affect productivity and revenues.
Regulatory compliance: Businesses must navigate an evolving regulatory landscape, and new or changing requirements can create additional uncertainties and challenges. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Implement comprehensive sustainability and energy management programs including: energy efficiency audits, incentives for upgrades, employee training and engagement, decarbonization roadmaps, renewable energy integration, monitoring and reporting  |
|   |  Reducing the climate and biodiversity impacts of development and construction projects (public spaces and buildings) | Difficulty in effectively integrating these objectives into the planning and design processes | Conflicts of interest: Economic and development priorities may conflict with environmental objectives, leading to inappropriate trade-offs in project design.
Lack of awareness and training: Those involved in planning and construction may not have a sufficient understanding of climate and biodiversity issues, which can lead to ill-informed decisions.
Regulatory complexity: Navigating an evolving regulatory framework for environmental protection can be difficult, and new requirements can complicate the project approval process.
Impact assessment: Environmental impact assessment may be insufficient or incomplete, leading to negative consequences for climate and biodiversity after construction.
Additional costs: Solutions aimed at reducing environmental impacts can be perceived as additional costs, which can act as a brake on the adoption of sustainable practices | Listed actions have systemic effects | An integrated and collaborative approach, involving environmental experts, town planners and stakeholders, to ensure that sustainability objectives are fully integrated from the earliest stages of planning  |
|   | Developing renewable electricity generation | Intermittent production | Variability of production: Renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, are dependent on weather conditions, which can lead to fluctuations in the amount of energy produced.
Supply management: Intermittency can complicate power grid management, requiring efficient storage solutions and demand management systems to balance supply and demand.
Inadequate infrastructure: Existing electricity grids may not be adapted to efficiently integrate a growing share of renewable energy, requiring significant investment in infrastructure.
Storage and flexibility costs: The development of storage technologies (such as batteries) and flexible solutions (such as gas-fired power stations that can be brought on stream quickly) may represent an additional cost.
Social and environmental acceptability: Renewable energy projects may encounter local resistance, particularly due to concerns about the impact on the landscape, biodiversity or health. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Involving local communities in the project planning and implementation process  |

|   |  Developing the production of renewable thermal energy | Resource management and the environmental impact associated with their use | Sustainability of resources: The production of thermal energy from biomass can raise questions about the sustainability of raw material sources, particularly if they come from intensive agricultural practices that damage biodiversity or soil quality.
Greenhouse gas emissions: Although renewable thermal energies are generally considered to be more sustainable, their use can still result in emissions, particularly when biomass is burnt, if it is not managed appropriately.
Social acceptability: Thermal energy projects, particularly those involving biomass, may encounter local resistance due to concerns about environmental impact, noise pollution or land use.
Installation and operating costs: The infrastructure needed to produce renewable thermal energy can require significant investment, and it can be expensive to operate, depending on the resources available.
Regulatory complexity: Regulatory frameworks for renewable thermal power generation can vary considerably, creating uncertainty for investors and developers. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Adopt sustainable management practices, promote clear policies and engage with local stakeholders from the earliest stages of project development.  |
|   |  Development of energy management | Resistance to change within organisations | Organisational culture: Employees and management may be reluctant to adopt new energy management practices or technologies, especially if this requires adjustments to their day-to-day working habits.
Lack of awareness: Lack of training and information on the benefits of energy management can limit the commitment and motivation of teams to get involved in these initiatives.
Upfront investment: The costs associated with implementing energy management systems (such as software or metering equipment) can be perceived as a barrier, especially in organisations with tight budgets.
Data and technology: Successful energy management relies on the collection and analysis of accurate data. Faulty systems or incomplete data can hamper decision-making and the effectiveness of actions taken.
Evaluating results: It can be difficult to quantify the benefits of energy management, which makes it difficult to justify efforts and investments to stakeholders. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Promote an energy culture within the organisation, provide appropriate training and clearly demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits of energy management initiatives  |
|  Production and | Encouraging the consumption of local products and supporting changes in behaviour | Consumer resistance to change | Entrenched habits: Consumers often have well-established habits regarding their food and consumption choices, and it can be difficult to encourage them to adopt new practices, even if these are more sustainable.
Perception of cost: Local products are sometimes perceived as more expensive than imported ones, which can deter consumers, especially those with budget constraints.
Availability and accessibility: The availability of local products may be limited, particularly in certain regions or at certain times of the year, making it difficult for them to be widely adopted.
Awareness and information: A lack of awareness of the environmental and socio-economic benefits of local consumption can lead to low motivation to change behaviour.
Social inequalities: Encouraging the consumption of local products can exacerbate inequalities if certain populations do not have fair access to these products or if they cannot afford to pay higher prices. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Set up awareness campaigns, promote initiatives to support local production and work with communities to make local products more accessible and attractivese  |

|  Fields of Action | Action / Indicator | Main Risk Identified | Description of Risk | Risk Priority | Mitigation of Risk  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Consommation or good and services | Promoting the circular economy, reducing the impact of industrial processes on the climate, biodiversity, resources and health | Difficulty in integrating new business models into existing structures | Resistance to change: Companies may be reluctant to change their established practices, especially if they perceive these changes as costly or disruptive to their operations.
Initial investment: The transition to more sustainable processes often requires significant investment in new technology or infrastructure, which can be a barrier, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.
Complexity of implementation: The circular economy involves complex changes to the supply chain and resource management, which can make the transition difficult to plan and execute.
Lack of awareness and training: Employees may not be sufficiently trained or informed about circular economy principles, which can limit their commitment and effectiveness in implementing new practices.
Impact assessment: Measuring the results of the transition to a circular economy can be complex, making it difficult to demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits to stakeholders. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Engage all stakeholders, provide financial and technical support, and promote a culture of innovation and sustainability within organisations  |
|  Water | Planning the management of water resources and adapting infrastructures | Climate uncertainty and variations in water availability | Resource variability: Climate change can lead to unpredictable fluctuations in the availability of water resources, making long-term infrastructure planning difficult.
High adaptation costs: Upgrading or building resilient infrastructure can require significant investment, which can be a barrier for some communities, especially in times of budget constraints.
Social acceptability: Adaptation projects can raise concerns within communities, particularly because of potential impacts on the environment or biodiversity, which can lead to opposition.
Coordination between stakeholders: Water resource management involves a large number of stakeholders (local authorities, farmers, industry, etc.), and coordination between them can be complex.
Assessing future needs: Anticipating future demand for water, particularly taking into account population growth and changes in use, can be difficult, which can lead to mismatches between supply and demand. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Adopting an integrated and adaptive approach, involving stakeholders from the outset and using reliable data to guide planning and decision-making  |
|  Sustainable agriculture | Supporting local, environmentally-friendly food production | Economic viability of these initiatives | Production costs: Ecological production methods can be more expensive than conventional practices, which can make local products less competitive in terms of market price.
Market access: Local producers may find it difficult to access wider markets, due to competition with large agri-food companies or the lack of suitable distribution networks.
Seasonality and availability: Local production is often subject to seasonal constraints, which can lead to fluctuations in product availability, making it difficult to meet consumer expectations.
Consumer awareness: Consumers may not be sufficiently informed about the benefits of local, environmentally-friendly production, which may limit demand for these products.
Inequalities of access: Support initiatives may not benefit all producers equally, creating disparities between farmers and exacerbating social inequalities. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Promote financial support programmes, raise consumer awareness of the benefits of local products and encourage distribution models that facilitate market access for local producers  |
|  Health and living environment | Reducing vulnerability to natural and health risks exacerbated by climate change | Complexity and uncertainty in planning and implementing adaptation measures | High costs: The investment required to strengthen infrastructure and improve resilience can be considerable, posing budgetary challenges, particularly for local authorities.
Uncertainty of future impacts: Predicting the effects of climate change is complex, and projections can vary. This makes it difficult to assess the most effective measures to implement.
Conflicting priorities: Limited resources can lead to conflicts of interest between different stakeholders, with each group having its own priorities in terms of adaptation or risk reduction.
Awareness and community involvement: There may be a lack of awareness among populations about the risks associated with climate change and the measures needed to reduce their vulnerability, which may hinder the implementation of effective strategies.
Social inequalities: The most vulnerable groups may not benefit equally from adaptation measures, exacerbating existing inequalities. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Develop and implement comprehensive resilience and adaptation strategies, which include : risk assessments, community engagement, strengthening infrastructure, Public Health initiatives, education and awareness, ecosystem restoration, policy frameworks  |
|  Services provided by nature | Strengthening biodiversity and natural ecosystems in the region | Competition for space and resources, which can lead to conflicts of use | Planning conflicts: The integration of green spaces and biodiversity initiatives may conflict with other urban needs, such as housing development or transport infrastructure.
Maintenance costs: Projects to enhance biodiversity may require ongoing maintenance and financial resources, which can be a challenge for local authorities.
Social acceptability: Some initiatives may meet with resistance from local residents, particularly if they are perceived as neglecting immediate community needs (such as accessibility or safety).
Impact on local species: Introducing new species or creating new habitats can have unforeseen consequences on existing ecosystems, particularly by disturbing local species or encouraging invasive species.
Measuring results: Assessing the impact of actions on biodiversity can be complex, making it difficult to justify efforts and investments to stakeholders. | Listed actions have systemic effects | Engage communities early in the process, plan in an integrated way and ensure that biodiversity initiatives are compatible with other urban needs  |

## C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

### Popular Climate and Biodiversity University

Dijon Metropole's Popular Climate and Biodiversity University is a social innovation designed to change social and cultural representations of climate and biodiversity issues. It helps to overcome the lack of awareness, the lack of dialogue between experts and citizens, and the anxiety-inducing atmosphere that can be associated with these issues.

Through interactive exchanges between researchers, educators and citizens, the University seeks to deepen understanding of climate issues while mobilizing local residents around concrete initiatives and actions. The formats are designed to be as inclusive as possible: participatory conferences and discussion workshops encourage an open dialogue where everyone can make a contribution. Beyond the formats, and always with a view to reaching a wide audience, particular attention will be paid to the accessibility of the venues, the clarity of communication and the choice of adapted timetables.

The University's iterative approach enables it to continually adapt its formats and content to the needs expressed by the population. By emphasizing the development of local contributions and interdisciplinary networking, it lays the foundations for lasting impact. This model is intended to be replicated in other communities.

In this way, the University is helping to strengthen the commitment of the city's population, while creating a territorial dynamic conducive to achieving climate and biodiversity objectives.

### Dijon Metropole Development Council

Dijon Métropole's Development Council is a fundamental forum for participative democracy. Comprising 150 members, including citizens, qualified experts and socio-economic players, its mission is to formulate proposals for the elected representatives of the metropolis.

Called upon on May 4, 2023 to contribute to the territory's Climate Plan, the Development Council is fully in line with a forward-looking vision for 2050, where Dijon Métropole is recognized as an exemplary model of climate and food transition and biodiversity preservation. This sustainable model is based on an inclusive and collaborative dynamic, integrating an interdisciplinary and participatory approach. By promoting greater cooperation between local and institutional players, the Development Council is helping to build a future where the necessary changes are brought about through innovative, shared solutions, enriched by the contributions and expertise of citizens.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the CCC Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for refining the CCC Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract in future iterations.

# Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iteration

Dijon metropole's CCC is based on the elements of the 2024-2030 Climate and Biodiversity Plan, a mandatory French regulatory document (PCAET). This initiative was driven by strong political ambition, going beyond national regulatory requirements. Driven by this ambition, the CCC was drawn up by Dijon metropole's Climate Transition Executive Directorate in cooperation with a multitude of players, ranging from the local authority's internal departments to local stakeholders, according to a specific development methodology.

To highlight the added value of the work reflected in the CCC, a detailed methodological guide, the Handbook, has been developed. It makes the considerations, stages and processes involved in designing and managing the CCC and PC&amp;B accessible and intelligible. The PC&amp;B work matrix inspired the structuring of processes and the projection into operational implementation.

This reference document is aimed at all the players involved, and in particular the local authority's internal departments, to ensure effective coordination and collective ownership of the approach.

This innovative methodology structures the Territorial Engineering of Climate Transition through 7 complementary workpackages (WP1 to WP7), guaranteeing a global and operational vision of the territory's climate transition:

WP1: Animation for the conception of the Plan
WP2: Development methodology and structuring documents
WP3: Plan action sheets
WP4: Animation, implementation, monitoring and steering
WP5: Evaluation and continuous improvement of the Plan
WP6: Operational management
WP7: Audit of operational capacities

The financial and climatic costing of the Climate and Biodiversity Plan's actions is exploratory, and aims to provide an initial methodological framework. The parameters and method presented will have to be rediscussed within the framework of the PC&amp;B's management, with local stakeholders. The aim is to make the data and the calculation method more reliable, so as to specify and refine the Climate and Biodiversity trajectory each year. This work will enable us to integrate a vision that is both precise and iterative. At this stage, the estimated financial cost, exclusively in terms of human resources (to monitor and lead the Plan's actions), for Dijon Métropole's services, amounts around 7 million euros over the 6 years of the Plan's implementation.

# OBJET : PREAMBULE

## Plan climat et biodiversité

Nous sommes collectivement confrontés à deux crises majeures causées par les pressions exercées par les activités humaines : le changement climatique et l'effondrement de la biodiversité.

De dimension planétaire, ces phénomènes sont la conséquence de nos modes de vie, de consommation et de production, et viennent les perturber en retour, de façon plus ou moins brutale.

En partie sous l'influence des travaux du GIEC (Groupe d'experts intergouvernemental sur l'évolution du climat créé en 1988), la prise de conscience progresse et l'engagement des États s'est affirmé dans le cadre de la convention-cadre des Nations unies sur le changement climatique de 1992 et au fil des conférences des Parties (COP) qui l'animent depuis 1995.

La diplomatie climatique s'est rapidement dotée d'outils permettant de dépasser les nombreux blocages rencontrés aussi bien dans la définition d'objectifs partagés que dans leur mise en œuvre entre des pays aux réalités très diverses et pourtant dans une relation d'interdépendance forte et croissante.

Le protocole de Kyoto, adopté dans le cadre de la troisième conférence des Parties de 1997 (COP3), a en particulier installé le mécanisme des permis d'émissions. Même si l'on commence à en voir certaines limites aujourd'hui, ce mécanisme a permis des avancées et des coopérations entre États significatives. Le mécanisme dit « de développement propre » a également ouvert la possibilité aux pays occidentaux de réaliser leurs objectifs en investissant dans les projets des pays en voie de développement.

Chaque COP a permis des progrès sensibles mais l'Accord de Paris de 2015 (COP21) a indéniablement constitué une étape importante dans la progression des négociations en fixant le premier cadre global et universel (195 signataires) en matière de coopération et de solidarité climatique autour d'un objectif : « contenir l'élévation de la température moyenne de la planète nettement en dessous de 2°C par rapport aux niveaux préindustriels et en poursuivant l'action menée pour limiter cette élévation à 1,5°C ».

Ces discussions internationales, dont l'Europe est partie prenante en tant que telle, constituent le cadre à partir duquel chaque État est censé définir sa propre politique de transition. Ce que fait la France au travers, notamment, de la production d'un certain nombre de lois structurantes. On peut évoquer en particulier la loi sur l'air et l'énergie de 1996, la loi d'orientation de la politique énergétique de 2005, les lois de 2009 et 2010 de mise en œuvre du Grenelle de l'environnement, la loi de transition énergétique pour la croissance verte de 2015, et plus récemment les lois Energie-Climat de 2019 et climat et résilience de 2021.

Les collectivités, à leur échelle, agissent dans cet environnement, avec plus ou moins d'engagement. Dijon métropole compte parmi les territoires pilotes au niveau national et européen au regard des actions structurantes et innovantes qu'elle porte depuis 20 ans.

Comme tous les établissements publics intercommunaux de plus de 20 000 habitants, la métropole a l'obligation réglementaire de réaliser un « Plan Climat Air Energie Territorial (PCAET) ». Le conseil métropolitain du 23 mars 2023 a fixé le cadre d'élaboration du PCAET 2024-2030, en référence naturellement aux orientations du projet métropolitain 2022-2030 adopté en mars 2023. Le document proposé à l'assemblée métropolitaine sera en réalité un « Plan Climat et Biodiversité ».

Les importants travaux mis en œuvre à la suite de la délibération de mars 2023 ont rapidement conforté la collectivité dans sa volonté de considérer sur le même plan, et de façon conjuguée, la question du réchauffement climatique et celle de l'effondrement de la biodiversité. Ces crises sont toutes deux causées par les pressions humaines, elles interagissent fortement ensemble et auront des conséquences croissantes sur notre environnement et nos modes de vie.

DM20240926_5
Bien que portée de façon différente au niveau international, sensiblement moins présente dans le débat public que l'enjeu du réchauffement ou plus complexe à aborder du point de vue des données chiffrées, la question de la biodiversité occupera donc une place centrale dans la stratégie de transition métropolitaine. La métropole contribuera sans doute de ce point de vue à une prise de conscience que l'on sent également croissante aussi bien au niveau institutionnel que dans l'opinion publique. Presque 30 ans après le "Sommet de la Terre" de Rio, en 1992, le GIEC et l'IPBES (Plateforme intergouvernementale scientifique et politique sur la biodiversité et les services écosystémiques) ont produit en 2021 un rapport conjoint qui souligne, concernant la lutte contre le changement climatique et la préservation de la biodiversité, "qu'aucun de ces enjeux ne sera résolu avec succès s'ils ne sont pas abordés ensemble ; le renforcement mutuel du changement climatique et de la biodiversité signifie que pour résoudre l'une de ces questions, il faut tenir compte de l'autre".

Ce document stratégique se caractérise également par la place importante occupée par l'alimentation. L'alimentation est au cœur de notre quotidien, de nos vies, de notre patrimoine et elle sera, elle est déjà, fortement percutée par ces deux crises. La transition alimentaire, au travers de ProDij, est aujourd'hui une des grandes politiques portées par la métropole. Il est apparu en conséquence tout à fait naturel d'inscrire la stratégie alimentaire métropolitaine au sein du plan climat et biodiversité pour mieux les articuler.

Au final Dijon métropole, forte d'un engagement précurseur en matière de climat et de biodiversité, a fait le choix d'aller très au-delà des exigences réglementaires pour porter une stratégie globale à la hauteur de ces enjeux planétaires qui lui permette non seulement de prendre sa part, mais de rester parmi les territoires pilotes en la matière.

A ce titre, le plan climat et biodiversité constitue l'une des pièces du "Climate City Contract", document qui sera remis à la commission européenne en vue d'une labellisation de la métropole dans le cadre de la mission « 100 villes climatiquement neutres et intelligentes ». Il est complété d'une part par le « contrat métropolitain pour le climat et la biodiversité », objet d'un rapport séparé, ainsi que du plan d'investissement, travail prospectif de modélisation de la trajectoire financière de décarbonation du territoire métropolitain.

Le plan Climat et Biodiversité, annexé au présent rapport, est construit autour de trois axes stratégiques : Atténuer, s'adapter, coopérer. Cette matrice, qui se veut aussi lisible qu'efficace, se décline en objectifs, stratégiques et chiffrés, puis en plan d'actions. Son élaboration a fait l'objet d'une démarche de concertation particulièrement importante et a bénéficié d'une contribution très qualitative du conseil de développement.

Le document est d'abord un document stratégique. Aussi, le plan d'actions ne saurait en rien apparaître comme exhaustif, et aura vocation à s'enrichir de façon continue dans le cadre du pilotage du Plan Climat et Biodiversité. Sa structure permettra de surcroît de suivre et d'évaluer de façon globale la masse d'actions à venir dans ce cadre, et en particulier celles issues des coopérations qui seront impulsées et constitueront un facteur clé d'atteinte des objectifs. A ce titre, les actions menées par les acteurs socio-économiques engagés dans le Contrat Métropolitain viendront typiquement enrichir le plan d'actions global.

Certaines actions, stratégiques ou emblématiques, susciteront sans doute un intérêt particulier : au titre de l'atténuation, la création d'une SEM énergie pour accélérer la transition énergétique du territoire, la création d'un Fonds Social pour le Climat au chapitre adaptation ou encore le projet de création d'une Université Populaire du Climat et de la Biodiversité au titre des coopérations. Mais c'est bien un dispositif d'action systémique qui est proposé et vise à soutenir une implication très large des acteurs du territoire.

Une attention particulière a été portée au confort de lecture du document, ce qui ne semble pas anecdotique pour un sujet dont la densité et la complexité limitent parfois l'accessibilité au plus grand nombre. Naturellement des versions abrégées et vulgarisées seront produites à destination du grand public mais ce souci pédagogique, déjà très présent dans la phase de concertation au travers de la création par la métropole de nombreux supports, a été également pris en compte pour le document principal qui fera lui aussi l'objet d'une large diffusion.
