# Summary

The City of Milan has embarked on a transformative journey toward environmental sustainability and climate neutrality, with the goal of cultivating a healthy, resilient, fair, and innovative urban environment that promotes sustainable and equitable prosperity for its residents and economy.

In the recent years, several commitments have been undertaken by the Municipality (such as endorsing the C40 Deadline 2020 and joining the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy), and an ambitious Air and Climate Plan (Piano Aria e Clima-PAC) has been developed to transform Milan into a fully carbon-neutral and resilient city by 2050.

Aligned with its dedication to climate neutrality, Milan has submitted an application to the Cities Mission, aiming to expedite its journey towards climate neutrality by 2030. This initiative transcends local political cycles and engages all local stakeholders. This commitment materializes through the collaborative development of a cross-sector Action Plan involving strategic actor clusters. These clusters encompass companies partnered with the Municipality, key players in urban regeneration and real estate development, housing cooperatives, city universities, environmental associations, banking foundations, advisory boards, think tanks, and citizens, represented by the existing Permanent Citizens' Assembly on Climate.

The scope of the Action Plan, therefore, is to pull together the key relevant interventions that can help achieve the target of climate neutrality by 2030.

Starting with Milan's GHG baseline inventory and assessment of current policies and strategies, a variety of systemic barriers and opportunities have been identified, and several impact pathways have been developed for the City, with expected co-benefits.

Following the impact pathways, the Action Plan unwraps a comprehensive and co-constructed Portfolio of Actions, which gathers 150 actions brought by a variety of local stakeholders in the fields of Energy and Buildings, Mobility and Transports, Green Infrastructures, Circular economy and waste. These actions complement and/or go beyond the carbon neutral molecules identified in Milan's Expression of Interest, contributing to extend Milan's carbon neutrality to the whole territory.

Plus, the actions of the portfolio will be monitored on a biennial basis, accordingly with the monitoring process developed in Module B-3, with the possibility of introducing new actions and new stakeholders to progressively reduce residual emissions. Lastly, governance innovation and social innovation interventions have been detailed in the Action Plan, as the latter help reaching climate neutrality by addressing most of systemic barriers and opportunities encountered.

Milan's Action Plan is the result of a coordinated multi-stakeholder's effort to accelerate Milan's decarbonization by 2030, going beyond the -60% target by 2030 set by the Municipality in the framework of its Air and Climate Plan.

The inaugural edition of Milan's Climate City Contract has provided an opportunity to trial stakeholder engagement methodologies, with plans for further refinement and review based on valuable feedback gathered from involved stakeholders. Future iterations of the Climate City Contract will include additional stakeholders and areas of transformation, new synergies with Milan's Air and Climate Alliance (developed in the framework of Milan's Air and Climate Plan), new digital tools and platforms to facilitate citizen engagement and participation in climate-related activities and decision-making processes, and a solid monitoring and reporting on progress towards climate neutrality goals.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Key data on the city

Milan is the capital of Lombardy region and the centre of the most urbanized area of the country. With just over 1.3 million residents, it is the second largest Italian municipality, and features a solid and highly diversified economy (mainly concentrated on trade, services and finance, with some residual industrial activities).

Being a highly densified and populated city, Milan is confronted to high levels of GHG emissions (3.4 tonCO2 eq/inhabitant in 2021) as well as growing environmental risks.

## 1.2 Complementarity between the Climate City Contract Action Plan and existing plans

To address these challenges, the City of Milan has set ambitious goals for reducing GHG emissions. Following the endorsement of the Covenant of Mayors and the C40 Deadline2020 Declaration, the City of Milan approved an Air and Climate Plan (PAC - Piano Aria e Clima) in 2022, aiming to:

Reduce GHG emissions by 60% by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
Limit the temperature increase to 2°C by 2050 through urban cooling actions and initiatives to mitigate heat island effects.
Improve air quality to meet the limit values for atmospheric pollutants PM10 and NOx as established by EC Directives.

The Air and Climate Plan serves as a comprehensive and strategic roadmap for the planning and implementation tools already established by the Municipality, encompassing five key areas of action: Health, Connectivity and Accessibility, Energy, Climate Change Adaptation, and Awareness.

This document addresses the transition to a "zero-emission" city in a holistic manner, merging the imperative to reduce air pollution with the necessities of mitigation and climate adaptation policies (including EU Missions).

Within the existing framework of policies and actions, the Climate City Contract will actively bolster numerous objectives and initiatives outlined in the Air and Climate Plan. This will involve expediting and prioritizing strategic actions that significantly contribute to reducing GHG emissions.

Collaboration among a diverse array of private and public stakeholders will facilitate this coordinated effort, which will also incorporate other strategic documents such as the city's Masterplan (Piano di Governo del Territorio).

Additionally, this initiative will synergize with other tools, notably the "Air and Climate Alliance," which fosters structured collaboration between local institutions and the private sector to more effectively achieve climate and air quality objectives.

# 2. Part A – Current State of Climate Action

## 2.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

The baseline of Milan Action Plan is the 2021 GHG inventory, the most recent available when the elaboration of the Plan started.

In 2021 overall emissions in Milan amounted to about 4.567.400 t CO2eq, mainly due to stationary sources, as illustrated in the graph below. This pattern is reflected in the emission gap and in the action plan, where most of the actions are concentrated in the energy and building sector.

The main source of GHG emissions is represented by buildings5 heating and domestic uses, accounting for about the 57,4% of overall emissions, divided between:

heating plants, accounting for the 50,5%, mainly gas boilers (73%), and, for a minor fraction electric heat pumps (16%) and diesel oil boilers (15%)
district heating (gas cogeneration and waste to energy) accounting for the 6,9%.

Another important source (27,7%) is represented by energy uses in the tertiary sector (almost completely electricity consumption). Finally, mobility accounts for the 14,8%, while fugitive emissions from wastewater treatment are negligible.

## 2.2 Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

### A-2.1: List of relevant policies, strategies &amp; regulations

Milan actively aligns with EU-wide policies, leveraging funding opportunities and ensuring that the city directly benefits from European initiatives supporting climate actions. This includes accessing direct funds for innovation through programs like Horizon Europe.

As part of the Next Generation EU initiative established at the European level to address the pandemic crisis caused by COVID-19, a Council Implementing Decision definitively approved on July 13, 2021, incorporated the European Commission's proposal known as the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP). This investment program is designed to transform Italy into a fairer, greener, and more inclusive country, fostering a competitive, dynamic, and innovative economy. The Decision includes an annex outlining precise time-bound objectives and targets for each investment and reform, with resource allocation being tied to these objectives on a semi-annual basis.

Italy's recovery strategy outlined in the NRRP revolves around three strategic axes that are shared at the European level, namely digitalization and innovation, ecological transition, and social inclusion. Specifically, over 37.5% of total financial resources (climate tagging) are dedicated to the ecological transition. The largest portion of resources is allocated to Mission 2, named the 'Green Revolution and Ecological Transition', receiving approximately 31.05% of the total Plan funding, equivalent to around EUR 59.47 million. This allocation aims to reinforce Italy's commitment in alignment with the ambitious objectives of the Green Deal, focusing on various issues such as promoting incentives for energy-efficient buildings, increasing the share of renewable energy production, enhancing electricity infrastructure, promoting energy communities, and fostering sustainable mobility and agriculture.

Mission 2 comprises four specific components:

C1: Sustainable agriculture and circular economy with funding of EUR 5.27 billion
C2: Renewable energy, hydrogen, grid, and sustainable mobility with funding of EUR 23.78 billion
C3: Energy efficiency and building renovation with financing of EUR 15.36 billion
C4: Protection of land and water resources with financing of EUR 15.06 billion

On a national level, as presented in Action plan A-2.1, Italy has seen several legislative and strategic policy updates relating to climate action in recent years.

Air pollution limits are often exceeded in Italian urban areas and the June 2019 action plan for improving air quality includes several measures with the dual purpose of limiting air pollutants and supporting decarbonisation efforts. Along with this, the transfer into law of the Climate Decree in 2019, further aligns several Italian climate action measures with the EU Green Deal.

Integration with national policies ensures that Milan benefits from broader initiatives, such as national grants and incentives, facilitating capital flows toward climate actions.

In the recent years, the Italian government has focused not only on containing greenhouse gas emissions but also on developing a strategy for adapting to climate change, by formulating a National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (SNAC) consistent with supranational and international objectives. The document, which came into effect in 2015, promotes a basic scientific understanding of the phenomenon of climate change, its effects, and its impacts on the natural and anthropic environment. Furthermore, it proposes adaptation actions to reduce impacts
Comune di Milano

Climate-Neutrality ACTION PLAN

and promote resilience. In general, the SNAC aims to facilitate the integration of adaptation measures into medium and long-term strategic territorial planning.

In December 2022, the Italian government published the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (PNACC) (MASE, 2022). The plan highlights the importance of implementing adaptation actions to address the effects of climate change, whose impact continues to grow in terms of the number of events and their intensity across the peninsula. The document presents a vision of resilience to climate change as a highly cross-cutting capacity, thus requiring a multilevel and multisectoral governance developed both vertically and horizontally. There must be a close coordination between different levels of government (from supranational to local), and at the same time, collaboration between public and private stakeholders must be established to achieve adaptation goals. The overall objective of the PNACC is to provide guidelines for the implementation of adaptation actions in various levels of territorial governance, leveraging potential advantages that may arise from new climatic conditions.

In light of what is suggested by the PNACC, the City of Milan's effort to measure the change generated by urban climate policies is in complete coherence with the national vision through its Air and Climate Plan (Piano Aria Clima - PAC) and other strategic documents such as the City's Masterplan (Piano di Governo del Territorio), its Sustainable Urban, Mobility Plan (SUMP), its efforts to build a Climate Budget with the support of the C40, and its "15 minutes-city" Strategy.

In June 2023, the Italian government submitted the new Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (INECP). Milan, together with the other 8 Italian cities of the Mission, played an active role in the public consultation process. The NECP outlines how Italy intends to address the 5 dimensions of the energy union: decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy security, internal energy market, research, innovation and competitiveness. The plan deals with key energy and climate policies and measures across those five dimensions. About energy efficiency, the 52% of them in the period 2021-2030 is expected to take place in the building sector. Accordingly, the system of tax deduction is being completely reviewed to ensure faster renovation for less energy efficient buildings.

In its NECP, Italy presents an overview of the expected total investments needed for the 2020-2030 period. Information on the financing sources needs will be further completed in the final updated plan (expected in mid-2024) and the 8 Italian cities are currently involved in the consultation process.

The five dimensions foreseen in the NECP have been considered in the CCC Commitments.

Another key focus area for breaking the link between economic growth and environmental degradation caused by resource extraction and utilization, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and waste, is the concept of the circular economy. Italy, recognizing the importance of this approach, implemented the National Circular Economy Strategy in June 2022. This strategy aims to introduce new administrative and fiscal measures to bolster the market for secondary raw materials, making them competitive in terms of availability, performance, and cost compared to primary raw materials. By doing so, Italy seeks to contribute to achieving climate neutrality objectives and establish a roadmap with measurable actions and targets to be accomplished by 2035.

Furthermore, the National Waste Management Programme, also enacted in June 2022, is another pertinent document relevant to the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (INECP). This programme, with a duration spanning six years (2022-2028), outlines macro-objectives, actions and targets and provides criteria and strategic guidance for regions and autonomous provinces in developing waste management plans. Additionally, it conducts a nationwide assessment of waste facilities and addresses regional disparities, with a specific focus on enhancing separate waste collection rates, reducing the presence of illegal landfills, and lowering the municipal waste landfilling rate to below 10% by 2035. The programme also emphasizes the importance of regional planning based

on waste quantification and utilizes the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to evaluate management scenarios, considering all environmental impacts.

On the subject of the need to promote a sustainable production and consumption model, the new action plan for the Environmental Sustainability of Consumption in the public administration sector is now under approval. The purpose of that plan is also to link the objectives to compliance with the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) principle. Within the framework of the Plan, the so-called Minimum Environmental Criteria (CAM) are adopted by Decree, i.e. the environmental requirements defined for the various stages of the purchasing process, aimed at identifying the design solution, the product or the best service from an environmental point of view over the life cycle, taking into account the availability of the market. It should be pointed out that the national policy on green public procurement is extremely relevant for this purpose, due to the effects of the legislative provisions of the Public Procurement Code, which make it mandatory for contracting authorities, at least, to include technical specifications and contractual clauses of minimum environmental criteria in the design and tender documentation for all categories of supplies, services and works for which these criteria have been adopted. Milan has put in place a monitoring process for ensuring effective and smooth application of the minimum Environmental Criteria.

## A-2.2: Description &amp; assessment of policies in Milan

In 2022 the City Council approved the Air and Climate Plan, a strategic document identifying priority measures for the achievement of three objectives:

abide by the limit values of atmospheric pollutants (PM10 and NOx) set by the EU to protect public health;
reduce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions by $60\%$ by 2030 (medium term vision) and become a Carbon Neutral City by 2050 (long term vision);
limit local temperature increase to within $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ by 2050, by means of urban cooling and reduction of heat islands.

The Plan brings together and ensures consistency among pre-existing and new sectorial strategies, such as the Urban Sustainable Mobility Plan, the Action Plan for Sustainable Energy, the Urban Traffic General Plan, the Timetable Territorial Plan, and the Stakeholders Engagement Strategy. To do this, it provides for a series of actions in five strategic areas:

Healthy and Inclusive Milan;
Connected and Highly Accessible Milan;
Positive Energy Milan;
Cooler Milan;
Aware Milan.

The Air and Climate Plan (Piano Aria Clima) develops three types of scenarios: Business as Usual (BAU), Reference Scenario (which includes the actions of the Sustainable Energy Action Plan -PAES - that settled GHG reduction targets for 2020) and the Plan Scenario (additional actions). It also includes a Monitoring Strategy assessing progress of the Plan, effectiveness of policy measures, overall effectiveness of the Plan's measures, costs and financial resources, and inclusiveness and equity.

## Milan's Masterplan (Piano di Governo del Territorio - PGT):

Milan's Masterplan aims to the improvement of environmental quality and the protection of permeable soil through new standards, as the article 10 of the document, which enforces a more resilient approach to buildings regulation,
Comune di Milano

Climate-Neutrality ACTION PLAN

decreasing the energy requirement and increasing the number of permeable spaces like green roofs and walls. In addition, for the first time Milan takes on the production of ecosystem services to support greenhouse gas and carbon emissions reduction and to mitigate extreme events (heat islands, peaks in air pollution, torrential rains). To meet the challenges posed by urbanization, the PGT sets itself these objectives related to greenery and land consumption:

reduction of land consumption rate, with the identification of 1,7 million mq of non-building areas and protection of 3,5 million m2 of new agricultural areas;
safeguarding future green areas;
creation of 20 new parks within the city;
planning of a large Metropolitan Park around Milan, which connects the new parks to the existing ones;
identification of an ecological network, with areas of depavimentation, planting and reforestation contributing to the ForestaMI project that aims to plant 3 million trees in the metropolitan city.

## Focus on FORESTAMI:

Together with Fondazione Comunitaria del Ticino Olona and Fondazione Comunitaria Nord Milano, Fondazione Cariplo supports the Forestami project, which involves the Municipality of Milan, the Metropolitan City of Milan, the Lombardy Region, Parco Nord Milano, Parco Agricolo Sud Milano, ERSAF, as well as the Milanese universities Politecnico, Statale, and Bicocca. The project aims to achieve the following objectives: plant 3 million trees by 2030 (with the help of public funds that the Forestami working group will be able to catalyze through participation in ministerial calls, regional calls, European calls, PSR (Rural Development Programme), PNRR, etc.); increase the natural capital of urban and peri-urban areas; contribute to mitigating air pollution; and improve the quality of life in the greater Milan area while simultaneously combating the effects of climate change.

Since the project's launch in 2020, 560.001 plants (including trees and shrubs) have been planted, with over 60.000 plants thanks to donations collected by the Forestami Fund, managed by Fondazione Comunitaria di Milano. According to the project's research group, it is estimated that all planted trees can contribute to the sequestration of 22.400 tons of CO2 absorbed. For the plants planted thanks to the Forestami Fund, the numbers amount to 2.400 tons of CO2, 129,02 tons of nitrogen dioxide, and 3,27 tons of PM10.

## Focus on Article 10 of Milan's Masterplan:

Article 10 defines performances in terms of CO2eq emissions for new construction and building renovations. In the case of new construction, urban restructuring, and building renovations involving demolition and reconstruction, achieving carbon neutrality is mandatory. For restoration, conservative renovation, and building renovation, a 15% reduction in CO2eq emissions compared to the emission values associated with overall energy performance limits is mandatory if higher-level energy regulations require verification. Furthermore, incentivization is provided in terms of reducing service needs if a 25% reduction in CO2eq emissions is achieved. Paragraph 5 of Article 10 indicates the possibility of monetizing any failure to meet the required performance in terms of CO2eq emissions by assigning economic value to each additional ton of CO2eq emitted beyond the obligatory value.

## Focus on Milan's contributory charges for urbanisation ("Delibera Oneri"):

Following an equitable and redistributive principle and continuing to promote urban regeneration processes, especially in less central areas, the Municipality has updated the contributory charges for urbanisation in 2023. The Municipality has decided to differentiate the weight of contributory charges in order not to penalize redevelopment interventions in urban regeneration areas, dividing the territory of Milan into two large zones: the central one, corresponding to the historic center and the immediately adjacent area, and the one beyond the outer
Comune di Milano

ring road, which is significantly larger (with an area equal to 84,13% of the total). The new contributory charges also seek to favour constructions that meet carbon-neutral criteria, with further incentives for hosting services in agreement with the Municipality, for hosting housing services rented at a subsidized rent, university student residences, for respecting the principle of hydraulic and hydrological invariance, for depolluting contaminated soils, and for using protocols and innovative technologies for waste and construction by-products tracing.

## The Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (PUMS):

The Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (PUMS), approved by the City Council of Milan in 2018, contains the strategies and guidelines for the future mobility of the city. It is the instrument provided by national regulations to "meet the mobility needs of the population, ensure the reduction of levels of air and noise pollution, reduce energy consumption, increase the safety levels of transportation and road traffic, minimize individual use of private cars and traffic congestion, increase transport capacity, increase the percentage of citizens transported by collective systems, and reduce congestion in urban areas".

Milan's PUMS is consistent not only with national objectives but also with European guidelines based on the following key principles:

Participatory and integrated approach;
Commitment to sustainability;
Clear vision, measurable objectives, and targets;
Examination of the costs and benefits of transportation.

The goals of the PUMS are the following:

Sustainable mobility: meeting the diverse mobility needs of residents, businesses, and city users, contributing to metropolitan area governance, and returning urban public spaces to shared use by all users.
Equity, safety, and social inclusion - ensuring adequate health, safety, accessibility, and information conditions for all.
Environmental quality - promoting and improving the environmental sustainability of the mobility system.
Innovation and economic efficiency - leveraging innovation opportunities, pursuing sustainability and spending priorities with a balanced perspective within the framework of limited financial resources.

In addition to the effect of such actions, the implementation of Area B, a Limited Traffic Zone has been established by the Administration in addition to the already existing Area C which covers the historical city centre. This zone has the characteristics of a Low Emission Zone, meaning that the criteria for vehicle access and transit are exclusively based on environmental factors.

## Pathway towards a climate budgeting process:

By joining the C40 Climate Budget Pilot Group, the city aims to optimize budget allocation to implement Air and Climate Plan (PAC) actions in the medium and long term, prioritize climate actions and related resources, complement and reinforce the Plan's monitoring system, and raise awareness and engage municipal departments on climate actions and budgeting. Consistently with the ACP approach, Milan has also endorsed the C40 Divesting from Fossil Fuels, investing in a Sustainable Future Declaration, committing to give priority to fossil fuel-free investments and investments in climate solutions to help promote decent jobs and a just and green economy.

# Milan's 2020 Adaptation Strategy and the 15-Minutes City Pledge:

In 2020, the outbreak of Covid-19 generated new challenges, as it exacerbated existing issues (i.e. traffic) and hit hardest the most vulnerable population. However, it also created new opportunities to frame the recovery process in a way that makes the city a greener and more just place to live. Milan endorsed the principles of the C40 Mayors' Agenda for a Green and Just Recovery (namely: jobs and an inclusive economy, resilience and equity, and health and well-being) and launched "Milano 2020", the adaptation strategy for the so-called "Phase 2" of the pandemic (which aimed to reorganize the city due to the need for social distancing and other precautions related to the coronavirus).

The strategy outlined a recovery scenario including both immediate and planned actions for the management of a "new normality" and was strongly focused on sustainability, thus promoting:

an economic relaunch in line with environmental transition objectives (equity, decarbonization and resilience);
the improvement of air quality through sustainable mobility;
local production and short food supply chains, as well as the application of the principles of circular economy to resources management.

In particular, "Milano 2020" set out the re-organization of local services with a view to create a 15-minute city, by integrating different local plans in the fields of transport, urban regeneration and citizens services. A practical example is the "Open Streets" plan, aiming to rapidly create an infrastructure of pedestrian and cycling roads through signals and movable road furniture, connecting the city center to peripheral districts. The plan originated from the requirement to implement social distancing rules made necessary by the pandemic, which offered an unprecedented opportunity to push further the shift to a more sustainable mobility and reorganize streets as public spaces on a human scale at the center of neighborhood life. As the emergency forced the city to identify light, cost-effective, fast and reversible options and at the same time caused a substantial reduction in urban traffic, it made possible to intervene minimizing traffic disruptions. The new cycle routes enhance existing connections with the main public transport hubs, thus offering an alternative mode of transport to both residents and commuters. All this has allowed Milan to strike a balance between sanitary requirements, traffic congestion and climate change, speeding up the environmental transition.

# Milan's Food Policy:

In 2015, the City of Milan approved an ambitious Food Policy, with five priorities:

Ensure healthy food and water for all citizens: ensure access to healthy food and water for all citizens to protect the dignity of the person and improve the quality of life.
Promote sustainability of the food system: facilitate the consolidation of all the components and activities necessary for the articulation of a sustainable food system and promote the local production and consumption of fresh, seasonal and quality food.
Promote Food Education: promote a culture oriented towards the conscious consumption of healthy, safe, culturally appropriate, sustainable food, produced and distributed in compliance with human rights and the environment.
Fighting against food waste: reduce food surpluses and waste in the various stages of the food cycle as a form of fighting social and economic inequalities and as a tool for reducing environmental impacts.
Comune di Milano

Climate-Neutrality ACTION PLAN

Support the scientific research in agrifood sectors: encourage the development of agri-food scientific research with connotations and repercussions relating to the urban system, aiming at the improvement of processes and the development of cutting-edge technologies.

The ongoing actions involve the activation of new projects in various neighbourhoods of Milan and the involvement of public and private stakeholders who can initiate experiments and sustainable models of food production, transformation, distribution, and collection, for instance:

Creating local food waste hubs to recover food losses from retailers, and food service operators and redistribute it through organizations supporting those in need. This is part of an effort to reduce food insecurity, make sure no edible food losses is wasted and to cut food waste in half by 2030.
Fiscal incentives to donate surplus food: to avoid perfectly edible food going to waste, Milan introduced a 20% waste tax break in 2018 for any food businesses donating their surplus food to charities and food banks.
Shortening supply chains and stimulating local procurement by working with the Distretto Agricolo Milanese (DAM) and Milano Ristorazione (MIRI, the Municipal Agency for School Canteens) to serve locally produced ingredients to Milanese school canteens, supporting the local economy and cutting down emissions by decreasing transportation.
Reducing food waste in school canteens: in partnership with Milano Ristorazione, a food waste campaign was launched in the schools and resulted in a 17% decrease in food waste, with the participation of 57 schools and 19.000 children.

## Circular Economy Action Plan 2024-2030:

Over the past 10 years, the Municipality of Milan has initiated several initiatives to support circularity, including its Food Policy, the European project "Reflow" (which experimented with circular technologies in covered municipal markets) and the European project "Centrino" (which intends to transform industrial historic heritage into productive and creative hubs in the Fashion and Design sectors). In the framework of its Air and Climate Plan, the Municipality has started implementing a collaborative Circular Economy Action Plan in several key sectors: food, water, peri-urban agriculture, construction, packaging, events, fashion, and design. The plan valorises existing circular experiences and helps the emergence of new initiatives and alliances.

Through a campaign of listening and dialogue with businesses and stakeholders, the Municipality has identified 9 "enabling" intervention areas on which the Municipality will work from now until 2030 together with large and small-medium enterprises, startups, universities, third sector organizations, institutions, and citizens, based on shared objectives and scientifically validated metrics. Among the first planned actions: a call for pilot projects aimed at companies and associations interested in participating in the implementation of the Plan; the development, in collaboration with MUSA Spoke 5, of a tool for measuring the results and impacts generated by repair, recovery, and reuse activities of products and waste in the city; the provision of financial contributions for the establishment and consolidation of circular businesses in Milan to ensure that the circular economy becomes an increasingly widespread local service at the neighbourhood scale.

## Milan's Housing Strategy:

Milan's Housing Strategy (2023) aims to define the objectives and consequent strategies and actions to respond to the theme of housing. The document seeks to initiate a process of common reflection to define and guide public policies for the coming years, while also being an evolving tool that can adapt and define itself over time through the participation of various stakeholders. This document combines the need for a strategic vision with a time
horizon that goes beyond the current three-year period mandated by public and social housing programming, requiring a broader extension in time for more effective analysis and goal setting.

The Municipality of Milan, through the work of its Housing Department, has identified a series of objectives to respond to the city's needs in terms of housing and accommodation, urban fabric regeneration planning, maintenance of a balanced social mix, promotion of inclusion, and defence of the right to housing.

Energy retrofitting of the municipal buildings is an important part of Milan's Housing Strategy and take place in the framework of Milan's Air and Climate Plan. The actions implemented aim at energy efficiency and conversion to renewable sources for a significant number of public residential buildings, with the aim of reducing fossil fuel consumption (gas and diesel) currently used for thermal purposes by 50% by 2030. This reduction in consumption, and thus in energy bill costs, will also benefit tenants facing energy poverty conditions. Interventions on thermal systems will also improve comfort and health conditions for tenants. Thermal insulation of public buildings also plays a primary role, for which first interventions have been carried out.

Recently, the Municipality of Milan and Fondazione Cariplo have initiated a collaboration aimed at the regeneration of Public Housing Estates (ERP) neighborhoods through the structuring of pilot projects. Fondazione Cariplo will allocate over 1,6 million euros for the development of Strategic Urban Area Programs (PUSA) in selected areas chosen by the municipal administration, with the goal of carrying out preliminary phases to activate more substantial resources linked to the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) and local resources. Also participating in this initiative are Fondazione Housing Sociale, providing technical and financial expertise developed in the promotion and development of social housing in Italy, and Fondazione Comunitaria di Milano, which will establish a dedicated fund thanks to the initial contribution from Fondazione Cariplo.

Additionally, Fondazione Cariplo, in collaboration with experts from the social enterprise Edera, plans further activities dedicated to Milan's public housing, focusing on its industrialized Deep Retrofitting according to the Energiesprong model. A module of this study will also be allocated to Tactical Housing, involving the creation of modular housing units with characteristics of temporariness, low environmental impact, and circularity using the same industrialized approach, particularly relevant in cases of ERP building renovations.

Milan's plan “Towards the common energy well-being” (“Verso il comune benessere energetico”):

In January 2024, the Municipality of Milan has approved guidelines for drafting a Plan to fight energy poverty and insecurity called “Towards the common energy well-being”, involving the Welfare Department and the Housing Department. On one hand, it aims to identify and support indigent households facing economic difficulties in adequately addressing extreme hot or cold conditions due to the climate crisis, which has severe health consequences. On the other hand, it intends to continue pursuing decarbonization and improving air quality objectives by promoting a fair and inclusive energy transition for all. The approved guidelines established a working group to draft a plan starting from the analysis of energy poverty situations, identifying necessary measures to support vulnerable families and contribute to a fair ecological transition. Some of the initiatives and projects already implemented in recent years will be adjusted and renewed, such as the Energy Desk managed by AMAT.

A-2.3: Emissions gap

Milan Air and Climate Plan (PAC) already takes into consideration the measures and policies illustrated above. Most of them are considered in PAC's 2030 Reference Scenario (in case they were already in progress, when the PAC was elaborated), the other ones are included in PAC's actions.

Therefore, as illustrated in the figure 2 and in table A-2.1, we considered: Baseline emissions: 4.567.402 t CO2eq in 2021 (column 1);

Residual emissions:  $20\%$  of 2021 emissions i.e. 913.000 t CO2eq (column 6);
Emissions Reduction Target: 3.654.402 t CO2eq (column 2);
PAC implementation: reduction in GHG emissions between 2021 and 2030 1.574.099 (column 3).

As a result, the gap to be covered with the present action plan amounts to  $2080\mathrm{tCO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$

Each system can be described as follows:

The political system:
the “political system” encompasses national, regional, provincial, metropolitan and municipal public administrations. The political system contributes to the city’s GHG emission as public policies, regardless of the scale and being transversal and/or thematic, can impact the city’s path to climate neutrality.

The technological/infrastructure system:
the technological/infrastructural system refers to energy, buildings and transport. In Milan, the actors of the technological/infrastructural system are mostly public companies with the Municipality as the main stakeholder.

The “city makers” system:
the city-makers system is composed of profit private and non-profit compagnies that carry on physical interventions on the urban built environment. The city-makers system encompasses major players in urban regeneration and real estate developments with areas of new carbon-neutral construction and environmentally ambitious projects, as well as housing cooperatives with a substantial stock of real estate for social purposes and ongoing energy efficiency improvements. Universities have also been considered into the “city-makers” system, as they carry out ambitious physical interventions on their campuses and their surroundings.

The “strategic support” system:
the “strategic support” system is understood as an ecosystem of actors which bring technical and/or financial support to Milan’s actions for Climate Neutrality. It encompasses philanthropic organizations and networks.

The social system:
the “social” system comprehends citizens as well as environmental associations, playing a key role in pushing for new laws, programmes, policies or strategies on climate change, and making sure national and local governments account on their commitments, while including the most vulnerable citizens.

For each system, specific barriers, gaps and opportunities have been identified and described as follows:

The political system

Barriers:
Lack of engagement and commitment from central government who have control over regulatory and legislative levers, possibility of conflicting national, regional and municipal frameworks: Milan has no direct control on all sources of emissions within its territories.
Lack of the right skills and expertise in the administration needed for climate neutrality; siloed work organization within the public administration.
Difficulty to integrate climate targets in the financial budget of the Municipality.
Comune di Milano

○ Difficulty to find a political consensus to take action for climate change.

Gaps to address: new forms of governance and collaboration within the administration.
Opportunities and evaluation of unexploited resources:
The strong mandate given to climate mitigation, adaptation and resilience work, and the full integration of environmental goals and indicators in the City's management system.
Consolidating a climate budget to integrate climate targets in the financial budget process and assign responsibility for implementation, monitoring, evaluation and reporting across the city government.
Data-driven and cross-sectorial platform, to better inform policy and decision making.

# The technological/infrastructure system

Barriers:
Cost of implementing actions to decarbonize the technological/infrastructure system.
Long-term interventions versus uncertainty of financial resources.
Individual behaviours (f.i for the use of public local transports) impacting the infrastructures.

Gaps to address: gap between the strategic goals of the Municipality and the pace of implementation by the stakeholders of the technological/infrastructure system
Opportunities and evaluation of unexploited resources:
Explore the opportunity of mobilizing public-private partnerships.
Capitalizing on the outcomes and results of policies such as the Superbonus incentive, for future replication by the public administration.

# The "city-makers" system

Barriers:
Lack of incentives to take part in greener and carbon-neutral constructions, which are more costly.
Complex and fragmented regulatory framework, especially regarding the energy transition path.
Difficulty to assess and monitor the benefits and co-benefits of the implemented solutions in newly built neighbourhoods or regenerated areas.

Gaps to address: synergy between the strategic goals of the Municipality and the individual strategies uptaken by the city-makers.
Opportunities and evaluation of unexploited resources:
Guidelines on urban regeneration and decarbonized neighbourhoods, co-constructed with the city-makers and the Municipality; new incentives (article 10 of the PGT, "Delibera Oneri").

Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

As mentioned in section 3 of the Commitments document ("Key Priorities and Strategic Interventions"), the City of Milan has identified four key priorities to be addressed in the short term to achieve climate neutrality by 2030: energy efficiency, clean mobility, nature-based approaches, and efficient and circular waste management. These priorities will be advanced through contributions from planned actions within the framework of the Air and Climate Plan, as well as portfolio actions.

In table B-1.1 are the documented results of our internal scenario modeling exercise, outlining the selected impact pathways for each key priority/emission domain.

It has been decided to measure and report the CO2 equivalent absorbed by new tree plantings and the increase in urban green areas to understand their impact on reducing city CO2 emissions. This measurement aims to assess the positive effects of these green initiatives. However, the CO2 absorption from these actions is not included in the total urban emissions calculation because the emissions inventory does not cover the AFOLU sector (agriculture, forestry, and other land use). To maintain methodological consistency, this absorption is not counted towards bridging the emissions gap, ensuring a clear and consistent emissions balance.

Emissions from the Waste to Energy facility are included in “stationary energy” according to GPC provisions, while scope 3 emissions were calculated for wastewater treatment only. Therefore in this first action plan cycle we didn’t estimate the impact of actions regarding circular economy on scope 3 GHG emissions.

# 3.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

As outlined in the Commitments document (Paragraph 2.2, "From the Expression of Interest to the Redefinition of the Geographic Boundary Corresponding to the 2030 Climate Neutrality Target"), the action portfolio has been crafted with a city-wide perspective, incorporating diverse strategies to achieve Milan's neutrality goal by 2030.

The portfolio co-design activities were conducted collaboratively through dedicated workshops involving various categories of invited local stakeholders (as detailed in the commitment document, Paragraph 4.2, "Participatory Governance and Key Stakeholders for Accelerated Change"). These events facilitated feedback on the Climate City Contract transition pathway and resulted in a co-designed portfolio of actions based on shared key priorities set by the administration.

Additionally, a robust sheet template has been developed to collect action proposals along with a comprehensive set of related data and indicators. This template has been further validated by the internal transition team, ensuring its robustness and alignment with the city's climate goals.

The action portfolio is structured as follows:

Actions owners: The portfolio is divided into two main sections. The first section details actions taken by the Municipality of Milan, while the second outlines commitments made by external stakeholders to reduce CO2 emissions.
Comune di Milano
Climate-Neutrality ACTION PLAN

Action domain: The actions have been categorized into the main areas suggested as priorities by the Mission: Energy and Buildings, Mobility and Transport, Green infrastructure¹¹, Circular economy and Waste management¹²). These Action domains have been further detailed by the city into key priorities (as described in the Commitments document, paragraph 4, "Key-priorities and strategic interventions").

Action domain sub-categories: These are specific sub-areas of intervention used to classify projects for further analysis and financial projections. Sub-areas include:

Energy and Buildings: B - Building retrofit (envelope, HVAC plants or both) and energy efficiency in electricity uses; ES - Energy Systems – new PV installations, improved and more extended district heating service (integrating new heat storages, renewable energy and waste heat recovery), power grid upgrading; U - Urban regeneration projects; R - Research project.

Mobility and Transport: I - Mobility and Transport Infrastructure; RSM - Regulations and Tools aimed at promoting soft mobility and at limiting private motorised traffic; E - Electrificaton.

Green Infrastructure: G - Green, new trees and vegetation, park renovation; D - Depaving; Re - Remediation; Mix - Mixed works including green, pedestrian areas, bike lanes etc.

Circular economy and waste management: EN - Energy recovery and biogas generation; CC - Carbon capture.

Typology of action¹³: Actions have been classified into various types to clarify distinctions and relate to different implementation timelines: Urban Regeneration Molecules (MOL), Interventions on Networks and Infrastructures (NET), Small-scale Projects (PRI), Enabling Actions (ENB)¹⁴, Strategies (STR).

Action number: An identifying code for the action promoter associated with a progressive number has been assigned to easily identify actions throughout the document and related annexes.

Action Title: Title or name of the proposed action.

Description: This field provides a brief overview of the project/intervention. For additional details on actions proposed by stakeholders, individual action outlines (module B-2.2) are presented in Annex 1 titled "Individual Actions". Annex 2, labeled "Collection of Actions Proposed by Stakeholders from the Original Sheets (Italian Language)", includes the original template model used for gathering initiatives and the completed sheets submitted by all external stakeholders.

¹¹ Actions related to greenery – such as new tree plantings, nature-based solutions (NBS), and the increase in urban green areas – have been integrated into the portfolio, and CO2 equivalent absorption has been reported. This measurement aims to assess the positive effects of these green initiatives. However, to maintain methodological consistency, this absorption is not counted towards bridging the emissions gap, ensuring a clear and consistent emissions balance. In future cycles of the City Contract, we will evaluate the feasibility of incorporating both IPPU and AFOLU into the baseline and the action plan.

¹² The Municipality's action portfolio encompasses initiatives in circular economy and waste management, emphasizing strategic investment and commitment through projects to be developed by 2030. Even though Scope 3 emissions have not yet been quantified, with the only exception of emissions from wastewater treated outside the city, the Administration acknowledges the importance of these actions. Circular economy and sustainable waste management play a crucial role in creating a sustainable and resilient city, reducing emissions, and enhancing citizens' quality of life by promoting cleaner environments, resource efficiency, and a just transition. Moving forward, we will explore methods for measuring Scope 3 emissions to strengthen our sustainability strategy and ensure its effectiveness and impact.

¹³ For a detailed description of the various types of actions, refer to the Commitments document, Paragraph 23 "Structuring and Co-Designing Milan's Climate Action Portfolio".

¹⁴ According to literature, these initiatives can indirectly contribute to emission reduction by influencing behaviors and lifestyles, with an estimated potential to reduce the emission gap by up to 10%. This estimate is supported by various sources including the European Environment Agency (EEA) which details how behavioral changes can enhance energy efficiency. The International Energy Agency (IEA) also emphasizes the significant impact of behavior changes on reducing CO2 emissions. Such initiatives, therefore, play a crucial role in achieving substantial emission reductions by promoting energy-efficient behaviors and lifestyle adjustments.

It has been decided to measure and report the CO2 equivalent absorbed by new tree plantings and the increase in urban green areas to understand their impact on reducing city CO2 emissions. This measurement aims to assess the positive effects of these green initiatives. However, the CO2 absorption from these actions is not included in the total urban emissions calculation because the emissions inventory does not cover the AFOLU sector (agriculture, forestry, and other land use). To maintain methodological consistency, this absorption is not counted towards bridging the emissions gap, ensuring a clear and consistent emissions balance.

In its action portfolio, the Municipality has incorporated initiatives in circular economy and waste management, highlighting its strategic investment and commitment to be realized by 2030. Although Scope 3 emissions have not yet been quantified, the Administration recognizes the importance of these actions for fostering a sustainable and resilient city. These initiatives contribute to emission reductions and improve citizens' quality of life by promoting healthier environments, resource efficiency, and a just transition. The Administration will explore methods for measuring Scope 3 emissions to refine and advance its sustainability strategy further, ensuring its efforts are effective and far-reaching.

Not applicable, as none of the actions reported here fall within the sub-categories defined for this area of action.

²¹ It has been decided to measure and report the CO2 equivalent absorbed by new tree plantings and the increase in urban green areas to understand their impact on reducing city CO2 emissions. This measurement aims to assess the positive effects of these green initiatives. However, the CO2 absorption from these actions is not included in the total urban emissions calculation because the emissions inventory does not cover the AFOLU sector (agriculture, forestry, and other land use). To maintain methodological consistency, this absorption is not counted towards bridging the emissions gap, ensuring a clear and consistent emissions balance.

## B-2.2: Individual action outlines

For individual action outlines (Module B-2.2) see Annex 1.

## B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

Residual emissions will need to be addressed in subsequent iterations of the Climate City Contract, with the support of new parties joining the Contract. We will apply some compensation measures in Milan metropolitan area, such as production of biomethane to be added in the gas grid, reforestation and PV installations (e.g. agro-PV). Finally, we expect potential offsetting to be required to cancel out remaining residual emissions. In fact, due to its density and location and ban of biomass use because of air-quality issues, Milan has no access to BECCS (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage). One CCUS (Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage) project is currently at demonstration stage (e.g. Hercules), running in 2023-27 at the waste treatment plant. Results could pave the way for offsetting mechanisms at industrial sites in the metropolitan area.

## 3.3 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

Expanding on the identified impact pathways and systemic barriers, the monitoring and reporting framework will be customized to address specific challenges and opportunities in advancing climate action in Milan. This approach ensures that monitoring efforts are not only comprehensive but also strategic, focusing on areas where interventions are most needed and can have the greatest impact.

By aligning monitoring activities with the identified impact pathways and systemic barriers, the Municipality of Milan and other stakeholders can better track progress, pinpoint areas of success, and address any barriers or challenges that may arise.

The monitoring process facilitated by the Climate City Contract initiative will foster continuous learning for all stakeholders involved. Through regular updates of action sheets within the portfolio and progress tracking based on suggested indicators, stakeholders can evaluate the effectiveness of planned or ongoing actions and identify areas for improvement. This iterative approach will allow for flexibility in adjusting strategies and interventions to better align with climate objectives and address emerging challenges.

Furthermore, by implementing this comprehensive monitoring and reporting framework, the city of Milan can effectively track its progress toward climate neutrality, ensure accountability, and adapt strategies as needed to achieve its climate objectives.

As part of the Climate City Contract initiative, the signatories of the commitments will be responsible for regularly updating the action sheets within the portfolio (refer to Annex 1). These updates will be based on the suggested indicators listed below, which may be supplemented with additional ones proposed later on. This iterative process aims to measure the progress of planned or ongoing actions, evaluate their effectiveness, and identify areas for improvement.

## Objectives, frequency, and approach of monitoring:

The Municipality of Milan will take the lead in establishing a comprehensive monitoring system to track the interventions outlined in the portfolio.

This monitoring system will serve multiple purposes:

Mapping the progress of the Climate City Contract: The system will provide insights into the implementation status of various initiatives included in the Climate City Contract, allowing stakeholders to track their advancement over time.
Evaluating the city's overall climate actions: Beyond the specific commitments outlined in the Climate City Contract, the monitoring system will also assess the broader climate actions undertaken by the city. This evaluation will help measure the effectiveness of these actions in achieving climate-related goals and objectives.

Overall, the monitoring system will play a crucial role in ensuring transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement in the city's efforts to combat climate change and promote sustainability.

The key objectives of the monitoring program are expected to be as follows:

Monitor the status of actions, verify the achievement of established objectives.
Continuously monitor indicators based on available data, adjusting them if necessary to ensure accuracy and relevance.
Comune di Milano

Climate-Neutrality ACTION PLAN

4

Compare indicator trends with Plan forecasts and objectives to assess progress and identify areas needing improvement.
Determine the need for corrective measures and Plan realignment if deviations from objectives occur or to align with international commitments or stricter regulatory requirements.

The city will conduct biannual follow-ups on its progress towards climate neutrality, aligning with the existing structures and organization of the city's climate strategy.

This monitoring will be integrated into the city's regular monitoring system and reported to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Plus, the CCC monitoring process will benefit from the experience gained during the first monitoring schedule of the Air and Climate Plan, scheduled to occur by the end of 2024.

During the first iteration in 2026, the monitoring process for the Action Plan will be defined and tested. To facilitate this, a set of indicators consistent with the impact pathways has been developed (see table B-3.1). These indicators will enable the measurement of progress and assess the effectiveness of the actions outlined in the Action Plan.

## Integration with the Reinventing Cities Programs and the establishment of "Carbon Neutral Areas" within Milan's Air and Climate Plan

The CCC monitoring will integrate data from the monitoring process of the Reinventing Cities programs and the Air and Climate Plan monitoring programme relating to "Carbon Neutral Areas"23 - which constitute some of the molecules of the Climate City Contract - as they become available. Those monitoring processes are based on the "carbon assessment of the project and environmental monitoring protocol" predefined by the participation requirements of the contest, in the case of Reinventing Cities, and set in the Guidelines for Carbon Neutral Areas.

The reference is to one of the actions of the Air and Climate Plan (3.1.1), which involves the creation of "Carbon Neutral" pilot areas to demonstrate the possibility of making Milan a carbon-neutral city by 2050.

# 4. Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

In the past years and in the framework of its participation to the Cities Mission, the City of Milan has developed an innovative and experimental governance framework, characterized by:

A multi-governance approach: Milan has coordinated itself with selected Italian cities - Bergamo, Bologna, Florence, Padua, Parma, Prato, Rome, Turin - to share, collect, and organize information derived from initiatives and projects related to the objectives of the Cities Mission. These cities are actively collaborating with the Ministry of Infrastructures and Transports, with which they have signed a Protocol of Understanding. The goal is to develop proposals for regulatory solutions, identify strategies to attract additional funding, exchange best practices, and collaborate on strategic and operational projects.

A collaborative approach: the city has adopted a participatory governance model that involves citizens and stakeholders in decision-making processes, promoting coordination, co-creation, and decision-sharing. More specifically, the Air and Climate Plan's ambitious approach to addressing the climate emergency involves engaging "challenge owners" (public administrators, companies, universities, NGOs) and educating and involving the broader citizen community, through Milan's Permanent Citizen's Assembly on Climate, and Milan's Alliance for Air and Climate. This aims to facilitate the transition to more sustainable and less carbon-intensive lifestyles by empowering local communities to understand and utilize leverage points for social innovation and behavioural change.

Empowering Collaborative Urban Regeneration for Climate Neutrality: consistently with the collaborative approach, the stakeholder panel that endorsed the current edition of the Milan CCC represents an ecosystem of actors, resources, and strategic competencies aimed at promoting exemplary pathways and initiatives for urban regeneration increasingly aligned with climate neutrality. During the execution of the commitments outlined in the CCC, special emphasis will be placed on engaging citizens and local communities residing in the identified transformation nuclei to collaboratively determine the most effective approaches for advancing interventions towards a fair and inclusive transition. Universities, facilitated by official collaboration protocols with the administration25, along with housing cooperatives and other enabling entities, will play a pivotal role in translating principles of inclusion, participation, and equity into these processes. They will maintain ongoing connections with local communities and residents, with a focus on addressing the potential impacts of the transition on the most vulnerable groups.

Innovation and experimentation: Given the overarching nature of climate objectives, the Mission has been acting as a catalyst for organizational and regulatory innovations within Milan's administration. For example, the creation of the Urban Resilience Department to institutionalize the role of a Chief Resilience Officer within the administration, has helped working in a cross-sectoral way on the city's climate agenda.

Data driven and technology enabled decision making: Milan is leading the way with innovative initiatives that combine new data sources, advanced technologies, and strategic partnerships to deepen our understanding of the urban environment, mitigate the effects of climate change, and quickly respond to emerging challenges. Serving as drivers for change, Milan has engaged stakeholders who play a pivotal role in cultivating an open and collaborative ecosystem within the region, such as Milano Smart City Alliance. Furthermore, the city of Milan has created the

In 2022, the Municipality of Milan approved guidelines for the signing of a Framework Agreement between the Municipality and Milanese Universities, as well as Higher Education and Cultural Institutions. The agreement aims to facilitate joint collaboration initiatives promoting development, innovation, and internationalization aligned with projects outlined in the 2021-2026 mandate program.

## 4.2 Module C-2 Social Innovation Interventions

The social innovations described in the C.2.1 Sample Table address the following systemic barriers:

### Political barriers:

Lack of engagement and commitment from central government who have control over regulatory and legislative levers, possibility of conflicting national, regional and municipal frameworks.
Lack of the right skills and expertise in the administration needed for climate neutrality, siloed work organization within the public administration.

### Technological/infrastructural/city makers barriers:

Cost of implementing actions to decarbonize the technological/infrastructure system.
Complex and fragmented regulatory framework, especially regarding the energy transition path.

### Social barriers:

Lack of a unified understanding and common vision on climate neutrality
Deep-rooted individual behaviours that hamper the climate neutrality pathway.
Short-term vision due to the uncertainty of financial resources and fundraising.

The interventions described are carried on by environmental associations, public and utilities companies, philanthropic organizations and housing cooperatives. Most social innovation interventions seek to empower citizens by raising their awareness on climate change as well as co-constructing sustainable practices with the latter (for instance, the Eco-Hackathon by Legambiente).

Another part of the social innovation interventions aims at fostering innovation of SMEs and startups in the energy field and the agricultural field (for example, the Ecomill initiative by Fondazione Cariplo), while some of the described social interventions focus on the capacity building of public administrations (for instance, the ClimaMI intervention by Fondazione Cariplo).

Empowerment, co-creation and capacity buildings are the main common elements across the described social innovation interventions, enabling stakeholders and citizens to join the journey towards climate neutrality. While most of the social interventions seek to engage with all social groups by involving them in an accessible and pedagogical way (photography contests, tree planting, decorating and taking care of the public space), some social innovation interventions focus more specifically on marginalized groups, such as The Energy Bank initiative by A2A (supports individuals facing energy poverty), the Bella Dentro project by Fondazione Cariplo (valorisation of unesthetic fresh products in cooperation with social cooperatives that work with vulnerable individuals) and the Vesti Solidale project by Fondazione Cariplo (creation of job opportunities for marginalized groups providing waste collection services for recycling and reuse).

Long-term impact and scale up of the existing and future social innovation activities will be ensured by mobilizing the necessary funds (Municipality budget, European funds and contributions from the partners involved in the project), by the human resources mobilized and the civic ambition, motivation and interest of the community.

# 5. Outlook and next steps

## 5.1 Stakeholder Engagement: Follow-up and Integration of New Participants

The current Action Plan delineates our roadmap for achieving climate neutrality, driven by our responsibility as a participant to the EU Cities Mission to catalyse systemic innovations and transformative actions in targeted emission sectors, leveraging all available resources. Milan aims to engage both organizations and residents, ensuring sustained involvement through initiatives like the ongoing Air and Climate Alliance and the Permanent Citizens Assembly. This endeavour necessitates not only coordination across different levels but also interventions that span various sectors, involving a diverse range of local stakeholders.

The development of the Climate City Contract's Action Plan has enabled 25 invited stakeholders to contribute to Milan's pursuit of climate neutrality by 2030. These stakeholders represent a rich and local ecosystem comprising diverse entities that can play pivotal roles in achieving the city's climate objectives. The inaugural edition of Milan's Climate City Contract has provided an opportunity to trial stakeholder engagement methodologies, with plans for further refinement and review based on valuable feedback gathered from involved stakeholders.

For 2024-2025, our focus will include:

Soliciting feedback from current stakeholders and expanding the Climate City Contract to encompass additional stakeholders and areas of transformation, thereby broadening the scope and effectiveness of climate action initiatives across Milan. This process may involve an expression of interest.
Getting feedback and establishing potential synergies with the revision process of the City Masterplan (PGT). This inclusive approach involves citizens, universities, businesses, civil society organizations, and sector experts in decision-making concerning urban and territorial development to facilitate the establishment of new rules and policies that advance environmental sustainability, urban resilience, and social inclusion, as described in the Commitments document (2.2 Ambition: testing, replicating and scaling up a "molecular strategy").
Continuously seeking feedback from the Milan's Air and Climate Alliance, as described in this Action Plan (5.1 Governance Innovation Interventions).
Developing digital tools and platforms to facilitate citizen engagement and participation in climate-related activities and decision-making processes, as described in the Commitments document (4.3 Molecular Action: Mobilizing Stakeholders and Citizens for Climate Neutrality).
Monitoring and reporting on progress towards climate neutrality goals, including tracking emissions reductions, energy savings, and other key performance indicators.

## 5.2 Expand and map the portfolio's actions geographically

Milan's Climate City Contract revolves around the concept of "climate-neutral molecules," aiming to explore, replicate, and scale up innovative solutions to achieve city-wide climate neutrality. Initially outlined in the Commitments document, the scope of actions and target areas expanded beyond the initial Expression of Interest, encompassing proposed actions that extended beyond the identified territorial areas for the 2030 climate neutrality goal. This shift led the city to broaden its focus to cover the entire territory in pursuit of carbon neutrality.

The action portfolio details a series of initiatives targeting measurable emission reductions initiated post-2021 and anticipated to conclude by 2030. These actions, outlined in Module B1, come with detailed cost projections and

require no additional funding. They include Urban Regeneration Molecules, Interventions on Networks and Infrastructures, Small-scale Projects, Enabling Actions, and a section dedicated to strategic actions (Strategies, STR). These strategic actions involve collaborative efforts with stakeholders to accelerate energy renovations in private buildings, enhance energy efficiency in the tertiary sector, and increase local renewable electricity production. Additionally, there's a plan to reduce reliance on private mobility by transitioning to electrified means and promoting public transport and active mobility.

For 2024-2025, our focus will be on:

Further implementing the action portfolio (across all types of actions) through new projects and initiatives led by both existing and new partners and stakeholders.
Enhancing the "Strategies" component and formulating an investment plan supported by innovative tools and financial partners. This endeavor will be pivotal in the activities conducted at the capital hubs established by the European Commission for the post-delivery phase of the Climate City Contracts by the Mission Cities.
Developing climate-neutral scenarios for Milan by 2030 based on the Climate City Contract portfolio, facilitating a comprehensive grasp of Milan's localized acceleration efforts.

# 5.3 Translate the city's strategies in concrete action plans to close the remaining gap

The development of the Action Plan has facilitated the identification of Milan's emission gap that needs to be addressed in the coming years. This involves delineating strategic priorities for short and medium-term efforts by developing action lines, tools, and projects gradually. These efforts can be augmented by contributions from external stakeholders invited to participate in future editions of the CCC, thanks to the molecular strategy. Digitalization, smart components, and behavioral changes among citizens will play significant roles in this process.

Based on the framework presented, future strategies and actions will focus on:

Stationary sources (residential buildings and other use destinations, primarily electrical uses in the tertiary sector);
Mobility and transport (approximately 80 KTons CO2eq), with a further shift towards electric mobility for private transportation and a reduction in private vehicle usage in favour of public transport and soft mobility.

Achieving decarbonization goals for stationary sources poses significant challenges due to the magnitude of emissions and the types of actions required. The gap in this area amounts to approximately 1600 KTons CO2eq, including around 1070 KtCO2 eq due to building heating and approximately 530 Kton due to final electrical uses in the tertiary, commercial, and services sector.

Milan's Air and Climate Plan outlines actions in both sectors. For heating, policies aim to accelerate the rate of deep retrofitting of buildings, transition to heat pumps where possible, and promote the recovery of waste heat. For electrical uses in the tertiary and services sectors, further demand reduction is expected, aided by the introduction of flexible grid management systems.

At the municipal level, initiatives include incentives through Milan's contributory Charges for Urbanization, emission requirements for building interventions, and direct capital incentives. Indeed, as part of the City Masterplan revision process, new implementation rules for interventions should be guided by environmental objectives and criteria. Specifically, with regard to achieving climate neutrality, regulations pertaining to carbon-

neutral private construction are currently being revised to introduce incentives and facilitations. Furthermore, regulations related to resilience, afforestation, and parking/heat islands are being bolstered.

Future iterations of the CCC aim to involve new entities managing significant assets across various sectors. To achieve these goals, a coordinated effort involving policymakers, industry stakeholders, community organizations, and regional-national government is crucial.

According to the outlined strategy, the objective in the future iterations of the CCC is to involve new entities managing significant assets (residential, commercial, tertiary, and general service sectors):

Hospitals and healthcare facilities in Milan (under the jurisdiction of the Lombardy Region, responsible for healthcare policies);
ALER Lombardia (manages a significant portion of the public residential housing stock, including properties in Milan);
Metropolitan City of Milan (responsible for the energy efficiency of many school facilities within the municipal territory);
Urban regeneration operators and cooperative housing associations;
Real estate asset management companies;
Milano Sport S.p.A. (a municipal company managing the city's sports facilities);
Milano-Cortina 2026 Foundation (focused on promoting a sustainable edition of the Games).

Synergies will also be created with Milan's Alliance for Air and Climate, which will involve a large panel of local companies with tertiary assets targeted by climate neutrality interventions.

The focus for the coming years includes:

Drafting an engagement program for 2025;
Updating action plans, tools, and finances for 2026-2027;
Implementing updated portfolios of action for 2027-2030.

# 5.4 Developing a scenario of decarbonization of the entire building stock of the city

Several tools and initiatives will support Milan's strategy to accelerate its decarbonization by 2030. For instance, the Crescenzago pilot case allowed the development of a simulation system for building stock efficiency scenarios at the neighbourhood/city scale (type of intervention/impact on emissions/investment required).

Using this simulation software in the neighbourhood of Crescenzago led to the definition of a decarbonization scenario on an area comprising 630 buildings of different construction periods and uses, thus supporting planning and decision-making processes.

Extending the results of the study to the entire building stock present in the municipal territory (mainly private) of 65,000 buildings, allowed a simulation (using a multiplier factor) of the interventions and investments needed to achieve decarbonization, serving as a knowledge base to outline possible implementation tools.

The next steps following the elaboration of the Action Plan will therefore involve conducting further analysis of the assessments conducted thus far and developing tools, policies, and actions to give substance to the identified strategic lines.

# 5.5 Capitalizing on the Climate City Contract process and embedding Climate Budgeting Principles within the Municipality of Milan

The development of the investment plan faced considerable barriers due to the absence of a climate budgeting system within the city. However, this challenge also brought forth opportunities to advance the alignment of climate objectives with budgeting and financial planning processes. Moving forward, key steps could include:

Establishing Data Collection Systems: Implementing comprehensive data collection systems to facilitate informed decision-making and prioritize interventions effectively. These systems should gather relevant data on emissions, climate impacts, and financial metrics to support the development of climate-aligned budgets and investment plans.
Working towards integrating climate objectives into existing budgeting and financial planning mechanisms: This may involve revising budgeting processes to explicitly consider climate-related costs and benefits, as well as incorporating climate risk assessments into financial planning frameworks.
Engaging financial Stakeholders: Collaborate with relevant stakeholders, including government agencies, EU institutions, Bank Foundations, and private sector partners, to gather input and expertise in developing climate-aligned budgeting and financial planning mechanisms and tools. Engaging stakeholders can help ensure that diverse perspectives are considered and that proposed solutions are feasible and effective.
Building Capacity and Expertise: Invest in building internal capacity and expertise within municipal departments responsible for budgeting and financial planning. This may involve providing training and resources to staff members to enhance their understanding of climate issues and their ability to integrate climate considerations into budgeting processes.
Monitoring and Evaluation: Implement robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track progress towards climate objectives and assess the effectiveness of climate-aligned budgeting and financial planning efforts. This may involve establishing key performance indicators (KPIs) and conducting regular reviews to identify areas for improvement and optimization.

# 5.6 Climate City Contract Update and Monitoring Iterations

The Climate City Contract is scheduled for its initial update phase tentatively by 2026, informed by participation and updates in the Cities Mission. It will undergo regular updates with more detailed information, incorporating new governing documents and stakeholders' involvement approximately every two years, as outlined in the commitments document signed by the Municipality and stakeholders. This update process will interact with the monitoring process by enhancing existing indicators and integrating new ones as needed, thus incrementally contributing to the goal of climate neutrality.

The monitoring and reporting framework for the city's progress towards climate neutrality, enabled by the Climate City Contract initiative, fosters a continuous learning process for all stakeholders involved. By regularly updating action sheets within the portfolio and tracking progress based on suggested indicators, stakeholders can assess the effectiveness of planned or ongoing actions and identify areas for improvement. This iterative approach allows for flexibility in adjusting strategies and interventions to better align with climate objectives and address emerging challenges.

The Municipality of Milan will lead the establishment of a comprehensive monitoring system to track the interventions outlined in the portfolio. This system serves multiple purposes, including mapping the progress of the
Comune di Milano

Climate-Neutrality ACTION PLAN

Climate City Contract initiatives and evaluating the city's overall climate actions. The monitoring system ensures transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement in the city's efforts to combat climate change and promote sustainability.

The key objectives of the monitoring program include monitoring the status of actions, continuously monitoring indicators, comparing indicator trends with plan forecasts and objectives, and determining the need for corrective measures and plan realignment. The city will conduct biannual follow-ups on its progress towards climate neutrality, aligning with the evaluation of the City's Air and Climate Plan, and reporting to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The CCC monitoring process will benefit from the experience gained during the first monitoring schedule of the Air and Climate Plan, scheduled by the end of 2024.

During the first iteration in 2026, the monitoring process for the Action Plan will be defined and tested, facilitated by a set of indicators consistent with the impact pathways. These indicators will enable the measurement of progress and assessment of the effectiveness of the actions outlined in the Action Plan.

Integration with Reinventing Cities Programs will ensure that data from these programs, constituting some of the molecules of the Climate City Contract, is integrated into the monitoring process. This monitoring process is based on the "carbon assessment of the project and environmental monitoring protocol" predefined by the participation requirements of the contest.

# 1. Introduction

In recent years, the City of Milan has undertaken a transformative journey towards environmental sustainability and carbon neutrality, aiming to create a healthy, resilient, just, and innovative urban environment that fosters sustainable and equitable prosperity for both citizens and the economy.

The Municipality strongly endorses the European Union's vision of a just and socially fair transition towards a 55% reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as outlined in the "Fit for 55" package.

This vision is consistent with several commitments undertaken by the city of Milan earlier than the current European acceleration. In 2017, Milan endorsed the C40 Deadline 2020, committing to become a carbon neutral and climate resilient city by 2050, through the development and implementation of a climate action plan aligned with the objectives of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The following year, the City joined the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and increase its resilience by adapting to the impacts of climate change, by way of a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) outlining mitigation measures and adaptation guidelines. Since then, the Municipality has undertaken several other sectoral commitments in specific fields of climate action, such as mobility, waste, food, air quality, urban reforestation, construction, and water resources¹.

In alignment with these commitments, the Municipality has developed an ambitious Air and Climate Plan (Piano Aria e Clima - PAC): a comprehensive strategy aimed at transforming Milan into a fully carbon-neutral and resilient city by 2050.

The plan is organized in five key-areas (Health, Connections and Accessibility, Energy, Climate Change Adaptation, and Awareness) and serves as a cross-cutting and strategic guidance for the planning and programming tools established by the Administration. Primary objectives include:

To improve air quality by reducing concentrations of atmospheric pollutants;
To reduce GHG emissions and promote decarbonization through mitigation measures;
To contribute to the containment of temperature increase through cooling and adaptation to climate change.

This strategic document was the result of an inclusive process involving citizens, associations, businesses, and various stakeholders, building on Milan's participation in the Deep Demonstrations of Healthy, Clean Cities under the EIT Climate-KIC initiative, which aimed to make 15 participating cities carbon neutral by 2030. The plan's goals and measures served as a basis for discussion and analysis for the Deep Demonstration process, and, in turn, the Deep Demonstration process contributed to the development of more concrete and efficient measures outlined in the Air and Climate Plan.

The Climate City Contract is set to build upon the solid foundation of the Air and Climate Plan's robust action framework. By doing so, it will not only anticipate but also fortify many of the objectives and actions outlined in the Air and Climate Plan, as elaborated in the subsequent paragraphs. This synergy will be achieved in alignment with other strategic documents like the City's Masterplan (Piano di Governo del Territorio), leveraging the expertise and resources of both private and public stakeholders.

Milan's dedication to civic engagement is evident through the establishment of the Permanent Citizens' Assembly on Climate. This participatory tool empowers residents to actively contribute to the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the Air and Climate Plan. Recognized with a Special Mention

¹ For a complete list of Milan's commitments, see Table 1.
Comune di Milano

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

for Climate at the "Best Practice in Citizen Participation Award," this assembly represents a powerful mechanism for inclusive decision-making, harnessing the social potential of the city's diverse population.

The city's commitment extends to urban planning with the experimentation on Carbon Neutral Areas. These zones, undergoing transformative development or revitalization, are strategically designed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. The Municipality of Milan has set clear criteria and developed comprehensive guidelines for greenhouse gas calculation and offsetting in these areas, establishing a robust framework for sustainable construction practices and mobility, reinforcing Milan's position as a leader in climate-conscious urban planning.

Moreover, as a result of the aforementioned two-year Deep Demonstration process (2020-2021), some interconnected, replicable, and scalable experiments were conducted, providing valuable insights and knowledge across internationally related projects in Europe. In particular, two innovative tools the city has begun to develop will contribute to support Milan's commitment to sustainable urban development:

an innovative Energy Dashboard aimed at supporting decision-making. This dashboard could meticulously track energy-related data from buildings across the city, providing a comprehensive understanding of energy needs. This knowledge will serve as a catalyst for targeted energy interventions, empowering Milan to make informed decisions that contribute to the overarching goal of decarbonization.
the Milan Transition Fund, building upon initial experimentation in 2020, could represent a groundbreaking financial model geared towards sustainability. By leveraging energy savings derived from building interventions, such as insulation upgrades and the transition from fossil fuels to electric energy, the fund could finance capital and installation costs. This innovative approach will not only support building owners in making eco-friendly upgrades but also ensure a self-sustaining cycle of investment, fostering a city-wide transition towards cleaner energy sources.

In the light of its strong commitment to carbon neutrality and the recognition of the importance of experimentation, Milan applied to the Mission recognizing three key principles and elements of value:

Involvement of the entire city: fostering a sense of ownership and shared responsibility among all stakeholders.
Broader perspective: going beyond local political cycles, crucial for addressing complex challenges requiring systemic change in a large city.
Support for realistic action plans: assisting cities in constructing realistic action plans based on an incremental logic, envisioning progressive improvements and expansions, and identifying appropriate funding mechanisms.

Additionally, the Mission is expected to facilitate partnerships on a global scale, connecting Milan with other Italian, European, and extra-European cities, different government levels, NGOs, and the private sector.

# 2. Goal

In the last decade, greenhouse gas emissions in Milan have progressively decreased. The graph provided illustrates this trend from 2013 to 2021 alongside the targets set forth in the Air and Climate Plan for 2030.

Regarding stationary sources, the reduction in emissions has been due to the progressive decrease in energy consumption for heating, mainly attributed to the renewal of thermal plants and, to a lesser extent, to building refurbishment interventions. The progressive elimination of diesel fuel (supported by regional and municipal incentives) has also contributed to emission reduction in this sector, with a shift to gas and, to a lesser extent, district heating or heat pumps.

Regarding transportation, there has been a decrease in gasoline and diesel consumption, mainly due to the evolution of the vehicle fleet and a reduction in travel distances.

The challenge of contributing to climate neutrality by 2030 requires accelerating the energy transition to reduce 2080 kt CO $_2$ eq emissions (as illustrated in Figure 2) and also enhancing the city's resilience to climate risks.

As clarified in the Action Plan, Module A-2.3 (Table A-2.1, "City's emissions gap and residual emissions") the emission reduction target is calculated after accounting for planned and ongoing actions within the Air and Climate Plan, covering the period until 2030, with an additional  $20\%$  of emissions to be offset. The resulting "Action Plan target" will be covered by the contribution of the action portfolio presented by the Municipality of Milan and the signing stakeholders (better described in the Action Plan and related Annexes (3.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design), as well as by additional actions and projects

that will be integrated into the Climate City Contract in subsequent iterations following the first edition in 2024, referred to at this time as the "Strategies".

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 2: Milan's Emissions Reduction Target

Addressing this multifaceted challenge goes beyond merely targeting emission sources; it necessitates a fundamental societal transformation and a shift in urban development, governance, and lifestyle.

Consistently with this goal, the Climate City Contract of Milan is based on the acceleration and strengthening of some objectives and actions outlined in the Air and Climate Plan, focusing on two main aspects:

Creating a network of diverse stakeholders – including public institutions, businesses, universities, and civil society organizations – working together to drive the climate transition of the city. Milan's Climate City Contract prioritizes collaboration with and engagement of the local private sector, especially key stakeholders involved in major urban regeneration interventions. These entities are encouraged to integrate climate risks as fundamental aspects of their projects. The goal is to explore new approaches and intervention models.
Implementing a strategy based on establishing multiple accelerated transformation centers distributed throughout the city, acting as catalysts for neighborhood regeneration and decarbonization efforts, led by both public and private entities $^2$ .

Crucial to unlocking this transformation is fostering collaboration among administrations and internal interdepartmental coordination, facilitated by a dedicated "transition team". Additionally, establishing frameworks for the involvement of various stakeholders is essential for driving meaningful and lasting

change. In the following paragraphs, more details will be provided on how the work program has been set up in this regard.

## 2.1 Milan, urban regeneration to mitigate climate change and improve urban resilience, considering social inclusion

Milan's real estate sector has long been - and still is - characterized by dynamic trends, evolving demand patterns, and significant processes of re-development, resulting in new neighbourhoods with innovative concepts and design. That is why the contribution of urban regeneration to climate neutrality is strategic.

With the long process of revitalization of abandoned industrial areas now completed, attention has shifted to neglected infrastructures, particularly the railway hubs that once served the city's industrial production base but are now unused. Milan is home to seven such hubs, which are the focus of a planning agreement involving the Municipality of Milan, the government of the Region of Lombardy, and the Italian National Railways company.

These railway yards, along with the area that hosted Expo Milan 2015 and a network of disused or underutilized military barracks, represent significant resources for urban development (MIND - Milano Innovation District - Programma Integrato di Intervento).

These areas are the heart of the current City's Masterplan, known as "Milan 2030", which envisages creating a city with advanced environmental standards. This involves both public and private projects that employ cutting-edge technologies and innovative design solutions. The aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, achieve zero-energy buildings and promote material recycling. It also includes reintegrating nature into urban areas, improving water drainage, cooling microclimates, and restoring biodiversity. The Masterplan is currently going through a participatory review process aimed at combining urban development with an improvement of the environment, the quality of life and the size of parks and gardens. The revised document will define new sustainability standards minimizing carbon emissions for new buildings, establishing incentives and monitoring and control systems.

In line with this efforts, Milan was acknowledged as a global testbed for urban green innovation thanks to C40's Reinventing Cities global competition, through which the City selected 9 winning projects (4 in 2019 and 5 in 2020). These showcase how cities can advance environmental and social goals simultaneously, while contributing to local economic development by generating green jobs.

Furthermore, in an effort to ready Milan's neighborhoods for climate-related risks while enhancing public spaces with a focus on community well-being, the City has launched a new initiative known as "Green and Thriving Neighbourhoods for Resilient Communities" (GTNRC), in collaboration with C40 Cities and Z Zurich. This program is dedicated to implementing resilient and inclusive projects within neighborhoods, merging the 15-minute city concept with locally-driven climate adaptation strategies. Over the next three years, the City aims to introduce spatial interventions aimed at bolstering community resilience, primarily in the Crescenzago-Rubattino area (in the northeastern outskirts of the city), serving as prototypes for a comprehensive approach to district revitalization and the transformation of public spaces based on principles of proximity.

The Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics and Paralympics will mark the peak of Milan's overall progress, emphasizing sustainability and striving for zero carbon. It will establish a carbon management strategy, implementing measures to minimize the carbon footprint by utilizing energy-efficient and low carbon solutions for both temporary and permanent infrastructures.

Special attention for social inclusion is paid in the planning and implementation of all climate actions of the City of Milan, striving to ensure that the most vulnerable population groups are not left behind and their needs are carefully considered. Similarly, the City's Welfare Plan, approved in 2022, has acknowledged climate change impacts as one of the causes of growing social inequalities and committed to a closer cooperation among municipal departments on shared issues. As part of its efforts to combat energy poverty, the city is closely aligning its welfare strategy with the Air and Climate Plan and related initiatives. Currently, Milan is drafting a plan specifically focused on addressing energy poverty and insecurity, titled "Towards Shared Energy Well-Being". The plan involves the Environment, Welfare, and Housing Departments. On one hand, it aims to identify and support economically disadvantaged households that face the greatest difficulties in adequately addressing extreme heat or cold conditions, increasingly common due to the climate crisis, with serious health consequences. On the other hand, it aims to continue pursuing decarbonization and air quality improvement objectives, promoting a fair and inclusive energy transition for all.

## 2.2 From the Expression of Interest to the redefinition of the geographic boundary corresponding to 2030 climate neutrality target

Given the ambitious goal and the city's vibrancy and attractiveness for private investment in urban regeneration, Milan applied to the EU Cities Mission in 2021 grounding its Expression of Interest in a progressive approach defined as a "molecular" strategy. The vision was to achieve carbon neutrality in selected areas by 2030, aiming to make the entire city emissions-free by 2050, as outlined in the City's Air and Climate Plan.

To achieve this, a strategy was proposed at the territorial level, initially targeting integrated areas with infrastructure and innovative carbon-neutral projects (target areas), conceived as equivalents to smaller cities. These defined nuclei were intended to act as drivers for accelerating the path to climate neutrality, through the subsequent expansion of the regeneration and urban development model they tested to the rest of the city's territory, supported by a system of economic incentives and disincentives.

These target areas identified for achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 corresponded to the Local Identity Nodes (NIL)³ where major urban transformations were planned or underway, driven by the winning projects of the more ambitious C40 "Reinventing Cities" international competitions (Via Serio – "VITAE" Project, Bovisa Node – "MoLeCoLa (Mobility, Learning, Community, Lab)" Project, Loreto – "Milano per LOC" Project, Crescenzago – "Green Between Urban Fabrics" Project, Lambrate Depot – "Lambrate Streaming" Project, Ex-Macello – "ARIA" Project). These areas were already undergoing urban redevelopment interventions (Montecity Rogoredo, Merezzate, MIND, Garibaldi-Repubblica, Giambellino 115) and the significant regenerations planned in the City Masterplan (Bovisa, Porto di Mare, Piazza d'Armi). The combination of areas corresponding to the identified NILs covered a total of 76.4 km² (approximately 42% of the city's territory) and included around 260,000 inhabitants (approximately 18.6% of the resident population).

Figure 3 presents a map from the Expression of Interest, highlighting the targeted areas (NILs) involved.

³ Local Identity Nuclei ["Nuclei di Identità Locale" (NIL)] are defined as territorial subdivision of the Municipality of Milan corresponding to the minimum planning units provided for within the City Masterplan (PGT).

Figure 3: Milan's Target for Carbon Neutrality: "Urban Regeneration Molecules" (Expression of Interest, January 2022)

When drafting the CCC Action Plan, actions and targets initially outlined in the Expression of Interest were expanded to include proposed actions that went beyond the identified territorial areas for the 2030 climate neutrality goal. This meant that the city expanded its focus to cover the entire territory in order to achieve carbon neutrality. As a result, the emission inventories used to calculate the emission gap by 2030 are based on the city scale, covering the administrative boundaries of the Municipality of Milan, as illustrated in Table A.2.1 "City's emission gap and residual emissions".

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
Figure 4: Milan's Geographical Target for Carbon Neutrality (Climate City Contract, March 2024)

Consequently, as detailed in paragraph 3.2 of the Action Plan (Module B.2 "Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design"), the action portfolio has been crafted with a city-wide perspective, incorporating diverse strategies to achieve Milan's neutrality goal by 2030.

## 2.3 Structuring and Co-Designing Milan's Climate Action Portfolio

The refined framework maintains the original focus on "climate-neutral molecules," aiming to explore, replicate, and scale up innovative solutions to achieve climate neutrality city-wide. Additionally, it incorporates targeted actions and infrastructure interventions benefiting the entire city, such as energy efficiency measures, public transportation enhancements, and green space expansion. Furthermore, it encompasses a network of projects at the scale of individual buildings or smaller, distributed throughout the city.

A first set of actions focuses on concrete and measurable emission reduction projects initiated after 2021 and currently underway, with completion expected by 2030. These actions are documented in a dedicated section of the Investment Plan (Module B1: Cost Scenarios for Climate Neutrality, Table 2.1: Sectorial Costing, actions planned by the Municipality), providing detailed cost and investment projections. Most importantly, these actions are financially supported, requiring no additional funding:

Urban Regeneration Molecules (MOL): These are district-level projects transforming degraded areas into environmentally and socially beneficial spaces. MOL projects integrate interventions in energy-efficient buildings, transportation, green spaces, and circular economy practices. They serve as hubs for neutrality by exemplifying multi-stakeholder initiatives aligned with decarbonization goals. Examples include carbon-neutral areas or urban regeneration projects showcasing replicable sustainable approaches.
Interventions on Networks and Infrastructures (NET): These include upgrades to existing networks or new infrastructure projects benefiting the entire city. Examples encompass improving energy efficiency in buildings, expanding district heating networks, modernizing the electrical grid, and promoting sustainable transportation and green spaces.
Small-scale Projects (PRJ): These are energy interventions at the scale of individual buildings or smaller, distributed throughout the city. Examples include building envelope improvements, installation of photovoltaic panels, and experimental renewable energy systems.
Enabling Actions (ENB): According to literature, these initiatives can indirectly contribute to emission reduction by influencing behaviors and lifestyles, with an estimated potential to reduce the emission gap by up to 10%. This estimate is supported by various sources including the European Environment Agency (EEA) which details how behavioral changes can enhance energy efficiency⁵. The International Energy Agency (IEA) also emphasizes the significant impact of behavior changes on reducing CO2 emissions⁶. Such initiatives, therefore, play a crucial role in achieving substantial emission reductions by promoting energy-efficient behaviors and lifestyle adjustments.

In addition to the ongoing actions, the Action Plan identifies strategic priorities to address the remaining emission gap over the next years:

Strategies (STR): This section outlines strategic lines of action in collaboration with stakeholders, guided by emission reduction scenarios. Key focuses include accelerating energy renovation of private buildings, enhancing energy efficiency in the tertiary sector, and increasing local renewable electricity production. In addition to this, the administration plans an additional effort to reduce

dependence on private mobility means (to be progressively electrified) and to encourage the use of public transport and active mobility.

The portfolio co-design activities were conducted collaboratively through dedicated workshops involving various categories of invited local stakeholders (as detailed in Paragraph 4.2, "Participatory Governance and Key Stakeholders for Accelerated Change"). These events facilitated feedback on the Climate City Contract transition pathway and resulted in a co-designed portfolio of actions based on shared key priorities set by the administration.

Additionally, a robust sheet template has been developed to collect action proposals along with a comprehensive set of related data and indicators. This template has been further validated by the internal transition team, ensuring its robustness and alignment with the city's climate goals.

The strategy will constantly evolve, supported by a framework of rules and policies, including incentives and disincentives, integrated into the revision process of the City Masterplan (PGT).

As a result, a transition team will lead efforts to map climate-neutral scenarios for Milan by 2030, creating an "atlas" of new urban regeneration zones striving for climate neutrality. This atlas will integrate elements such as renewable energy infrastructure, district heating networks, green transportation, and nature-based solutions, while also identifying further development prospects.

Here are some examples of ongoing mappings aimed at obtaining a layered map of interventions included in Milan's Climate City Contract.

# 2.4 Co-benefits of Accelerating Climate Action

The acceleration of Milan's climate mitigation and adaptation is expected to generate numerous co-benefits for the city and its community. These co-benefits underscore the interconnected nature of climate action and its cross-cutting impacts on various aspects of urban life. The categorization below has the purpose of simplifying the dense web of connections between mitigation and adaptation and their positive effects, although it is difficult to clearly distinguish benefits, as is evident from the continuous cross-references.
Comune di Milano
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

# Social co-benefits:

Improved health (physical and mental): A shift towards carbon neutrality and sustainability will contribute to a healthier population, both in the short and long term. For instance, measures for the reduction of vehicles circulation and the promotion of soft mobility will lead to reduced injuries and fatalities caused by road accidents, as well as to lessened heat strokes in the short term, while lowering the incidence of occasional and chronic respiratory problems, cardiopulmonary diseases and lung cancers, decreasing the cases of overweight and obesity and reducing mortality related to heatwaves, air pollution and sedentary lifestyle in the long term. Moreover, a more liveable urban environment and easier access to green and blue areas will improve mental health and wellbeing.
Improved housing quality and accessibility: actions for the improvement of buildings' energy efficiency will, in the first place, improve the thermal comfort of inhabitants and, in the second place, enhance the overall quality of Milan's real estate and its affordability, benefitting the segments of the population with lower spending capacity.
Reduced energy poverty: buildings retrofit and reduced reliance on fossil fuels will decrease energy costs for households and improve thermal comfort, with consequent positive impacts on the economic resources, health and wellbeing of residents, especially those in conditions or at risk of energy poverty.
Improved equity and social inclusion: Thanks to the creation of a 15-minute city, better public spaces, mobility infrastructures and services will be made available to a larger portion of residents, especially in peripheral districts, where the most vulnerable population groups live. Sharing public spaces will also favour citizens engagement, including through voluntary associations, reinforce social relations and help build a stronger sense of community, thus reducing isolation and marginalization and increasing social cohesion.
Improved urban liveability: Sustainable urban planning will help create a more resilient, accessible and pleasant city with green spaces, improved infrastructure, and overall better living conditions. The improved quality of life will not only benefit residents' physical and mental health, but also make the city more attractive, with positive impacts on its economic dynamism.

# Economic co-benefits:

Enhanced employment: With adequate investment in climate actions, over 50,000 new good green jobs could be created over the next ten years⁷, helping enhance overall economic development and social cohesion.
Augmented prosperity: Implementing low-carbon policies will attract investments and contribute to the development of new industries, fostering overall economic vitality.
Fostered innovation: Climate policies will spur innovation in low-carbon technologies, which over time will become cheaper and more widely available. In the long run, green innovation will stimulate general economic growth through increased investment, cheaper energy and more energy efficient production processes, as well as less frequent and costly climate disasters due to enhanced resilience.
Increased energy independence: Diversifying the energy mix and reducing reliance on fossil fuels will contribute to greater energy independence, ensuring a more reliable and resilient energy supply for the city and its economy.

## Environmental co-benefits:

Improved air quality: GHG emissions and air pollution have common sources, therefore many actions that tackle the first also contribute to reduce the latter, as in the case of clean transports and buildings. Improved air quality would result in better health and, consequently, economic savings in terms of healthcare and labour costs.
A greater biodiversity: Climate actions, in particular concerning green and blue areas and NBS, will help safeguard biodiversity, ensuring the conservation, restoration and management of ecosystems services, such as temperature and hydrological regulation. These will provide a buffer against extreme weather events, strengthening the city's resilience to the impacts of climate change. Additionally, a greater and livelier biodiversity will reinforce social and cultural services, like spiritual fulfilment and recreation, with positive impacts on people's mental health and wellbeing.
Reduced acoustic pollution: Climate actions for sustainable mobility (traffic reduction, soft mobility), the expansion of accessible green and blue areas, and cleaner construction sites will help reduce outdoor noise. This will benefit citizens' and workers' mental and physical health thanks to decreased stress, anxiety and fatigue caused by high noise levels.

## 3. Key-priorities and strategic interventions

Based on the City's greenhouse gas inventories used to develop its Air and Climate Plan, Milan has analysed the state of climate action and identified four key-priorities that need to be addressed in the short term to contribute to the climate neutrality goal by 2030.

Contributions to these strategic and systemic priorities are expected from the collaborative efforts of the Municipality and external stakeholders, encompassing a diverse array of policy measures and investments for their successful implementation.

The following are the most significant systemic priorities to be addressed in the short term to contribute to a climate-positive Milan by 2030, at city level and within the priority areas outlined by the Mission: energy efficiency, clean mobility, nature-based approaches, and efficient and circular waste management.

## 3.1 Enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings while reducing reliance on fossil fuels by promoting renewable energy sources (Priority 1)

The challenge of contributing to climate neutrality by 2030 requires accelerating the city's energy transition. This makes it essential to invest in realistic and accessible technical solutions, involving local stakeholders, harmonizing interventions, and systematizing resources.

Emission inventories for 2021 indicate that in Milan, the sectors with the highest energy consumption are building heating, mobility and transportation, and energy use in the tertiary sector.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 6: Milan Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Sector (2021)

Despite local and national incentive mechanisms, the number of deep refurbishment interventions in the building stock is very limited. Accordingly, a strategy to accelerate the decarbonization of Municipal Building Consumption, improving comfort and health for residents and workers is needed.

On one hand, the Administration will promote the fulfillment of commitments already made within the Air and Climate Plan, which includes a 50% reduction in CO₂eq emissions across the entire municipal building portfolio by 2030, encompassing public housing, schools, and services. Additionally, the CCC is seen as an opportunity to support and expedite the reduction in CO₂eq emissions across the urban private stock.

In parallel to the building stock retrofit strategy, a pillar of Milan's energy transition involves initiating a "decarbonization of thermal energy" process, progressively shifting from fossil fuels (mainly gas) to local renewable sources, such as geothermal heat, and waste heat recovery (e.g. from data centers). Positive Energy districts will also be promoted, building on a few pilot projects that are already under construction.

Electricity demand is expected to highly increase in the coming years (for mobility, heat pumps, etc). Accordingly, promoting renewable energy production is a fundamental step to reduce CO₂eq emissions by 60% by 2030 and achieve a carbon-neutral city by 2050. For this reason, it is necessary to first establish local production facilities through the development of energy communities, encourage large private users to consume renewable electricity with a guarantee of origin, and define a strategy to make electrical consumption in the tertiary and production sectors more efficient.

Furthermore, efforts are being made to expand and enhance the efficiency of electricity distribution, thereby reducing distribution losses.

## 3.2 Mitigating the emission effects of urban transportation (Priority 2)

Although most people use public transport to get around Milan (57% of all trips in Milan are made by public transport, 30% by cars, 7% by motorbike and 6% by bicycle), the city still has one of the highest European

The 60% GHG reduction target is referred to the 2005 baseline and takes into consideration both local action (the measures of the Air and Climate Plan) and external factors (the reduction of electricity emission factor between 2005 and 2030 and an increasing fraction of biofuel in diesel oil for mobility). The same target recalculated without considering external factors (i.e. using for electricity and diesel oil the same emission factors in 2005 and 2030) corresponds to a 45% reduction in GHG emissions attributable to local action (PAC) only.

rates of car ownership and one of the highest concentrations of particulate matter among large European cities. Due to these critical reasons, the City of Milan launched several measures to address air pollution and traffic congestion, which also contribute to GHG emissions/climate mitigation.

One such measure is an innovative road pricing scheme called Area C, a congestion charge aimed at reducing traffic pollution in the city of Milan and, consequently, improving quality of life for citizens and visitors alike.

Consistent with the goals outlined in the Air and Climate Plan, as well as the actions promoted so far, Milan aims to intensify its focus on:

strengthening and decarbonizing Public Transport Systems (TPL);
traffic moderation and promotion of active mobility (cycling, walking).

## 3.3 Improving the green infrastructure of the city to mitigate GHG emissions and increasing its resilience to climate change (Priority 3)

Despite its marginal contribution in terms of carbon absorption, vegetation plays a crucial role in combating the urban heat island effect in cities. Transforming Milan into a green and shaded city, both in public and private spaces, is one of the main adaptation measures to enhance the liveability, health, and comfort of urban areas. This aligns with the strategic vision of creating a "greener, more liveable, and resilient" Milan by 2030 outlined in the City Masterplan (PGT).

This priority identifies measures to increase urban greenery (in various forms: from afforestation to green roofs and walls) and permeable surfaces, in order to respond to rising temperatures in summer and reduce the risk of flooding and overflow during extreme weather events. These actions will reduce heat island effect, increase natural cooling in the summer, modify the albedo (reflective power), and emissivity of urban and building elements, and allow an integrated management of stormwater to reduce flooding and air temperature.

Consistent with the goals outlined in the Air and Climate Plan, as well as the actions promoted so far, Milan aims to intensify its focus on:

Planting new trees and creating new green areas (Forest restoration, biodiversity and ecosystem services);
Contributing to urban cooling and reducing the heat island effect (depaving, nature-based solutions).

## 3.4 Minimizing waste production and food waste, as well as reducing the consumption of raw materials (Priority 4) $^9$

The circular economy, aligned with a policy targeting the reduction and repurposing of food surpluses, the minimization of waste production and raw material consumption, the implementation of green criteria for

$^9$ In the action portfolio the Municipality has incorporated actions in the areas of Circular economy and waste management, underscoring its strategic investment and commitment through concrete initiatives set to be developed

public administration procurement and the organization of public events in fashion, design and culture, rappresent an opportunity for transitioning towards a healthier and more inclusive city. It serves both as a strategy to address social and economic inequalities and a tool for reducing environmental impact.

Consistent with the goals outlined in the Air and Climate Plan, as well as the actions promoted so far by its Food Policy, Milan aims to intensify its focus on:

Reducing per capita waste production;
Reducing food waste by 50% in alignment with the Food Policy targets by 2030 and C40 Zero Waste objective;
Reducing waste production and the consumption of raw materials in the city by endorsing business models that prioritize reduction, reuse, and repair;
Enhancing green-sustainable procurement and events in the city.

# 4. Principles and process

## 4.1 Building a Strong Mandate

Milan's transition team has been incorporated in the Urban Resilience Directorate in close collaboration with the Deputy Mayor for Environment and Green, supported by the International Relations Area within the Mayor's Office, and the Specialist Directorate for Plan Management and Monitoring Authority. Technical support is provided by the Mobility, Environment, and Territory Agency (AMAT), an in-house company of the Municipality of Milan.

The working group is tasked with the operational coordination of local and international activities related to the Mission. Additionally, it manages relations with the NetZeroCities platform, which is the technical-scientific consortium designated by the European Commission to support cities in the network.

Given the overarching nature of climate objectives, the Mission is expected to act as a catalyst for organizational and regulatory innovations within Milan's Administration. The Municipality has embarked on a process to review and improve regulations and administrative tools, such as urban planning regulations, incentives, Green Public Procurement criteria for goods and services, events and buildings retrofit. These initiatives are aimed at establishing a regulatory framework to achieve climate neutrality and adaptation goals.

Due to the strategic nature of the initiative, the internal process within the Administration involved not only the Directorate of Green and Environment, responsible for the Air and Climate Plan of the Municipality of Milan, but also other Directorates responsible for policies, programs, and projects relevant to the objectives of the Mission. In particular, the Directorates of Urban Regeneration, Housing, Welfare and Health, Labor, Sports and Youth, Mobility, Technical, Property and Heritage, and Budget participated

by 2030. Although emissions related to Scope 3 have not yet been quantified, the Administration recognizes the critical importance of integrating these actions. Circular economy and sustainable waste management are pivotal for fostering a more sustainable and resilient city. These initiatives not only contribute to reducing emissions but also enhance the quality of life for citizens by creating healthier, cleaner environments and promoting resource efficiency and a just transition. Looking ahead, we will explore methods for measuring Scope 3 emissions to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its environmental impact. This will enable the Administration to refine and advance its sustainability strategy further, ensuring that its efforts are as effective and far-reaching as possible.

# 4.2 Participatory governance and Key Stakeholders for Accelerated Change

Milan's smart city approach, initiated under Mayor Giuliano Pisapia's left-wing coalition in 2011, emphasizes participatory governance and has led to further development in various policy areas. This involves early citizen involvement and collaboration with private actors to address issues of greening, infrastructure, and public services.

The Air and Climate Plan's ambitious approach to addressing the climate emergency involves engaging "challenge owners" (public administrators, companies, universities, NGOs) and educating and involving the broader community. This aims to facilitate the transition to more sustainable and less carbon-intensive lifestyles by empowering local communities to understand and utilize leverage points for social innovation and behavioural change.

Building on the strong involvement of various city components in addressing climate challenges with various tools, the transition team has planned to engage specific types of stakeholders to join the creation of Milan's Climate City Contract in 2024.

Mapping of actors was conducted through meetings between departments, their staff, and relevant directorates, defining priority targets and methods of stakeholder engagement.

The first cohort of participants (first Edition of Climate City Contract, 2024) represent strategic clusters of actors crucial for Milan's climate neutrality strategy. This selection aligns with the interaction model promoted by the Mission, which involves actors from academia, research, businesses, public institutions, and civil society, often referred to as the "quadruple helix":

Companies partnered with the Municipality, providing strategic services for the city such as energy, public real estate management, water and wastewater treatment plants, school catering, and more.
Key-players in urban regeneration and real estate development, undertaking projects based on new carbon-neutral construction and ambitious environmental goals.

Figure 9: Milan Climate City Contract Journey

Feedback from stakeholders has been collected both in-person and via email. One-to-one support has been provided to help fill out the format/sheet for collecting initiatives to be submitted to the Climate City Contract, prepared by the transition team.

A report containing a synthesis of the initial results (from the submitted version of the CCC) has been provided to all stakeholders.

The process led to the identification of substantial contributions from both the Administration and stakeholders. Approximately 150 concrete and measurable actions were identified to be included in the Action Plan portfolio (as better described in the Action Plan, Module B-2 "Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design"). These actions align with the Mission's sectors and the city's strategic vision, derived from its contextual characteristics.

As this is an ongoing, cyclical, and open process, the Action Plan undergo biennial monitoring, allowing for the possibility of modifying the action portfolio by introducing new actions and stakeholders to address the emission target (gap) as set in Figure 2 "Milan's Emissions Reduction Target" of the present Commitments document.

# 4.3 Collaboratively design a portfolio by integrating existing policies, actions, and programs with new or accelerated interventions

The Programmatic Guidelines approved by Milan's City Council in 2021 underscore the city's commitment to ecological transition processes and sustainability principles. These guidelines highlight initiatives such as implementing the City Masterplan "Milano 2030", developing the concept of a 15-minute city, constructing and maintaining public housing, and managing the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics.

Under Mission No. 9 "Sustainable Development and Protection of Territory and Environment", the City Administration aims to create a more resilient city by implementing climate and air quality strategies. This includes developing livable, comfortable, and adaptive urban spaces for citizens, as outlined in the Unique Programming Document and Forecast Budget 2024-2026.

The City Masterplan outlines objectives for Milan 2030, including establishing new environmental standards through both public and private projects. These projects focus on reducing greenhouse gas

emissions, achieving zero-energy buildings, implementing circular material recovery processes, promoting renaturalization, improving water drainage, cooling microclimates, and enhancing biodiversity. The plan is currently undergoing a general amendment process aimed at strengthening programmatic lines guiding administrative action, taking into account the climate and environmental crisis, as well as the socioeconomic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. These impacts include the need for local services and the effects on energy and housing prices.

Additionally, in 2021 the City Council approved the Air and Climate Plan (Piano Aria e Clima - PAC) to reduce air pollutants, mitigate climate change, and define adaptation strategies for Milan's territory. The plan includes a series of systemic and cross-cutting actions aimed at achieving a  $60\%$  reduction in emissions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. Therefore, it has encouraged the start of an internal governance innovation process that will see environmental issues and climate challenges becoming increasingly cross-cutting across the various policy areas typically organized in silos within the Administration. It outlines the shift towards a "zero-emission" city in a holistic manner, integrating efforts to reduce air pollution with measures for mitigation and climate adaptation (including EU Missions). This approach prioritizes health, equity, and justice by emphasizing social inclusion and safeguarding vulnerable populations.

Within the existing framework of policies and actions, the Climate City Contract will actively bolster numerous objectives and initiatives outlined in the Air and Climate Plan. This will involve expediting and prioritizing strategic actions that significantly contribute to reducing GHG emissions. Collaboration among a diverse array of private and public stakeholders will facilitate this coordinated effort, which will also incorporate other strategic documents such as the city's Masterplan (Piano di Governo del Territorio). Additionally, this initiative will synergize with other tools, notably the "Air and Climate Alliance," which fosters structured collaboration between local institutions and the private sector to more effectively achieve climate and air quality objectives.

Additionally, Milan has coordinated with selected Italian cities - Bergamo, Bologna, Florence, Padua, Parma, Prato, Rome, Turin - to share, collect, and organize information derived from initiatives and projects related to the objectives of the Cities Mission. These cities are actively collaborating with the Ministry of Infrastructure and Sustainable Mobility (MIMS), with which they have signed a Protocol of Understanding. The goal is to develop proposals for regulatory solutions, identify strategies to attract additional funding, exchange best practices, and collaborate on strategic and operational projects.

## 4.4 Learn &amp; Reflect: Taking Action for Successive Iterations of the Climate City Contract

Building the Action Plan has helped identify Milan's emission gap that needs to be addressed in the coming years, referred to as "strategies."

This was achieved by outlining strategic priorities to focus efforts on in the short and medium term. The plan involves developing action lines, tools and projects gradually, which can be further fueled by new contributions from external stakeholders invited to participate in future editions of the Climate City Contract.

An important role is assigned to digitalization, the smart component, and citizens' behavioural change, but also to scientific knowledge and academic expertise as a key lever to access the latest scientific findings, innovative technologies and best practices in climate resilience and decarbonization.

The city has envisioned some mechanisms and strategies to implement the molecular strategy, progressively involving new stakeholders and energizing the network of those already engaged.

By implementing the following mechanisms and strategies, the City of Milan can effectively engage citizens and stakeholders in the development and implementation of its Climate City Contract, fostering collaboration, ownership, and commitment to achieving climate neutrality by 2030:

The Milan's Climate City Contract will gradually implement action lines, tools, and projects, supported by contributions from external stakeholders invited to join the Climate City Contract.

Below are the main mechanisms and strategies Milan envisions to progressively engage new stakeholders and strengthen the existing network, including citizens (better described in the Action Plan, Module C.1 "Governance Innovation Interventions"):

Establish community forums or working groups at district level to involve residents, businesses, academic institutions, and NGOs in carbon-neutral projects, fostering ownership and participation. The EU-funded project "REGEN" will provide a testbed for district regeneration, engaging stakeholders in participatory processes within a Neighbourhood Regeneration Office (NRO).
Partner with universities, innovation boards, and think tanks to access the latest scientific findings and best practices in climate resilience and decarbonization, enhancing the city's capacity for impactful solutions. The Municipality actively participates in Horizon Europe projects such as Urbanisme and Reach-Out to maximize impact and effectiveness.
Incorporate inclusivity within the Permanent Citizens' Assembly on Climate: Utilize the Assembly as a platform for civic engagement, comprising members selected from diverse demographics and ensuring representation across various groups. Information about the assembly's activities and outcomes will be accessible through various channels, promoting transparency and involvement.
Utilize digital platforms like "Milano Partecipa" and "Milano Cambia Aria" to engage citizens and manage communities involved in climate initiatives, ensuring transparency and facilitating participation.
Provide resources, workshops, and training sessions to empower individuals and organizations in taking meaningful actions to reduce emissions and transition to a carbon-neutral future.
Create a comprehensive atlas mapping out specific actions for urban regeneration, including the development of new carbon-neutral areas and retrofitting existing buildings for energy efficiency. This will showcase project initiatives, identify new potential areas for investment, and foster collaboration among stakeholders.

The stakeholder panel that signed the first edition of Milan's CCC represents an ecosystem of actors, resources, and strategic competencies to promote exemplary paths and molecules of urban regeneration increasingly oriented towards climate neutrality.

During the implementation of the CCC's commitments, specific attention will be devoted to re-engaging citizens and local communities settled in the mapped transformation nuclei, in order to identify the best ways to advance interventions towards a just and inclusive transition with them.

In this regard, Universities, thanks also to official collaboration protocols with the Administration, as well as housing cooperatives and all enabling actors involved, will play a crucial role in translating the principles of inclusion, participation, and social justice into these processes, in constant connection with local communities and citizens, focusing on the impacts that the transition can have on the most vulnerable categories.

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano
Lettera di impegni

Adesione del Comune di Milano alla Missione UE "100 Climate-neutral and Smart Cities by 2030"

Si stima che a livello globale le città consumino più del 65% di energia e siano responsabili di più del 70% delle emissioni di CO₂.

In Europa, dove le aree urbane ospitano il 75% della popolazione, la transizione alla neutralità climatica richiede un nuovo protagonismo delle città e si associa a una serie di importanti benefici come la riduzione dell'inquinamento atmosferico e acustico e il miglioramento della salute e del benessere, la riduzione dell'impronta ambientale urbana, il miglioramento del verde, la riduzione dell'impermeabilizzazione e la gestione sostenibile dell'acqua, la riduzione dell'effetto isola di calore, e dunque complessivamente il miglioramento della qualità urbana.

In linea con quanto emerge da questi dati e con gli obiettivi del Green Deal europeo, la Commissione Europea ha lanciato la Missione "100 Climate-neutral and Smart cities by 2030", che ha come scopo il raggiungimento della neutralità climatica entro il 2030 in cento città dell'Unione (più altre dodici città in Paesi Associati o prossimi ad associarsi al programma quadro della Commissione "Horizon Europe").

Selezionate tra le 377 che hanno presentato la propria candidatura, le cento città coinvolte agiscono come centri di sperimentazione e innovazione, con l'obiettivo finale del raggiungimento della neutralità climatica in tutte le aree urbane europee nel più breve tempo possibile.

Le azioni che contribuiscono alla Missione sono declinate in diversi ambiti, tra i quali la creazione di distretti a energia pulita, la mobilità sostenibile, la pianificazione orientata alla sostenibilità e alla protezione dell'ambiente. Ogni città è tenuta a presentare un proprio "Climate City Contract", che prevede un piano di azione per la neutralità climatica in settori-chiave quali la produzione di energia, l'edilizia, i trasporti, la gestione dei rifiuti e un piano di investimento correlato alle azioni da mettere in campo con una coalizione ampia di soggetti che si impegnano con l'Amministrazione nel contribuire all'obiettivo.

Insieme a Bergamo, Bologna, Firenze, Padova, Parma, Prato, Roma e Torino, Milano è una delle nove città italiane selezionate per partecipare alla Missione.

La partecipazione del Comune di Milano si inserisce nel quadro di una serie di iniziative nazionali e internazionali sui temi della transizione ambientale, della decarbonizzazione e della sostenibilità, su cui l'Amministrazione è impegnata da anni. Tra queste il network "C40 Cities Climate", la "Urban Agenda Partnership on Air Quality", il Patto dei Sindaci, il "Resilient Cities Network", l'iniziativa europea "EIT Climate-KIC", la rete "Città Sane".
Comune di Milano

Dal 2019, inoltre, il Comune ha avviato l'elaborazione del proprio Piano Aria e Clima, che si pone i seguenti obiettivi:

migliorare la qualità dell'aria riducendo le concentrazioni degli inquinanti atmosferici;
ridurre le emissioni di $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ e favorire il processo di decarbonizzazione attraverso misure di mitigazione;
contribuire a contenere l'aumento della temperatura attraverso azioni di raffrescamento e di adattamento ai cambiamenti climatici;
sviluppare una visione di città mirata al raggiungimento dell'obiettivo di lungo termine "Città Carbon Neutral al 2050".

Il Piano Aria e Clima agisce come dispositivo trasversale e di indirizzo strategico per altri strumenti settoriali di pianificazione e programmazione. Gli obiettivi sono declinati in cinque ambiti di azione: la salute e l'inclusività (per una città pulita, equa, aperta e solidale), la mobilità (per garantire spostamenti sostenibili, flessibili, attivi e sicuri), l'energia (per ridurre e migliorare i consumi), i cambiamenti climatici (per una città verde, fresca e vivibile, in grado di adattarsi), e la consapevolezza (informare e coinvolgere cittadini e le realtà del territorio sui temi della qualità dell'aria e del clima). La sua preparazione ha visto il coinvolgimento di cittadini e portatori d'interesse di vario tipo, tra cui organizzazioni della società civile, ordini professionali e soggetti economici in previsione della sua approvazione finale da parte del Consiglio Comunale nel 2022.

## 2. Il "Climate City Contract" di Milano

Il percorso di costruzione del "Climate City Contract" è coordinato dalla Direzione di Progetto Resilienza Urbana (Assessorato Ambiente e Verde del Comune di Milano), affiancata dall'Area Relazioni Internazionali (Gabinetto del Sindaco) e dalla Direzione Specialistica Autorità di Gestione e Monitoraggio Piani, con il supporto tecnico della Agenzia Mobilità, Ambiente e Territorio (AMAT), società partecipata al 100% dal Comune di Milano. Il gruppo di lavoro, cosiddetto "transition team", è responsabile del coordinamento operativo delle attività locali e internazionali collegate alla Missione, nonché dei rapporti con "NetZeroCities", il consorzio tecnico-scientifico incaricato dalla Commissione Europea per supportare le città della rete.

Il "Climate City Contract" di Milano prevede un programma di lavoro e un piano di investimenti per accelerare il raggiungimento della neutralità basato sull'accelerazione e sul rafforzamento di alcuni degli obiettivi e delle azioni del Piano Aria e Clima in ambiti previsti dalla Missione (energia ed edifici, mobilità e trasporti, verde e forestazione, rifiuti ed economia circolare), a partire da due principali aspetti:

la collaborazione e l'ingaggio di stakeholder chiave per affrontare le sfide della transizione climatica della città, anche in considerazione del modello di interazioni suggerito dalla Missione stessa che coinvolge gli attori dell'economia, della ricerca, delle imprese, delle istituzioni pubbliche e della società civile;
Comune di Milano

la sperimentazione di una "strategia molecolare", riconoscendo il ruolo chiave dei processi di rigenerazione urbana nel percorso verso la neutralità climatica e identificando alcuni nuclei urbani circoscritti (molecole) che fungono da propulsori dell'accelerazione del percorso verso la neutralità.

La strategia, che evolverà nel tempo coinvolgendo il resto del territorio cittadino, sarà supportata dal sistema di regole, incentivi e disincentivi posti in essere dall'Amministrazione.

Il percorso opererà in sinergia con altri strumenti previsti dal Piano Aria E Clima, tra cui l'Alleanza per il Clima e l'Aria di Milano, che prevede una collaborazione strutturata tra le istituzioni locali e il settore privato per raggiungere in modo più rapido ed efficace gli obiettivi climatici e di qualità dell'aria.

A corredo del processo, è intenzione dell'Amministrazione avviare la costruzione di un "atlante" degli scenari di neutralità climatica della città proiettati al 2030 nella loro dimensione territoriale, localizzando azioni puntuali di rigenerazione urbana (con nuove aree carbon-neutral), e di riqualificazione energetica dello stock edilizio esistente, e sovrapponendole ad una mappatura dinamica delle reti e delle infrastrutture che abilitano la transizione (reti energetiche, della mobilità, del verde) con il duplice obiettivo di dare evidenza di progettualità e impegni al 2030 e di individuare nuove potenziali aree o progettualità su cui investire in futuro.

# 3. Impegni

Sulla base della strategia molecolare prima descritta e considerato il carattere aperto e incrementale del processo, partecipano alla costruzione della prima edizione del "Climate City Contract" di Milano 25 soggetti oltre al Comune di Milano, rappresentativi del mondo delle istituzioni, delle imprese, della ricerca, della società civile, secondo il cosiddetto modello a "quadrupla elica" suggerito dalla Missione.

Sottoscrivendo la presente Lettera di impegni, il Comune di Milano e gli altri firmatari si impegnano a contribuire all'accelerazione del percorso verso la neutralità climatica come indicato dalla Missione, mettendo a disposizione proprie strategie e azioni esemplari e più spinte verso criteri di neutralità in ambiti identificati dal Piano Aria e Clima (energia-edifici; mobilità e trasporti; verde e forestazione urbana; economia circolare e rifiuti). Tali azioni sono selezionate dai proponenti per il loro potenziale in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ e/o altri cobenefici, includendo anche azioni "soft" che possono proiettare effetti su comportamenti, abitudini di consumo, consapevolezza dei cittadini o di altri gruppi specifici.

La componente dei cittadini avrà un ruolo strategico di accompagnamento e monitoraggio del Piano e sarà coinvolta dall'Amministrazione in modo strutturato tramite l'Assemblea Permanente dei Cittadini sul Clima, istituita dal Comune di Milano in versione pilota ed entrata a regime dal 2024.

Attraverso una serie di incontri e workshop, plenari e bilaterali, coordinati dall'Amministrazione con gli stakeholder coinvolti sono state identificate più di 80 azioni concrete e misurabili, che concorrono ai seguenti obiettivi:
Comune di Milano

migliorare l'efficienza energetica negli edifici e promuovere fonti di energia rinnovabile per ridurre la dipendenza dai combustibili fossili;
ridurre gli impatti dei sistemi di trasporto urbano e incentivare modelli di mobilità sostenibile;
migliorare l'infrastruttura verde della città e potenziarne la resilienza ai cambiamenti climatici;
minimizzare la produzione di rifiuti, inclusi gli sprechi alimentari, e ridurre il consumo complessivo di materie prime.

I contenuti del "Climate City Contract" di Milano rispettano gli obiettivi richiesti dalla Commissione Europea prevedendo, attraverso l'implementazione delle azioni previste, un abbattimento delle emissioni di $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ della città utile a contribuire all'obiettivo di neutralità climatica entro il 2030, unitamente alle azioni già previste nel Piano Aria e Clima.

Il "Climate City Contract" di Milano non costituisce un titolo giuridico tra l'Amministrazione e la Commissione Europea, non essendoci finanziamenti dedicati all'implementazione del Piano di Azione, e la sua sottoscrizione non prevede per i firmatari l'aggiudicazione di fondi o contributi né dalla Commissione europea né dal Comune di Milano. Non prevede altresì contributi o pagamenti per l'esecuzione del contratto stesso a carico dei firmatari.

Gli impegni sottoscritti al momento della firma e quelli che verranno successivamente sottoscritti a integrazione dei precedenti, non hanno né avranno natura vincolante. Né l'Amministrazione né altri soggetti terzi potranno chiederne l'adempimento.

# 4. Modalità di presentazione del "Climate City Contract di Milano" e sviluppi successivi

L'Amministrazione si è data l'obiettivo di presentare il "Climate City Contract" di Milano (comprendente dei suoi allegati "Commitments", "Action Plan", "Investment Plan") entro la scadenza del 15 marzo 2024 attraverso la piattaforma messa a disposizione delle città dal consorzio "NetZeroCities".

Gli esperti di "NetZeroCities" effettueranno una pre-validazione del documento suggerendo eventuali integrazioni o modifiche non sostanziali o, in caso di lacune maggiori, suggerendo di procrastinare la presentazione del documento alla finestra temporale successiva (giugno 2024).

Il documento sarà trasmesso da "NetZeroCities" alla Commissione Europea che, tramite propri panel di esperti, effettuerà la valutazione formale del documento per rilasciare l'approvazione definitiva; tale processo avrà una durata da 5 a 6 mesi;

Trattandosi di un processo ciclico e inclusivo, lo stato di avanzamento delle azioni indicate nel "Climate City Contract" e i loro impatti saranno oggetto di monitoraggio con cadenza indicativamente biennale da parte del Comune di Milano. In concomitanza con le scadenze di monitoraggio sarà possibile includere nuovi partecipanti e integrare il portafoglio con ulteriori azioni e progetti, per diminuire progressivamente le emissioni residue. Tali modifiche saranno preferibilmente apportate nell'ambito del monitoraggio biennale e saranno inviate agli altri firmatari a scopo informativo.
Comune di Milano

Le attività di attuazione, monitoraggio e progressivo aggiornamento del "Climate City Contract" di Milano verranno realizzate subordinatamente alla approvazione del documento da parte della Commissione, con l'attribuzione alla Città della cosiddetta "label" di Missione, che certifica la qualità dei piani predisposti dalle città per raggiungere la neutralità climatica e facilita l'accesso ai finanziamenti pubblici e privati.

# 5. Accesso ai dati e comunicazione del "Climate City Contract"

È intenzione manifesta della Commissione rendere consultabili pubblicamente i "Climate City Contract" delle città della Missione attraverso la piattaforma https://netzerocities.eu/ stralciando dal documento la sezione "Piano degli Investimenti".

In caso di necessità o intenzione da parte di singoli firmatari o della città titolare del documento di non divulgare dati o informazioni specifiche saranno concordate modalità di protezione dei dati anche singolarmente prima della consegna del documento finale alla Commissione.

L'allegato "Investment Plan" sarà trattato in modo riservato dal Comune di Milano rendendo eventualmente pubblico solo il volume aggregato degli investimenti previsti dal piano di azione.

La diffusione del documento di impegni e del piano di azione in proiezione locale (canali di comunicazione del Comune di Milano e dei partecipanti) avverrà nel quadro di una strategia di comunicazione e di animazione del percorso da concordare con tutti i partecipanti, con la promozione da parte del Comune di Milano di un evento pubblico di presentazione alla città (indicativamente previsto tra maggio e giugno 2024), e con momenti di disseminazione all'interno della "Green Week" organizzata dall'Assessorato all'Ambiente e Verde (settembre 2024).

|   | Comments on implementation – | The technology is not commercially available today. As part of the project, it is planned to build an experimental plant to treat a small flow rate of flue gas produced by a waste-to-energy plant line (<1% by volume) and capture a small percentage of the CO2 emitted. Once the plant is built, it is planned to carry out a test campaign with a total duration of about 4,000 hours. Test results will be used in the plant and thermofluid dynamics (0D/1D) modeling of two possible full-scale plant configurations. The data collected and models developed will be used by technology providers and research institutes involved in the project for future development of commercial solutions. At the end of the experiment, the experimental plant is scheduled to be decommissioned, so it will be shut down and the associated carbon dioxide capture will be discontinued.  |

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Raccolta delle azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti:
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti /efficientamento dei processi, reti locali di riscaldamento e raffrescamento, ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature Based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

# Sezione 1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets e delle proprie attività, che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030

A2A è una Life Company impegnata a generare un impatto positivo sulla qualità della vita delle persone e a tutela del pianeta, per cui mette a disposizione la sua tecnologia e le sue competenze. Lavorando per rigenerare costantemente il potenziale di ogni risorsa naturale, A2A vuole diventare protagonista della crescita sostenibile del Paese praticando un'economia che crei sempre nuovo valore, per contribuire a migliorare la vita di tutti.

La sostenibilità è alla base della strategia, focalizzata su una transizione equa, ecologica e condivisa e declinata nei due pilastri dell'economia circolare e della transizione energetica all'interno del Piano Strategico, nel quale uno degli obiettivi fondamentali e imprescindibili che il Gruppo si è dato è quello del Net Zero al 2040. L'impegno in tal senso non riguarda solo il perimetro aziendale: il Gruppo si vuole porre come controparte abilitante la decarbonizzazione del Sistema Paese e delle comunità in cui è insediata. Da questo punto di vista, la città di Milano è indubbiamente uno degli stakeholder di maggior rilievo e con cui il Gruppo ha l'ambizione di collaborare in maniera sempre più sinergica e integrata.

A tal fine, sono molteplici le linee di azione già avviate o pianificate per i prossimi anni che hanno l'obiettivo di aiutare il capoluogo lombardo ad abbracciare le linee di indirizzo europee sul tema decarbonizzazione.

Inoltre, l'impegno per la città di Milano tocca 11 dei 17 Sustainable Development Goals dell'Agenda ONU 2030.

Nel contesto delle reti gestite dal distributore Unareti di A2A, il vettore energia elettrica è in piena espansione, con una quota di consumi associati sempre maggiore e un numero di utenti serviti (passivi/attivi) in crescita, tendenza giustificata dalle spinte sempre più forti verso l'elettrificazione dei consumi e la produzione di energia da fonti rinnovabili, a cui fa seguito anche un aumento della potenza di picco necessaria. Ne consegue che il potenziamento ed il rinnovo della rete elettrica di distribuzione rappresenta indubbiamente uno dei principali fattori abilitanti per la transizione energetica.
Negli ultimi anni, inoltre, Unareti ha incrementato notevolmente, gli investimenti dedicati alle proprie reti elettriche, e come peraltro descritto nel Piano di Sviluppo 2023, tale trend continuerà a crescere, con interventi principalmente legati al potenziamento e realizzazione di 14 nuove cabine primarie e della rete di media tensione correlata (già in servizio “Rozzano” e “San Cristoforo”), potenziamento e realizzazione di nuove cabine secondarie e la realizzazione di nuove prese (allacciamenti) con gli utenti finali.

Il teleriscaldamento è elemento chiave per il riscaldamento degli edifici a basso impatto ambientale e ad alta efficienza. Lo sviluppo di progettualità, volte ad estendere la rete esistente per raggiungere un maggior numero di utenti e ridurre l'impronta carbonica della fornitura termica è in fase di implementazione, principalmente tramite iniziative volte al recupero di energia termica dispersa sul territorio e rinnovabile e sistemi di accumulo.

A2A incentiva l'efficientamento energetico degli edifici proponendo interventi di riqualificazione del parco immobiliare esistente, sia per gli utenti pubblici che privati, favorendo l'autoconsumo e la generazione diffusa. Tra gli interventi già eseguiti, troviamo misure volte a fronteggiare la povertà energetica come quelli realizzati presso complessi di edilizia residenziale popolare.

Per quanto riguarda la rete del gas, la strategia di A2A consiste nel digitalizzare e rendere sempre più sostenibile l'infrastruttura di distribuzione. La rete gas abilita la connessione di nuovi impianti di produzione di biometano, decarbonizzando quota parte dell'energia distribuita e incrementando l'autosufficienza energetica: è già stato connesso alla rete un impianto di produzione biometano di un soggetto terzo. Inoltre, Unareti sta sviluppando la propria strategia di riduzione delle emissioni fuggitive di metano, riducendole del 40% al 2040 rispetto al 2019, target certificato dalla Oil &amp; Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP), nel cui ambito la società ha ottenuto il riconoscimento Gold Standard, che premia, oltre a target ambiziosi di riduzione delle emissioni di metano, anche la solidità dei processi di reporting esistenti ed il piano per migliorarli ulteriormente entro il 2024.

L'ambizione di A2A E-Mobility è quella di posizionare Milano tra le città pioniere della mobilità elettrica, realizzando una rete di ricarica diffusa e ambientalmente sostenibile mediante la realizzazione di infrastrutture di ricarica pubbliche alimentate da energia prodotta al 100% da fonti rinnovabili. A2A E-Mobility contribuisce già al raggiungimento degli obiettivi di neutralità carbonica della città di Milano con il progetto “city plug”, che prevederà la realizzazione di 4.000 punti di ricarica distribuiti uniformemente su tutto il territorio cittadino, oltre ai 446 punti di ricarica già operativi.

Inoltre, il gruppo A2A è da sempre attento alla riduzione delle emissioni del proprio parco veicolare, tramite una massiva sostituzione dei veicoli alimentati a fonti fossili verso fonti a basso impatto emissivo, in particolare elettrico ed ibrido e dove ciò non risulti possibile per esigenze operative l'uso del metano, raggiungendo nel 2022 la quota di 700 veicoli elettrici. Più in dettaglio, A2A sta attuando un piano di sostituzione della flotta dei veicoli operativi e promiscui con la graduale

4
introduzione di quote sempre più crescenti dei veicoli "full electric" fino al raggiungimento del 100% al 2030.

Con riferimento ai servizi ambientali, AMSA raccoglie e gestisce i rifiuti nel rispetto dell'ambiente nell'ottica del massimizzare il recupero e il riciclo, e da oltre 100 anni gestisce la raccolta differenziata domestica e delle grandi utenze sul territorio di Milano. Entro il 2030 l'obiettivo è di aumentare la percentuale di raccolta differenziata della città dall'attuale 62% al 75%: a tal fine sono state avviate campagne di sensibilizzazione e di educazione ambientale verso i cittadini, in coerenza con gli obbiettivi indicati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano e dalla rete internazionale C40, con comunicazioni dedicate ed eventi straordinari, come quelli di raccolta RAEE. Inoltre, AMSA pone particolare enfasi a temi di sostenibilità ambientale atti ad incrementare l'energia proveniente da fonti rinnovabili e ridurre le quantità di CO2 immesse in atmosfera. Per questo motivo doterà ogni sede dedicata al servizio di impianti fotovoltaici.

A2A Ambiente partecipa inoltre ad importanti progetti di ricerca europei, con l'obiettivo di rendere più sostenibile e di minimizzare l'impronta carbonica del processo di valorizzazione dei rifiuti: in corso il progetto sperimentale Herccules, che prevede la cattura della CO₂ dai fumi di combustione del termovalorizzatore Silla 2 (ca. 2.500 tCO₂/anno) con successivo utilizzo nell'industria dei gas tecnici o alimentare.

Infine, A2A Illuminazione Pubblica perseguendo l'obiettivo di illuminare la Città ed i suoi principali monumenti in modo efficiente e sostenibile, alimenta i propri corpi illuminanti con energia 100% rinnovabile. Una progressiva sostituzione dei vecchi impianti con sorgenti led di ultima generazione è già in atto da tempo per ridurre il consumo energetico e l'impatto emissivo associato.

Si tratta infatti di un vero e proprio progetto di ricerca finanziato dalla Comunità Europea, che ha come obiettivo la validazione e lo sviluppo della tecnologia stessa. Nell'ambito del progetto si prevede di costruire un impianto sperimentale per il trattamento di una piccola portata dei fumi prodotti da una linea del Termovalorizzatore (<1% in volume) e la cattura di una piccola percentuale della CO_{2} emessa. Una volta realizzato l'impianto si prevede di eseguire una campagna di test della durata complessiva di circa 4000 ore.
I risultati dei test saranno impiegati nella modellizzazione impiantistica e termofluidodinamica (OD/1D) di due possibili configurazioni di impianto full-scale.
I dati raccolti ed i modelli sviluppati saranno impiegati dai provider tecnologici e dagli istituti di ricerca coinvolti nel progetto per il futuro sviluppo di soluzioni commerciali.
A fine sperimentazione è prevista la dismissione dell'impianto sperimentale, che quindi verrà spento e la relativa cattura dell'anidride carbonica verrà interrotta.  |

identificati (ad esempio stock edificato, sistemi energetici, infrastrutture per la mobilità). interventi sugli edifici hanno riguardato la posa di cappotto termico sulle pareti « calde » e la sostituzione degli infissi con l'installazione di tende da sole. Sull'edificio Centrale Termica per entrambi i siti si è intervenuti attraverso la sostituzione dei generatori di calore a gas tradizionali con un sistema ibrido composto da tre caldaie a condensazione e tre pompe di calore con conseguente rinnovamento di tutto il circuito primario. Per il funzionamento delle stesse si è provveduto alla realizzazione di una nuova cabina di trasformazione MT-BT per sito. Per il sito di Bagarotti è stato installato un impianto fotovoltaico di potenza 20 kWp con accumulo di capacità 43 kWh, mentre su Coppin si è realizzato un impianto da 10 kWp con accumulo di capacità pari a 20 kWh. Entrambi gli impianti fotovoltaici sono a servizio della rispettiva Centrale Termica.

Il progetto City Plug porta una serie di benefici significativi in termini di sostenibilità ambientale, efficienza energetica e logistica urbana alla città di Milano, contribuendo in modo sostanziale alla transizione verso l'elettrificazione dei trasporti. Tali benefici, possono essere sintetizzati come segue :
**Salvaguardia dello Spazio Urbano**
• Minimizzazione dell'impatto visivo: grazie alle sue dimensioni contenute, l'infrastruttura mira a essere "quasi invisibile" nel contesto urbano, preservando così l'estetica della città e sottraendo il minor spazio pubblico possibile, tutelando un bene prezioso per i cittadini.
• Sosta libera: le city plug non richiederanno l'uso esclusivo degli stalli ai soli fini della ricarica, i quali manterranno la loro attuale funzione (residenti, a pagamento, gratuiti) ma saranno dotati di un servizio aggiuntivo, ovvero la ricarica elettrica
**Efficienza e Sostenibilità Energetica**
• Gestione dinamica del carico: l'utilizzo del Dynamic Load Management permette di bilanciare in modo intelligente il carico, incrementando fino a 7 volte il numero di punti di ricarica alimentabili da un singolo contatore da 33 kW. La soluzione proposta assicura la sostenibilità energetica dell'iniziativa, evitando eccessive richieste di potenza alla rete elettrica esistente e massimizzando il numero di punti di ricarica disponibili.
**Logistica Urbana**
• Riduzione del numero di cantieri: grazie alla configurazione delle stazioni City Plug, che possono gestire fino a 14 punti di ricarica, il numero di cantieri necessari per ogni 100 prese di ricarica diminuisce drasticamente, riducendo i disagi per i cittadini.
• Flessibilità e manutenibilità: le stazioni City Plug sono progettate per essere facilmente rimovibili temporaneamente in caso di eventi o altre esigenze, garantendo flessibilità e adattabilità alle dinamiche urbane. Le City Plug sono state inoltre studiate per rendere semplici le procedure di manutenzione, permettendo un facile accesso e estrazione delle componenti hardware.  |

Per ogni stazione, il cantiere tipo avrà una durata di 5 giorni lavorativi e si propone di avere all'attivo circa 3 cantieri contemporaneamente.

Con la progressiva entrata in servizio delle nuove CP si disporrà di un numero maggiore di linee di media tensione sulle quali sarà possibile distribuire meglio il numero di utenti andando a razionalizzare ed uniformare la rete.
In particolare, il progetto prevede la realizzazione di 4 nuove Cabine Primarie : San Cristoforo, Mugello, Comasina, MICO.  |

Pertanto, l'intervento consentirà di migliorare la distribuzione dei carichi elettrici nelle aree selezionate, abilitare lo sviluppo dei carichi elettrici futuri (es. Per trasformazioni di impianti termici, installazione di nuove infrastrutture di ricarica dei veicoli elettrici, etc.)  |   |

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Raccolta delle azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti:

# Sezione 1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets e delle proprie attività, che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030

La principale strategia di decarbonizzazione messa in pratica da ATM è il Piano Full Electric, avviato nel 2017, che consiste nella sostituzione di 1200 bus a gasolio in elettrici entro il 2030.

Inclusi nel piano vi sono anche la costruzione di due nuovi depositi che ospiteranno i bus elettrici, situati in Via Triboniano e Viale Toscana. Quest'ultimo, comprenderà 20.000 metri quadrati sotterranei dedicati al ricovero e manutenzione di 100 bus elettrici, mentre la superficie sarà sfruttata come luogo di forestazione e di sfruttamento del verde a beneficio del quartiere e della Cittadinanza, attraverso aree verdi e campi sportivi.

Ulteriori strategie di decarbonizzazione di ATM, nell'ambito dei Sustainable Development Goal 11 e 13, consistono nel progetto "Depositi verdi" per cui i vecchi depositi saranno riconvertiti per ospitare i nuovi bus e le colonnine necessarie alla loro ricarica. Il revamping degli spazi prevede

Inoltre l'utilizzo di strumenti NBS (Natural Based Solutions), che oltre ad essere soluzioni che aiutano l'abbattimento della Co2, possono anche essere elementi di modernizzazione della mobilità sostenibile e dell'integrazione del tessuto cittadino.

La riqualificazione, comprende opere di piantumazione di alberi (attualmente sono stati piantumati 440 alberi nel deposito di San Donato) e la realizzazione di opere verdi, come la Parete Verde realizzata sulla facciata esterna del deposito di Via Giambellino, un'opera di 350 mq che rientra nel progetto Europeo Horizon 2020 all'interno del piano Clever Cities e che ha visto la partecipazione e il contributo della comunità locale e del Politecnico di Milano.

Infine, un più recente progetto di decarbonizzazione è l'installazione di impianti fotovoltaici sui tetti di depositi e parcheggi in possesso di ATM.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Raccolta delle azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti:
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti /efficientamento dei processi, reti locali di riscaldamento e raffrescamento, ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature Based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

## Sezione 1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets e delle proprie attività, che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030.

La società pubblica Milano Ristorazione S.p.a. ha definito, in sinergia con il Comune di Milano, delle proprie iniziative di decarbonizzazione definite all'interno del Contratto di Servizio per l'erogazione del servizio di refezione scolastica. All'art. 7 è stata definita un'innovativa disciplina in merito alla sostenibilità ambientale ed all'internalizzazione delle esternalità generate dal servizio, in particolare al comma 8 "la Società, laddove economicamente e ambientalmente sostenibile, si impegna ad acquistare energia proveniente da fonti rinnovabili ed utilizzare soluzioni tecnologiche per l'illuminazione a ridotto impatto ambientale".

Inoltre, la società sta sviluppando un'iniziativa tesa al completo abbattimento delle emissioni relative al trasporto pasti consistente nell'elettrificazione della flotta disponibile.

La società ha pertanto definito una propria iniziativa per la produzione di energia elettrica da sistemi fotovoltaici da installare sui centri cucina disponibili.

## Sezione 2: Progetti urbani e interventi relativi a propri asset

Si richiede di compilare la "Scheda raccolta azioni" (suddivisa in 3 parti) duplicandola per ciascun progetto che si desidera illustrare, compatibilmente con la disponibilità di dati e l'avanzamento dei progetti.

# Sezione 1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets e delle proprie attività, che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030.

La società pubblica Milano Ristorazione S.p.a. ha definito, in sinergia con il Comune di Milano, proprie iniziative di decarbonizzazione definite all'interno del Contratto di Servizio per l'erogazione del servizio di refezione scolastica. All'art. 7 è stata introdotta un'innovativa disciplina in merito alla sostenibilità ambientale ed all'internalizzazione delle esternalità generate dal servizio; in particolare al comma 2 del suddetto articolo si prevede che "nei propri piani di trasporto delle derrate (piattaforma centrale vs. centri cucina) e di veicolazione dei pasti (centri cucina vs. terminali di distribuzione) la Società prevede l'impiego di veicoli a limitato impatto ambientale".

Inoltre in merito all'elettrificazione della flotta, nell'allegato 13 del medesimo contratto di servizio è disposto che "in ottemperanza alle strategie dell'Amministrazione Comunale contenute nel Piano Aria e Clima approvato con deliberazione di Consiglio Comunale n.4/2022, nonché nel Piano Urbano della Mobilità Sostenibile (PUMS), la Società dovrà progettare la conversione della propria flotta di veicoli alla logistica a zero emissioni, anche con progressioni graduali, attraverso sperimentazioni pilota o per lotti progressivi. In linea con la disciplina per l'Area C la sperimentazione del full-electric dovrà essere avviata con priorità per il territorio del centro della città incluso nel perimetro di Area C. Nelle nuove progettazioni di centri cucina dovrà essere inclusa la realizzazione delle infrastrutture di ricarica elettrica".

La società ha pertanto definito una propria iniziativa per convertire la flotta di distribuzione derrate e veicolazione pasti verso una neutralità dovuta all'alimentazione elettrica dei mezzi di trasporto.

Sezione 2: Progetti urbani e interventi relativi a propri asset
Si richiede di compilare la "Scheda raccolta azioni" (suddivisa in 3 parti) duplicandola per ciascun progetto che si desidera illustrare, compatibilmente con la disponibilità di dati e l'avanzamento dei progetti.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Raccolta delle azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti:
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti /efficientamento dei processi, reti locali di riscaldamento e raffrescamento, ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature Based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

# NOTE PER LA COMPILAZIONE

La scheda è suddivisa in due parti:

Sezione 1: strategia ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione. Fornire una descrizione generale della strategia di decarbonizzazione nell'ambito della quale si collocano le progettualità che intendete mettere a disposizione del Climate City Contract di Milano
Sezione 2: progetti urbani e interventi relativi a propri asset e alle proprie attività. Compilare la tabella "Raccolta azioni", facendone una copia per ciascun progetto considerato.

NB: per "progetti urbani" si intende progetti di rigenerazione urbana in corso e previsti sul territorio comunale; per "interventi relativi a propri asset e alle proprie attività" si intende progetti e iniziative relative agli edifici e alle infrastrutture di proprietà (owned assets), agli uffici direzionali, alle infrastrutture gestite, ai servizi erogati e ad attività specifiche, con localizzazione a Milano.

Il questionario è in formato editabile, vi chiediamo gentilmente di compilare i riquadri destinati alle risposte, compatibilmente con la disponibilità di dati e l'avanzamento dei progetti, eventualmente replicando le tabelle per ciascuna progettualità che si intende presentare.
Preghiamo di darci riscontro della ricezione del questionario e di inviare il questionario compilato entro il 20 gennaio 2024, all'indirizzo di rossana.torri@comune.milano.it, marta.papetti@amat-mi.it e manuela.ojan@amat-mi.it

## Sezione 1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets e delle proprie attività, che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030
# Sezione 2: Progetti urbani e interventi relativi a propri asset

Si richiede di compilare la “Scheda raccolta azioni” (suddivisa in 3 parti) duplicandola per ciascun progetto che si desidera illustrare, compatibilmente con la disponibilità di dati e l'avanzamento dei progetti.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Raccolta delle azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti:
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti / efficientamento dei processi, reti locali di riscaldamento e raffrescamento, ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature Based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

# NOTE PER LA COMPILAZIONE

La scheda è suddivisa in due parti:

Sezione 1: strategia ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione. Fornire una descrizione generale della strategia di decarbonizzazione nell'ambito della quale si collocano le progettualità che intendete mettere a disposizione del Climate City Contract di Milano
Sezione 2: progetti urbani e interventi relativi a propri asset e alle proprie attività. Compilare la tabella "Raccolta azioni", facendone una copia per ciascun progetto considerato.

NB: per "progetti urbani" si intende progetti di rigenerazione urbana in corso e previsti sul territorio comunale; per "interventi relativi a propri asset e alle proprie attività" si intende progetti e iniziative relative agli edifici e alle infrastrutture di proprietà (owned assets), agli uffici direzionali, alle infrastrutture gestite, ai servizi erogati e ad attività specifiche, con localizzazione a Milano.

Il questionario è in formato editabile, vi chiediamo gentilmente di compilare i riquadri destinati alle risposte, compatibilmente con la disponibilità di dati e l'avanzamento dei progetti, eventualmente replicando le tabelle per ciascuna progettualità che si intende presentare.
Preghiamo di darci riscontro della ricezione del questionario e di inviare il questionario compilato entro il 20 gennaio 2024, all'indirizzo di rossana.torri@comune.milano.it, marta.papetti@amat-mi.it e manuela.ojan@amat-mi.it

## Sezione 1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets e delle proprie attività, che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030
# Sezione 2: Progetti urbani e interventi relativi a propri asset

Si richiede di compilare la “Scheda raccolta azioni” (suddivisa in 3 parti) duplicandola per ciascun progetto che si desidera illustrare, compatibilmente con la disponibilità di dati e l'avanzamento dei progetti.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Nel Climate City Contract possono essere valorizzate strategie, progetti e strumenti che favoriscono il raggiungimento degli obiettivi pur agendo indirettamente sulla riduzione delle emissioni.

Tali azioni dovranno essere sempre in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.
A titolo di esempio, una lista non esaustiva di tipologie di azioni o programmi di azione:

Coinvolgere le comunità nella formulazione di progetti incoraggiando un approccio partecipativo.

Sostenere finanziariamente soggetti o progetti che adottano pratiche in linea con gli obiettivi di riduzione delle emissioni.

Promuovere l'uso di mezzi di trasporto sostenibili come biciclette, mezzi pubblici e veicoli elettrici.

Sensibilizzare i cittadini sull'importanza dell'efficienza energetica nelle abitazioni.

Promuovere l'adozione di tecnologie a basso consumo energetico e pratiche di costruzione sostenibili.

Educare i cittadini sulla corretta gestione dei rifiuti e incentivare il riciclo.

Promuovere abitudini alimentari sostenibili, come la riduzione del consumo di carne e la preferenza per prodotti locali e stagionali.

Coinvolgere attivamente i cittadini nelle decisioni riguardanti la sostenibilità urbana.

Creare piattaforme di partecipazione civica e fornire strumenti per la condivisione di idee e progetti.

Condurre campagne di sensibilizzazione sui cambiamenti climatici e sulle azioni che i cittadini possono intraprendere.

Promuovere la creazione e la manutenzione di spazi verdi urbani coinvolgendo i cittadini nella piantumazione di alberi e nella conservazione della biodiversità locale.

Integrare temi legati alla sostenibilità nei programmi scolastici.

Coinvolgere le scuole in progetti e iniziative a favore dell'ambiente.

Incoraggiare le imprese locali ad adottare pratiche sostenibili e a ridurre l'impatto ambientale delle loro attività.

SCHEDA – Strategie e azioni puntuali

Si possono descrivere qui in generale strategie ed iniziative con impatti, anche indiretti, sulla neutralità climatica della città al 2030, a partire dagli ambiti privilegiati energia ed edifici; verde e forestazione, mobilità, economia circolare.

Le attività didattiche che MM Spa conduce presso il proprio museo di impresa, la Centrale dell'Acqua di Milano, hanno il duplice obiettivo di proporre un percorso di educazione ambientale e scientifica, che approfondisce le proprietà chimico fisiche, l'importanza biologica e il ciclo naturale dell'acqua, le tematiche della crisi climatica e della resilienza. Si tratta di iniziative formative, didattiche e divulgative che raccontano la crisi climatica e le azioni necessarie per l'adattamento agli impatti che questa ha sulla città. Con particolare attenzione all'uso razionale della risorsa idrica.

Gli interventi di dissemination sono rivolti a tutta la popolazione, con particolare cura degli studenti delle primarie e secondarie.

Nel 2023 sono stati 6700 i ragazzi che hanno partecipato alle visite e ai laboratori della Centrale dell'Acqua, che è diventata un punto di riferimento per le scuole e tra i musei milanesi più attivi sul piano didattico

Nella scheda seguente possono essere raccolti interventi e azioni puntuali coerenti con gli obiettivi della Missione.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Raccolta delle azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti:
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti /efficientamento dei processi, reti locali di riscaldamento e raffrescamento, ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature Based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

# NOTE PER LA COMPILAZIONE

La scheda è suddivisa in due parti:

Sezione 1: strategia ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione. Fornire una descrizione generale della strategia di decarbonizzazione nell'ambito della quale si collocano le progettualità che intendete mettere a disposizione del Climate City Contract di Milano
Sezione 2: progetti urbani e interventi relativi a propri asset e alle proprie attività. Compilare la tabella "Raccolta azioni", facendone una copia per ciascun progetto considerato.

NB: per "progetti urbani" si intende progetti di rigenerazione urbana in corso e previsti sul territorio comunale; per "interventi relativi a propri asset e alle proprie attività" si intende progetti e iniziative relative agli edifici e alle infrastrutture di proprietà (owned assets), agli uffici direzionali, alle infrastrutture gestite, ai servizi erogati e ad attività specifiche, con localizzazione a Milano.

Il questionario è in formato editabile, vi chiediamo gentilmente di compilare i riquadri destinati alle risposte, compatibilmente con la disponibilità di dati e l'avanzamento dei progetti, eventualmente replicando le tabelle per ciascuna progettualità che si intende presentare.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Raccolta delle azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti:
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti /efficientamento dei processi, reti locali di riscaldamento e raffrescamento, ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature Based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

# NOTE PER LA COMPILAZIONE

La scheda è suddivisa in due parti:

Sezione 1: strategia ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione. Fornire una descrizione generale della strategia di decarbonizzazione nell'ambito della quale si collocano le progettualità che intendete mettere a disposizione del Climate City Contract di Milano

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Raccolta delle azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti:
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti /efficientamento dei processi, reti locali di riscaldamento e raffrescamento, ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature Based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

# NOTE PER LA COMPILAZIONE

La scheda è suddivisa in due parti:

Sezione 1: strategia ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione. Fornire una descrizione generale della strategia di decarbonizzazione nell'ambito della quale si collocano le progettualità che intendete mettere a disposizione del Climate City Contract di Milano

# Sezione 1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets e delle proprie attività, che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030

SEA (Società per azioni Esercizi Aeroportuali) gestisce gli aeroporti di Milano Linate e Milano Malpensa in forza della convenzione di gestione stipulata tra SEA e l'Ente Nazionale Aviazione Civile ("ENAC") in data 4 settembre 2001, con scadenza, come prorogata, il 4 maggio 2043.

L'aeroporto di Malpensa è localizzato in provincia di Varese e non viene considerato nel contesto della "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission", mentre l'aeroporto di Linate, per quanto solo parzialmente ricadente nel territorio del Comune di Milano, viene considerato nella sua completezza fisica ed operativa, coerentemente con il suo ruolo di city airport e per le sue strette connessioni soprattutto con il sistema dei trasporti milanesi ("terminale" di Viale Forlanini, connessione alla Tangenziale Est, sistema dei taxi, integrazione con il trasporto pubblico tramite la Linea 73 e ora la Linea 4 della metropolitana milanese).

È un preciso impegno del Gruppo SEA coniugare il valore fondamentale del rispetto e della salvaguardia del patrimonio ambientale con lo sviluppo del traffico aereo e delle proprie infrastrutture.

Nell'ambito della propria politica ambientale ed energetica "SEA si impegna a ridurre in modo assoluto le emissioni sotto il proprio controllo, sia dirette ("scope 1") che indirette ("scope 2", connesse agli usi energetici), per conseguire l'obiettivo "Net Zero" entro il 2030 per entrambi gli aeroporti di Linate e Malpensa, coerentemente alle previsioni delle organizzazioni del settore aeronautico, gli accordi e programmi internazionali, e alla pari delle best practice degli aeroporti europei. Inoltre, il gruppo si impegna a guidare attivamente le terze parti che operano nei propri aeroporti alla riduzione delle loro emissioni ("scope 3"). La Politica ambientale ed energetica di SEA è reperibile qui: https://www.seamilano.eu/sites/default/files/2022-12/Politica%20Ambientale%20ed%20Energetica_08-2021.pdf

Dal 2009 SEA aderisce al massimo livello disponibile del programma Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA), istituito da Airports Council International (ACI), che è l'unico programma di certificazione globale per la gestione del carbonio approvato a livello istituzionale per gli aeroporti mondiali.

Nell'ottobre 2023 SEA ha approvato la propria strategia energetica

Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti identificati (ad esempio stock edificato, sistemi energetici, infrastrutture per la mobilità). | Al fine di conseguire l'obiettivo « Net Zero 2030 » relativo alle emissioni di gas climalteranti sotto il proprio controllo (cd emissioni scope 1 e 2) SEA ha definito una strategia energetica integrata nel proprio piano che prevede un insieme di iniziative, interventi e investimenti per la decarbonizzazione.
I principali sono i seguenti :
• Interventi di efficientamento e riduzione dei consumi energetici sia elettrici che termici ;
• Realizzazione di un impianto fotovoltatico di potenza 5 MW nel sedime aeroportuale di Linate (comune di Milano) ;
• Progressivo incremento del ricorso a « energia verde » sia elettrica che termica fino a coprire il 100% dei consumi, anche tramite l'attivazione di PPA (power purchase agreements) ;
• Elettrificazione del parco mezzi operativi ;
• Introduzione di combustibili di origine biogenica (HVO) e dell'idrogeno per i mezzi operativi per i quali al momento non sono disponibili alternative elettriche  |

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Raccolta delle azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti:
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti /efficientamento dei processi, reti locali di riscaldamento e raffrescamento, ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature Based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

# Sezione 1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets e delle proprie attività, che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030

Gli obiettivi di miglioramento ambientale del Masterplan per il mercato agroalimentare di Milano devono essere considerati nell'insieme del riassetto delle aree già interessate dalle attività mercatali nel passato, previsto dalla D.C.C. 12/2019 e degli interventi che saranno attivati da diversi attori:

La valorizzazione delle Palazzine Liberty lungo viale Molise, restituite alla città;
La rigenerazione urbanistica del complesso degli ex macelli, attraverso un bando di valorizzazione su progetti di innovazione,

attraverso la piattaforma concorsuale Reinventing Cities del gruppo C40, alleanza delle metropoli mondiali per la lotta al cambiamento climatico di cui Milano è parte da diversi anni; - La rimozione a cura del Comune di Milano (con rivalsa sui terzi responsabili) dei cumuli di materiale di riporto presenti sul confine est dell'area, nella aree affidate a SO.GE.MI. nel 1998;

La bonifica a carico di SO.GE.MI., nell'ambito del suo progetto di riqualificazione, delle altre passività ambientali presenti nelle aree dell'Ortomercato ricevute in concessione nel 1980;

Più in dettaglio, l'intero progetto di riassetto dell'area dell'ortomercato ha come obiettivo primario il miglioramento delle componenti ambientali, prima di tutto nei confronti di circa 8.000 operatori e addetti che frequentano l'area quotidianamente, ma anche rispetto all'attuale impatto dell'area sia sulle aree urbane limitrofe, sia in generale rispetto al consumo di risorse non rinnovabili e a rischi indotti dal cambiamento climatico. Questo come descritto nel paragrafo precedente senza far venir meno, anzi potenziando, la funzione di interesse pubblico primaria dell'attività, ovvero l'approvvigionamento di prodotti alimentari freschi di qualità, controllati dal punto di vista sanitario e a prezzi accessibili da parte dei cittadini, degli esercizi pubblici e commerciali, delle istituzioni e
delle imprese che operano a Milano. Questi obiettivi di miglioramento ambientale possono essere descritti a

partire dalla descrizione delle componenti ambientali contenuta nella relazione di prefattibilità ambientale allegata agli studi di fattibilità del 2016 e rinviando alla descrizione tematica nei capitoli successivi per l'illustrazione di come il Masterplan risponda a questi obiettivi

**UN PRIMO LIVELLO** di miglioramento ambientale, rispetto ai lavoratori della struttura, su cui incideranno gli interventi radicali di demolizione e ricostruzione della piattaforma Ortomercato è quello strutturale ed impiantistico; anche se la Gestione ha cercato nel tempo di mantenere l'efficienza e la conformità normativa degli spazi, l'obsolescenza delle strutture, sia per il degrado sia per l'evoluzione della normativa sui carichi e il rischio sismico, e l'insufficienza della rete di smaltimento dei reflui possono essere risolte solo mediante interventi radicali.

**UN SECONDO OBIETTIVO** di miglioramento riguarda l'accessibilità e il traffico, oggi l'accesso avviene sia dallo svincolo di Corvetto che da quelli di via Mecenate e Forlanini, e spesso i mezzi in attesa usano la viabilità urbana come spazio di accumulo. Queste passività saranno ridotte dal riassetto degli ingressi con la concentrazione dell'accesso ai mezzi pesanti nel nuovo portale sud (comparto 1_INT), con adeguati spazi di sosta e di servizio per gli autotrasportatori, e in prospettiva il completamento del raccordo verso la lo svincolo della tangenziale della strada.

**UN TERZO AMBITO DI MIGLIORAMENTO PREMINENTE** è quello del sistema energetico. Il sistema attuale è interamente appoggiato alla rete elettrica cittadina con macchine frigorifere altamente inefficienti (con scambio di calore in atmosfera) gestite autonomamente dai singoli affittuari. Il progetto NPO include secondo lo studio energetico predisposto da So.Ge.Mi. nel 2020 la costruzione di un anello di distribuzione di fluidi refrigeranti, con scambio in acqua di falda e corsi d'acqua superficiale, che sarà via via esteso agli sviluppi logistici in corso di progettazione, agli edifici esistenti. Integrata con la produzione elettrica dei tetti fotovoltaici installati sui nuovi padiglioni logistici ed NPO, questa rete permetterà oltre che aumentare l'efficienza e contenere i consumi delle macchine frigorifere, di coprire con energia rinnovabile prodotta localmente circa il 50% dei consumi. Come descritto meglio nelle linee guida relative all'energia, la connessione degli edifici climatizzati per servizi complementari di nuova costruzione alla rete fluidi e di produzione fotovoltaica permetterà la climatizzazione invernale a consumo zero, sfruttando i cascami termici del sistema di refrigerazione, e anche la neutralità carbonica dei consumi estivi, secondo quanto prescritto dall'art. 10 delle N.A. del Piano delle Regole Milano 2030..

**IL QUARTO OBIETTIVO**, coerente con i cambiamenti della città che si sta trasformando intorno al sito del mercato, sarà raggiunto con la realizzazione completa del Masterplan, che in parte riqualificherà e in parte trasferà verso ovest, ossia verso via Varsavia, il corpus delle aree verdi oggi prospicienti la ferrovia. In questo modo la cintura verde permarrà a protezione del l'enclave Mercato Agroalimentare verso la ferrovia e a rinforzo della connessione ecologica definita dal Piano di Governo del Territorio, mentre si apriranno nuovi scorci e possibilità di fruizione green a vantaggio
del rapporto visivo e percettivo con la città, consentendo al sito di inserirsi nelle dinamiche di riqualificazione di tutta la zona.

# PARTE A - Sezione A.1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets, uffici direzionali, "third-party asset and property management services", che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030

Il Politecnico di Milano ha pubblicato nel 2023 il Piano Strategico di Sostenibilità 2023-2025, assumendo impegni concreti di contributo allo sviluppo sostenibile rispetto a 6 priorità: Inclusione e pari opportunità, Ricerca sostenibile, Sostenibilità nella didattica, Diritto allo studio, Innovazione e responsabilità sociale e Ambiente.

Tra gli obiettivi posti per la priorità Ambiente – Ambito Energia e decarbonizzazione – l’Ateneo ha definito i seguenti target di decarbonizzazione: -25% di emissioni di $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ pro capite entro il 2025 e -50% entro il 2030 (rispetto all’anno baseline 2015), da raggiungere con interventi a livello energetico (riduzione consumi, efficientamento, produzione di energia rinnovabile), di mobilità ed edilizia sostenibile. Rispetto all’ambito Mobilità sostenibile, è fissato un obiettivo specifico di riduzione delle emissioni di $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ per l’accesso di studenti e lavoratori ai campus del 15%. Questi impegni di riduzione si inseriscono nel percorso che porterà il Politecnico ad una condizione *net zero* rispetto alle emissioni di $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ entro il 2040.

Sono in fase di redazione il Piano Spostamenti Casa-Università e il Piano di Mitigazione delle emissioni di $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ che dettagliano i singoli interventi in programma e ne quantificano l’impatto in termini di riduzione delle emissioni. È prevista inoltre nel 2024 la redazione del Piano di Adattamento ai cambiamenti climatici.

Le linee di intervento previste entro il 2025 (con termine di alcune azioni previsto per il 2026) sono le seguenti:

efficienza energetica: interventi di ottimizzazione della regolazione degli impianti, sostituzione corpi illuminanti, modelli di comportamento per la riduzione dei consumi, sostituzione impianti di riscaldamento con pompe di calore;
produzione di energia rinnovabile: installazione di pannelli fotovoltaici, stipula di PPA per approvvigionamento di energia con garanzia di origine rinnovabile, realizzazione di Comunità Energetiche Rinnovabili;
mobilità sostenibile: realizzazione di infrastrutture di supporto alla mobilità attiva, installazione di ulteriori punti di ricarica per i veicoli elettrici, pedonalizzazione aree interne ai campus, incentivazione economica del TP-TPL, azioni di potenziamento del lavoro da remoto, attività di sensibilizzazione, interazioni con il territorio per il miglioramento del servizio di TPL e potenziamento della rete ciclabile;
edilizia sostenibile: riqualificazione del parco edilizio dell'Ateneo, realizzazione di un nuovo campus net zero carbon nell'area Bovisa Nord e ripristino di suolo con interventi di de-impermeabilizzazione e rinnovamento delle aree verdi.

Le linee di intervento saranno aggiornate e integrate ove necessario per il quinquennio 2026-2030 al fine di raggiungere l'obiettivo di riduzione delle emissioni posto al 2030.

Gli interventi insisteranno principalmente sui due campus del Politecnico localizzati nel Comune di Milano (Città Studi e Bovisa), che ospitano attualmente il 92% degli studenti dell'Ateneo. Il monitoraggio delle azioni sarà presentato annualmente nel Rapporto di Sostenibilità dell'Ateneo.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (Player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi laddove disponibili, utili ad avere un inquadramento generale della realtà in cui operate e a collocare le progettualità presentate nel contesto milanese.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime-seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

## PARTE A - Sezione A.1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets, uffici direzionali, "third-party asset and property management services", che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030

La sostenibilità riveste un ruolo centrale nelle strategie dell'Università Bocconi, come evidenziato nella sua "Vision 2030" e nel "Piano Strategico 2021-2025". Bocconi si impegna a contribuire al raggiungimento di uno sviluppo maggiormente sostenibile, inclusivo, orientato alle future generazioni, proponendosi come catalizzatore di un cambiamento sostenibile attraverso la ricerca, finalizzata alla creazione di nuova conoscenza a beneficio della società, e la didattica, volta a fornire agli studenti gli strumenti necessari per essere i protagonisti di questo cambiamento. Allo stesso tempo, l'Ateneo si impegna per tradurre la sostenibilità in obiettivi, azioni ed interventi concreti nell'ambito delle proprie attività operative e nella gestione degli asset. Il report di sostenibilità dell'Università, giunto alla sua quarta edizione e pubblicato annualmente, dà evidenza di questo percorso attraverso dati e attività concrete svolte nell'ambito delle principali "sfide di sostenibilità" individuate.

Per la governance della sostenibilità, l'Università Bocconi ha previsto specifici incarichi istituzionali ed ha istituito una serie di Comitati, composti da docenti e membri dello staff amministrativo e studenti, atti a presidiare gli aspetti legati all'etica e alla gestione responsabile dell'Ateneo. Il Comitato per la Sostenibilità, avviato nel 2013, ha la responsabilità di definire le linee guida e gli indirizzi dell'Ateneo per la riduzione degli impatti sull'ambiente, promuovere la cultura della responsabilità sociale e coordinare progetti universitari sulla base di obiettivi di sostenibilità. Il Comitato rappresenta il motore della sostenibilità in Bocconi, nelle sue varie articolazioni, sia di natura ambientale, che sociale.

In questo quadro strategico per la sostenibilità si inserisce l'impegno dell'Università Bocconi per il clima. Grazie agli investimenti realizzati negli anni, al continuo ammodernamento degli impianti e dei macchinari e all'ottimizzazione dei consumi, l'Ateneo ha ottenuto il disaccoppiamento tra consumi energetici, cresciuti nel triennio 2020-2022 di circa il 16%, ed emissioni di CO2, diminuite nello stesso periodo di più del 15%. Iniziative di investimento già programmate (ad es. sostituzione dei residui impianti termici con pompe di calore) avvicineranno ulteriormente l'Università alla soglia della carbon neutrality per le proprie emissioni dirette. Inoltre, il nuovo campus Bocconi è già carbon neutral per emissioni Scope 1 e Scope 2. Sulla base di queste premesse, nel 2022 l'Università Bocconi e la SDA Bocconi School of Management hanno intrapreso un percorso per la definizione del piano di decarbonizzazione dell'Ateneo, con lo scopo di

3
formalizzare quanto già raggiunto in termini di riduzione delle emissioni, quantificare le altre emissioni indirette (cosiddette Scope 3) legate alle attività dell'Ateneo e definire un percorso di carbon neutrality con obiettivi, target e tempistica di raggiungimento.

Il piano di decarbonizzazione sviluppato dall'Università Bocconi prevede di raggiungere la carbon neutrality (emissioni dirette scope 1 e indirette scope 2) entro il 2025, per concentrarsi successivamente sull'obiettivo Net Zero, comprensivo di tutte le altre principali emissioni indirette.

A supporto della definizione e dell'implementazione del piano di decarbonizzazione, l'Ateneo ha attivato un percorso per il calcolo e la certificazione della propria carbon footprint secondo lo standard ISO 14064-1, svoltosi nel 2023. In base ai risultati ottenuti dal calcolo della carbon footprint, e dal confronto con altre università italiane, europee ed internazionali con caratteristiche comparabili, Università Bocconi e SDA sono fra le best in class in ambito di performance emissive.

Tra le principali iniziative già realizzate negli ultimi anni che hanno contribuito alla riduzione delle emissioni si segnalano:

## Efficientamento e riduzione dei consumi energetici

Promozione della "Energy Policy" per la riduzione dei consumi e il contenimento dei costi;
Certificazione ISO 50001 sull'Energy Management;
Attività di relamping (sostituzione dei corpi illuminanti con soluzioni ad alta efficienza energetica);
Ottenimento della Certificazione LEED Platinum per il nuovo Urban Campus, massimo livello della certificazione LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design);
Avvio di uno studio di fattibilità per la richiesta di aumento della capacità di utilizzo dell'acqua di falda a servizio del Campus e conversione ad uso scambio termico;
Partecipazione ai bandi per ottenimento fondi ai sensi della L. 338/2000 per interventi di efficientamento energetico della Residenza Spadolini;
Intervento di efficientamento energetico presso l'edificio di via Salasco, finanziato ai sensi del c.d. "super bonus 110%".

## Approvvigionamento energetico da fonti rinnovabili

Autoproduzione di energia da fonti rinnovabili fotovoltaiche e geotermiche. In particolare il parco fotovoltaico Bocconi, secondo per dimensione nella città di Milano, ha superato la soglia di 1,2 MW di potenza installata e avvicina l'Ateneo alla soglia della carbon neutrality per le emissioni dirette Scope 1;
Approvvigionamento dal 2017 del 100% dell'energia elettrica acquisita da terze parti da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine, azzerando le emissioni indirette Scope 2.

## Promozione della mobilità sostenibile

realizzazione di oltre 500 stalli per biciclette nel campus;
stipula di accordi con società per il noleggio di e-bike per alcune delle residenze più lontane;
nomina formale di un Mobility Manager che promuove iniziative di concerto con il Comune di Milano;
realizzazione del Piano Spostamento Casa-Lavoro (PSCL);
inaugurazione della Stazione Ferroviaria Milano Tibaldi-Università Bocconi.

## Monitoraggio e riduzione dei rifiuti:

rafforzamento del monitoraggio della quantità e tipologia di rifiuti prodotti, sia urbani che speciali;
analisi merceologiche dei rifiuti urbani (campionamento conferimenti) commissionate ad AMSA;
incarico di effettuare analisi e proposte per l'ottimizzazione del ciclo dei rifiuti urbani on Campus (Waste Audit) a "Re Learn", startup accelerata da B4i che sviluppa soluzioni tecnologiche per il miglioramento del processo di waste management;
avvio della "Bocconi Food Policy", con sezioni specifiche dedicate alla riduzione dello spreco alimentare e dell'impatto ambientale (inclusa generazione rifiuti) della produzione;
Ristrutturazione della mensa Residenza Bocconi 12 in ottica salute e sostenibilità;
Sin dal 2020, rimozione di tutte le bottiglie di plastica dai distributori automatici e installazione di oltre 70 "water dispenser" (dal 2020 al 2022 sono stati erogati 1.860.000 litri di acqua corrispondenti a 3.725.000 bottigliette da 50 cl).

Nel 2023 è stata inoltre attivata una campagna di comunicazione per sensibilizzare su tutte le tematiche riconducibili alla sostenibilità. La campagna di comunicazione, che verrà completata nel 2024, toccherà anche temi importanti e sensibili per la comunità quali un'alimentazione più sana, l'attenzione ai consumi energetici e agli sprechi.

Con riferimento alle tempistiche definite nel piano di decarbonizzazione, nei prossimi anni l'Università Bocconi intende implementare una serie di azioni che consentiranno di raggiungere l'obiettivo di carbon neutrality sulle emissioni Scope 1 e Scope 2 entro il 2025, proseguendo sulle linee strategiche di efficientamento, ammodernamento degli impianti, sostituzione degli ultimi impianti termici con pompe di calore, autoproduzione di energia rinnovabile, acquisto di energia rinnovabile certificata e promozione della mobilità sostenibile, e definirà una serie di azioni specifiche per ridurre le emissioni Scope 3 in un'ottica Net-Zero. In questo quadro si segnala la strategia di sviluppo del Campus in un'ottica sempre più sostenibile ed inclusiva, che verrà implementata nell'orizzonte temporale considerato nel "Climate City Contract". A dicembre 2022 è stato approvato l'intervento di demolizione e ricostruzione degli edifici di Via Bocconi 6-8 e Piazza Sraffa 11 (per un totale di circa 16.500 mq). Questo importante intervento, la cui progettazione verrà completata nel 2024, vedrà la sua completa realizzazione entro il 2030. I due edifici contribuiranno alla completa decarbonizzazione dell'intero campus Bocconi, minimizzando il proprio impatto sull'ambiente circostante e garantendo un limitato fabbisogno di risorse per la propria manutenzione. Inoltre, interpreteranno sia in termini fisici che culturali il contesto in cui si collocano, con soluzioni innovative in grado di garantire continuità con Milano e con il campus Bocconi.

Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (Player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi laddove disponibili, utili ad avere un inquadramento generale della realtà in cui operate e a collocare le progettualità presentate nel contesto milanese.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime-seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

## PARTE A - Sezione A.1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets, uffici direzionali, "third-party asset and property management services", che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030

La policy generale dell'Ateneo in materia di sostenibilità ambientale si propone l'ottenimento di un progressivo generale miglioramento delle performance dell'Ateneo, raggiungendo standard avanzati e prospettici per successivi step, in linea con gli obiettivi indicati dall'Unione Europea per il raggiungimento della 'neutralità climatica' o 'Net Zero'.

Fra i diversi Campus dell'Università Cattolica presenti sul territorio nazionale, quello di Milano si distingue per l'alto valore storico-artistico dei principali edifici, ubicati nelle immediate vicinanze della Basilica di Sant'Ambrogio. Nel corso degli anni, compatibilmente ai vincoli di tutela monumentale gravanti sul patrimonio immobiliare, sono state attuate significative azioni gestionali e di riqualificazione per la riduzione dell'impatto ambientale, e sono attualmente in corso o previsti: (i) interventi di adeguamento e taratura quadri elettrici generali nelle cabine di media tensione; (ii) interventi di riqualificazione impiantistica della centrale termica e frigorifera; (iii) implementazione puntuale del sistema di Building Management; (iv) progressiva sostituzione dei corpi illuminanti esistenti con apparecchi di nuova tecnologia a led (relamping); (v) proseguimento nella graduale sostituzione dei vecchi serramenti; (vi) proseguimento riqualificazione tecnica ed igienico sanitaria degli impianti di climatizzazione degli edifici; (vii) sostituzione vecchie torri evaporative con impianti con maggior efficienza energetica.

Oltre a tali interventi, si sta procedendo all'attuazione del programma di rigenerazione urbana sancito dall'Accordo Territoriale per la Sicurezza Integrata per lo Sviluppo (A.T.S.I.S.) sottoscritto tra il Ministero dell'Interno, della Difesa, delle Infrastrutture, dei Beni e della Attività culturali, l'Agenzia del Demanio, la Regione Lombardia, il Comune di Milano e l'Università Cattolica, in relazione alla riqualificazione delle Caserme Garibaldi, in p.zza sant'Ambrogio, Montello, in p.zza Firenze, e Santa Barbara, in p.zza Perrucchetti.

Tale progetto, con significative ricadute nell'ambito del territorio milanese e di rilevanza strategica per l'Ateneo anche in relazione agli interventi di rigenerazione e decarbonizzazione programmati, riguarda la trasformazione in sede dell'Università Cattolica della Caserma Garibaldi, di superficie complessiva pari a
circa 53.600 mq., in via di graduale dismissione da parte della Polizia di Stato. Nell'ambito di tale Accordo sono stati avviati ed attualmente in corso i lavori di rifunzionalizzazione dell'Ala di via Santa Valeria, per una superficie di circa 11.400 mq., con conclusione prevista nel 2025; i lavori di trasformazione della rimanente parte della Caserma potranno avere inizio nel 2028, successivamente al trasferimento degli uffici della Polizia di Stato nella nuova sede presso la Caserma Montello, al termine degli interventi di ristrutturazione e nuova costruzione con inizio programmato nel corrente anno 2024, oltre che al termine degli interventi in corso e previsti presso la Caserma Santa Barbara.

Per ciò che riguarda l'intervento di riqualificazione della Caserma Garibaldi, di seguito si riporta una sintetica descrizione degli aspetti che hanno maggiore attinenza ai fini della sostenibilità ambientale, e che vengono specificati con ulteriore dettaglio nella Sezione A.2 del presente documento.

L'involucro edilizio sarà coibentato internamente nelle componenti opache per l'abbattimento delle dispersioni termiche e saranno sostituiti tutti i serramenti con nuovi a bassa trasmittanza in conformità agli elevati standard prescritti dalla normativa vigente.

Gli impianti di climatizzazione saranno realizzati con pompe di calore aria-acqua e sistema a tutt'aria a portata variabile, con gestione modulante correlata all'occupazione degli ambienti e conseguente risparmio energetico in funzione dell'uso effettivo degli spazi; tali pompe di calore, ad alto rendimento, verranno mantenute anche nella fase successiva di ristrutturazione totale del compendio, integrate nella configurazione finale della centrale di climatizzazione con sistema di pompe di calore con acqua di falda, con funzione di ausilio e supporto nella gestione picchi di energia e pertanto con ottimizzazione rendimenti e riduzione consumi.

Gli impianti di illuminazione saranno basati su tecnologie LED e gestiti con sistemi automatici di regolazione controllati da sonde in campo per rilevazione presenza e apporto illuminazione naturale.

I sistemi tecnologici saranno gestiti da sistema centralizzato di BMS con caratteristiche e funzioni di "intelligenza artificiale" in grado di monitorare, gestire ed impostare l'impiantistica in funzione dell'uso degli spazi e dei parametri di rendimento energetico dei componenti e sistemi impiantistici, e di segnalare, in caso eventuali perdite di prestazioni, azioni di manutenzione preventiva.

Gli interventi verranno inoltre realizzati con l'obiettivo di conseguire, al termine dei lavori nel compendio complessivo, standard qualitativi con certificazioni LEED e WELL. Nell'ambito di tali certificazioni in particolare verrà garantito nel corso della produzione di cantiere un ridotto impatto ambientale per il recupero, riutilizzo e riciclo dei rifiuti di costruzione e demolizione, con invio a riciclo di almeno il 75% dei rifiuti prodotti. Si evidenzia che nel corso dell'attuale fase di ristrutturazione, nell'Ala di via Santa Valeria la quantità di rifiuti prodotta nel corso del 2023 è stata finora di oltre 5.500 tonnellate con riciclo di circa il 97% dei materiali.

Ai fini della decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica della Caserma Garibaldi trasformata in sede universitaria verrà infine acquistata e utilizzata fin dalla prima fase energia elettrica certificata con garanzia di origine da fonti rinnovabili.

Il piano strategico per la sostenibilità ambientale dell'Ateneo prevede inoltre le seguenti ulteriori azioni specifiche:

Fonti rinnovabili: implementazione pannelli fotovoltaici da installare nelle sedi per produzione energia da fonti rinnovabili, per quanto possibile tenendo conto dei vincoli architettonici e paesaggistici della maggior parte degli edifici della Sede di Milano; in particolare si prevede l'attivazione dell'impianto fotovoltaico recentemente installato presso l'edificio di via Lanzone 14, con potenza 10 kW, e la verifica della fattibilità di eventuali ulteriori impianti in altre aree/superfici utilizzabili e delle modalità di posizionamento dei pannelli e di collegamento degli stessi con gli impianti elettrici esistenti; con stima del numero di KWh producibili dall'impianto, anche al fine di prevedere i tempi attesi di ritorno dall'investimento; e successiva contabilizzazione con statistiche di produzione e consumo.

Plastiche: proseguimento del lavoro già iniziato da alcuni anni per la progressiva riduzione dei consumi interni di acqua e bibite in bottigliette di plastica e, per estensione, dei consumi di bicchieri/stoviglie in plastica utilizzati negli eventi pubblici (seminari, convegni, etc.), attraverso: (i) installazione nelle sedi di erogatori di acqua minerale; (ii) misurazione dei consumi attuali di plastica in contenitori, in collaborazione con EDUCatt e gli attuali gestori dei servizi bar delle sedi, e con i gestori dei distributori automatici; (iii) scelta del materiale alternativo alla plastica, da condurre assieme ai fornitori, considerando anche i costi al pubblico; (iv) programma di implementazione in 2/3 anni, a partire da un progetto pilota; (v) campagna di informazione e sensibilizzazione rivolta a tutti gli utenti dell'Università (studenti, docenti e PTA); (vi) stima della riduzione dei consumi raggiunta ed effetti ambientali connessi.

Automezzi: il pur ridotto parco auto di servizio dell'Università Cattolica presenta ancora veicoli ad elevati tassi di emissione di CO2. Verranno quindi attuati: (i) nell'ambito delle rotazioni degli automezzi, investimenti di rinnovo che privilegiano scelte orientate alle auto elettriche o ibride; (ii) scouting di mercato per la selezione delle auto, con verifica in sede di scelta dei livelli di emissioni dichiarate, con preferenza alle auto elettriche per quegli automezzi non destinati a utilizzi su lunghe percorrenze; (iii) ove necessario, installazione di torrette per la ricarica dei motori elettrici (o plug-in hybrid) presso le sedi interessate; (iv) monitoraggio dei chilometri percorsi e stima delle minori emissioni prodotte.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (Player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi laddove disponibili, utili ad avere un inquadramento generale della realtà in cui operate e a collocare le progettualità presentate nel contesto milanese.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare.
A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.

Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti di trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime-seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030

## Iniziative dell'Università in riferimento alla sostenibilità ambientale

Per quanto riguarda lo sviluppo sostenibile l'Università Statale di Milano ha in atto azioni e iniziative a sostegno di nuovi modelli di crescita e stili di vita consapevoli. Acqua, rifiuti, energia, mobilità, welfare e benessere della persona, disabilità e politiche di genere sono temi al centro di una sorta di "agenda per la sostenibilità", iniziata 30 anni fa, ma che l'Università Statale ha voluto formalizzare negli ultimi anni attraverso la creazione e la partecipazione attiva a progetti di Ateneo e network cittadini, nazionali e internazionali.

Tramite il progetto Minerva 2030, lanciato nell'ottobre 2018 e coordinato dal prof. Stefano Bocchi, delegato per lo sviluppo sostenibile della Statale, l'Ateno promuove, insieme all'intera comunità universitaria e grazie ai gruppi di lavoro che operano per la realizzazione delle diverse azioni, una vera e propria cultura della sostenibilità.

L'Università Statale, con il Progetto Minerva 2030, ha individuato idee e persone con cui costruire una più ampia e attiva partecipazione al raggiungimento dei 17 obiettivi dell'Agenda 2030 ONU per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile, che rappresentano la bussola per il prossimo decennio a favore di uno sviluppo basato su un patto sociale trasversale fra le diverse generazioni.

È stato così attivato nel 2019 un processo progressivo di consultazioni interne all'ateneo nei confronti dei dipartimenti al fine di individuare tematiche, ambiti di ricerca e didattica, docenti, ricercatori, personale maggiormente interessati ad essere coinvolti nel programma "Statale per la Sostenibilità" al fine di potenziare anche la terza missione, vale a dire le interazioni fra la Statale e gli ambiti esterni ad essa.

In seguito a questo primo passaggio interno, nell'anno successivo (2020) si sono progressivamente rafforzate le reti esistenti e attive sui temi della sostenibilità. Si sono in particolare consolidati i rapporti con altri Atenei Milanesi a partire dal Politecnico (Campus Sostenibile) e Bicocca, ma non solo. Particolarmente importante e strategico è il rapporto con le Istituzioni come Comune di Milano, Città Metropolitana e Regione, così come con altri attori impegnati sul fronte di progetti di sostenibilità come Fondazione Cariplo, Fondazione Feltrinelli, MM spa, Triennale, Musei (2020 – 2023).

In futuro saranno ulteriormente valorizzati i rapporti esistenti ed eventualmente costituiti nuovi tavoli tecnici con le industrie del territorio per i progetti dell'Università degli Studi di Milano - Aziende sulla sostenibilità, utili per elaborare nuove strategie operative condivise con le aziende per tutti gli ambiti di competenze

universitarie. Infine, verranno potenziati i rapporti con i media sui temi del percepire, comunicare, dibattere, approfondire i temi di Agenda 2030.

L'Ateneo è fortemente impegnato nelle attività sulla sostenibilità ambientale, che vanno dalla riduzione della plastica, alla raccolta differenziata dei rifiuti, al risparmio energetico, alla mobilità sostenibile, anche sulla base di quanto previsto da appositi piani di programmazione (es. Piano energetico, Piano triennale Edilizia, Progetto Minerva 2030) e da quanto promosso dalla Rete delle Università per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile (RUS). È stata costituita nel 2022 la Direzione Edilizia e Sostenibilità, struttura amministrativa che provvede al coordinamento delle politiche per la sostenibilità e della tematica ambientale dei consumi della Pubblica Amministrazione.

In particolare, nella direzione di cui sopra l'Ufficio Sostenibilità non solo promuove l'ottimizzazione dei processi sui temi della sostenibilità nell'ottica di una migliore gestione delle risorse energetiche e idriche e della tutela dell'ambiente, ma anche iniziative per la diffusione di buone pratiche e campagne di comunicazione per incentivare politiche di sostenibilità. Si occupa inoltre della gestione dei rifiuti prodotti dall'Ateneo.

In contemporanea alla costituzione Direzione Edilizia e Sostenibilità, ha visto la nascita di un nuovo gruppo di lavoro denominato "Green Office" costituito da docenti, personale tecnico/amministrativo e studenti con il compito di sviluppare i temi della sostenibilità all'interno dell'Ateneo, parallelamente a questo gruppo è stato creato dalla Direzione Generale un gruppo di lavoro denominato "Energy Team" con il compito di facilitare l'interazione delle varie strutture amministrative/gestionali dell'Università per sviluppare tutti quei temi di risparmio energetico e buone pratiche, implementabili all'interno dell'Ateneo.

Inoltre è presente in Ateneo la figura del Mobility Manager (fa parte della Direzione Generale), che contribuisce all'elaborazione del Piano di Mobilità dell'Ateneo, e partecipa alle iniziative locali e nazionali di mobilità sostenibile, quali il gruppo Coordinamento Nazionale dei Mobility Manager delle Università Italiane della RUS (Rete delle Università per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile).

L'Ufficio dell'Energy Manager (fa parte della Direzione Edilizia e Sostenibilità) garantisce la predisposizione e l'aggiornamento del Bilancio Energetico d'Ateneo. Promuove pratiche d'uso dell'energia razionale e conservative, individuando le azioni, gli interventi e le procedure per garantire il buon uso dell'energia. Attua verifiche sugli interventi sottoposti alle politiche di risparmio energetico.

Anche mediante l'attività didattica e divulgativa rivolta ai propri studenti, nonché alla cittadinanza, l'Ateneo è impegnato a favorire la sensibilizzazione sui temi della sostenibilità ambientale con la promozione di iniziative a ciò atte.

Nell'ambito del progetto Minerva 2030, a partire dal 2019 è stato costituito un gruppo di lavoro al fine di individuare gli ambiti di azione, sia interni sia esterni all'Ateneo, sia le modalità di sviluppo degli obiettivi di Agenda 2030, includendo le diverse componenti dell'Università, anche per potenziarne il dialogo, con particolare attenzione nei confronti dei gruppi degli studenti. Fra gli obiettivi stabiliti è rientrato quello di fare emergere, comunicare e potenziare quanto la Statale sta già facendo in termini di sostenibilità.

Per una migliore comprensione delle attività previste è possibile consultare i seguenti documenti:

Tra le iniziative già avviate e/o realizzate, possono essere annoverate le seguenti:

## PLASTIC FREE

Con particolare riferimento all'utilizzo della plastica e all'intenzione di ridurne drasticamente la sua presenza nel mercato dei beni di consumo, si è considerata l'opportunità di avviare delle iniziative atte a una immediata, o graduale, riduzione - nonché futura eliminazione – del suo utilizzo, e nel caso specifico, delle bottiglie d'acqua di plastica da parte della comunità accademica.

A tal fine, il Consiglio di Amministrazione, nella seduta del 28 maggio 2019, ha approvato la pubblicazione di avviso pubblico per la ricerca di operatori economici da invitare alla procedura per l'affidamento del contratto di sponsorizzazione, ex art. 19, c. 1, D.Lgs. n. 50/2016, finalizzato alla realizzazione di iniziative a supporto del progetto "plastic free" sostenibilità ambientale presso l'Università degli Studi di Milano.

distribuzione gratuita di borracce di alluminio in favore della comunità accademica;
realizzazione di n. 4 casette dell'acqua presso varie sedi dell'Università degli Studi di Milano;
realizzazione di 10 nuovi punti di prelievo di acqua potabile presso varie sedi dell'Università degli Studi di Milano.

È stata inoltre attuata l'installazione di 41 distributori piccoli presso i dipartimenti e le residenze universitarie, oltre ad altri 25 distributori più grandi da posizionare nei settori didattici in sostituzione dei vending di bottigliette. Dall'installazione della prima casetta dell'acqua a oggi si stima l'erogazione di oltre n. 1.500.000 L di acqua, con un risparmio di n. 3.000.000 bottiglie di plastica e di n. 60.000 Kg di CO2 non immessi in atmosfera. Plastic free è collegata con il progetto BeviMi: Statale, Politecnico e Bicocca insieme per il consumo responsabile di acqua.

## RISPARMIO ENERGETICO

La Direzione Edilizia e Sostenibilità, in sintonia con il Piano Strategico triennale e le attività di programmazione edilizia, redige annualmente il Piano Energetico, che si inserisce a pieno titolo tra gli strumenti di cui si dota l'Università per garantire l'impegno nell'attività di gestione dei consumi e risparmio energetico. Gli obiettivi principali del Piano Energetico sono i seguenti:

analisi energetica continua del patrimonio edilizio;
migliorare l'efficienza energetica ed idrica degli edifici;
ridurre l'utilizzo di energia da fonti fossili non rinnovabili e favorire l'utilizzo di energia da fonti rinnovabili;
favorire una gestione del patrimonio edilizio in una logica "LIFE CYCLE";
promuovere nuove campagne di informazione/formazione e consolidare quelle attivate negli anni passati, per sensibilizzare gli occupanti verso i temi dell'efficienza energetica.

## IMPLEMENTAZIONE DELLA RACCOLTA DIFFERENZIATA NELLE AULE

La collocazione di set per la raccolta separata di rifiuti indifferenziati-carta-plastica-lattine nelle aule, già realizzata, su richiesta degli studenti, nel settore didattico di Via Conservatorio/Via Passione/Via Livorno, interesserà nel corso del 2021-2022 anche le aule con capienza superiore a 100 posti di Città Studi e del Centro Veterinario di Lodi.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (Player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi laddove disponibili, utili ad avere un inquadramento generale della realtà in cui operate e a collocare le progettualità presentate nel contesto milanese.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime-seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti identificati (ad esempio stock edificato, sistemi energetici, infrastrutture per la mobilità). | Nell’ottica di dotarsi di strumenti efficaci per affrontare le frequenti crisi del mercato energetico l’Università degli Studi di Milano si è dotata di un gruppo di lavoro interdisciplinare denominato “Energy Team” delegato dalla Direzione Generale a proporre un piano di interventi di efficientamento energetico che potesse rispondere in tempi rapidi alle ricadute economiche e sociali della crisi energetica post emergenza sanitaria COVID 19 esplose nel corso del 2021/2022. Forti dei risultati ottenuti nel primo anno di lavoro si è deciso di consolidare alcune scelte fatte in un contesto emergenziale per farle diventare degli standard di gestione del patrimonio edilizio di Ateneo.
Il minimo comune denominatore di questo progetto è stato individuare interventi principalmente gestionali sui sistemi energetici, di facile applicabilità su larga scala, con investimenti contenuti e rapido tempo di ritorno.
I principali interventi inseriti nel progetto sono:
Ottimizzazione orari di accensione/spegnimento impianti termici/frigoriferi
Ottimizzazione temperature di comfort invernale ed estivo
Ottimizzazione gestione impianti termici e di ventilazione nei periodi di pausa delle lezioni (vacanze estive, invernali, periodo esami etc.) in edifici a principale destinazione d’uso didattica.  |

# PARTE A - Sezione A.1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets, uffici direzionali, "third-party asset and property management services", che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030

Fin dalla sua istituzione l'Università di Milano-Bicocca ha scelto di impegnarsi attivamente per lo sviluppo sostenibile proponendosi come modello educativo e comportamentale.

L'Ateneo aderisce alla RUS (Rete delle Università per lo Sviluppo sostenibile), ha istituito il gruppo BASE (Bicocca Ambiente Società Economia) un comitato scientifico multidisciplinare formato da docenti, ricercatori, studenti e personale tecnico/amministrativo con il compito di definire le politiche di sostenibilità dell'Ateneo e ha predisposto negli anni una serie di Piani Strategici (da ultimo il Piano 2023-2025) attenti al raggiungimento degli obiettivi dell'Agenda 2030, dell'efficientamento energetico e della decarbonizzazione.

A partire dal 2023 l'articolazione delle sue unità organizzative comprende, all'interno dell'Area Infrastrutture e Approvvigionamenti, il Settore Sostenibilità, con le funzioni di green office di Ateneo.

L'analisi integrata dell'inventario delle emissioni di Ateneo in rapporto al proprio asset immobiliare, impiantistico e del verde, le indagini sugli spostamenti Casa-Università ed i dati raccolti per la redazione del report di sostenibilità, hanno permesso di individuare gli ambiti più critici di produzione di $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (riscaldamento, elettricità, mobilità), su cui si deve agire anche grazie al coinvolgimento dell'intera comunità accademica.

Alla luce di ciò si è programmato un piano di rinnovamento del patrimonio immobiliare che, considerando gli edifici terminati dal 2022 e fino al 2030 vede un investimento del valore di oltre 240 milioni di euro.

Il piano si rivolge contemporaneamente al completamento del masterplan gregottiano e all'ammodernamento ed efficientamento di quelli esistenti, senza ulteriore consumo di suolo. Un ambizioso programma di rilancio e rinnovamento delle infrastrutture edilizie, fondamentali per la didattica e la ricerca, nonché delle residenze universitarie, con l'uso di fonti di energia alternative (potenziamento degli impianti fotovoltaici di Ateneo e geotermia), l'efficientamento degli involucri (sostituzione dei serramenti e cappotto termico), l'avanzamento del piano di revamping dei sistemi con illuminazione a LED, il rafforzamento del monitoraggio ambientale degli spazi attraverso l'implementazione di sistemi BMS e di nuova sensoristica, nonché il rinnovamento e/o l'ottimizzazione del tuning degli impianti termici ed elettrici.

Il programma di ammodernamento infrastrutturale e tecnologico ha ottenuto finanziamenti per un importo di oltre 90 milioni di euro tra fondi ministeriali (Ministero dell'Università e Ricerca a valere sul Fondo per l'edilizia universitaria (DM 1432 del 23 dicembre 2022) e le residenze universitarie, fondi destinati all'acquisto di grandi attrezzature scientifiche (DM 1274/2021) e fondi regionali.

Questo programma è completato e arricchito dagli investimenti materiali e immateriali previsti nell'ambito dei progetti del PNRR (comprensivo dei progetti MUSA, NBFC e MOST) che prevedono la creazione di Joint e Living Labs con la realizzazione congiunta (tra Ateneo e aziende) di prototipi per nuove tecnologie sostenibili o soluzioni smart da implementare e testare in situ all'interno del campus di Bicocca, per la realizzazione di uno Smart Campus, in collaborazione con le università partner e gli Enti istituzionali, garantendone la replicabilità e scalabilità. Tali prototipi comprendono:

scelte energetiche e di utilizzo di fonti rinnovabili, verso la realizzazione di distretti carbon neutral;
soluzioni a sostegno della mobilità dolce a basso impatto ambientale, dell'economia circolare e della biodiversità.

L'implementazione fisica di tali prototipi nel campus conferisce all'Ateneo il ruolo di laboratorio per la sperimentazione e consente di equipaggiare le strutture edilizie dell'Ateneo con soluzioni innovative e sostenibili in materia di efficientamento energetico, illuminazione, videosorveglianza e utilizzo di servizi di mobilità.
Le ulteriori strategie di intervento dell'Ateneo verso la decarbonizzazione sono orientate, in un'ottica di ampio respiro, ad azioni multidisciplinari diffuse a tutti gli ambiti e livelli Universitari:

**organigramma**: la necessità di allinearsi ai criteri internazionali di sviluppo e sostenibilità ha coinvolto tutta la struttura amministrativa dell'Ateneo, che ha programmato e messo in atto politiche integrate di sostenibilità con azioni di razionalizzazione e riorganizzazione interna anche al fine di creare sinergie tra le diverse aree tecnico/amministrative;
**mobility management**: le azioni positive programmate nell'ambito della mobilità sostenibile si sono rivolte principalmente agli spostamenti casa-università attraverso interventi mirati sia a potenziare infrastrutture e servizi per la mobilità dolce (come la realizzazione di velostazioni per il ricovero sicuro delle biciclette, il convenzionamento con aziende di Sharing-mobility) sia ad incentivare l'utilizzo del Trasporto Pubblico con iniziative direttamente finanziate dall'Ateneo (navette dedicate alla connessione intermodale dei campus Bicocca con il Trasporto Pubblico locale) o in collaborazione con le istituzioni (i Comuni di Milano e Monza, le Aziende di trasporto Pubblico per l'ottimizzazione delle corse e degli orari dei mezzi);
**formazione e comunicazione**: l'attenzione ai temi della sostenibilità ha interessato a 360° l'ambito della didattica. A livello di formazione continua sono stati attivati corsi trasversali sui goals dell'agenda 2030 in e-learning fruibili da parte di tutta la comunità universitaria, mentre con riferimento alla formazione accademica l'offerta si è arricchita di insegnamenti su specifici temi legati alla sostenibilità (ad oggi lo studente ha la possibilità di verificare in modo semplice e intuitivo quale obiettivo dell'Agenda 2030 è perseguito da ogni insegnamento) oltre che, con l'istituzione della Bicocca Academy sono stati avviati master di I e II livello su tali temi (si citano tra tanti: "Sostenibilità in Diritto Finanza e Management SiLFiM" e "Cibo e Società: innovare pratiche, politiche e mercati alimentari");
**gestione dei rifiuti**: gli obiettivi di Waste and resource management d'Ateneo riguardano la valorizzazione delle risorse e miglioramento della gestione dei rifiuti, con riferimento agli obiettivi della Circular Economy. L'Università degli Studi di Milano – Bicocca produce rifiuti speciali pericolosi e non pericolosi e rifiuti urbani, questi ultimi raccolti previa differenziazione all'origine nelle frazioni di carta/cartone, vetro, metallo e plastica, indifferenziato. La frazione umida è raccolta dal gestore del servizio ristorazione. Circa il 70% dei rifiuti urbani raccolti dalle eco-isole viene differenziato;
**food and water management**: la realizzazione di azioni di governo finalizzate alla promozione di cibo salutare e sostenibile ed alla salvaguardia delle risorse si è concretizzata e si sta concretizzando nella progettazione e gestione di appalti per servizi di ristorazione plastic-free più attenti alla qualità dell'offerta (con le diete nutrizionalmente complete), nella prescrizione delle tipologie di alimenti da rendere disponibili nelle vending machines e con la realizzazione di aree dedicate al consumo di cibo portato da casa. In sinergia con le azioni per limitare la produzione di rifiuti ed evitare gli sprechi, è in programma un rafforzamento dei punti di erogazione dell'acqua potabile che nel solo anno 2022 hanno permesso di risparmiare la produzione di circa 6.000 kg di rifiuti di plastica da bottiglie;
**stili di vita e inclusione**: da sempre l'Università di Milano - Bicocca si è posta come Ateneo aperto a tutti, impegnandosi da una parte nella riduzione delle diseguaglianze e dall'altra nella promozione di politiche per l'adozione di corretti stili di vita. Le politiche della governance prevedono una serie di servizi a disposizione della comunità accademica come la navetta dedicata al trasporto dei portatori di handicap nel tragitto casa/università, gli interventi costanti per l'accessibilità degli spazi promossi con il progetto B-Map (il comune di Milano ha riconosciuto il comparto Bicocca come una delle aree cittadine a minor presenza di barriere architettoniche), l'istituzione di un ufficio dedicato agli studenti con disabilità. A questo si aggiungono interventi a favore della salute e del benessere della comunità accademica: l'istituzione del programma dual career a favore degli studenti atleti, gli interventi edilizi ancora in corso e programmati per il futuro per il completamento delle strutture sportive ed il centro di medicina per lo sport a cui si aggiungono la creazione/ristrutturazione di spazi verdi di condivisione e socialità, la realizzazione di residenze universitarie destinate ad ospitare studenti fuorisede economicamente svantaggiati, l'istituzione di borse di studio e meccanismi premiali per gli studenti meritevoli;
**gestione e promozione del verde**: è in fase avanzata di progetto la realizzazione del Bosco Urbano ad uso pubblico di 19.151 mq adiacente il nuovo edificio universitario U10, a completamento del master plan gregottiano, che rappresenta un ampliamento considerevole (oltre il 40% di superficie verde) del Campus universitario di Milano. In aggiunta la depavimentazione di alcune zone dell'Ateneo (Piazza della Scienza), la creazione di spazi per l'educazione ambientale e la promozione della biodiversità (il Vivaio Bicocca) e l'individuazione di azioni strutturali con l'applicazione dell'approccio Nature Based Solutions nella realizzare e gestione di edifici e spazi verdi pertinenziali garantirà uno rigenerazione urbana dell'intero quartiere.

# Efficientamento energetico delle infrastrutture edilizie ed impiantistiche per la didattica e la ricerca

Nel periodo 2022-2030 sono in previsione, come da indicazioni delle redigendi Linee Guida d'Ateneo per la riduzione dei consumi e l'efficientamento energetico e il loro monitoraggio (da integrare nel più ampio Piano di Sostenibilità di Ateneo), l'incremento delle fonti rinnovabili e la decarbonizzazione, con individuazione di azioni, interventi e procedure migliorative nel breve, medio e lungo periodo di tipo organizzativo, gestionale, operativo e di monitoraggio nella conduzione degli impianti e delle strutture, nonché di scelta comparata della più opportuna contrattualizzazione dei servizi di gestione energia, nonché di tipo tecnologico/strutturale e di quant'altro necessario per promuovere l'uso razionale dell'energia.

Considerando il 2021 come base-line, l'energia elettrica acquisita in convenzione Consip per le utenze intestate direttamente all'Università (95% del totale) è in Opzione Verde con certificazione della fornitura da sole fonti rinnovabili, tramite Garanzia di Origine (GO) e gli edifici del Campus di Milano U1, U2, U3, U4, U5, U6, U7, U9, U12, U17 e U27 sono allacciati al TLR+ACS e TLF (al teleraffrescamento con esclusione degli edifici U5, U9 e U27) con fornitore A2A Calore e Servizi srl (Impianto di produzione Tecnocity-Bicocca: Combustibile usato gas naturale; potenza installata 10 MWe, 10 MWf e 41 MWt di cui 16 MWt da cogenerazione, Unità di produzione: n. 2 turbogas da 5 MWe + 8 MWt ciascuno; n. 3 caldaie a gas da 25 MWt totali; n. 2 serbatoi di accumulo termico da 700 m³ ciascuno).

La proposta di azioni migliorative, oltre a continuare la compensazione dell'energia elettrica con acquisti verdi e il perseguimento dei contratti di TLR+ACS e TLF, verte all'ottimizzazione di tipo organizzativo, gestionale e operativo nella conduzione degli impianti e delle strutture, tra cui:

nuove soluzioni per il monitoraggio e la gestione ottimizzata degli impianti e delle reti;
sistemi di razionalizzazione d'uso degli spazi (es. introduzione di criteri di sistemi di calcolo dei consumi energetici nell'assegnazione delle aule d'Ateneo che tengano conto anche dei fattori di minor consumo energetico, riorganizzazione dei CED, centri della e laboratori informatici in ottica di efficientamento energetico, valutazione dei consumi energetici di ampliamenti e realizzazione di nuovi laboratori di ricerca, regolazione delle accensioni degli impianti di climatizzazione e delle temperature di set-point mantenute negli ambienti, spegnimento dell'illuminazione e degli apparecchi elettrici in determinate fasce orarie e la verifica dello spegnimento dell'illuminazione interna notturna (salvo illuminazione di sicurezza) e di tutti gli apparecchi elettrici non necessari, etc.);
ottimizzazione ambienti in ottica di benessere termo-igrometrico, qualità dell'aria e comfort visivo;
soluzioni tecniche per favorire la compartecipazione degli utenti rivolto al risparmio energetico che tenga conto dell'interazione utente-edificio-comunicazione;
interfaccia con referente Terzo responsabile per analisi energetica, valutazioni, aggiornamento database consumi.

Le proposte di interventi tecnologici/strutturali riguardano la produzione di energia attraverso l'uso di fonti energetiche rinnovabili (verranno installati circa 4.000 mq di pannelli fotovoltaici per una potenza complessiva pari a circa 1.000 kWp e una produzione pari a circa 1 milione di kWh/anno), implementazione di sistemi di controllo BMS su tutti i vettori energetici - calore, energia frigorifera, energia elettrica, gas metano, acqua potabile - e qualità dell'aria degli edifici, efficientamento dell'involucro edilizio, revamping impianti elettrici e termici, opere di relamping illuminazione e implementazione sistemi di gestione illuminazione DALI, installazione e posa di ottimizzazione di tensione e/o quadri di rifasamento, specifiche funzioni di diagnostica predittiva nonché di utilizzo di algoritmi innovativi per la gestione degli impianti di produzione calore, acquisti con CAM, sistema di recupero dell'acqua piovana per flussaggi e irrigazione, etc.).

Sono in fase previsione di cantierizzazione gli interventi di ristrutturazione o manutenzione straordinaria dei principali edifici del Campus di Milano (edifici U1-U2¹ e U3-U4² in Piazza della Scienza oltre agli interventi già in corso in U5³, U7⁴ e U9⁵) al fine di renderli più efficienti, sostenibili e adeguati alle esigenze della ricerca con estensione di sistemi BMS, revamping dei corpi illuminanti, dei sistemi elettrici e UTA, installazione di pannelli fotovoltaici e interventi di miglioramento delle prestazioni energetiche degli involucri opachi e trasparenti.

In questi stessi edifici verranno eseguiti lavori di ammodernamento delle aule didattiche, adeguate all'implementazione della didattica innovativa, a fruizione ibrida in presenza e a distanza, fisica e virtuale, esperienziale e immersiva.

Al rinnovamento delle strutture esistenti si aggiunge il completamento della costruzione di due nuovi edifici universitari, moderni e sostenibili ad implementazione del polo universitario di Milano Bicocca (che comportano un ampliamento di circa il 10% dell'attuale patrimonio immobiliare universitario ricadente nel Comune di Milano):

L'edificio U10, avente una superficie lorda complessiva di mq. 20.000, da destinarsi a servizi didattici e spazi dipartimentali per una superficie lorda di mq. 17.000 (porzione U10.1), ed in parte da destinare ad edilizia residenziale universitaria e/o altra destinazione a standard connessa alla funzione universitaria per una superficie lorda di mq. 3.000 (porzione U10.2), su di un sedime di mq. 7.550 (settemila cinquecentocinquanta) con parcheggi nel sottosuolo nella misura minima di mq. 6.000, completamente immerso in un parco⁶ dove saranno anche predisposte aule all'aperto, sarà dedicato in parte a residenza universitaria e in parte alle attività di didattica, con aule già predisposte per la didattica innovativa.
L'edificio U19⁷ che sarà completamente dedicato alla ricerca d'avanguardia per quanto riguarda le scienze dure, inclusa la sperimentazione di soluzioni per l'efficientamento energetico grazie alla geotermia (Energy Lab); e sarà in buona parte dedicato a joint lab con aziende, inclusi quelli promossi all'interno del PNRR.

## Potenziamento e rinnovamento delle residenze universitarie

Per sostenere e incrementare l'attrattività verso gli studenti fuori sede e internazionali, risulta strategico l'impegno dell'Ateneo alla realizzazione ed accoglienza nelle residenze universitarie, che attualmente ospitano 616 posti letto in diritto allo studio universitario (di cui 388 in Comune di Milano), interventi di riqualificazione ed efficientamento (in U92 - Casa Marmont di Giò Ponti)⁸ e l'implementazione di strutture nuove progettate con ampi spazi comuni di studio, convivenza e socializzazione: la residenza U42⁹, inaugurata a settembre 2022, con una capacità di 156 posti letto, e la realizzazione di nuovi edifici in classe A, tendenti al soddisfacimento dei requisiti nZEB (residenze U52¹⁰ (132 posti letto) con previsione di fine lavori al 2027 e U32¹¹ (per ora ancora in fase di progettualità per 141 posti letto), oltre agli ulteriori posti letto in U10 e in convenzionamento per l'accoglienza complessiva di ulteriori 565 studenti (di cui 533 in Comune di Milano).

## Interventi di prototipazione di edilizia sostenibile e Smart Campus: il progetto MUSA

Il progetto MUSA¹², coordinato da Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca in partenariato con altre quattro Università milanesi, affronta in 6 differenti spoke le strategie di decarbonizzazione con più di 900 ricercatori su tematiche di sostenibilità climatica con riferimento al risparmio di energia, a nuove forme di mobilità e all'implementazione di Nature Based Solutions. Spoke 1 (Rigenerazione Urbana) e Spoke 4 (Finanza) riguardano in modo diretto il tema della transizione ecologica e digitale a livello urbano attraverso la definizione di nuovi modelli e strategie di rigenerazione della città attraverso una progettazione multicriterio in grado di valorizzazione le peculiarità del territorio per creare città più sostenibili e resilienti.

La valutazione economica dei diversi elementi, a partire dai servizi ecosistemici delle aree verdi, sino alla stima degli effetti di determinate scelte urbanistiche sulla salute umana saranno fondamentali non solo per quantificare il valore dei processi di rigenerazione, ma anche per individuare leve e modelli di finanziamento di nuovi prototipi di intervento di forestazione urbana, di depavimentazione e mitigazione delle isole di calore¹³ oltre che di recupero di aree critiche e dismesse.

In questo ambito l'Ateneo promuove la ricerca di scelte energetiche e di utilizzo di fonti rinnovabili e la realizzazione di distretti carbon neutral e Positive Energy Districts (PED) attraverso innovazioni tecniche, schemi e strumenti economici innovativi di produzione e gestione di energia rinnovabile con riduzione dei flussi di energia, materiali e occupazione di suolo.

## La progettualità nell'ambito del Mobility Management e il progetto MOST

Nell'ambito del Mobility Management l'Ateneo è impegnato su più fronti con azioni finalizzate ad ottimizzare gli spostamenti casa-università di studenti e personale docente e tecnico/amministrativo secondo forme di mobilità pubblica e attiva. Nel proporsi come Ateneo inclusivo, dove la presenza delle persone rappresenta un valore aggiunto imprescindibile, si vuole consentire alla comunità accademica di raggiungere fisicamente e virtualmente le proprie strutture con il minor impatto carbonico possibile.

Fulcro della progettualità d'Ateneo in materia di mobility management è il Piano spostamenti casa-lavoro-Università in fase di aggiornamento.

Come indicato nelle "Linee guida per la redazione e l'implementazione dei piani degli spostamenti casa-lavoro (PSCL)" sottoscritte con il Decreto Interdirettoriale n. 209 del 4 agosto 2021 il piano conterrà, l'analisi dell'offerta e della domanda di mobilità della comunità accademica, le politiche di Ateneo, le azioni positive e gli strumenti per incentivare la mobilità sostenibile, compresi il cronoprogramma e il budget.

In quanto Ateneo affiliato dello Spoke 8 del progetto MOST¹⁴ (MaaS e Servizi Innovativi) è stato possibile integrare le ricerche promosse a livello nazionale con l'indagine sulle modalità di spostamento Casa - Ateneo di Milano-Bicocca, somministrando il questionario elaborato dai ricercatori alla comunità universitaria con un ottimo riscontro (circa il 10% di risposte). L'utilizzo di un medesimo strumento di analisi su diverse realtà universitarie (gli Atenei coinvolti nel progetto MOST_Spoke 8 sono POLIBA - UNINA - UNIPD - UNICA - UNIMIB) permetterà anche un confronto/collaborazione tra le cinque strutture accademiche per pianificare e verificare l'efficacia delle diverse azioni.

La peculiarità dell'Università di Milano-Bicocca, consistente prima di tutto nel suo essere strutturalmente diffusa sia a livello cittadino (Municipio IX del comune di Milano) sia a livello regionale (con sedi nelle province di Monza-Brianza, Sondrio, Bergamo, Lecco), comporta tuttavia una progettazione ad hoc degli interventi in collaborazione con gli Enti locali territorialmente competenti e con i gestori del trasporto pubblico locale.

Sono in essere le seguenti misure finalizzate alla riduzione dell'utilizzo dell'auto privata:

convenzionamento con il trasporto pubblico per consentire ai dipendenti l'acquisto di abbonamenti annuali ferroviari e dello STIBM (Sistema Tariffario Integrato del Bacino di Mobilità Milano e Monza Brianza) con tariffe agevolate;
attivazione del programma di scontistica "Trenitalia for Business" per tutta la comunità accademica su tutti i treni del servizio nazionale Frecce e Intercity;
convenzionamento con vari provider di sharing-mobility attivi su Milano e Lombardia per l'utilizzo a prezzi agevolati di biciclette, scooter e automobili a trazione elettrica;
predisposizione di un servizio di Ecobus navetta gratuito per tutta la popolazione accademica per il collegamento diretto dei campus di Milano e Monza con le sue residenze universitarie e con la rete TPL (80.000 utenze stimate per il triennio 2022_2024). Con aggiornamento periodico di percorsi e orari vengono sono periodicamente sulla base dell'implementazione del TPL e il monitoraggio continuo del tasso di occupazione dei mezzi;

¹⁴ MOST - Centro Nazionale per la Mobilità Sostenibile nasce sulla spinta del PNRR con la collaborazione tra 24 università, il CNR e 24 grandi imprese. Il progetto ha la missione di implementare soluzioni moderne, sostenibili e inclusive per l'intero territorio nazionale nell'ambito della mobilità aerea, dei veicoli stradali sostenibili, del trasporto per vie d'acqua e su ferrovia. Nello specifico il MOST si occupa di rendere il sistema della mobilità più "green" nel suo complesso e più "digitale" nella sua gestione, attraverso soluzioni leggere e sistemi di propulsione elettrica e a idrogeno, sistemi digitali per la riduzione degli incidenti, soluzioni più efficaci per il trasporto pubblico e la logistica.

L'Ateneo di Milano-Bicocca partecipa alle attività in qualità di Affiliato, nella cornice di due Spoke:

SPOKE 8 – MaaS e servizi innovativi
SPOKE 13 - Sistema di Trazione Elettrica e Batteria
installazione di una Ciclofficina aperta a tutta la cittadinanza che offre manutenzioni ordinarie e straordinarie di supporto biomeccanico e consulenza tecnica;
promozione di corsi di alta formazione sui temi della sicurezza e dell'educazione nel settore della mobilità e dei trasporti (Summer School MUST: Mobility Urban Safe and Training).

Il settore Sostenibilità di Ateneo, in accordo con il delegato alla Sostenibilità e Mobility Manager, supportato dalla Governance di Ateneo nonché sentiti i rappresentanti degli studenti, ha programmato, progettato e finanziato le seguenti azioni che verranno attuate a partire dall'anno corrente e troveranno sistematizzazione nell'ambito del PSCL:

nuovo bando navette 2025 2027 progettato sulla base delle risultanze dell'indagine degli spostamenti della popolazione accademica con percorsi ed orari coordinati con trasporto pubblico locale, con la prescrizione nonché utilizzo di mezzi collettivi a trazione elettrica;
accordi programmatici con il Comune di Milano, di Monza e Brianza, di Area Metropolitana e Regionale a beneficio non solo dell campus di Milano ma dell'intero quartiere: nel dettaglio sono in fase di trattativa la realizzazione di una zona 30 (con limite di velocità a 30km/ora sugli assi di attraversamento carrabile del Campus di Milano), il collegamento ciclo-pedonale con l'area verde del parco nord, la predisposizione di una segnaletica di orientamento, il miglioramento della sicurezza degli spazi pubblici, l'implementazione di piste ciclabili, l'adeguamento delle barriere architettoniche del quartiere e della stazione ferroviaria di Milano Greco Pirelli;
realizzazione di cinque velostazioni nel campus di Milano-Bicocca, per un totale di oltre 500 posti che permetteranno il ricovero sicuro e protetto delle biciclette. Le prime velostazioni (200 posti circa) saranno operative già a partire dall'anno corrente;
posizionamento di stazioni di ricarica elettrica per auto e mobilità leggera a disposizione della comunità accademica: un primo studio di fattibilità ha permesso di individuare le collocazioni potenzialmente idonee per quattro infrastrutture di ricarica veicoli complete di proprio punto di fornitura per un totale di 24 postazioni (wall-box/colonnine), sono in fase di studio le modalità di finanziamento attraverso bandi;
promozione ed educazione alla mobilità ciclistica grazie all'istituzione, con base la ciclo-officina, del gruppo ACS-CICLOESCURSIONISMO e ACS-CICLOTURISMO, e l'apertura di una serie di corsi di introduzione alla riparazione e all'utilizzo della bicicletta in sicurezza aperti a tutta la cittadinanza.

# Le Nature-Based Solutions e le infrastrutture verdi di Ateneo. Il Centro Nazionale per la Biodiversità (NBFC) e gli ulteriori progetti di ricerca applicata nell'ambito della sostenibilità

Le Nature-Based Solutions, ossia interventi che utilizzano e integrano processi ed elementi naturali per affrontare sfide ambientali, caratterizzano l'approccio che l'Ateneo applica nella manutenzione, gestione e ampliamento del proprio asset di infrastrutture verdi. Nel dettaglio, a seguire:

A. Con la convenzione per la gestione dello spazio comunale del VIVAIO BICOCCA (Via R. Cozzi, 18) si è riusciti a concretizzare un progetto ampio di riqualificazione dell'area con la creazione di ambienti e spazi destinati all'aumento e fioritura della biodiversità tra insetti e piante e attraverso la sperimentazione applicata poter realizzare azioni didattiche, attività divulgative e progetti di partecipazione scientifica, disseminando conoscenze di riqualificazione urbana, transizione ecologica e tutela delle risorse naturali alla cittadinanza e agli studenti di ogni grado in più di 50 eventi di sensibilizzazione avviati dal 2022.

Il Vivaio Bicocca è stato inserito in due importanti progetti, quali:

"MUSA: Multilayered Urban Sustainability Action" a valere sul Piano Nazionale per la Ripresa e la Resilienza (PNRR)¹⁵, dedicato alla riprogettazione delle città e allo sviluppo di soluzioni intelligenti di energia rinnovabile, di sistemi di gestione del territorio, di rifiuti e di nuovi modelli di mobilità;
"NBFC - National Biodiversity Future Center" per il Potenziamento di strutture di ricerca e creazione di "campioni nazionali" di R&amp;S da finanziare nell'ambito del PNRR¹⁶. Il Centro Nazionale per la Biodiversità svolge attività di ricerca e promuove lo sviluppo di soluzioni per monitorare, preservare e ripristinare la biodiversità funzionale, attraverso processi di economia circolare e di restoration economy, sostiene lo

¹⁵ Missione 4, Componente 2 Investimento 1.4, finanziato dall'Unione Europea – NextGenerationEU
¹⁶ Missione 4, Componente 2 Investimento 1.4, "Potenziamento strutture di ricerca e creazione di "campioni nazionali di R&amp;S" su alcune Key Enabling Technologies" finanziato dall'Unione Europea – NextGenerationEU
sviluppo di biobanche, favorendo la creazione e l'aggregazione di aree protette e di infrastrutture verdi e individuando soluzioni tecnologiche e gestionali capaci di generare valore ambientale, sociale ed economico. Presso il Vivaio Bicocca verrà avviata la sperimentazione in ambienti controllati di ricerca attrezzati per coltivazione dove verranno approfonditi i temi di progetto (Spoke 5 e Spoke 6).

A tal riguardo il Vivaio ospiterà in modo permanente una nuova infrastruttura costituita da un sistema di serre ed aule didattiche ad uso sperimentale per la ricerca di nuove condizioni ambientali e per la crescita di piante in ambiente urbano. All'interno del progetto “BEES &amp; BERRIES: Do pollinator insects enhance fruit nutritional and nutraceutical value?”¹⁷ verrà realizzato un laboratorio su campo, negli spazi esterni di UNIMIB e la sperimentazione in circa 30 mq di serra, posizionata negli spazi del Vivaio Bicocca, per la valutazione delle condizioni reali urbane di coltivazione con focus sull'impollinazione degli insetti nel contesto della produzione alimentare, come elemento chiave per aumentare la produzione e la qualità di frutti carichi di antiossidanti e composti antinfiammatori. Utilizzando approcci che coinvolgono il monitoraggio della biodiversità degli insetti, analisi chimiche e statistiche, il progetto condurrà esperimenti sia in serra che in giardini urbani, allo scopo di mimare in un laboratorio operativo le condizioni reali.

B. Nei Giardini delle betulle presso l'edificio U7 (via Bicocca degli Arcimboldi n. 8), è stato realizzato un luogo verde rigenerato per la promozione di biodiversità e soprattutto all'insegna di una sperimentazione per la manutenzione del verde controllata e rispettosa delle specie: scelte oculate in termini di specie vegetali e di tecniche manutentive permettono un ridottissimo quantitativo di manutenzione, promuovendo un ricco manto erbaceo che trattiene umidità nei mesi più caldi, aiutando le piante a essere rigoglioso anche nei periodi più caldi. Queste scelte sono state comunicate agli studenti e ai visitatori con apposita cartellonistica per diffondere la consapevolezza e l'esistenza delle soluzioni basate sulla natura nonché abituare le persone ad un verde differente, più lontano dal concetto di “deserto verde” privo di biodiversità ma vicino ad una rigogliosa aiuola ricca di vita.

C. Bosco urbano in U10. L'intervento di Riqualificazione prevede la realizzazione di tre aree verdi per complessivi 19.500 mq che si aggiungono agli attuali 26.680 mq di superficie a verde gestita dall'Ateneo in Comune di Milano. Il progetto prevede:

Un'area di rievocazione della foresta planiziale lombarda con alberi anche di notevoli dimensioni, ricca di specie arbustive e di sottobosco. Un vero e proprio ricostruzione di un bosco naturale che supporterà i servizi ecosistemici e consentirà ai cittadini di vivere la biodiversità nel contesto urbano della città;
Una seconda area sarà dedicata a vivere e conoscere la biodiversità e sarà caratterizzata da alberi, piante da frutto, erbe aromatiche, da specie erbacee e arbustive con fioriture consequenziali e capaci di colorare e profumare il giardino. Spazi condivisi, zone studio e piccoli spazi didattici sorgeranno in mezzo a questa grande macchia di biodiversità consentendo a cittadini e studenti di vivere a pieno l'area.
Una zona, infine, sarà caratterizzata dal giardino degli impollinatori, con tante piante a fiore ma anche con spazi dove insetti di vario tipo potranno trovare riparo.

D. Con l'intento di perseguire consapevolezza e aumento della biodiversità, gli insediamenti universitari e residenziali nuovi o in via di ristrutturazione saranno accompagnati dalla riqualificazione del verde pertinenziale (come la riqualificazione del verde della residenza di U42 per complessivi 3.262 mq) secondo le seguenti direttive proprie anche del nuovo appalto della manutenzione del verde (dal 2025) con lo scopo di favorire:

scelte di specie vegetali in linea con le nuove condizioni climatiche (soprattutto estive) volte a una riduzione dell'uso di acqua, con benefici ambientali ed economici
monitoraggio dei consumi idrici con il posizionamento di sensori di pioggia e contabilizzatori di consumo d'acqua, nonché implementazione di sistemi di recupero dell'acqua piovana, allo scopo di monitorare e diminuire nel tempo l'uso di fonti idriche
trovare soluzioni che avvicinano un numero sempre maggiore di aree ad un basso numero di interventi di manutenzione, al fine di trovare un equilibrio tra gradevolezza estetica e aumento della biodiversità e resilienza degli ecosistemi
implementare Nature Based Solutions nel rispetto dei CAM e delle indicazioni attualmente in atto a livello di regolamentazione del verde del Comune di Milano.

# Progetto TECLA (TErra CLima e Ambiente)

Il Progetto TECLA (TErra CLima e Ambiente) è l'integrazione di concetti e metodi classici della geologia con le più avanzate tecniche di monitoraggio e modellizzazione per comprendere a fondo l'evoluzione del clima e individuare rimedi concreti. Nel dettaglio gli obiettivi di sviluppo si concentrano special modo sul monitoraggio degli effetti del riscaldamento climatico e valutazione dei rischi geoambientali connessi e lo studio di tecniche per la riduzione dei gas serra e per lo sfruttamento del potenziale geotermico in collaborazione con ENI ed ENEL Green Power (sul progetto carbon capture).

Il progetto prevede la realizzazione di laboratori pilota che consentiranno il monitoraggio geoambientale integrato e in continuo in ambienti montani d'alta quota (Mountain lab) e urbani (Urban lab). Quest'ultimo si svilupperà nell'area di Milano con una rete di monitoraggio delle caratteristiche fisico-chimiche e biologiche delle acque e misure di temperatura e flusso in pozzo, creando un database open access. Il centro MaRHE di Bicocca (Maldive) fungerà da laboratorio pilota per il monitoraggio ambientale e il ripristino degli ecosistemi marini.

Questo approccio integrato per lo studio del clima consentirà di mettere a disposizione della comunità informazioni utili come banche dati, modelli matematici e analisi statistiche per:

migliorare la comprensione dei processi geologici che controllano l'evoluzione del clima;
suggerire soluzioni per la mitigazione del riscaldamento globale e per uno sfruttamento intelligente e sostenibile delle risorse idriche ed energetiche.

Il progetto è finanziato per 8.675.000 euro (IVA esclusa) con fondi MUR

# Economia circolare e rifiuti

Il sistema di gestione dei rifiuti urbani all'interno dell'Ateneo è stato organizzato con isole per la raccolta differenziata di carta e cartone, plastica e metallo, vetro e il rimanente residuo secco. Le isole di raccolta sono state collocate negli spazi comuni (comprese le aree esterne) attrezzati con contenitori modulari e con cartellonistica informativa sulle disposizioni comunali specifiche per il Campus di Milano e il Campus Biomedico di Monza, Vedano, Sondrio e Bergamo. Nelle residenze universitarie di Milano, Cinisello e Faedo il sistema di postazioni modulari include la raccolta della frazione organica domestica. In tutte le procedure di approvvigionamento è previsto l'acquisto di prodotti certificati Ecolabel, Blauer Engel, Nordic Swan o TCO, con specifiche tecniche (imballaggi disassemblabili e riciclabili) anche sul packaging di fornitura dei beni. Nei capitolati di acquisto di beni e servizi e per la nuova realizzazione/ristrutturazione degli edifici sono applicati i Criteri Ambientali Minimi (CAM) del Piano d'azione per la sostenibilità ambientale dei consumi della pubblica amministrazione (PAN GPP). È stata rivista l'organizzazione del sistema di raccolta dei rifiuti speciali, con l'individuazione di un esperto qualificato (waste specialist) a supporto dei servizi dipartimentali e d'area per la raccolta di RAEE, batterie, toner, rifiuti chimici, rifiuti biologici e radioattivi.

Le politiche di sviluppo di Ateneo per il miglioramento dei processi di differenziazione dei rifiuti e di applicazione dei principi di economia circolare prevedono:

lo sviluppo di un metodo di rendicontazione della raccolta differenziata suddiviso per sede e per frazione;
l'estensione della raccolta differenziata della frazione organica;
l'istituzione di un "portale del riuso" analogamente a quanto fatto da altre realtà universitarie: un luogo dove i gruppi di ricerca possono segnalare la disponibilità di apparecchiature, arredi o altro che non utilizzano più, per essere rimesse in circolo;
la collaborazione con enti no-profit per la cessione a titolo gratuito di beni dismessi (PC, monitor, arredi) che, in questo modo non diventano rifiuti;
l'introduzione di modifiche logistiche e tecniche come l'installazione di asciugamani elettrici nei bagni e/o di asciugamani a rullo in tessuto lavabile e l'installazione di frangiflusso sui rubinetti dei servizi, la previsione della funzione escludi-bicchiere nei distributori automatici di bevande, il settaggio della modalità di stampa automatica fronte e retro e l'acquisto di carta riciclata;
l'incentivazione all'acquisto di prodotti certificati (certificate con Ecolabel, Blauer Engel, Nordic Swan o TCO) e all'uso di imballaggi disassemblabili e riciclabili e con contenuto di materie riciclate, introdotti con la generalità delle forniture di beni attraverso la previsione laddove possibile di specifiche sugli imballaggi (packaging) nei capitolati/schede tecniche di acquisto di beni, come estensione in adesione volontaria ai CAM (Criteri Ambientali Minimi) del PAN GPP (Piano d'azione per la sostenibilità ambientale dei consumi della pubblica amministrazione);
l'organizzazione di campagne di comunicazione mirate anche in adesione ad iniziative esistenti (es. SERR - settimana europea per la riduzione dei rifiuti).

SISTEMI ENERGETICI
• Installazione di una stazione esterna (SOLAR LAB) per approfondire le prestazioni del
fotovoltaico in condizioni urbane reali (ambiente operativo, tetti, ambiente con
ombra), in collaborazione con EDISON. Con contestuale modellizzazione di business
per calare in ambiente operativo lo sfruttamento del fotovoltaico.
• Il laboratorio congiunto Joint lab UNIMIB-ENI studierà la definizione di metodi per la
conversione di anidride carbonica a metanolo, con sottoprodotto acqua, con la
sperimentazione e il testing di catalizzatori. Queste metodiche permettono di
convertire la CO2 in materie di pregio e uso industriale.
• Energia Geotermica, dati e sfruttamento a Milano. Allo scopo di popolare con dati il
modello digitale a supporto dell'uso della geotermia, è stata instaurata una
collaborazione tra enti universitari e del territorio per la quantificazione del flusso di
calore antropico in modelli numerici, consentendo di ricostruire la distribuzione
energetica del sottosuolo. L'obiettivo è quello di fornire uno strumento predittivo per
una gestione sostenibile e organizzata del giacimento, assicurando la massima
efficienza degli impianti e la ricarica naturale del sistema.
ECONOMIA CIRCOLARE E RIFIUTI
• Nell'ottica del potenziamento delle capacità gestionale del rifiuto, allo scopo di dare
nuovo valore allo scarto in ottica di economia circolare saranno testati metodi e
processi in grado di aiutare la gestione dei rifiuti urbani della città di Milano. Prime
sperimentazioni hanno permesso di valorizzare queste biomasse nella produzione di
tessuti di similipelle derivanti da scarti organici.
INFRASTRUTTURE VERDI E NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS
• Sensori e strumenti analitici sono stati messi a regime in ambiente operativo (living
labs), allo scopo di monitorare le scelte, l'intervento e le soluzioni verso la sostenibilità
adottate nei progetti di ricerca applicata del Dipartimento di Eccellenza DISAT e nei
lavori di deimpermeabilizzazione della Piazza della Scienza (presso il Campus di
Milano). Il monitoraggio pre e post lavori consentirà di comprendere se le soluzioni  |

|   |  | adottate in campo di riduzione dell'isola di calore, aumento e qualità della biodiversità, aumento delle interazioni tra piante e animali (tramite videocamere per insetti, sensori di acustica, sensoristica) siano state efficaci a migliorare vivibilità e qualità della Piazza, avvicinandosi ad una rigenerazione urbana più cosciente della sostenibilità.
MOBILITÀ SICURA, SMART E INCLUSIVA
• il progetto ha lo scopo di sviluppare e migliorare la mobilità sostenibile, attiva e micro a livello di quartiere attraverso interventi di ricerca, educativi, tecnologici e infrastrutturali, fornendo al contempo nuove opportunità di sviluppo socio-economico e territoriale. La prima fase del progetto vede la rilevazione dei flussi di traffico veicolare e di persone sia al livello di quartiere sia negli edifici universitari tramite il posizionamento di sensori in punti strategici dell'area oggetto di studio  |

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi, laddove disponibili, utili a dare un quadro di dettaglio sulle progettualità presentate.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime–seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

## PARTE A - Sezione A.1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets, uffici direzionali, "third-party asset and property management services", che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030

Elettrificazione della generazione energetica: si prevede la realizzazione di un sistema termico con pompe di calore per il riscaldamento, il raffrescamento e la produzione di acqua calda sanitaria. Si prediligerà l'implementazione di un sistema termico con pompe di calore polivalenti ad aria o ad acqua che utilizzano acqua di falda prelevata tramite pozzi di presa e restituita tramite pozzi di resa e tramite scarico in ricettori locali, quali per esempio il Cavo Annoni Melzi (ulteriori analisi saranno necessarie per confermarne la capacità e la possibilità ricettiva). Questa soluzione che sfrutta l'acqua di falda potrà essere integrata con sistemi ad aria qualora si rendesse necessario coprire i picchi termici estivi e/o qualora ci fossero delle limitazioni nella capacità di emungimento dei pozzi o nella capacità ricettiva dei canali per lo scarico di acqua di falda. Tale approccio evita il ricorso a fonti fossili. Il progetto prevede anche l'integrazione di fonti rinnovabili attraverso l'installazione di impianti fotovoltaici integrati nel design degli edifici consentendo il raggiungimento della neutralità carbonica anche attraverso l'acquisto della rimanente energia elettrica da fonte rinnovabile (acquisto energia verde, PPA, etc.)

Strategia energetica a livello edificio fondata sulla massimizzazione dell'efficienza dell'involucro e degli impianti e l'installazione di pannelli fotovoltaici integrati agli edifici.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea “100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030”, il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi, laddove disponibili, utili a dare un quadro di dettaglio sulle progettualità presentate.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime–seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

# PARTE A - Sezione A.1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets, uffici direzionali, "third-party asset and property management services", che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030.

Nel 2018, miravamo a una riduzione delle nostre emissioni di gas serra del -34% tra il 2010 e il 2030. Un obiettivo in linea con quello dei 2°C dell'Accordo di Parigi. Nel 2021, abbiamo aggiornato la nostra traiettoria, constatando di essere in anticipo sui nostri obiettivi, e oggi siamo fiduciosi di poter raggiungere -40% delle nostre emissioni complessive entro il 2030 (passando da 78 kgCO2/m³ nel 2010 a circa 48 kgCO2/m³ nel 2030) con:

Obiettivo di neutralità carbonica entro il 2030 su scope 1 e 2, allineato su una traiettoria di 1,5°C, consistente in una riduzione delle emissioni assolute del 63% tra il 2015 e il 2030 e la compensazione sulle emissioni residue.
Allineamento sulla traiettoria 'Ben al di sotto dei 2°C' (tra 1,5 e 2°C) sullo scope 3.

I nostri obiettivi sono stati validati da SBTi, al momento non è prevista una ulteriore revisione ma in accordo con le raccomandazioni di SBTi procederemo alla verifica che gli obiettivi siano ancora validi entro 5 anni.

Le nostre leve che ci permetteranno di ridurre le nostre emissioni Scope 1 e 2 sono:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Relativamente allo Scope 3:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Abbiamo poco controllo sull'evoluzione del mix energetico del paese (che non dipende da noi ma dal paese in cui operiamo e dal tasso di decarbonizzazione dell'energia attraverso l'uso di energie rinnovabili), anche se possiamo favorire soluzioni green, ad esempio, reti di riscaldamento nei nostri progetti. Per quanto riguarda le altre leve:

Costruire a bassa emissione di carbonio = 29%, utilizzando materiali a bassa emissione di carbonio, questa prestazione verrà garantita dalla nuova certificazione Low Carbon Building Initiative (LCBI) di minimo il 50% dei nuovi sviluppi.
Misure di efficienza energetica = 56%, continuando il nostro ambizioso piano strategico (€254M tra il 2023 e il 2030), lavorando con gli inquilini per ridurre il consumo energetico degli edifici (compresi i locali privati che non gestiamo): isolamento, attrezzature, pannelli solari, impianto di riscaldamento e condizionamento dell'aria, illuminazione a LED.
Elettricità verde = 15%, utilizzando contratti di fornitura di energia rinnovabile. Covivio ha un contratto quadro con IREN per la fornitura di energia rinnovabile per il 100% dei suoi asset terziari gestiti direttamente (aree comuni degli edifici a più inquilini + sedi centrali).

Covivio ha conciliato gli scenari CRREM con i dati storici sulle emissioni di gas serra già pubblicati ogni anno e con i dati calcolati per il 2030 come parte della sua traiettoria di carbonio. Ciò ha permesso di convalidare la coerenza degli obiettivi di riduzione delle emissioni di gas serra sul suo portafoglio, che sono al di sotto dei livelli dei 'punti critici' identificati da CRREM. Gli scenari utilizzati sono quelli pubblicati da CRREM l'11 gennaio 2023 e sono a un livello più ambizioso rispetto ai precedenti.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modellidi intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi, laddove disponibili, utili a dare un quadro di dettaglio sulle progettualità presentate.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime-seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

***

Nel gruppo Lendlease, la sostenibilità riveste un ruolo fondamentale. Questo si riflette nella definizione della strategia aziendale e si manifesta nei risultati ottenuti in termini di prestazioni ambientali, sociali ed economiche, che vengono riportati nelle relazioni annuali agli azionisti. Gli obiettivi di sostenibilità sono alla base dell'identificazione, valutazione e selezione dei progetti e degli investimenti, nonché nelle fasi successive di gestione. Questi obiettivi sono guidati da una solida strategia di sostenibilità, inquadrata nel "Sustainability framework" che è in linea con gli Obiettivi di Sviluppo Sostenibile delle Nazioni Unite.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Questo framework riflette tre imperativi di sostenibilità: (i) crescita economica sostenibile; (ii) comunità e città vivibili e resilienti; (iii) popolazione e pianeta più sani. Inoltre, il sustainability framework serve da guida per il raggiungimento degli obiettivi ambientali e sociali, incluso l'allineamento al target sottoscritto di riduzione del carbonio di 1,5°C, ovvero raggiungere il net zero entro il 2025 per le emissioni di scopo 1 e 2, e l'absolute zero entro il 2040 per le emissioni di scopo 3. Il target di creazione di valore è pari a 250 milioni di AUSD in aggiunta agli obblighi eventuali di concessione.

Per raggiungere tali obiettivi, Lendlease introduce misure di controllo in tutte le fasi del processo: progettazione, produzione dei materiali, costruzione, uso, dismissione e riutilizzo. Queste misure includono l'adozione di un "carbon budget" e l'implementazione di strategie energetiche alimentate al 100% da fonti rinnovabili, nonché l'adesione a iniziative come ConcreteZero, Steelzero e Accelerating Timber Construction. Un altro elemento chiave nella decarbonizzazione è la partecipazione attiva a iniziative promosse dalle associazioni di settore, come la campagna "building life" del Green Building Council Italia, che ha portato alla stesura di una roadmap nazionale di decarbonizzazione multi-settore in concerto con altre iniziative europee.

Un importante strumento per monitorare i progressi compiuti sono le valutazioni di terze parti attraverso l'uso di rating energetico-ambientali internazionali, e in linea con la Taxonomia UE, la divulgazione di report non finanziari e la finanza sostenibile (NFRD e SFDR). Il 100% degli asset è certificato con un rating LEED di almeno livello "Gold" e il 100% dei fondi è certificato GRESB di livello minimo 5 stelle.

Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti identificati (ad esempio stock edificato, sistemi energetici, infrastrutture per la mobilità). | Il nuovo Campus scientifico dell’Università Statale di Milano oltre a prevedere numerosi spazi verdi di differente tipo di vegetazione, è stato progettato per essere misurato con la più alta certificazione energetico-ambientale internazionale LEED Gold, mettendo al centro la priorità di rispettare elevaticriteri di sostenibilità e rispondere ai rischi del cambiamento climatico.

Il Campus sarà alimentato solo da energia elettrica (no combustili fossili) che alimenterà pompe di calore ad aria, ad acqua e polivalenti.

L’energia utilizzata dal campus proverrà sia da fonti rinnovabili prodotte in loco (es fotovoltaico, acqua di falda) sia da forniture elettriche acquistate da rete esterna prodotta da fonti rinnovabili con certificati d’Origine.

L’edificio si posiziona all’interno del progetto MIND, il quale gode di un ottimo collegamento, sia per mezzi di trasporto pubblici (treni, metro) che per i mezzi privati, in quanto all’interno del principale sistema infrastrutturale regionale.  |

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi, laddove disponibili, utili a dare un quadro di dettaglio sulle progettualità presentate.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime–seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

***

Nel gruppo Lendlease, la sostenibilità riveste un ruolo fondamentale. Questo si riflette nella definizione della strategia aziendale e si manifesta nei risultati ottenuti in termini di prestazioni ambientali, sociali ed economiche, che vengono riportati nelle relazioni annuali agli azionisti. Gli obiettivi di sostenibilità sono alla base dell'identificazione, valutazione e selezione dei progetti e degli investimenti, nonché nelle fasi successive di gestione. Questi obiettivi sono guidati da una solida strategia di sostenibilità, inquadrata nel "Sustainability framework" che è in linea con gli Obiettivi di Sviluppo Sostenibile delle Nazioni Unite.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Questo framework riflette tre imperativi di sostenibilità: (i) crescita economica sostenibile; (ii) comunità e città vivibili e resilienti; (iii) popolazione e pianeta più sani. Inoltre, il sustainability framework serve da guida per il raggiungimento degli obiettivi ambientali e sociali, incluso l'allineamento al target sottoscritto di riduzione del carbonio di 1,5°C, ovvero raggiungere il net zero entro il 2025 per le emissioni di scopo 1 e 2, e l'absolute zero entro il 2040 per le emissioni di scopo 3. Il target di creazione di valore è pari a 250 milioni di AUSD in aggiunta agli obblighi eventuali di concessione.

Per raggiungere tali obiettivi, Lendlease introduce misure di controllo in tutte le fasi del processo: progettazione, produzione dei materiali, costruzione, uso, dismissione e riutilizzo. Queste misure includono l'adozione di un "carbon budget" e l'implementazione di strategie energetiche alimentate al 100% da fonti rinnovabili, nonché l'adesione a iniziative come ConcreteZero, Steelzero e Accelerating Timber Construction. Un altro elemento chiave nella decarbonizzazione è la partecipazione attiva a iniziative promosse dalle associazioni di settore, come la campagna "building life" del Green Building Council Italia, che ha portato alla stesura di una roadmap nazionale di decarbonizzazione multi-settore in concerto con altre iniziative europee.

Un importante strumento per monitorare i progressi compiuti sono le valutazioni di terze parti attraverso l'uso di rating energetico-ambientali internazionali, e in linea con la Taxonomia UE, la divulgazione di report non finanziari e la finanza sostenibile (NFRD e SFDR). Il 100% degli asset è certificato con un rating LEED di almeno livello "Gold" e il 100% dei fondi è certificato GRESB di livello minimo 5 stelle.

## PARTE A - Sezione A.2: Progetti urbani e interventi relativi a propri asset

Si richiede di compilare la “Scheda raccolta azioni” (suddivisa in 3 parti) duplicandola per ciascun progetto che si desidera illustrare, compatibilmente con la disponibilità di dati e l'avanzamento dei progetti.

|  Descrizione dell’azione/progetto/intervento
Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti identificati (ad esempio stock edificato, sistemi energetici, infrastrutture per la mobilità). | Edificio di nuova costruzione ad uso uffici all’interno dell’area di West Gate, nel quadrante ovest di MIND, è pensato con i più moderni standard qualitativi, di efficienza energetica (classe A+) e sostenibilità a livello di edificio (certificazioni LEED BD+C, EU Taxonomy) e quartiere (LEED for Communities).

L’energia utilizzata dall’edificio è in linea con la strategia di decarbonizzazione di Lendlease e proverrà al 100% da fonti rinnovabili prodotte in loco (fotovoltaico, acqua di canale e pozzi geotermici) sia da forniture elettriche della rete esterna con certificazione di produzione tramite fonti rinnovabili (Certificati d’Origine). Il sistema di gestione digitale ectogrid™ di E.ON consentirà inoltre il recupero e il riutilizzo efficiente dell’energia di scarto fra le diverse utenze.

Dal punto di vista delle emissioni di scopo 3, l’edificio adotta diverse iniziative quali l’implementazione di un carbon budget, obiettivi di economia circolare e un approccio innovativo che utilizza il DfMA – Design for Manufacture and Assembly.

Ulteriore priorità del progetto MIND è la resilienza ai cambiamenti climatici, ovvero la capacità del luogo e degli edifici che ne fanno parte di adattarsi alle condizioni climatiche nel tempo (RCP 8.5 @2090). Tale capacità è stata sviluppata tramite l’adozione di strategie passive e/o tecnologiche che mitigano i rischi climatici identificati (urban flood e heatwaves) dal climate change impact assessment.

L’edificio si posiziona all’interno del progetto MIND, il quale  |

La temperatura del fluido all'interno della rete varia a seconda della stagione e del livello di fabbisogno energetico dei vari edifici ad essa collegati. La bassa temperatura della rete Ectogrid™ consente di ridurre le perdite di calore di rete e di ottenere, in alcune condizioni operative, dei contributi energetici positivi dal terreno (es. terreno a temperatura più alta della rete fredda nelle condizioni invernali piuttosto che a temperatura più bassa del ramo caldo nella stagione estiva). |  |  |   |

Quando gli edifici collegati alla rete Ectogrid™ richiedono complessivamente e integrazione o dissipazione di energia, l'energy centre provvede, rispettivamente, a immettere o dissipare quanto richiesto attraverso le apparecchiature installate e le fonti di energia primaria di cui dispone (acqua di falda, acqua di canale, aria, energia elettrica, ecc.).

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea “100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030”, il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette “molecole”) interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo “Piano di azione”.

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi, laddove disponibili, utili a dare un quadro di dettaglio sulle progettualità presentate.

Nel gruppo Lendlease, la sostenibilità riveste un ruolo fondamentale. Questo si riflette nella definizione della strategia aziendale e si manifesta nei risultati ottenuti in termini di prestazioni ambientali, sociali ed economiche, che vengono riportati nelle relazioni annuali agli azionisti. Gli obiettivi di sostenibilità sono alla base dell'identificazione, valutazione e selezione dei progetti e degli investimenti, nonché nelle fasi successive di gestione. Questi obiettivi sono guidati da una solida strategia di sostenibilità, inquadrata nel "Sustainability framework" che è in linea con gli Obiettivi di Sviluppo Sostenibile delle Nazioni Unite.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Questo framework riflette tre imperativi di sostenibilità: (i) crescita economica sostenibile; (ii) comunità e città vivibili e resilienti; (iii) popolazione e pianeta più sani. Inoltre, il sustainability framework serve da guida per il raggiungimento degli obiettivi ambientali e sociali, incluso l'allineamento al target sottoscrittodi riduzione del carbonio di 1,5° C, ovvero raggiungere il net zero entro il 2025 per le emissioni di scopo 1 e 2, e l'absolute zero entro il 2040 per le emissioni di scopo 3. Il target di creazione di valore è pari a250 milioni di AUSD in aggiunta agli obblighi eventuali di concessione.

Per raggiungere tali obiettivi, Lendlease introduce misure di controllo in tutte le fasi del processo: progettazione, produzione dei materiali, costruzione, uso, dismissione e riutilizzo. Queste misure includono l'adozione di un "carbon budget" e l'implementazione di strategie energetiche alimentate al 100% da fonti rinnovabili, nonché l'adesione a iniziative come ConcreteZero, Steelzero e Accelerating Timber Construction. Un altro elemento chiave nella decarbonizzazione è la partecipazione attiva a iniziative promosse dalle associazioni di settore, come la campagna "building life" del Green Building Council Italia, che ha portato alla stesura di una roadmap nazionale di decarbonizzazione multi-settore inconcerto con altre iniziative europee.

Un importante strumento per monitorare i progressi compiuti sono le valutazioni di terze parti attraverso l'uso di rating energetico-ambientali internazionali, e in linea con la Taxonomia UE, la divulgazione di report non finanziari e la finanza sostenibile (NFRD e SFDR). Il 100% degli asset è certificato con un rating LEED di almeno livello "Gold" e il 100% dei fondi è certificato GRESB di livello minimo 5 stelle.

dell’azione/progetto/intervento
Fornire una descrizione generale del
progetto relativamente agli ambiti
identificati (ad esempio stock
edificato, sistemi energetici,
infrastrutture per la mobilità). | Edificio di nuova costruzione ad uso residenziale ha come obiettivo
quello di connettere gli elementi esistenti del tessuto urbano, e attivare
nuove possibilità di attraversamento creando continuità fisica e
prospettica tra l’area della futura sede del conservatorio G. Verdi, il
parco esistente dell’Alberello a nord, il parco trapezio, la nuova piazza
Tina Modotti e la stazione di Rogoredo. Spark Living èpensato con i più
moderni standard qualitativi, di efficienza energetica (classe minimo A3)
e sostenibilità a livello di edificio (certificazioni LEED BD+C, EU
Taxonomy) e quartiere(LEED for Communities).

L’energia utilizzata dall’edificio è in linea con la strategia di
decarbonizzazione di Lendlease e proverrà al 100% da fontirinnovabili
sia prodotte in loco (fotovoltaico e pozzi geotermici) sia da forniture
elettriche della rete esterna concertificazione di produzione tramite
fonti rinnovabili (Certificati d’Origine).

Dal punto di vista delle emissioni di scopo 3, l’edificio adottadiverse
iniziative quali l’implementazione di un carbon budget, obiettivi di
economia circolare.

Ulteriore priorità del progetto MSG è la resilienza ai cambiamenti
climatici, ovvero la capacità del luogo e degli edifici che ne fanno parte di
adattarsi alle condizioni climatiche nel tempo (RCP 8.5 @2090). Tale
capacità è statasviluppata tramite l’adozione di strategie passive e/o
tecnologiche che mitigano i rischi climatici identificati dal climate change
impact assessment come le ondate di calore
e le bombe d’acqua.  |

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi, laddove disponibili, utili a dare un quadro di dettaglio sulle progettualità presentate.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime–seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

|  Descrizione dell’azione/progetto/intervento
Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti identificati (ad esempio stock edificato, sistemi energetici, infrastrutture per la mobilità). | Edificio di nuova costruzione ad uso uffici all’interno dell’area di West Gate, nel quadrante ovest di MIND, è pensato con i più moderni standard qualitativi, di efficienza energetica (classe A+) e sostenibilità a livello di edificio (certificazioni LEED BD+C, EU Taxonomy) e quartiere (LEED for Communities).

L’energia utilizzata dall’edificio è in linea con la strategia di decarbonizzazione di Lendlease e proverrà al 100% da fonti rinnovabili prodotte in loco (fotovoltaico, acqua di canale e pozzi geotermici) sia da forniture elettriche della rete esterna con certificazione di produzione tramite fonti rinnovabili (Certificati d’Origine). Il sistema di gestione digitale ectogrid™ di E.ON consentirà inoltre il recupero e il riutilizzo efficiente dell’energia di scarto fra le diverse utenze.

Dal punto di vista delle emissioni di scopo 3, l’edificio adotta diverse iniziative quali l’implementazione di un carbon budget, obiettivi di economia circolare e un approccio innovativo che utilizza il DfMA – Design for Manufacture and Assembly.

Ulteriore priorità del progetto MIND è la resilienza ai cambiamenti climatici, ovvero la capacità del luogo e degli edifici che ne fanno parte di adattarsi alle condizioni climatiche nel tempo (RCP 8.5 @2090). Tale capacità è stata sviluppata tramite l’adozione di strategie passive e/o tecnologiche che mitigano i rischi climatici identificati (urban flood e heatwaves) dal climate change impact assessment.

L’edificio si posiziona all’interno del masterplan MIND, che  |

MIND è il riferimento per chi fa innovazione in termini di qualità, scambio di saperi, connessione internazionale. A rendere unico l'ecosistema non sono soltanto le dimensioni, ma la presenza di grandi eccellenze nelle Life Sciences e un ambiente di profonda integrazione, negli spazi fisici e nelle attività, pensato per moltiplicare opportunità e relazioni.

Nel suo ruolo di hub e catalizzatore di sviluppo, MIND ha riunione da subito protagonisti scientifici e tecnologici con origini e finalità diverse, legati tutti dall'interesse per il progresso, la sperimentazione, le nuove prospettive per un avanzamento della società.

Esempio di stakeholder coinvolti sono:

Arexpo, quale responsabile delle iniziative istituzionali promosse dal distretto, centri di ricerca e dipartimenti R&D, grandi società e startup. Tutte le realtà insediate trovano forza e dinamismo nelle opportunità di sinergia e nella presenza di eccellenze di interesse pubblico nelle Life Science: l'istituto Human Technopole, il polo della salute IRCCS Galeazzi, che insieme a Fondazione Triulza e al Campus scientifico dell'Università di Milano formano il nucleo originario dell'ecosistema.  |

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi, laddove disponibili, utili a dare un quadro di dettaglio sulle progettualità presentate.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime–seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

## PARTE A - Sezione A.1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets, uffici direzionali, "third-party asset and property management services", che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030

In linea generale Nhood Italia applica le seguenti strategie per la decarbonizzazione:

Carbon footprint: valutazione completa del ciclo di vita del carbonio (Life Cycle Assessment LCA) fin dalle prime fasi della progettazione (strategia net zero o carbon neutral);
Biodiversity and Deartificialization: analisi della biodiversità/calcolo del valore ecologico e attenzione al tema del deartificialization (deartificializzazione) in fase di progettazione;
Mobility: valutazione della mobilità e un piano di spostamento;
Materiale e costruzione: selezione di materiali certificati dall'alto contenuto di riciclato o di tecnologie costruttive che favoriscano il recupero selettivo a fine vita;
Climate Risk Assessment: analisi dell'esposizione ai rischi climatici e delle vulnerabilità con successiva creazione di piano di resilienza

Strategia progetto LOC:

Attraverso il l'intervento di rigenerazione urbana LOC – Loreto Open Community si sono attuate le seguenti strategie in linea con gli obiettivi di riduzione delle emissioni:

Adozione di tecnologie impiantistiche a basso consumo energetico, quali ad esempio il ricorso all'energia geotermica e solare, pompe di calore ad alta efficienza, VMC con recupero di calore e attuazione di free-cooling, ottimizzazione gestionale impiantistica con sistemi avanzati (BMS e IoT).
Impegno all'acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine per la quota parte di energia non prodotta da fonte rinnovabile in sito.
Scelta di pratiche di costruzione dal basso impatto ambientale sul ciclo di vita, quali ad esempio la selezione di materiali certificati dall'alto contenuto di riciclato o di tecnologie costruttive che favoriscano il recupero selettivo a fine vita.
Promozione dell'uso di mezzi di trasporto sostenibili come biciclette, mezzi pubblici e veicoli elettrici (tramite la creazione di un accesso alla metropolitana attraverso una piazza ipogea, di nuove piste ciclabili,

3
nuovi stalli per bici private ed in sharing, l'installazione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica) e disincentivazione all'uso di auto private (assenza di offerta di parcheggi auto nell'intervento).

Creazione di spazi aperti urbani verdi di elevata qualità fruibili per i cittadini, anche sulle coperture degli edifici, capaci di influenzare positivamente il microclima locale e la biodiversità.
Contribuzione a progetti condivisi di forestazione urbana attraverso l'adesione a Forestami.
Impegno a ridurre sensibilmente la quantità di rifiuti indifferenziati durante le fasi di cantiere in ottica di circularità delle risorse.
Attenzione alla preservazione della risorsa idrica, grazie all'impiego di Nature Based Solutions e a sistemi di raccolta delle acque meteoriche a fini irrigui e idrico-sanitari. Gestione dei fenomeni metereologici intensi attraverso superfici drenanti e vasche di laminazione.
Coinvolgimento della comunità agli obiettivi del Progetto attraverso la creazione di uno spazio fisico di comunicazione quale LOC HUB 2026.

|   | Descrizione dell'azione/progetto/intervento
Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti identificati (ad esempio stock edificato, sistemi energetici, infrastrutture per la mobilità). | Il progetto LOC incorpora gli obiettivi di sviluppo sostenibile dell'Agenda 2030 attraverso strategie e azioni tangibili di rigenerazione urbana. LOC vuole ridurre l'entropia del sistema urbano, mirando alla circularità dei processi, dall'uso dei materiali sostenibili e riciclati/riciclabili, alla cantierizzazione diluita. LOC sposa quindi una visione olistica e integrata di masterplan, in grado di rispondere in modo resiliente all'intensificarsi di fenomeni, quali l'aumentare delle temperature e delle precipitazioni, attraverso soluzioni progettuali basate sulla natura. Integrando la natura come elemento fondante del progetto, il masterplan è anche servizio di supporto alla biodiversità urbana. La generazione di energia solare rinnovabile in sito plasma le forme del progetto, costruendo un nesso positivo con le nuove esigenze di mobilità elettrica. Creando nuovi spazi condivisi di qualità, l'intervento consente di rendere il quartiere più aperto e identitario. Il progetto LOC considera fin da subito gli impatti generati a lungo termine e contribuisce a originare nuovi modelli di urbanità ecologici.  |

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente). Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi, laddove disponibili, utili a dare un quadro di dettaglio sulle progettualità presentate.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili
in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.

Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime–seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

In qualità di Società benefit, Redo condivide e persegue, direttamente e nello svolgimento della propria attività, finalità di beneficio comune e di sviluppo sostenibile nel medio-lungo periodo (finalità di beneficio comune), bilanciandole all'obiettivo di massimizzazione degli utili, conformemente a quanto previsto nello statuto della Società.
Nel perseguire queste finalità Redo adotta un approccio mirato alla responsabilità sociale, ambientale e di governance, creando valore condiviso per tutti gli stakeholder: dipendenti, fornitori, investitori dei FIA, soci, conduttori degli asset gestiti, nonché per le comunità in cui questi sono inseriti.

Redo è il primo gestore di fondi immobiliari impegnato nella creazione di spazi abitativi che siano allo stesso tempo di qualità ed economicamente sostenibili per le persone: il nostro focus sono l'affordable housing, la rigenerazione urbana a impatto sociale e la promozione della tutela dell'ambiente e neutralità climatica.

Redo ha istituito la Funzione del Responsabile di Impatto e Sostenibilità che si occupa dell'integrazione degli obiettivi di sostenibilità attività delle altre strutture organizzative della SGR, alle quali assegna specifiche responsabilità, in linea con la Politica degli investimenti sostenibili. La Funzione del Responsabile di Impatto e Sostenibilità è dedicata alla piena considerazione dei rischi legati al clima e all'ambiente, attinge a competenze interne ed esterne e consiglia e assiste l'organo di gestione nella definizione, implementazione e monitoraggio della strategia ESG della Società e dei fondi gestiti. Redo ha adottato una Politica di remunerazione e incentivazione del personale della SGR che integra i rischi e le opportunità di sostenibilità per il raggiungimento delle performance sociali e ambientali: saper bilanciare gli interessi degli investitori con gli interessi degli stakeholder dipende dalla consapevolezza, dalla leadership e dalla motivazione delle persone, del team.

Lo statuto societario all'art. 4.9 (iii) prevede che tra le finalità di beneficio comune e di sviluppo sostenibile nel medio-lungo periodo, Redo minimizza "l'impatto negativo sulle risorse naturali, attuando un'evoluzione progressiva verso un'economia a zero emissioni di gas climalteranti, sia nella propria operatività sia nella realizzazione e gestione dei progetti immobiliari, in linea con gli obiettivi europei, nazionali e regionali di neutralità climatica e di transizione ecologica."

Redo aderisce a CO2alizione Italia¹ per sottolineare ancora una volta l'impegno verso un approccio attento all'ambiente e alla comunità. CO2alizione Italia riunisce più di 50 importanti aziende italiane, che, come Redo, hanno deciso di impegnarsi formalmente nella esplicita integrazione della finalità di neutralità climatica nel loro Statuto. In questo modo, l'evoluzione verso un'economia a zero emissioni diventa uno scopo da perseguire nel tempo, con la stessa priorità delle finalità di profitto.

La Società ha adottato la Politica degli investimenti sostenibili, consapevole che l'integrazione, all'interno dei prodotti finanziari, di obiettivi di sostenibilità e di fattori ESG rappresenti non solo una strategia per mitigare i rischi ma anche un'opportunità per ottenere quegli impatti essenziali al raggiungimento delle finalità di beneficio comune che Redo persegue nativamente.

¹ https://co2alizione.eco/it/home
La Politica definisce a livello di SGR le regole generali della gestione della sostenibilità, con particolare riferimento ai requisiti normativi della SFDR, della tassonomia dell'UE e dei diversi Regolamenti Delegati di applicazione tecnica e adottando un approccio "comply". Redo utilizza e pubblica gli indicatori PAI (Principal Adverse Impact) anche come indicatori di monitoraggio degli obiettivi di sostenibilità, e misurare il raggiungimento delle caratteristiche ambientali e sociali dei prodotti finanziari Art. 8 SFDR e l'impatto degli investimenti sostenibili dei prodotti Art. 9 SFDR secondo un framework di sostenibilità aderente alla doppia materialità. Tra i vari strumenti Redo si è dotata di Linee guida di Progetto e Costruzione per il rispetto dei requisiti Tassonomici rivolte a progettisti e costruttori che tengono conto del calcolo del Global Warming Potential (GWP), della valutazione del rischio climatico e della vulnerabilità climatica, del Piano di controllo dell'inquinamento di cantiere che include gli aspetti di gestione delle acque, del Piano di gestione dei rifiuti e la tutela della biodiversità, per tutti i nuovi interventi immobiliari, secondo i livelli e le soglie previste per le attività 7.1 Costruzione di nuovi edifici, 7.2 Ristrutturazione di edifici esistenti, 7.7 Acquisto e proprietà di edifici secondo la Tassonomia UE per il Contributo sostanziale alla mitigazione dei cambiamenti climatici.

Le valutazioni di investimento, ai sensi dell'art. 6 SFDR, vengono effettuate in linea con la Policy Risk Management adottata da Redo e aggiornata nel 2023, che prevede diverse categorie di rischio, tra cui i rischi di sostenibilità. Tra questi i rischi climatici vengono considerati come "fisici" e "di transizione": entrambi sono connessi al cambiamento climatico e alle due maggiori fonti di incertezza che esso determina nel lungo periodo per la salute e sicurezza degli abitanti e per la sostenibilità degli investimenti.

L'attività di monitoraggio dei consumi energetici e idrici degli immobili in gestione, l'educazione e l'ingaggio dei residenti, l'attenta pianificazione degli investimenti per la decarbonizzazione e la consapevolezza dei rischi climatici fisici e di transizione sono importanti driver che permettono a Redo di valorizzare il patrimonio immobiliare gestito nel medio-lungo termine. Ad oggi, l'impronta di carbonio degli asset in gestione, monitorata mensilmente attraverso un Environmental Management System certificato ISO 14001, risulta allineata con gli obiettivi di neutralità climatica europei al 2033 - in base allo scenario di mitigazione del cambiamento climatico entro $1,5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ - ed al 2040 in base allo scenario $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. Gli scenari per il settore immobiliare sono resi disponibili da CRREM PATHWAYS V2 for Residential Building, il benchmark di riferimento a livello globale per la decarbonizzazione degli asset immobiliari in fase operativa e il loro allineamento agli Accordi di Parigi aggiornato al 2023. I fondi in gestione hanno ottenuto il rating GRESB green star per il 2023.

Redo sta realizzando i primi progetti di social housing carbon neutral in conformità con gli impegno del concorso internazionale Reinventing Cities e con le Linee Guida delle Aree Carbon Neutral del Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milan. I progetti L'INNESTO, la riqualificazione dell'es scalo ferroviario di Milano Greco Breda, Green Between, la riqualificazione di un parcheggio ATM a Crescenzago, e ARIA, la riqualificazione dell'Ex Macello di Milano, sono tre progetti impegnati ad azzerare nell'arco di 50 anni sia le emissioni in fase di esercizio che le emissioni di CO2eq messe in gioco con la costruzione stessa degli edifici.

Il tema della realizzazione di aree urbane net zero carbon richiede un approccio innovativo, poiché non è possibile realizzare tali aree se non ricorrendo a compensazioni esterne al perimetro del singolo edificio, includendo cioè anche strategie di decarbonizzazione a scala di area e a scala di utente, comprese quelle compensazioni ibride, quali l'utilizzo di CER, di RECs o Energia con Garanzia di Origine, di mobilità condivisa, di nuove soluzioni di economia circolare, al di fuori dagli stretti confini del sistema di progetto edilizio ma realizzabili solo in stretta dipendenza con il progetto stesso, coinvolgendo gli abitanti e gli utenti in comportamenti civici più attenti e virtuosi.

Per sostenere gli impatti sociali della rigenerazione urbana è necessario, infatti, fare dello sviluppo sostenibile della comunità uno strumento strategico per:

orientare la pianificazione urbanistica a favore di una rinascita non solo economica, ma anche sociale e culturale dei quartieri;
rafforzare il legame con i territori anche periferici;
valorizzare le peculiarità dei luoghi;
sperimentare nuovi standard qualitativi e, non ultimo,
incidere sugli strumenti normativi.

Tale piano individua una serie di previsioni urbanistiche finalizzate al miglioramento dell'assetto e della qualità urbana e ambientale, all'incremento del verde a fruizione dei cittadini, dei servizi pubblici, al potenziamento dell'offerta di edilizia residenziale sociale e del trasporto pubblico. L'area di trasformazione è compresa tra i due assi di viale Fulvio Testi e viale Monza, in prossimità della stazione ferroviaria urbana Greco Pirelli. Ad est un tessuto misto di maglia minuta residenziale e produttivo-artigianale comprende i nuclei storici preesistenti di Segnanino, Segnano, Greco Milanese e Precotto; ad ovest invece il nuovo quartiere di Milano Bicocca ha visto l'insediamento di un polo tecnologico, con presenza di funzioni residenziali e di interesse generale come l'Università, il teatro degli Arcimboldi e nuovi spazi pubblici. Il sito è diviso in due porzioni: la parte centrale lungo le vie Breda e Rucellai lato Viale Monza e una spina verde che corre lungo i binari della ferrovia, lato Greco – Pirelli sulla via Sesto San Giovanni.  |

|  Descrizione dell'azione/progetto/intervento
Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti identificati (ad esempio stock edificato, sistemi energetici, infrastrutture per la mobilità). | **Sistemi energetici**
Il Sistema Energetico di Area è un sistema di teleriscaldamento e tele raffrescamento di IV° Generazione (TLR4G) a bassa temperatura che alimenta i satelliti delle singole unità, un circuito aperto all'integrazione di fluidi prodotti con fonti rinnovabili. Il sistema è composto da:
• un allacciamento alla rete di teleriscaldamento che utilizza energia termica proveniente da fonte rinnovabile (riuso del cascame energetico di un processo produttivo nei pressi dell'intervento);
• una pompa di calore acqua/acqua che sfrutta il calore dei reflui urbani;
• un campo solare termico per la produzione di ACS e per la rigenerazione dei dispositivi DEC per la deumidificazione e il raffrescamento degli ambienti delle residenze;
• un campo solare fotovoltaico.
Il Sistema Energetico di Area consente di portare il TLR di Bicocca anche in zona Viale Monza grazie all'attraversamento del sedime ferroviario, permettendo l'estensione futura della rete.

**Involucro edilizio (cappotto, coperture, serramenti)**
L'analisi LCA di questa sezione del progetto include le emissioni generate durante tutte le fasi del ciclo di vita della materia: l'estrazione delle materie prime (A1), il loro trasporto alla fabbrica (A2), il processo di produzione del prodotto finale (A3) e le fasi di fine vita quali il trattamento (C3) e lo smaltimento dei rifiuti (C4). Il perimetro di analisi è riferisce a 7 sistemi edilizi: la fondazione, la struttura, l'interpiano, la copertura, vetrate dell'involucro, l'involucro opaco e le partizioni interne. Per ridurre l'impatto ambientale dell'intervento, le opzioni materiche sono state selezionate in base ai seguenti parametri: biodegradabilità e rinnovabilità del materiale, riciclabilità e contenuto di riciclato, certificazione del materiale, regionalità del materiale. Il sistema costruttivo prevede un telaio strutturale in eco-cemento di loppa d'alto forno lombarda, solai in latero-eco-cemento analogo, tamponamenti in blocchi di origine argillosa, contro pareti interne a secco in cartongesso. Per l'analisi delle emissioni  |

di carbonio, l'indicatore di riferimento è stato il potenziale di riscaldamento globale o Global Warming Potential (GWP), misurato in kgCO2e.

## Produzione da fonti rinnovabili (fotovoltaico, etc.)

Il 100% dei consumi, elencati nei Sistemi energetici, è coperto da fonti di energia rinnovabile in-site e off-site. Il contributo energetico delle diverse fonti di energia rinnovabile è distinto come segue:

588 MWh/anno da campo solare fotovoltaico di cui:
277 MWh/anno per utenze elettriche in sito
311 MWh/anno per gli abitanti attraverso CER
170,8 MWh/annuo da sistema DEC di cui:
22,6 MWh/anno rigenerazione dei sistemi DEC
139,7 MWh/anno per raffrescamento
8.5 MWh/anno per ventilazione
165 MWh/anno da campo solare termico per energy center
140 KWh/anno scambiatore di acque reflue
1.120 MWh/anno di REC PPAs per energy center

## Mobilità e trasporti

Il progetto, grazie al ricollocamento della via Breda in fregio alla stazione FS, rende l'area totalmente pedonale, promuovendo la mobilità attiva tramite la riqualificazione dell'infrastruttura ciclopedonale al contorno, della creazione di nuove infrastrutture dedicate, dell'uso del trasporto pubblico tramite la creazione di un nodo intermodale legato al comparto ed alla stazione di Greco. Il progetto, infatti, integra una flotta elettrica condominiale in condivisione con i sistemi di sharing urbani aperti anche ad altri utenti. Queste condizioni consentono una riduzione della dotazione di sosta e mettono in condizione gli abitanti a poter rinunciare al possesso dell'auto privata.

## Economia circolare e rifiuti

La progettazione e la gestione de L'Innesto segue una logica di minimizzazione del LCA con l'impiego di materiali a minor impatto ambientale (biobased, riciclati/riciclabili, con passaporto

digitale), parziale industrializzazione del processo produttivo, flessibilizzazione e decostruzione selettiva con approccio modulare, riduzione dei rifiuti in fase di costruzione. In fase di gestione il servizio di Circular Housing® permette agli abitanti il noleggio di arredi da filiera del legno 100% riciclato ed elettrodomestici ad alte prestazioni, costituendo un'alternativa sostenibile, economica e facile rispetto al loro acquisto. Integrando i principi dell'economia circolare nella vita di tutti i giorni è prevista una drastica riduzione di rifiuti da smaltire derivanti da produzione e da consumo, grazie ad un contratto di noleggio operativo basato sulla responsabilità estesa del produttore, con possibilità di ricondizionamento, e riutilizzo a fine vita e dimezzamento della CO2 durante la vita operativa. Sarà presente in sito, inoltre, un centro di ricerca e innovazione dedicato all'economia circolare che proporrà diversi living lab tra imprese e cittadini, per sperimentare nuove applicazioni, quali ad esempio il compostaggio automatico di comunità e la trasformazione degli scarti di caffè in materia prima seconda.

## Infrastrutture verdi e Nature Based Solutions

L'87% dell'ex scalo ferroviario viene dedicato a superfici verdi e superfici permeabili, questo consente di adottare strategie di sequestro della CO2 attraverso attività di forestazione urbana, l'applicazione di misure agro-ecologiche e di carbon farming.

Il progetto prevede la piantumazione e la gestione decennale di circa 700 nuove alberature all'interno di un parco urbano che ospita anche funzioni produttive e agro-forestali ed è costituito da aree verdi di differente vocazione (frutteto, orti, wildflower gardens, aree a verde) volte alla rinaturalizzazione del sito, alla riforestazione, all'incremento della biodiversità e della qualità ambientale dei luoghi. In questo senso, è importante considerare l'influenza della stagionalità nella scelta delle specie per lo sviluppo del paesaggio urbano (es. fioriture), anche al fine di prevenire la percezione invernale di abbandono, oltre a limitare l'utilizzo di specie allergizzanti. E' prevista l'individuazione, sia in fase di prima piantumazione che di gestione, di fornitori di specie autoctone e sementi perlopiù a livello locale, coinvolgendo eventuali competenze e risorse locali, facilitando la filiera corta.

Nell'ottica del potenziamento della formazione di nuovo suolo si prevede l'utilizzo di concimi naturali, privilegiando la lotta integrata e prevedendo l'adozione dell'agricoltura biologica, evitando quindi in generale l'utilizzo di pesticidi e fertilizzanti di sintesi.

|   | La valutazione dell'intero ciclo dell'acqua nell'ambito del progetto, dall'irrigazione alla verifica di fattibilità del recupero di acque piovane, è fondamentale per ottenere una maggior qualità dell'acqua utilizzata. Per questo motivo è cruciale la gestione e il riuso in sito delle acque meteoriche al fine di replicare i processi della naturale idrologia del sito, con l'introduzione del concetto di rain garden che prevede il ribassamento delle aree di captazione (aree verdi drenanti), il rispetto del principio di invarianza idraulica ed idrologica e l'implementazione di strategie finalizzate a ridurre l'uso di acqua potabile da parte dei futuri utenti.  |

|  L'infrastruttura digitale a disposizione degli abitanti de L'INNESTO mette in rete i dati ambientali e climatici sia allo scopo di **adattarsi ai cambiamenti climatici** attraverso la mitigazione degli shock e degli stress causati dell'impatto degli eventi estremi (e.g. ondate di calore, precipitazioni intense, qualità dell'aria), sia allo scopo di **supportare la transizione** monitorando gli effetti delle strategie di compensazione collaborative.  |   |
|  Il nuovo distretto promuove servizi di prossimità a basse emissioni e volti alla riduzione degli **sprechi** come ad esempio uno Zero Waste Store, il riuso degli scarti commerciali e domestici del caffè attraverso l'applicazione di Coffeefrom, la gestione collaborativa e non commerciale di una porzione orticola del sito e il riutilizzo della frazione organica (compost) per la fertilizzazione delle aree agricole locali.  |   |
|  Le relazioni sociali e il coinvolgimento degli abitanti nello sviluppo del quartiere sono al centro de L'Innesto. L'intervento sperimenta, infatti, un nuovo modo di vivere l'**abitare collaborativo**, che non si limita alla partecipazione degli inquilini alla gestione degli spazi comuni e degli spazi aperti, ma si apre all'intero quartiere e alla città di Milano. Questo approccio inclusivo alla vita del quartiere si riflette anche nella proposta abitativa diversificata di social housing, con alloggi in locazione, in vendita convenzionata agevolata e in condivisione, residenze sociali rivolte a categorie in difficoltà e uno studentato convenzionato con 300 posti letto.  |   |

|   |  Cobenefici
I cobenefici sono i risultati indiretti della propria azione, effetti e cambiamenti realizzati sulla vita dei soggetti coinvolti e sul territorio (es. ridotto traffico stradale, disponibilità di aree verdi, mix abitativo social housing e non) | Effetti indiretti delle azioni messe in campo da L'INNESTO ricadono nei domini della salute, dell'equità e dell'occupazione.

SALUTE
Il cambiamento climatico ha numerosi effetti avversi sulla salute umana. Le ondate di calore, uno degli effetti diretti, comportano un carico quantificabile di mortalità e morbilità in Italia (ogni estate, più del 2-3% dei decessi totali è attribuibile all'esposizione al calore e questi numeri sono destinati ad  |
```html
|   | aumentare). L'adattamento agli impatti climatici e le attività di early warning per eventi estremi pervisti ne L'INNESTO possono avere effetti molto rilevanti sulla salute, rappresentando un'altra fonte di co-benefici sia con l'impiego di NBS per il microclima dei quartieri sia con l'impiego di sistemi di allerta per gli eventi avversi quali le ondate di calore o le alte concentrazioni di inquinanti nell'aria. Una riduzione importante (fino al 30-40%), secondo il Ministero della Sanità Italiana, dell'incidenza delle malattie croniche (tumori, diabete, malattie cardiovascolari, respiratorie e neurologiche) può essere ottenuta con politiche preventive realizzate al di fuori del sistema sanitario, ad esempio migliorando la qualità dell'aria in ambiente urbano, favorendo la mobilità attiva, migliorando la dieta. D'altro canto anche lo stress abitativo ha gravi impatti negativi sulla salute dei bambini e degli adulti: gli alloggi sociali e a prezzi accessibili possono migliorare la salute fornendo maggiore stabilità e liberando risorse per cibo sano e attività di benessere e aumentando l'accesso ai servizi nei quartieri di qualità.  |
| --- | --- |
|  **EQUITA'**
La resilienza delle comunità dipende anche dalla loro diversità, in termini di età, reddito, professione, provenienza, cultura. Lo scambio culturale continuo se ben incanalato in nuove opportunità, nuovi servizi e spazi comuni, contribuisce ad aumentare il capitale sociale di una comunità. Redo massimizza la mixità abitativa e funzionale lavorando nel lungo periodo sul profilo di comunità de L'INNESTO (classi di età, sesso, classi di reddito, composizione del nucleo familiare, figli a carico, provenienza geografica, stato occupazionale, titoli di studio, etc.) sulla gestione delle morosità (accesso a bonus – contributi, cura dei piani di rientro), sulla gestione delle istanze della comunità (progetti, partecipazione, attività collaborative, institution building, valorizzazione del volontariato, etc.) e nella gestione del benessere abitativo (conflitti, informazione e comunicazione, degrado, sicurezza, coesione, soddisfazione percepita). Gli alloggi a prezzi accessibili contribuiscono anche a significativi impatti economici, incluso l'aumento del potere d'acquisto locale, la creazione di posti di lavoro e nuove entrate fiscali, costruendo una comunità vivace senza sacrificare i  |   |

valori immobiliari delle proprietà circostanti. I miglioramenti dovuti all'efficienza energetica riducono i costi operativi a lungo termine degli edifici multifamiliari. Questo aiuta a stabilizzare i portafogli di appartamenti a prezzi accessibili come quelli di Redo, a preservare lo stock in affitto e a proteggere gli inquilini dall'instabilità economica derivante dalle basse performance energetiche e prevenire l'insorgenza della povertà energetica. D'altro canto l'instabilità abitativa può mettere seriamente a repentaglio il rendimento e il successo scolastico dei bambini e contribuire a divari di rendimento duraturi.

## OCCUPAZIONE

Il 14,23% degli investimenti per lo sviluppo immobiliare de L'INNESTO corrisponde all'incidenza della remunerazione della forza lavoro di cantiere. Il modello di gestione di Redo crea, inoltre, un indotto di 20 posti di lavoro permanenti per ogni 100 appartamenti costruiti: nel property e facility management, nella gestione della comunità, nei servizi pubblici e commerciali. Centro propulsivo de L'INNESTO è il Circular Economy District, un hub che ha come obiettivo lo sviluppo e la sperimentazione di modelli innovativi di produzione, consumo e stili di vita basati sulla circularità e sulla partecipazione della comunità. Gli enti e le persone che convergeranno attorno a questo hub sono imprenditori, imprese del territorio milanese, ricercatori e giovani talenti per i quali questo centro sarà un punto di riferimento. Il distretto prevede attività di accompagnamento imprenditoriale, sviluppo di progetti di contaminazione tra aziende del territorio, start up e piccole e medie imprese innovative, oltre a percorsi formativi focalizzati sull'economia circolare. In questo modo, il Circular Economy District diventa un catalizzatore per la creazione di posti di lavoro a tema innovazione.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (Player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi laddove disponibili, utili ad avere un inquadramento generale della realtà in cui operate e a collocare le progettualità presentate nel contesto milanese.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime-seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030

Abitare soc. coop, da sempre attenta ai temi ambientali, ha da tempo avviato un programma di miglioramento dell'efficienza energetica dei propri caseggiati mediante la realizzazione di interventi di relamping, impianti fotovoltaici, installazione di case dell'acqua all'interno dei propri stabili, progressiva sostituzione dei fornelli a gas con piastre a induzione. Inoltre, al fine di incoraggiare il riuso, sono stati disposti in molti stabili i cassonetti gialli gestiti dalle cooperative sociale di Rete RIUSE.

A partire dal 2021, Abitare ha avviato un ambizioso progetto di efficientamento energetico dei propri caseggiati, comprensivo di riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, adozione dei sistemi a pompa di calore a falda geotermica, installazione di nuovi pannelli fotovoltaici, adozione di sistemi di BACS.

A questo, si aggiungono il potenziamento del relamping, la progressiva eliminazione del metano per uso domestico e la progressiva adozione di flotte green.

Altri progetti distintivi sono la partecipazione attiva alla CERS promossa dal Comune di Milano e l'avvio di un progetto di Orti Sociali.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (Player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi laddove disponibili, utili ad avere un inquadramento generale della realtà in cui operate e a collocare le progettualità presentate nel contesto milanese.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime-seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

# NOTE PER LA COMPILAZIONE

La scheda è strutturata in due parti:

**PARTE A**: le informazioni sono necessarie alla sottoscrizione del Climate City Contract

Sezione A.1: strategia ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione. Fornire una descrizione generale della strategia di decarbonizzazione nell'ambito della quale si collocano le progettualità che intendete mettere a disposizione del Climate City Contract di Milano
Sezione A.2: progetti urbani e interventi relativi a propri asset. Compilare la tabella "Raccolta azioni", facendone una copia per ciascun progetto considerato.

**NB**: per "progetti urbani" si intende progetti di rigenerazione urbana in corso e previsti sul territorio comunale; per "interventi relativi a propri asset" si intende progetti e iniziative relative agli edifici di proprietà (owned assets), uffici direzionali, "and third-party asset and property management services" localizzati a Milano.

**PARTE B**: (facoltativa) per ciascun progetto segnalato nella PARTE A, compilare le seguenti due sezioni:

Sezione B.1: quadro conoscitivo
Sezione B.2: Scheda relativa al sistema energetico e ai consumi energetici.

Il questionario è in formato editabile, vi chiediamo gentilmente di compilare i riquadri destinati alle risposte, compatibilmente con la disponibilità di dati e l'avanzamento dei progetti, eventualmente replicando le tabelle per ciascuna progettualità che si intende presentare.
Preghiamo di darci riscontro della ricezione del questionario e di inviare il questionario compilato entro il 20 gennaio 2024, all'indirizzo di rossana.torri@comune.milano.it, marta.papetti@amat-mi.it e manuela.ojan@amat-mi.it

## PARTE A - Sezione A.1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

La seguente sezione riguarda la strategia alla base delle iniziative di decarbonizzazione rilevanti già messe in atto o previste sul breve e medio periodo sia a livello di propri assets, uffici direzionali, "third-party asset and property management services", che di progetti di rigenerazione urbana localizzati nel perimetro comunale di Milano.

Avete già predisposto una strategia per la decarbonizzazione/neutralità carbonica sul territorio milanese al 2030? Descrivete la visione complessiva, eventuali interventi già realizzati e, in linee generali, cosa si intende realizzare entro il 2030

La Cooperativa è proprietaria di patrimonio immobiliare sul territorio milanese ed è presente anche nello sviluppo di nuove iniziative immobiliari nell'ambito del contesto attuale della rigenerazione urbana avendo il tema la decarbonizzazione come uno dei principali obiettivi da raggiungere. Lo sviluppo in corso dei nuovi progetti immobiliari è ad emissione "0", così come lo sono gli interventi attualmente in corso di costruzione e che saranno a breve ultimati. La strategia aziendale prevede come obiettivo la decarbonizzazione anche nella gestione del patrimonio esistente ma evidentemente attraverso l'analisi della fattibilità economica. Lo studio per la ristrutturazione del patrimonio esistente, attraverso una significativa riqualificazione architettonica e di efficientamento energetico, è in corso ed in continua evoluzione ma spesso si scontra con il contesto molto complesso, con reti di TLR ad esempio classificate come non efficienti o difficoltà di applicare ed incrementare fonti rinnovabili. L'obiettivo comunque rimane così come la continua ricerca di soluzioni in grado di garantire la sostenibilità economica finanziaria degli interventi affinché non si generino incrementi degli affitti non più sostenibili da parte dei nostri Soci.

# Sezione 1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

Il FAI-Fondo per l'Ambiente Italiano è attivamente impegnato nell'azione di contrasto della crisi climatica, attraverso la concreta messa a terra di misure di mitigazione e adattamento all'interno dei suoi Beni. Si impegna, inoltre, a promuovere e valorizzare queste esperienze, affinché cittadini e governi possano ritrovare in queste pratiche virtuose modelli da replicare o da cui trarre spunto per nuove iniziative. Il FAI ha l'obiettivo di ridurre le sue emissioni di CO2e del 35% entro il 2030 e di raggiungere la neutralità carbonica al 2040 in tutte le sue attività, per questo sta investendo per incrementare l'uso di energia prodotta da fonti rinnovabili, nel miglioramento dell'efficienza energetica e nella promozione di un'economia circolare, attraverso il riuso e il riciclo di risorse e materiali in particolar modo nelle sue attività di cantiere. Inoltre, il FAI, già duramente colpito dagli eventi estremi che hanno interessato l'Italia, vuole creare le basi per un processo di adattamento ai cambiamenti climatici, attraverso la migliore comprensione dei rischi a cui sono esposti i suoi Beni – e dunque i territori in cui sono inseriti – e la conseguente realizzazione di misure volte a tutelarli e renderli più resilienti. Dalla manutenzione ordinaria, infatti, si sta adoperando per pianificare una lungimirante strategia di adattamento efficace e adeguata alla sfida che abbiamo di fronte.

A Milano il FAI ha la sua sede centrale, alla Cavallerizza, in Via Carlo Foldi 2, l'edificio di proprietà del Ministero della Cultura in cui è in affitto, ospita nei locali sotterranei il deposito dell'emeroteca della Biblioteca di Brera. Nell'edificio sono presenti e lavorano all'incirca 150 dei quasi 300 dipendenti della Fondazione, oltre a ospitare gli Uffici della Direzione Generale e della Presidenza.

Nel 2008 il FAI ha aperto al pubblico, dopo un lungo e attento restauro, Villa Necchi Campiglio (Via Mozart, 12) donata alla Fondazione dalle sorelle Necchi; nel 2023 il patrimonio del FAI sul territorio milanese si è arricchito di due nuove donazioni - due nuove Case Museo e due nuove Collezioni: Casa Crespi e Collezione Bagutta e Casa Livio e Collezione Grandi. Dal 2015 il Comune di Milano ha affidato in concessione al FAI la Palazzina Appiani.

A Villa Necchi Campiglio durante i lavori di restauro iniziati nel 2004, è stato sostituito l'originale sistema di produzione del calore, una caldaia a gasolio, con una caldaia a condensazione e una pompa di calore geotermica di tipo orizzontale. Dal punto di vista del bilancio ambientale, questo sistema si serve di una risorsa rinnovabile, l'acqua di falda, che viene reintegrata immediatamente nel ciclo naturale, contribuendo così a contenere anche i possibili effetti di abbassamento della falda indotti dalla diffusione dei sistemi di scambio
geotermico. Le modalità di gestione e i continui controlli hanno un ruolo centrale nella manutenzione di questo e di tutti gli impianti. In collaborazione con Edison Next a Villa Necchi Campiglio dal 2017 è in corso il monitoraggio dei consumi energetici che ci ha portato nel 2023 a intervenire con un revamping della pompa di calore e con l'inserimento di particolari filtri defangatori per migliorare le prestazioni e ridurre i consumi. Attualmente a Villa Necchi sono allo studio soluzioni progettuali per ridurre l'impatto degli eventi meteorologici estremi, le forti piogge in particolare, sulla villa creando nuove superfici drenanti.

Per le due nuove acquisizioni, Casa Crespi e Casa Livio, l'apertura al pubblico è prevista per il 2026. L'intervento di restauro sui due beni è allo studio del FAI, interventi di restauro che non potranno prescindere da l'utilizzo di soluzioni innovative per la mitigazione e l'efficientamento energetico e la sostenibilità in genere. Obiettivo che dal 2026 sarà anche al centro del progetto di gestione.

|   | Per primo il FAI intende esplorare la possibilità di inserire sulla copertura della sua sede, la Cavallerizza (Via Carlo Foldi, 2) un impianto fotovoltaico diventando uno dei produttori di energia della CER – la falda esposta a sud del tetto su cui si potrebbe installare il fotovoltaico è ampia circa 600 mq. Coinvolgendo altri attori presenti nel quartiere le superfici dei tetti utilizzabili crescerebbe significativamente, sono infatti limitrofi alla Cavallerizza diversi beni di proprietà del Comune di Milano e della Curia: - Al lato dell’edificio lungo la via Bezzecca sono ubicate le “Scuole infanzia Bezzecca 16”; sempre in via Bezzecca al 20 ha sede il Comando Zona 4 della Polizia locale e al civico 24 ha sede un C.R.A.L. del Comune di Milano. - Intorno alla Cavallerizza ci sono diversi edifici di edilizia pubblica, sono di MM lo stabile di Via Bezzecca 3 e lo stabile di Piazza Santa Maria del Suffragio 2/Corso XXII Marzo. - Sempre di proprietà del Comune di Milano è il Mercato Comunale al centro della Piazza di Santa Maria del Suffragio. - Sulla Piazza, inoltre, al civico 23 di Corso XXII Marzo si trova la Parrocchia di S. Maria del Suffragio, con l’annessa scuola (scuola dell’infanzia, elementari e medie). Sull’area insistono tre cabine elettriche primarie: AC012E0009 (via Giovanni Cena/Via Cervignano) e poi AC012E00018 (Piazza Tricolore/Corso Monforte) e AC012E00019 (Crocetta). Le fasi del progetto prevedono: - Esplorazione dei diversi soggetti potenzialmente interessati alla creazione della comunità energetica (CER), tra cui il Comune di Milano (scuole, Polizia locale, Circoli CRAL, MM per l’edilizia pubblica); la Braidense; Parrocchia di Santa Maria del Suffragio e Curia ... - Individuazione le aree dove è possibile realizzare impianti alimentati da fonti rinnovabili - esplorazione di partner scientifici (Politecnico di Milano, FLA) - esplorazione di uno sponsor tecnico per il FAI - studio di fattibilità per la comunità energetica: individuare i potenziali produttori di energia e auto-  |

|   | Descrizione dell'azione/progetto/intervento | La campagna #FAIperilclima, cosa stiamo facendo  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  | Il FAI da tre anni ha avviato una campagna di sensibilizzazione e conoscenza a scala nazionale dedicata al tema del cambiamento climatico #FAIperilclima. Tra le attività della campagna sono previste delle visite guidate nei Beni del FAI in cui grazie alla guida di relatori esperti (climatologi, pedologici, botanici, agronomi, geologi ecc) vengono fatti “toccare con mano” gli effetti del cambiamento climatico nel Bene o sul suo territorio di riferimento e illustrate eventuali azioni di adattamento in essere o necessarie per la messa in sicurezza dei luoghi e del patrimonio paesaggistico e culturale. A Milano queste “visite speciali” sono state condotte sia a Villa Necchi Campiglio che a Palazzina Appiani. Nella scorsa edizione dell’autunno 2023 a Villa Necchi Elena Lucchi e Francesca Turati hanno parlato di Efficienza energetica e sostenibilità del patrimonio storico, mentre a Palazzina Appiani il tema è stato: Un parco in città tra adattamento al cambiamento climatico e salute.  |
|   |  | Oltre a questi appuntamenti da due anni il FAI partecipa alla Green Week. Nel 2022 in seguito alla inaugurazione del video-racconto Un ambiente per l’ambiente (da allora sempre visibile gratuitamente a tutti nei giorni e negli orari di apertura della Villa) abbiamo organizzato un ciclo di incontri dedicati alla città e ai vari temi ambientali – abbiamo con l’occasione presentato il Piano Aria Clima e parlato di mitigazione anche attraverso nuove grande opere idrauliche come la riapertura dei Navigli. Nella edizione del 2023 invece è stata organizzata una tavola rotonda con la collaborazione del FAI Giovani dell’Oltrepò Pavese e dell’Ordine dei Dottori Agronomi e Forestali, dedicata al Giardino del futuro in cui sono stati presentate le esperienze milanesi di rain garden e dry garden.  |
|   |  | Inoltre, a Villa Necchi Campiglio come in tutti i Beni del FAI sono affissi per il pubblico alcuni spunti su comportamenti virtuosi sull’esempio delle buone pratiche del FAI.  |
9

Infine, nell'ottobre 2023 abbiamo organizzato a Villa Necchi Campiglio un open day per gli insegnanti di ogni ordine e grado in cui sono state raccontate le buone pratiche del FAI per la mitigazione e l'adattamento al cambiamento climatico. Gli insegnanti sono stati invitati a portare la loro classe in visita a Villa Necchi per la visione del video-racconto i Un ambiente per l'Ambiente per favorire il confronto in classe https://fondoambiente.it/news/open-day-per-docenti-nei-beni-fai

Lo sviluppo della campagna #FAIperilclima nel prossimo triennio

Attività in sviluppo per la concertazione e la condivisione delle buone pratiche del FAI

L'avvio del progetto per la realizzazione di una CER a Milano potrebbe essere accompagnato dall'organizzazione di un workshop a Villa Necchi Campiglio - o in Cavallerizza - sul tema "rinnovabili e patrimonio storico", con il rilascio di crediti formativi per professionisti; che prende spunto dalla condivisione dell'impegno del FAI.
Sperimentare nei Beni FAI dei laboratori per la sensibilizzazione sul tema del cambiamento climatico da proporre durante gli eventi (per esempio laboratori in cui si parla di sementi e scelte resilienti legate al verde).
Creare contenuti appositi sul tema della mitigazione, adattamento e buone pratiche legati ai Beni del FAI da lasciare ai visitatori come contenuto alla visita (podcast, video-pillole scaricabili in sito con QRcode).

Attività in sviluppo da parte della Rete territoriale del FAI (Delegazioni) a scala locale

Dal 2024 la campagna #FAI per il clima coinvolgerà la Rete territoriale del FAI, che si attiverà per intensificare il numero delle "visite speciali" dedicate alla campagna sui territori, nel caso specifico nell'area metropolitana di Milano, la Delegazione di Milano, il Gruppo FAI Giovani di Milano e la Delegazione FAI Ovest Milano organizzeranno – nelle date del 2-3 e 9-10 novembre 2024 visite dedicate ai temi di #FAIperilclima, che saranno promosse anche a scala nazionale.

|   | • In termini di comunicazione tutte le attività che ricadono nella campagna #FAlperilclina hanno una veste grafica univoca e riconoscibile.
• Inoltre, si intende supportare le Delegazioni lombarde ad aggiungere nel loro programma di eventi locali almeno un appuntamento a bimestre dedicato alla campagna #FAlperilclima e alla creazione di un evento regionale dedicato alla stessa campagna;
• e promuovere nelle Giornate FAI di Primavera e nelle Giornate FAI di Autunno l'“apertura” di almeno un luogo che sia legato ai temi del cambiamento climatico, come per esempio un centro di ricerca, ma anche la visita a un rain garden, piuttosto che a un parco urbano per mostrare gli effetti del cambiamento climatico o illustrare i benefici del verde urbano per i cittadini ecc.

**Attività con le scuole**
• Ripetere a Villa Necchi Campiglio l’open day per gli insegnanti di ogni ordine;
• dedicare l’annuale contest destinato agli studenti al tema del cambiamento climatico. Ogni anno uno street artist viene incaricato della realizzazione di tre proposte grafiche per un murales su un tema indicato dal FAI. Le proposte vengono sottoposte al voto degli studenti e la vincitrice viene realizzata in una città con vernici assorbismog (Airlite);
• durante gli incontri di formazione sensibilizzare gli “Apprendisti Ciceroni” sul tema del cambiamento climatico. Gli Apprendisti Ciceroni sono studenti di ogni ordine e grado formati per accompagnare il pubblico durante le Giornate FAI di Primavera.  |

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Nel Climate City Contract possono essere valorizzate strategie, progetti e strumenti che favoriscono il raggiungimento degli obiettivi pur agendo indirettamente sulla riduzione delle emissioni.

Tali azioni dovranno essere sempre in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.
A titolo di esempio, una lista non esaustiva di tipologie di azioni o programmi di azione:

Coinvolgere le comunità nella formulazione di progetti incoraggiando un approccio partecipativo.

Sostenere finanziariamente soggetti o progetti che adottano pratiche in linea con gli obiettivi di riduzione delle emissioni.

Promuovere l'uso di mezzi di trasporto sostenibili come biciclette, mezzi pubblici e veicoli elettrici.

Sensibilizzare i cittadini sull'importanza dell'efficienza energetica nelle abitazioni.

Promuovere l'adozione di tecnologie a basso consumo energetico e pratiche di costruzione sostenibili.

Educare i cittadini sulla corretta gestione dei rifiuti e incentivare il riciclo.

Promuovere abitudini alimentari sostenibili, come la riduzione del consumo di carne e la preferenza per prodotti locali e stagionali.

Coinvolgere attivamente i cittadini nelle decisioni riguardanti la sostenibilità urbana.

Creare piattaforme di partecipazione civica e fornire strumenti per la condivisione di idee e progetti.

Condurre campagne di sensibilizzazione sui cambiamenti climatici e sulle azioni che i cittadini possono intraprendere.

Promuovere la creazione e la manutenzione di spazi verdi urbani coinvolgendo i cittadini nella piantumazione di alberi e nella conservazione della biodiversità locale.

Integrare temi legati alla sostenibilità nei programmi scolastici.

Coinvolgere le scuole in progetti e iniziative a favore dell'ambiente.

Incoraggiare le imprese locali ad adottare pratiche sostenibili e a ridurre l'impatto ambientale delle loro attività.

# SCHEDA – Strategie e azioni puntuali

Si possono descrivere qui in generale strategie ed iniziative con impatti, anche indiretti, sulla neutralità climatica della città al 2030, a partire dagli ambiti privilegiati energia ed edifici; verde e forestazione, mobilità, economia circolare.

Nell'ambito della propria strategia, il Gruppo focalizza i propri sforzi secondo le due direttrici di Transizione Energetica ed Economia Circolare, rese sinergiche grazie al modello di business che contraddistingue le attività del Gruppo. Nell'ambito della transizione energetica, molteplici sono le iniziative e i progetti portati avanti da A2A nel corso degli ultimi anni e molti sono in sviluppo per essere messi a terra nei prossimi anni, a supporto dell'obiettivo che il Gruppo si è dato in relazione alla decarbonizzazione delle proprie attività e, quindi, in maniera indiretta anche del sistema Paese e, nello specifico, delle aree geografiche di presenza. In particolare, A2A si è data un obiettivo di riduzione del 47% del proprio fattore emissivo (i.e. il quantitativo di anidride carbonica immesso in atmosfera rapportato alla produzione energetica) al 2030, rispetto al 2017. Tale riduzione, di cui beneficerà in ultima analisi l'intero sistema elettrico italiano, sarà raggiungibile grazie agli investimenti complessivi in arco Piano, pari a 11 miliardi di euro, focalizzati sullo sviluppo del parco rinnovabile e sull'elettrificazione dei consumi, nonché sulla capacità di flessibilità della rete elettrica. La realizzazione di nuove cabine primarie e la posa di oltre 2.500 km di rete rappresentano snodi fondamentali nell'ambito di questa strategia, ma non solo: l'offerta di nuove soluzioni VAS, il costante supporto alla mobilità elettrica, lo sviluppo di una generazione di tipo distribuito e la promozione, tramite Comunità Energetiche, dell'autoconsumo elettrico dei cittadini grazie alla capillarizzazione di impianti fotovoltaici small-scale, costituiranno elementi fondamentali nell'ambito della creazione di un ecosistema sempre più decarbonizzato.

Con riferimento all'Economia Circolare, il Gruppo è in prima linea nel fornire un servizio di raccolta e smaltimento rifiuti che sia in grado di migliorare la vita dei cittadini. Il Gruppo crede fortemente nel valore che i rifiuti possono acquisire nell'ambito della transizione ecologica. In particolare, i termovalorizzatori e i processi ad essi connessi contribuiscono in maniera sostanziale al raggiungimento degli obiettivi europei sulla diminuzione del conferimento in discarica, anche in ottica di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2. Inoltre, gli impianti Waste-to-energy, oltre ad assolvere questo ruolo cruciale, consentono di ottenere energia dal rifiuto, immettendola in rete e, di fatto, "sostituendo" energia che altrimenti sarebbe generata tramite fonti fossili tradizionali: anche in questo caso, è evidente come il beneficio emissivo per il sistema Paese sia indubbio e rilevante, considerando che l'anidride carbonica emessa dalla valorizzazione dei rifiuti urbani sia contraddistinta da un'importante percentuale biogenica e che, quindi, non altera i cicli naturali.

Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti identificati | Il Banco dell'energia realizza progetti legati al contrasto della povertà energetica.
Fondato in Lombardia nel 2016 da A2A e dalle sue Fondazioni, nell'ottobre del 2022, si è trasformato da Comitato Onlus a Fondazione Ente Filantropico, allargando la propria Governance ad altre aziende: Edison, Plenitude e Iren sono infatti entrate a far parte del Consiglio di  |
Amministrazione della Fondazione. Dalla firma del Manifesto "Insieme per contrastare la povertà energetica" nel 2021, ad oggi i firmatari sono 70.

Si segnalano 5 iniziative afferenti al Banco dell'Energia da poco concluse.

**Banco dell'energia: bando doniamo energia**

Il Bando 2020-2022 ha messo a disposizione 2 M€, di cui 500 k€ di Banco dell'energia. Sono risultati aggiudicatari 17 progettualità di cui 6 per la provincia di Milano con risorse stanziate pari a 160 k€.

**Banco dell'energia: Energia in periferia - Quarto Oggiaro e Milano Sud**

Il progetto "Energia in periferia" (lanciato nel 2021) ha coinvolto nel 2022 Quarto Oggiaro, e nel 2023 Milano Sud, con lo scopo di evitare l'aggravarsi di situazioni di vulnerabilità tramite azioni di sostegno economico (pagamento di bollette di qualsiasi operatore energetico), e promozione di percorsi di educazione al risparmio energetico.

Globalmente saranno aiutate più di 200 famiglie con 80 k€ finanziati da Banco dell'Energia con contributi di Next Energy, Foundazione ed Engel &amp; Völkers ed Eni Plenitude.

**Banco dell'energia: "SOLari e SOLidali"**

Il progetto prevede la creazione di una Comunità Energetica Rinnovabile e Solidale a Baranzate con l'installazione di un impianto fotovoltaico avente una potenza di picco di 86,7 kW.

Tale soluzione permette il contrasto alla povertà energetica creando risorse per una rete di sostegno: infatti, attraverso il meccanismo di volontariato energetico, sarà istituito un fondo destinato alle famiglie vulnerabili. L'importo finanziato è stato di 137.5 k€, anche con il sostegno di contributi di A2A, Next Energy Foundation e Fondazione AEM.

**Banco dell'energia: Fondazione Pellegrini – Ristorante Ruben**
|   |  | La Fondazione Ernesto Pellegrini Onlus pone da sempre grande attenzione verso le famiglie e le persone fragili e con il Ristorante Solidale Ruben cerca di dare un sostegno a chi si trova in una situazione temporanea di emergenza e di fragilità economica e sociale. Sono previste attività di formazione in ambito energetico per coloro che frequentano il Ristorante.

Banco dell'energia: Energia in Cooperativa – Villaggio Barona
Il progetto, coordinato da Banco dell'energia, ha permesso di realizzare un intervento di efficientamento energetico nel contesto del primo Social Housing di Italia, il Villaggio Barona, realizzato dalla Fondazione Attilio e Teresa Cassoni e sede delle due Cooperative Sociali Officina dell'abitare e Opera in Fiore che danno lavoro a persone svantaggiate, disabili, carcerati e migranti.
Grazie alla donazione in kind da parte di A2A Illuminazione Pubblica e Signify è stato possibile realizzare un nuovo impianto di illuminazione funzionante ad energia fotovoltaica nel giardino comunitario “Milano Green Way”, aperto alla cittadinanza e dove i dipendenti della Cooperativa (detenuti in permesso, rifugiati, persone con disabilità) si prendono cura del verde e possono usufruire di orti sociali, fattoria didattica, laboratori didattici e tante altre attività aggregative.
Inoltre, grazie al contributo economico da parte di Fondazione AEM, sono state installate due colonnine di ricarica elettriche per permettere alla Fondazione Cassoni e alle Cooperative Sociali di rinnovare il parco auto usato dai soci lavoratori.  |

|   |  Descrizione dell'azione/progetto/intervento
Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti | A2A ha avviato tre tavoli di confronto con gli stakeholder di Milano con l'obiettivo di evidenziare le problematiche e le possibili soluzioni per promuovere un consumo più  |
|   | identificati | sostenibile dell'energia. Sono stati quindi costituiti gli Advisory Board Consumi Sostenibili, che vedono la partecipazione di una diversificata serie di rappresentanti di interesse mossi da questo comune obiettivo.
La Carta dei Consumi Sostenibili è un documento di sintesi, che riassume il percorso di ascolto e confronto intrapreso in questi mesi, e di indirizzo verso azioni comuni e concrete da realizzare insieme agli stakeholder. Gli incontri degli Advisory Board si sono svolti intorno a sei tematiche che sono state proposte e valutate come utili all'obiettivo: la ricerca di dati per un'analisi di scenario condivisa, l'indagine sulle abitudini di consumo, le soluzioni di mercato esistenti a disposizione di cittadini e imprese, la soluzione offerta dai sistemi di teleriscaldamento e la grande rivoluzione annunciata delle comunità energetiche rinnovabili.
L'approccio che guida questo progetto è quello della Sostenibilità nelle sue diverse declinazioni: per il Gruppo A2A e gli stakeholder che partecipano agli Advisory Board è essenziale tenere insieme sostenibilità economica, ambientale e sociale del percorso verso un nuovo approccio ai consumi responsabili di energia: per consumare meno, ridurre lo sforzo economico complessivo, ottenere crescenti impatti positivi sul clima e l'ambiente e, al tempo stesso, non lasciare indietro nessuno  |

Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti identificati | Amsa ha l'obiettivo di valorizzare e migliorare la qualità della raccolta differenziata (75%) attraverso campagne di comunicazione ed interventi sui temi di: prevenzione e riduzione dei rifiuti, recupero e riutilizzo di beni e prodotti, decoro urbano.
Per incontrare gli obiettivi sopra citati, AMSA introdurrà e potenzierà la raccolta differenziata dei cestini stradali, dei mercati coperti e di ferrovie ed aeroporti; promuoverà la raccolta selettiva delle bottiglie PET, di oli vegetali esausti, pile, RAEE, farmaci e mozziconi di sigaretta; introdurrà una comunicazione specifica  |
|  | per non-vedenti e una dedicata allo spreco alimentare coinvolgendo il settore Ho.Re.Ca.

Inoltre, per il terzo anno consecutivo, AMSA e Deliveroo sono scesi in campo per aiutare gli esercizi commerciali nella scelta di imballaggi riciclabili. I cittadini sono sensibilizzati a differenziare in modo corretto le confezioni delle pietanze ricevute inquadrando il QR-code presente sui nuovi sacchetti di consegna.

Infine, AMSA rinnova il sostegno ai progetti «NoPlà» e «NoPlà AGain - riutilizzare è un vantaggio per tutti», iniziative che hanno come scopo principale la riduzione della plastica monouso nei target Scuola, GDO e Ristorazione, con focus sul riuso della plastica come pratica virtuosa. |

|   |  Descrizione dell'azione/progetto/intervento Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti identificati | Tramite il progetto “#Ambienteascuola”, A2A e AMSA in collaborazione con il Comune di Milano hanno promosso un percorso all'interno delle scuole milanesi per promuovere la raccolta differenziata, il riciclo, il riuso e lo spreco alimentare, dunque e l'educazione civica e ambientale.
Dal 2019 ad oggi sono stati introdotti 5 progetti scolastici che hanno coinvolto le scuole dell'infanzia, le scuole primarie e le scuole  |
|   | secondarie di I e II grado.

I progetti hanno coinvolto 691 plessi delle scuole di Milano con la formazione di 4.836 educatori, personale ausiliario e studenti e la distribuzione di circa 20.000 contenitori per raccolta differenziata nelle aule e 884 progetti realizzati dagli alunni nei contest creativi.

I progetti degli ultimi anni sono stati anche potenziati dalla collaborazione con alcuni consorzi di filiera che hanno permesso, come nel caso del progetto per l'anno scolastico 2022_2023 delle raccolte straordinaria di Rifiuti da Apparecchiature Elettriche ed Elettroniche (RAEE) nello specifico R4, ovvero, smartphone, tablet, mouse, orologi elettronici, joystick.

I progetti scuola sono tutti su base volontaria e prevedono anche delle premialità e la diffusione di materiale informativo sulle modalità di raccolta differenziata per le classi e da portare a casa.

Inoltre, per le scolaresche di Milano è possibile venire a visitare la sede di AMSA, dove presso l'auditorium viene organizzato uno spettacolo per ragazzi a tema raccolta differenziata., oppure visitare gli impianti del Gruppo A2A.

Inoltre, tramite il progetto “Verso il 2050 con le scuole per un futuro sostenibile e circolare”, A2A e DeA Scuola erogano un percorso di formazione ai docenti delle scuole primarie e secondarie di I e II grado a livello nazionale, tramite 10 webinar con esperti, ricercatori e divulgatori autorevoli. Il livello di partecipazione è stato di 6857 docenti a livello nazionale e 504 per le scuole milanesi.

Infine, tramite la prova educativa “Ecogame A2A – Transizione Energetica”, le classi delle scuole primarie e secondarie hanno avuto la possibilità di sfidarsi in un gioco a quiz sulla transizione energetica. Hanno partecipato 246 classi a livello nazionale e 57 studenti delle scuole di Milano.  |

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Nel Climate City Contract possono essere valorizzate strategie, progetti e strumenti che favoriscono il raggiungimento degli obiettivi pur agendo indirettamente sulla riduzione delle emissioni.

Tali azioni dovranno essere sempre in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.
A titolo di esempio, una lista non esaustiva di tipologie di azioni o programmi di azione:

Coinvolgere le comunità nella formulazione di progetti incoraggiando un approccio partecipativo.

Sostenere finanziariamente soggetti o progetti che adottano pratiche in linea con gli obiettivi di riduzione delle emissioni.

Promuovere l'uso di mezzi di trasporto sostenibili come biciclette, mezzi pubblici e veicoli elettrici.

Sensibilizzare i cittadini sull'importanza dell'efficienza energetica nelle abitazioni.

Promuovere l'adozione di tecnologie a basso consumo energetico e pratiche di costruzione sostenibili.

Educare i cittadini sulla corretta gestione dei rifiuti e incentivare il riciclo.

Promuovere abitudini alimentari sostenibili, come la riduzione del consumo di carne e la preferenza per prodotti locali e stagionali.

Coinvolgere attivamente i cittadini nelle decisioni riguardanti la sostenibilità urbana.

Creare piattaforme di partecipazione civica e fornire strumenti per la condivisione di idee e progetti.

Condurre campagne di sensibilizzazione sui cambiamenti climatici e sulle azioni che i cittadini possono intraprendere.

Promuovere la creazione e la manutenzione di spazi verdi urbani coinvolgendo i cittadini nella piantumazione di alberi e nella conservazione della biodiversità locale.

Integrare temi legati alla sostenibilità nei programmi scolastici.

Coinvolgere le scuole in progetti e iniziative a favore dell'ambiente.

Incoraggiare le imprese locali ad adottare pratiche sostenibili e a ridurre l'impatto ambientale delle loro attività.

SCHEDA – Strategie e azioni puntuali

Si possono descrivere qui in generale strategie ed iniziative con impatti, anche indiretti, sulla neutralità climatica della città al 2030, a partire dagli ambiti privilegiati energia ed edifici; verde e forestazione, mobilità, economia circolare.

Le attività didattiche che MM Spa conduce presso il proprio museo di impresa, la Centrale dell'Acqua di Milano, hanno il duplice obiettivo di proporre un percorso di educazione ambientale e scientifica, che approfondisce le proprietà chimico fisiche, l'importanza biologica e il ciclo naturale dell'acqua, le tematiche della crisi climatica e della resilienza. Si tratta di iniziative formative, didattiche e divulgative che raccontano la crisi climatica e le azioni necessarie per l'adattamento agli impatti che questa ha sulla città. Con particolare attenzione all'uso razionale della risorsa idrica.

Gli interventi di dissemination sono rivolti a tutta la popolazione, con particolare cura degli studenti delle primarie e secondarie.

Nel 2023 sono stati 6700 i ragazzi che hanno partecipato alle visite e ai laboratori della Centrale dell'Acqua, che è diventata un punto di riferimento per le scuole e tra i musei milanesi più attivi sul piano didattico

# Sezione 1: Strategie ed iniziative di decarbonizzazione

Il FAI-Fondo per l'Ambiente Italiano è attivamente impegnato nell'azione di contrasto della crisi climatica, attraverso la concreta messa a terra di misure di mitigazione e adattamento all'interno dei suoi Beni. Si impegna, inoltre, a promuovere e valorizzare queste esperienze, affinché cittadini e governi possano ritrovare in queste pratiche virtuose modelli da replicare o da cui trarre spunto per nuove iniziative. Il FAI ha l'obiettivo di ridurre le sue emissioni di CO2e del 35% entro il 2030 e di raggiungere la neutralità carbonica al 2040 in tutte le sue attività, per questo sta investendo per incrementare l'uso di energia prodotta da fonti rinnovabili, nel miglioramento dell'efficienza energetica e nella promozione di un'economia circolare, attraverso il riuso e il riciclo di risorse e materiali in particolar modo nelle sue attività di cantiere. Inoltre, il FAI, già duramente colpito dagli eventi estremi che hanno interessato l'Italia, vuole creare le basi per un processo di adattamento ai cambiamenti climatici, attraverso la migliore comprensione dei rischi a cui sono esposti i suoi Beni – e dunque i territori in cui sono inseriti – e la conseguente realizzazione di misure volte a tutelarli e renderli più resilienti. Dalla manutenzione ordinaria, infatti, si sta adoperando per pianificare una lungimirante strategia di adattamento efficace e adeguata alla sfida che abbiamo di fronte.

A Milano il FAI ha la sua sede centrale, alla Cavallerizza, in Via Carlo Foldi 2, l'edificio di proprietà del Ministero della Cultura in cui è in affitto, ospita nei locali sotterranei il deposito dell'emeroteca della Biblioteca di Brera. Nell'edificio sono presenti e lavorano all'incirca 150 dei quasi 300 dipendenti della Fondazione, oltre a ospitare gli Uffici della Direzione Generale e della Presidenza.

Nel 2008 il FAI ha aperto al pubblico, dopo un lungo e attento restauro, Villa Necchi Campiglio (Via Mozart, 12) donata alla Fondazione dalle sorelle Necchi; nel 2023 il patrimonio del FAI sul territorio milanese si è arricchito di due nuove donazioni - due nuove Case Museo e due nuove Collezioni: Casa Crespi e Collezione Bagutta e Casa Livio e Collezione Grandi. Dal 2015 il Comune di Milano ha affidato in concessione al FAI la Palazzina Appiani.

A Villa Necchi Campiglio durante i lavori di restauro iniziati nel 2004, è stato sostituito l'originale sistema di produzione del calore, una caldaia a gasolio, con una caldaia a condensazione e una pompa di calore geotermica di tipo orizzontale. Dal punto di vista del bilancio ambientale, questo sistema si serve di una risorsa rinnovabile, l'acqua di falda, che viene reintegrata immediatamente nel ciclo naturale, contribuendo così a contenere anche i possibili effetti di abbassamento della falda indotti dalla diffusione dei sistemi di scambio
geotermico. Le modalità di gestione e i continui controlli hanno un ruolo centrale nella manutenzione di questo e di tutti gli impianti. In collaborazione con Edison Next a Villa Necchi Campiglio dal 2017 è in corso il monitoraggio dei consumi energetici che ci ha portato nel 2023 a intervenire con un revamping della pompa di calore e con l'inserimento di particolari filtri defangatori per migliorare le prestazioni e ridurre i consumi. Attualmente a Villa Necchi sono allo studio soluzioni progettuali per ridurre l'impatto degli eventi meteorologici estremi, le forti piogge in particolare, sulla villa creando nuove superfici drenanti.

Per le due nuove acquisizioni, Casa Crespi e Casa Livio, l'apertura al pubblico è prevista per il 2026. L'intervento di restauro sui due beni è allo studio del FAI, interventi di restauro che non potranno prescindere da l'utilizzo di soluzioni innovative per la mitigazione e l'efficientamento energetico e la sostenibilità in genere. Obiettivo che dal 2026 sarà anche al centro del progetto di gestione.

|   | Per primo il FAI intende esplorare la possibilità di inserire sulla copertura della sua sede, la Cavallerizza (Via Carlo Foldi, 2) un impianto fotovoltaico diventando uno dei produttori di energia della CER – la falda esposta a sud del tetto su cui si potrebbe installare il fotovoltaico è ampia circa 600 mq. Coinvolgendo altri attori presenti nel quartiere le superfici dei tetti utilizzabili crescerebbe significativamente, sono infatti limitrofi alla Cavallerizza diversi beni di proprietà del Comune di Milano e della Curia: - Al lato dell'edificio lungo la via Bezzecca sono ubicate le “Scuole infanzia Bezzecca 16”; sempre in via Bezzecca al 20 ha sede il Comando Zona 4 della Polizia locale e al civico 24 ha sede un C.R.A.L. del Comune di Milano. - Intorno alla Cavallerizza ci sono diversi edifici di edilizia pubblica, sono di MM lo stabile di Via Bezzecca 3 e lo stabile di Piazza Santa Maria del Suffragio 2/Corso XXII Marzo. - Sempre di proprietà del Comune di Milano è il Mercato Comunale al centro della Piazza di Santa Maria del Suffragio. - Sulla Piazza, inoltre, al civico 23 di Corso XXII Marzo si trova la Parrocchia di S. Maria del Suffragio, con l'annessa scuola (scuola dell'infanzia, elementari e medie). Sull'area insistono tre cabine elettriche primarie: AC012E0009 (via Giovanni Cena/Via Cervignano) e poi AC012E00018 (Piazza Tricolore/Corso Monforte) e AC012E00019 (Crocetta). Le fasi del progetto prevedono: - Esplorazione dei diversi soggetti potenzialmente interessati alla creazione della comunità energetica (CER), tra cui il Comune di Milano (scuole, Polizia locale, Circoli CRAL, MM per l'edilizia pubblica); la Braidense; Parrocchia di Santa Maria del Suffragio e Curia ... - Individuazione le aree dove è possibile realizzare impianti alimentati da fonti rinnovabili - esplorazione di partner scientifici (Politecnico di Milano, FLA) - esplorazione di uno sponsor tecnico per il FAI - studio di fattibilità per la comunità energetica: individuare i potenziali produttori di energia e auto-  |

|   | Descrizione
dell'azione/progetto/intervento | La campagna #FAIperilclima, cosa stiamo facendo  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  | Il FAI da tre anni ha avviato una campagna di sensibilizzazione e conoscenza a scala nazionale dedicata al tema del cambiamento climatico #FAIperilclima. Tra le attività della campagna sono previste delle visite guidate nei Beni del FAI in cui grazie alla guida di relatori esperti (climatologi, pedologici, botanici, agronomi, geologi ecc) vengono fatti “toccare con mano” gli effetti del cambiamento climatico nel Bene o sul suo territorio di riferimento e illustrate eventuali azioni di adattamento in essere o necessarie per la messa in sicurezza dei luoghi e del patrimonio paesaggistico e culturale. A Milano queste “visite speciali” sono state condotte sia a Villa Necchi Campiglio che a Palazzina Appiani. Nella scorsa edizione dell’autunno 2023 a Villa Necchi Elena Lucchi e Francesca Turati hanno parlato di Efficienza energetica e sostenibilità del patrimonio storico, mentre a Palazzina Appiani il tema è stato: Un parco in città tra adattamento al cambiamento climatico e salute.  |
|   |  | Oltre a questi appuntamenti da due anni il FAI partecipa alla Green Week. Nel 2022 in seguito alla inaugurazione del video-racconto Un ambiente per l’ambiente (da allora sempre visibile gratuitamente a tutti nei giorni e negli orari di apertura della Villa) abbiamo organizzato un ciclo di incontri dedicati alla città e ai vari temi ambientali – abbiamo con l’occasione presentato il Piano Aria Clima e parlato di mitigazione anche attraverso nuove grande opere idrauliche come la riapertura dei Navigli. Nella edizione del 2023 invece è stata organizzata una tavola rotonda con la collaborazione del FAI Giovani dell’Oltrepò Pavese e dell’Ordine dei Dottori Agronomi e Forestali, dedicata al Giardino del futuro in cui sono stati presentate le esperienze milanesi di rain garden e dry garden.  |
|   |  | Inoltre, a Villa Necchi Campiglio come in tutti i Beni del FAI sono affissi per il pubblico alcuni spunti su comportamenti virtuosi sull’esempio delle buone pratiche del FAI.  |

Infine, nell'ottobre 2023 abbiamo organizzato a Villa Necchi Campiglio un open day per gli insegnanti di ogni ordine e grado in cui sono state raccontate le buone pratiche del FAI per la mitigazione e l'adattamento al cambiamento climatico. Gli insegnanti sono stati invitati a portare la loro classe in visita a Villa Necchi per la visione del video-racconto i Un ambiente per l'Ambiente per favorire il confronto in classe https://fondoambiente.it/news/open-day-per-docenti-nei-beni-fai

Lo sviluppo della campagna #FAIperilclima nel prossimo triennio

Attività in sviluppo per la concertazione e la condivisione delle buone pratiche del FAI

L'avvio del progetto per la realizzazione di una CER a Milano potrebbe essere accompagnato dall'organizzazione di un workshop a Villa Necchi Campiglio - o in Cavallerizza - sul tema “rinnovabili e patrimonio storico”, con il rilascio di crediti formativi per professionisti; che prende spunto dalla condivisione dell'impegno del FAI.
Sperimentare nei Beni FAI dei laboratori per la sensibilizzazione sul tema del cambiamento climatico da proporre durante gli eventi (per esempio laboratori in cui si parla di sementi e scelte resilienti legate al verde).
Creare contenuti appositi sul tema della mitigazione, adattamento e buone pratiche legati ai Beni del FAI da lasciare ai visitatori come contenuto alla visita (podcast, video-pillole scaricabili in sito con QRcode).

Attività in sviluppo da parte della Rete territoriale del FAI (Delegazioni) a scala locale

Dal 2024 la campagna #FAI per il clima coinvolgerà la Rete territoriale del FAI, che si attiverà per intensificare il numero delle “visite speciali” dedicate alla campagna sui territori, nel caso specifico nell'area metropolitana di Milano, la Delegazione di Milano, il Gruppo FAI Giovani di Milano e la Delegazione FAI Ovest Milano organizzeranno – nelle date del 2-3 e 9-10 novembre 2024 visite dedicate ai temi di #FAIperilclima, che saranno promosse anche a scala nazionale.

|   | • In termini di comunicazione tutte le attività che ricadono nella campagna #FAlperilclina hanno una veste grafica univoca e riconoscibile.
• Inoltre, si intende supportare le Delegazioni lombarde ad aggiungere nel loro programma di eventi locali almeno un appuntamento a bimestre dedicato alla campagna #FAlperilclima e alla creazione di un evento regionale dedicato alla stessa campagna;
• e promuovere nelle Giornate FAI di Primavera e nelle Giornate FAI di Autunno l'“apertura” di almeno un luogo che sia legato ai temi del cambiamento climatico, come per esempio un centro di ricerca, ma anche la visita a un rain garden, piuttosto che a un parco urbano per mostrare gli effetti del cambiamento climatico o illustrare i benefici del verde urbano per i cittadini ecc.

**Attività con le scuole**
• Ripetere a Villa Necchi Campiglio l’open day per gli insegnanti di ogni ordine;
• dedicare l’annuale contest destinato agli studenti al tema del cambiamento climatico. Ogni anno uno street artist viene incaricato della realizzazione di tre proposte grafiche per un murales su un tema indicato dal FAI. Le proposte vengono sottoposte al voto degli studenti e la vincitrice viene realizzata in una città con vernici assorbismog (Airlite);
• durante gli incontri di formazione sensibilizzare gli “Apprendisti Ciceroni” sul tema del cambiamento climatico. Gli Apprendisti Ciceroni sono studenti di ogni ordine e grado formati per accompagnare il pubblico durante le Giornate FAI di Primavera.  |

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Nel Climate City Contract possono essere valorizzate strategie, progetti e strumenti che favoriscono il raggiungimento degli obiettivi pur agendo indirettamente sulla riduzione delle emissioni.

Tali azioni dovranno essere sempre in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.
A titolo di esempio, una lista non esaustiva di tipologie di azioni o programmi di azione:

Coinvolgere le comunità nella formulazione di progetti incoraggiando un approccio partecipativo.

Sostenere finanziariamente soggetti o progetti che adottano pratiche in linea con gli obiettivi di riduzione delle emissioni.

Promuovere l'uso di mezzi di trasporto sostenibili come biciclette, mezzi pubblici e veicoli elettrici.

Sensibilizzare i cittadini sull'importanza dell'efficienza energetica nelle abitazioni.

Promuovere l'adozione di tecnologie a basso consumo energetico e pratiche di costruzione sostenibili.

Educare i cittadini sulla corretta gestione dei rifiuti e incentivare il riciclo.

Promuovere abitudini alimentari sostenibili, come la riduzione del consumo di carne e la preferenza per prodotti locali e stagionali.

Coinvolgere attivamente i cittadini nelle decisioni riguardanti la sostenibilità urbana.

Creare piattaforme di partecipazione civica e fornire strumenti per la condivisione di idee e progetti.

Condurre campagne di sensibilizzazione sui cambiamenti climatici e sulle azioni che i cittadini possono intraprendere.

Promuovere la creazione e la manutenzione di spazi verdi urbani coinvolgendo i cittadini nella piantumazione di alberi e nella conservazione della biodiversità locale.

Integrare temi legati alla sostenibilità nei programmi scolastici.

Coinvolgere le scuole in progetti e iniziative a favore dell'ambiente.

Incoraggiare le imprese locali ad adottare pratiche sostenibili e a ridurre l'impatto ambientale delle loro attività.

SCHEDA – Strategie e azioni puntuali

Si possono descrivere qui in generale strategie ed iniziative con impatti, anche indiretti, sulla neutralità climatica della città al 2030, a partire dagli ambiti privilegiati energia ed edifici; verde e forestazione, mobilità, economia circolare.

La vastità dell'impatto delle attività antropiche sull'ambiente necessita una risposta condivisa tra forze sociali e istituzioni per uno sviluppo sostenibile a tutti i livelli.

Attivazione e convergenza di forze diverse e lavoro di rete in grado di integrare energie pubbliche, private e del privato-sociale possono, infatti, innescare soluzioni più robuste e con maggiori probabilità di successo per numerose problematiche di carattere ambientale, economico e sociale.

Tale approccio è particolarmente efficace per affrontare le sfide climatiche a livello territoriale.

Fondazione Cariplo sta realizzando, direttamente o tramite gli enti filantropici collegati e le proprie società strumentali, diverse iniziative per il contrasto al cambiamento climatico, tra cui il sostegno ad azioni di mitigazione, adattamento, monitoraggio e comunicazione, nonché di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile e di economia circolare, molte delle quali sono state e saranno realizzate nel territorio del comune di Milano.

Sebbene lo strumento principale dell'Area Ambiente attualmente operativo, la Call for ideas Strategia clima, stia sostenendo territori lombardi fuori da Milano (sono in corso di implementazione 8 Strategie di Transizione Climatica (STC) con contributi complessivi pari a 12,5, tra cui la STC "Cli.C. Bergamo!" del comune di Bergamo, anch'esso compreso tra le 100 climate-neutral and smart cities), sono state recentemente realizzate numerose altre attività. Si citano in particolare:

Il progetto Territori Virtuosi con riferimento all'efficientamento energetico delle scuole della Città Metropolitana di Milano, di cui 62 nel territorio del comune di Milano (cfr. Scheda allegata);
Il progetto ClimaMI, climatologia per le attività professionali e l'adattamento ai cambiamenti climatici urbani nel milanese (cfr. Scheda allegata);
L'iniziativa F2Click che ha portato anche all'attenzione dei cittadini milanesi, mediante affissioni in metropolitana e per la città, fotografie mirate a sensibilizzare sul cambiamento climatico e sulle possibili soluzioni;
Convegno Metropoli Agricole: l'edizione 2021 dell'annuale convegno milanese ha posto l'accento sulla relazione tra agricoltura e crisi climatica, cercando di approfondire possibili risposte e approcci verso la sostenibilità Agricoltura e crisi climatica: risposte e approcci verso la sostenibilità.

Oltre all'area Ambiente, anche le altre aree filantropiche sono attive sui temi della sostenibilità e hanno contribuito a numerosi progetti di enorme rilevanza per la città di Milano, tra cui a titolo di esempio:

Area Ricerca Scientifica: Food Policy del Comune di Milano (Food Policy Milano) e relativi food hub; Bandi Economia Circolare, che coinvolgono numerose università milanesi; Circular Economy Lab, nato dalla collaborazione tra Cariplo Factory e Intesa SanPaolo Innovation Center.
Area Servizi alla persona: progetto QuBi contro la povertà infantile;
Area Arte e Cultura: programma LaCittàIntorno dedicato alla riattivazione di spazi inutilizzati o in stato di degrado in alcune periferie della città e al coinvolgimento dei cittadini, anche attraverso patti di collaborazione su aree verdi e altri spazi.

Recentemente, Comune di Milano e Fondazione Cariplo hanno dato vita ad una collaborazione mirata alla rigenerazione dei quartieri di Edilizia residenziale pubblica (ERP) attraverso la strutturazione di progetti pilota. Fondazione Cariplo metterà a disposizione oltre 1,6 milioni di euro per l'elaborazione dei Programmi urbani strategici d'area (PUSA) su alcune aree scelte dall'Amministrazione comunale, con l'obiettivo di svolgere le fasi propedeutiche per attivare risorse più ingenti legate al PNRR e alle risorse sul territorio. A tale attività parteciperanno anche Fondazione Housing Sociale, che mette a disposizione competenze tecniche e finanziarie sviluppate nell'ambito della promozione e sviluppo del social housing in Italia, e Fondazione Comunitaria di Milano, che costituirà un Fondo dedicato grazie al contributo iniziale di Fondazione Cariplo.

È inoltre in previsione da parte di Fondazione Cariplo, in collaborazione con gli esperti dell'impresa sociale Edera, anche un'ulteriore attività dedicata all'edilizia residenziale pubblica milanese, relativa al suo Deep Retrofitting industrializzato secondo il modello Energiesprong. Un modulo di questo studio verrà inoltre destinato al Tactical Housing, consistente nella creazione di alloggi modulari con caratteristiche di temporaneità, basso impatto ambientale e circularità con il medesimo approccio industrializzato, particolarmente rilevanti nei casi di ristrutturazione degli edifici ERP.

Per quanto riguarda gli enti filantropici collegati a Fondazione Cariplo e le sue società strumentali, si evidenzia l'importante ruolo di:

Fondazione Comunità di Milano ETS sostiene interventi di utilità sociale per rispondere ai bisogni di oltre 2 milioni di cittadine e cittadini di Milano e di 56 Comuni nelle aree Sud Ovest, Sud Est, Adda Martesana della città metropolitana.

In particolare, insieme a Fondazione Comunitaria del Ticino Olona e Fondazione Comunitaria Nord Milano, sostiene il progetto Forestami, a cui partecipano Comune di Milano, Città metropolitana di Milano, Regione Lombardia, Parco Nord Milano, Parco Agricolo Sud Milano, ERSAF, oltre alle università milanesi Politecnico, Statale e Bicocca. Il progetto si pone i seguenti obiettivi: mettere a dimora 3 milioni di alberi entro il 2030 (grazie anche ai fondi pubblici che il gruppo di lavoro di Forestami sarà in grado di catalizzare attraverso la partecipazione a bandi ministeriali, bandi regionali, bandi europei, PSR, PNRR etc); far crescere il capitale naturale del tessuto urbano e periurbano; contribuire a mitigare l'inquinamento atmosferico; contribuire a migliorare la qualità della vita nella grande Milano contrastando al tempo stesso gli effetti del cambiamento climatico.

Dall'avvio del progetto nel 2020, sono state messe a dimora 560.001 piante (tra alberi e arbusti), di cui oltre $60.000^{1}$ piante grazie alle donazioni raccolte dal Fondo Forestami, gestito da Fondazione Comunità di Milano. Secondo il calcolo del gruppo di ricerca del progetto, si stima che tutte le piante messe a dimora possano contribuire al sequestro di 22.400 ton/CO₂ assorbita. Per le piante messe a dimora grazie al Fondo Forestami i numeri sono pari a 2.400 t di CO₂, 129,02 t di biossido d'azoto e di 3,27 t di PM10.

Fondazione Housing Sociale (FHS) persegue fini di solidarietà sociale e intende contribuire a risolvere il problema abitativo.

REDO sgr (certificata B Corp) si occupa di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile e housing sociale.

Il numero non considera i risarcimenti delle piante morte a causa delle condizioni atmosferiche estreme dell'estate 2022 e 2023.
FHS e REDO insieme hanno realizzato diversi interventi nel comune di Milano, tra cui edifici a "zero emissioni". REDO - con il contributo progettuale di FHS - sta realizzando i primi progetti di social housing carbon neutral, in conformità con le richieste del concorso internazionale Reinventing Cities e con le Linee Guida delle Aree Carbon Neutral del Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano. L'INNESTO, riqualificazione dell'ex scalo ferroviario di Milano Greco Breda, Green Between, riqualificazione di un parcheggio ATM a Crescenzago, e ARIA, rigenerazione dell'area dell'Ex Macello di Milano, sono tre progetti impegnati ad azzerare nell'arco di 50 anni, sia le emissioni in fase di esercizio, che le emissioni di $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$ messe in gioco con la costruzione stessa degli edifici. Questi interventi sono dettagliatamente descritti nella Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica-Operatori prodotta e consegnata da REDO per Climate City Contract della Città di Milano.

Fondazione Social Venture Giordano Dell'Amore è impegnata nello sviluppo dell'impact investing e dell'innovazione sociale, secondo i principi di inclusione e sostenibilità. È attivamente coinvolta nel sostegno a iniziative volte a ridurre le emissioni di gas climalteranti attraverso l'offerta di competenze e capitale paziente a favore di progetti imprenditoriali, alcuni dei quali sono descritti nelle Schede di dettaglio allegate.

Nella scheda seguente possono essere raccolti interventi e azioni puntuali coerenti con gli obiettivi della Missione.

|   | **Descrizione dell'azione/progetto/intervento**
Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti identificati | Con il progetto Territori Virtuosi è stato promosso un modello virtuoso dell'efficienza energetica, che permette di finanziare gli interventi di efficientamento energetico degli edifici pubblici con i risparmi economici ottenuti dalla riduzione dei consumi energetici, basandosi principalmente su:

• Partenariato Pubblico Privato (PPP): forma di cooperazione tra i poteri pubblici e i privati che hanno lo scopo di finanziare, costruire e gestire infrastrutture o fornire servizi di interesse pubblico;
• “modello ESCo”: un servizio integrato per la realizzazione, e successiva gestione, di interventi per il risparmio energetico con garanzia di risultato, che viene compensato, in base ai risultati, con i risparmi conseguiti;
• Energy Performance Contract (EPC): il contratto di risparmio energetico con garanzia di risultato è lo strumento con cui sono regolati i complessi rapporti che il PPP e il modello ESCo impongono.

La Fondazione tramite il progetto Territori Virtuosi ha fornito un servizio di accompagnamento tecnico, legale ed economico-finanziario per l'individuazione di una Energy Service Company (ESCo) in grado di realizzare interventi di efficientamento energetico con capitale proprio o di terzi.  |

Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti identificati | Il progetto si propone di restituire dignità ai prodotti classificati come “scarto” – poiché esteticamente imperfetti ma “belli dentro” – promuovendo una filiera distributiva alternativa a quella tradizionale, più etica e sostenibile. In concreto, acquista direttamente dagli agricoltori quei prodotti orto-frutticoli di ottima qualità, che solitamente non vengono accettati dai consorzi/cooperative e dalla grande distribuzione. Una parte viene venduta fresca e sfusa nel negozio di via Pergolesi o utilizzata come materia prima per i punti di somministrazione e un'altra parte viene trasformata in succhi, confetture ed essiccati grazie al lavoro di due cooperative sociali dedite all'inserimento lavorativo e alla formazione di persone fragili e con disabilità.  |

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Nel Climate City Contract possono essere valorizzate strategie, progetti e strumenti che favoriscono il raggiungimento degli obiettivi pur agendo indirettamente sulla riduzione delle emissioni.

Tali azioni dovranno essere sempre in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.
A titolo di esempio, una lista non esaustiva di tipologie di azioni o programmi di azione:

Coinvolgere le comunità nella formulazione di progetti incoraggiando un approccio partecipativo.

Sostenere finanziariamente soggetti o progetti che adottano pratiche in linea con gli obiettivi di riduzione delle emissioni.

Promuovere l'uso di mezzi di trasporto sostenibili come biciclette, mezzi pubblici e veicoli elettrici.

Sensibilizzare i cittadini sull'importanza dell'efficienza energetica nelle abitazioni.

Promuovere l'adozione di tecnologie a basso consumo energetico e pratiche di costruzione sostenibili.

Educare i cittadini sulla corretta gestione dei rifiuti e incentivare il riciclo.

Promuovere abitudini alimentari sostenibili, come la riduzione del consumo di carne e la preferenza per prodotti locali e stagionali.

Coinvolgere attivamente i cittadini nelle decisioni riguardanti la sostenibilità urbana.

Creare piattaforme di partecipazione civica e fornire strumenti per la condivisione di idee e progetti.

Condurre campagne di sensibilizzazione sui cambiamenti climatici e sulle azioni che i cittadini possono intraprendere.

Promuovere la creazione e la manutenzione di spazi verdi urbani coinvolgendo i cittadini nella piantumazione di alberi e nella conservazione della biodiversità locale.

Integrare temi legati alla sostenibilità nei programmi scolastici.

Coinvolgere le scuole in progetti e iniziative a favore dell'ambiente.

SCHEDA – Strategie e azioni puntuali

Si possono descrivere qui in generale strategie ed iniziative con impatti, anche indiretti, sulla neutralità climatica della città al 2030, a partire dagli ambiti privilegiati energia ed edifici; verde e forestazione, mobilità, economia circolare.

La vastità dell'impatto delle attività antropiche sull'ambiente necessita una risposta condivisa tra forze sociali e istituzioni per uno sviluppo sostenibile a tutti i livelli.

Attivazione e convergenza di forze diverse e lavoro di rete in grado di integrare energie pubbliche, private e del privato-sociale possono, infatti, innescare soluzioni più robuste e con maggiori probabilità di successo per numerose problematiche di carattere ambientale, economico e sociale.

Tale approccio è particolarmente efficace per affrontare le sfide climatiche a livello territoriale.

Fondazione Cariplo sta realizzando, direttamente o tramite gli enti filantropici collegati e le proprie società strumentali, diverse iniziative per il contrasto al cambiamento climatico, tra cui il sostegno ad azioni di mitigazione, adattamento, monitoraggio e comunicazione, nonché di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile e di economia circolare, molte delle quali sono state e saranno realizzate nel territorio del comune di Milano.

Sebbene lo strumento principale dell'Area Ambiente attualmente operativo, la Call for ideas Strategia clima, stia sostenendo territori lombardi fuori da Milano (sono in corso di implementazione 8 Strategie di Transizione Climatica (STC) con contributi complessivi pari a 12,5, tra cui la STC "Cli.C. Bergamo!" del comune di Bergamo, anch'esso compreso tra le 100 climate-neutral and smart cities), sono state recentemente realizzate numerose altre attività. Si citano in particolare:

Il progetto Territori Virtuosi con riferimento all'efficientamento energetico delle scuole della Città Metropolitana di Milano, di cui 62 nel territorio del comune di Milano (cfr. Scheda allegata);
Il progetto ClimaMI, climatologia per le attività professionali e l'adattamento ai cambiamenti climatici urbani nel milanese (cfr. Scheda allegata);
L'iniziativa F2Click che ha portato anche all'attenzione dei cittadini milanesi, mediante affissioni in metropolitana e per la città, fotografie mirate a sensibilizzare sul cambiamento climatico e sulle possibili soluzioni;
Convegno Metropoli Agricole: l'edizione 2021 dell'annuale convegno milanese ha posto l'accento sulla relazione tra agricoltura e crisi climatica, cercando di approfondire possibili risposte e approcci verso la sostenibilità Agricoltura e crisi climatica: risposte e approcci verso la sostenibilità.

Oltre all'area Ambiente, anche le altre aree filantropiche sono attive sui temi della sostenibilità e hanno contribuito a numerosi progetti di enorme rilevanza per la città di Milano, tra cui a titolo di esempio:

Area Ricerca Scientifica: Food Policy del Comune di Milano (Food Policy Milano) e relativi food hub; Bandi Economia Circolare, che coinvolgono numerose università milanesi; Circular Economy Lab, nato dalla collaborazione tra Cariplo Factory e Intesa SanPaolo Innovation Center.
Area Servizi alla persona: progetto QuBi contro la povertà infantile;
Area Arte e Cultura: programma LaCittàIntorno dedicato alla riattivazione di spazi inutilizzati o in stato di degrado in alcune periferie della città e al coinvolgimento dei cittadini, anche attraverso patti di collaborazione su aree verdi e altri spazi.

Recentemente, Comune di Milano e Fondazione Cariplo hanno dato vita ad una collaborazione mirata alla rigenerazione dei quartieri di Edilizia residenziale pubblica (ERP) attraverso la strutturazione di progetti pilota. Fondazione Cariplo metterà a disposizione oltre 1,6 milioni di euro per l'elaborazione dei Programmi urbani strategici d'area (PUSA) su alcune aree scelte dall'Amministrazione comunale, con l'obiettivo di svolgere le fasi propedeutiche per attivare risorse più ingenti legate al PNRR e alle risorse sul territorio. A tale attività parteciperanno anche Fondazione Housing Sociale, che mette a disposizione competenze tecniche e finanziarie sviluppate nell'ambito della promozione e sviluppo del social housing in Italia, e Fondazione Comunitaria di Milano, che costituirà un Fondo dedicato grazie al contributo iniziale di Fondazione Cariplo.

È inoltre in previsione da parte di Fondazione Cariplo, in collaborazione con gli esperti dell'impresa sociale Edera, anche un'ulteriore attività dedicata all'edilizia residenziale pubblica milanese, relativa al suo Deep Retrofitting industrializzato secondo il modello Energiesprong. Un modulo di questo studio verrà inoltre destinato al Tactical Housing, consistente nella creazione di alloggi modulari con caratteristiche di temporaneità, basso impatto ambientale e circularità con il medesimo approccio industrializzato, particolarmente rilevanti nei casi di ristrutturazione degli edifici ERP.

Per quanto riguarda gli enti filantropici collegati a Fondazione Cariplo e le sue società strumentali, si evidenzia l'importante ruolo di:

Fondazione Comunità di Milano ETS sostiene interventi di utilità sociale per rispondere ai bisogni di oltre 2 milioni di cittadine e cittadini di Milano e di 56 Comuni nelle aree Sud Ovest, Sud Est, Adda Martesana della città metropolitana.

In particolare, insieme a Fondazione Comunitaria del Ticino Olona e Fondazione Comunitaria Nord Milano, sostiene il progetto Forestami, a cui partecipano Comune di Milano, Città metropolitana di Milano, Regione Lombardia, Parco Nord Milano, Parco Agricolo Sud Milano, ERSAF, oltre alle università milanesi Politecnico, Statale e Bicocca. Il progetto si pone i seguenti obiettivi: mettere a dimora 3 milioni di alberi entro il 2030 (grazie anche ai fondi pubblici che il gruppo di lavoro di Forestami sarà in grado di catalizzare attraverso la partecipazione a bandi ministeriali, bandi regionali, bandi europei, PSR, PNRR etc); far crescere il capitale naturale del tessuto urbano e periurbano; contribuire a mitigare l'inquinamento atmosferico; contribuire a migliorare la qualità della vita nella grande Milano contrastando al tempo stesso gli effetti del cambiamento climatico.

Dall'avvio del progetto nel 2020, sono state messe a dimora 560.001 piante (tra alberi e arbusti), di cui oltre $60.000^{1}$ piante grazie alle donazioni raccolte dal Fondo Forestami, gestito da Fondazione Comunità di Milano. Secondo il calcolo del gruppo di ricerca del progetto, si stima che tutte le piante messe a dimora possano contribuire al sequestro di 22.400 ton/CO₂ assorbita. Per le piante messe a dimora grazie al Fondo Forestami i numeri sono pari a 2.400 t di CO₂, 129,02 t di biossido d'azoto e di 3,27 t di PM10.

Fondazione Housing Sociale (FHS) persegue fini di solidarietà sociale e intende contribuire a risolvere il problema abitativo.

REDO sgr (certificata B Corp) si occupa di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile e housing sociale.

Il numero non considera i risarcimenti delle piante morte a causa delle condizioni atmosferiche estreme dell'estate 2022 e 2023.
FHS e REDO insieme hanno realizzato diversi interventi nel comune di Milano, tra cui edifici a "zero emissioni". REDO - con il contributo progettuale di FHS - sta realizzando i primi progetti di social housing carbon neutral, in conformità con le richieste del concorso internazionale Reinventing Cities e con le Linee Guida delle Aree Carbon Neutral del Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano. L'INNESTO, riqualificazione dell'ex scalo ferroviario di Milano Greco Breda, Green Between, riqualificazione di un parcheggio ATM a Crescenzago, e ARIA, rigenerazione dell'area dell'Ex Macello di Milano, sono tre progetti impegnati ad azzerare nell'arco di 50 anni, sia le emissioni in fase di esercizio, che le emissioni di $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$ messe in gioco con la costruzione stessa degli edifici. Questi interventi sono dettagliatamente descritti nella Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica-Operatori prodotta e consegnata da REDO per Climate City Contract della Città di Milano.

Fondazione Social Venture Giordano Dell'Amore è impegnata nello sviluppo dell'impact investing e dell'innovazione sociale, secondo i principi di inclusione e sostenibilità. È attivamente coinvolta nel sostegno a iniziative volte a ridurre le emissioni di gas climalteranti attraverso l'offerta di competenze e capitale paziente a favore di progetti imprenditoriali, alcuni dei quali sono descritti nelle Schede di dettaglio allegate.

Nella scheda seguente possono essere raccolti interventi e azioni puntuali coerenti con gli obiettivi della Missione.

|   | **Descrizione dell'azione/progetto/intervento**
Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti identificati | Con il progetto Territori Virtuosi è stato promosso un modello virtuoso dell'efficienza energetica, che permette di finanziare gli interventi di efficientamento energetico degli edifici pubblici con i risparmi economici ottenuti dalla riduzione dei consumi energetici, basandosi principalmente su:

• Partenariato Pubblico Privato (PPP): forma di cooperazione tra i poteri pubblici e i privati che hanno lo scopo di finanziare, costruire e gestire infrastrutture o fornire servizi di interesse pubblico;
• “modello ESCo”: un servizio integrato per la realizzazione, e successiva gestione, di interventi per il risparmio energetico con garanzia di risultato, che viene compensato, in base ai risultati, con i risparmi conseguiti;
• Energy Performance Contract (EPC): il contratto di risparmio energetico con garanzia di risultato è lo strumento con cui sono regolati i complessi rapporti che il PPP e il modello ESCo impongono.

La Fondazione tramite il progetto Territori Virtuosi ha fornito un servizio di accompagnamento tecnico, legale ed economico-finanziario per l'individuazione di una Energy Service Company (ESCo) in grado di realizzare interventi di efficientamento energetico con capitale proprio o di terzi.  |

Fornire una descrizione generale del progetto relativamente agli ambiti identificati | Il progetto si propone di restituire dignità ai prodotti classificati come “scarto” – poiché esteticamente imperfetti ma “belli dentro” – promuovendo una filiera distributiva alternativa a quella tradizionale, più etica e sostenibile. In concreto, acquista direttamente dagli agricoltori quei prodotti orto-frutticoli di ottima qualità, che solitamente non vengono accettati dai consorzi/cooperative e dalla grande distribuzione. Una parte viene venduta fresca e sfusa nel negozio di via Pergolesi o utilizzata come materia prima per i punti di somministrazione e un'altra parte viene trasformata in succhi, confetture ed essiccati grazie al lavoro di due cooperative sociali dedite all'inserimento lavorativo e alla formazione di persone fragili e con disabilità.  |

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Nel Climate City Contract possono essere valorizzate strategie, progetti e strumenti che favoriscono il raggiungimento degli obiettivi pur agendo indirettamente sulla riduzione delle emissioni.

Tali azioni dovranno essere sempre in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.
A titolo di esempio, una lista non esaustiva di tipologie di azioni o programmi di azione:

Coinvolgere le comunità nella formulazione di progetti incoraggiando un approccio partecipativo.

Sostenere finanziariamente soggetti o progetti che adottano pratiche in linea con gli obiettivi di riduzione delle emissioni.

Promuovere l'uso di mezzi di trasporto sostenibili come biciclette, mezzi pubblici e veicoli elettrici.

Sensibilizzare i cittadini sull'importanza dell'efficienza energetica nelle abitazioni.

Promuovere l'adozione di tecnologie a basso consumo energetico e pratiche di costruzione sostenibili.

Educare i cittadini sulla corretta gestione dei rifiuti e incentivare il riciclo.

Promuovere abitudini alimentari sostenibili, come la riduzione del consumo di carne e la preferenza per prodotti locali e stagionali.

Coinvolgere attivamente i cittadini nelle decisioni riguardanti la sostenibilità urbana.

Creare piattaforme di partecipazione civica e fornire strumenti per la condivisione di idee e progetti.

Condurre campagne di sensibilizzazione sui cambiamenti climatici e sulle azioni che i cittadini possono intraprendere.

Promuovere la creazione e la manutenzione di spazi verdi urbani coinvolgendo i cittadini nella piantumazione di alberi e nella conservazione della biodiversità locale.

Integrare temi legati alla sostenibilità nei programmi scolastici.

Coinvolgere le scuole in progetti e iniziative a favore dell'ambiente.

Incoraggiare le imprese locali ad adottare pratiche sostenibili e a ridurre l'impatto ambientale delle loro attività.

## NOTE PER LA COMPILAZIONE

Il questionario è in formato editabile, vi chiediamo gentilmente di compilare i riquadri destinati alle risposte, compatibilmente con la disponibilità dei dati e l'avanzamento dei progetti, eventualmente replicando le tabelle per ciascuna progettualità che si intende presentare.

Preghiamo di darci riscontro della ricezione del questionario e di inviare il questionario compilato entro il 20 gennaio 2024, all'indirizzo di rossana.torri@comune.milano.it, marta.papetti@amat-mi.it e manuela.ojan@amat-mi.it
SCHEDA – Strategie e azioni puntuali

Si possono descrivere qui in generale strategie ed iniziative con impatti, anche indiretti, sulla neutralità climatica della città al 2030, a partire dagli ambiti privilegiati energia ed edifici; verde e forestazione, mobilità, economia circolare.

GBC Italia si propone come soggetto abilitatore che può mettere in campo le seguenti azioni, che derivano dalla propria esperienza.

Supporto per l'adozione dei protocolli di sostenibilità per la certificazione dei green building (dall'edificio al quartiere) all'interno della regolamentazione comunale (es. Piano di Governo del Territorio) utili per guidare gli investimenti verso un livello di sostenibilità misurabile, con la possibilità quindi di associare delle premialità in funzione del livello di qualità ambientale e sociale raggiunta.
Supporto per la raccolta dei dati di impatto dell'edilizia sostenibile, sulla base di quanto recentemente fatto su scala nazionale. Questa attività potrebbe restituire una stima di riduzione dell'impatto in termini di minori emissioni di CO₂, maggiore circolarità, ecc.. dei green buildings presenti nella città di Milano, di cui GBC Italia dispone di dati prestazionali. L'analisi di riduzione dell'impatto ambientale potrebbe poi essere proiettata al 2030 sulla base delle informazioni di sviluppo dei green building disponibili a GBC Italia.
Pubblicazione ed aggiornamento della mappa dei green building della città di Milano, e più in generale delle aree ed edifici che traguardano obiettivi di sostenibilità utili alla neutralità climatica, con l'obiettivo di coinvolgere la cittadinanza nella comprensione dell'evoluzione della città.
Guida alla personalizzazione di una roadmap per la transizione ecologica della città, sulla base della roadmap nazionale recentemente pubblicata, nella quale sono individuati obiettivi e azioni specifici per le amministrazioni locali, coordinate con le azioni ed obiettivi degli altri stakeholder pubblici e privati della filiera

Queste proposte hanno l'intento di fornire all'Amministrazione Comunale un set di strumenti da utilizzarsi a supporto e per la gestione di diverse azioni: guida degli investimenti (rating dei green building), monitoraggio e stima dei risultati (analisi di impatto), coinvolgimento della popolazione (mappa della città green) e la pianificazione delle azioni nel medio lungo periodo (roadmap di transizione).

Nella scheda seguente possono essere raccolti interventi e azioni puntuali coerenti con gli obiettivi della Missione.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Nel Climate City Contract possono essere valorizzate strategie, progetti e strumenti che favoriscono il raggiungimento degli obiettivi pur agendo indirettamente sulla riduzione delle emissioni.

Tali azioni dovranno essere sempre in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.
A titolo di esempio, una lista non esaustiva di tipologie di azioni o programmi di azione:

Coinvolgere le comunità nella formulazione di progetti incoraggiando un approccio partecipativo.

Sostenere finanziariamente soggetti o progetti che adottano pratiche in linea con gli obiettivi di riduzione delle emissioni.

Promuovere l'uso di mezzi di trasporto sostenibili come biciclette, mezzi pubblici e veicoli elettrici.

Sensibilizzare i cittadini sull'importanza dell'efficienza energetica nelle abitazioni.

Promuovere l'adozione di tecnologie a basso consumo energetico e pratiche di costruzione sostenibili.

Educare i cittadini sulla corretta gestione dei rifiuti e incentivare il riciclo.

Promuovere abitudini alimentari sostenibili, come la riduzione del consumo di carne e la preferenza per prodotti locali e stagionali.

Coinvolgere attivamente i cittadini nelle decisioni riguardanti la sostenibilità urbana.

Creare piattaforme di partecipazione civica e fornire strumenti per la condivisione di idee e progetti.

Condurre campagne di sensibilizzazione sui cambiamenti climatici e sulle azioni che i cittadini possono intraprendere.

Promuovere la creazione e la manutenzione di spazi verdi urbani coinvolgendo i cittadini nella piantumazione di alberi e nella conservazione della biodiversità locale.

Integrare temi legati alla sostenibilità nei programmi scolastici.

Coinvolgere le scuole in progetti e iniziative a favore dell'ambiente.

Incoraggiare le imprese locali ad adottare pratiche sostenibili e a ridurre l'impatto ambientale delle loro attività.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Nel Climate City Contract possono essere valorizzate strategie, progetti e strumenti che favoriscono il raggiungimento degli obiettivi pur agendo indirettamente sulla riduzione delle emissioni.

Tali azioni dovranno essere sempre in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.
A titolo di esempio, una lista non esaustiva di tipologie di azioni o programmi di azione:

Coinvolgere le comunità nella formulazione di progetti incoraggiando un approccio partecipativo.

Sostenere finanziariamente soggetti o progetti che adottano pratiche in linea con gli obiettivi di riduzione delle emissioni.

Promuovere l'uso di mezzi di trasporto sostenibili come biciclette, mezzi pubblici e veicoli elettrici.

Sensibilizzare i cittadini sull'importanza dell'efficienza energetica nelle abitazioni.

Promuovere l'adozione di tecnologie a basso consumo energetico e pratiche di costruzione sostenibili.

Educare i cittadini sulla corretta gestione dei rifiuti e incentivare il riciclo.

Promuovere abitudini alimentari sostenibili, come la riduzione del consumo di carne e la preferenza per prodotti locali e stagionali.

Coinvolgere attivamente i cittadini nelle decisioni riguardanti la sostenibilità urbana.

Creare piattaforme di partecipazione civica e fornire strumenti per la condivisione di idee e progetti.

Condurre campagne di sensibilizzazione sui cambiamenti climatici e sulle azioni che i cittadini possono intraprendere.

Promuovere la creazione e la manutenzione di spazi verdi urbani coinvolgendo i cittadini nella piantumazione di alberi e nella conservazione della biodiversità locale.

Integrare temi legati alla sostenibilità nei programmi scolastici.

Coinvolgere le scuole in progetti e iniziative a favore dell'ambiente.

Incoraggiare le imprese locali ad adottare pratiche sostenibili e a ridurre l'impatto ambientale delle loro attività.

SCHEDA – Strategie e azioni puntuali

Si possono descrivere qui in generale strategie ed iniziative con impatti, anche indiretti, sulla neutralità climatica della città al 2030, a partire dagli ambiti privilegiati energia ed edifici; verde e forestazione, mobilità, economia circolare.

Energia: promuovere azioni di sufficienza, non solo di efficienza, a partire dagli edifici, sia pubblici sia privati.

Verde e forestazione: introdurre spazi diffusi di forestazione all'interno del tessuto urbano più centrale, iniziando da una mappatura dei sottoservizi.

Mobilità: Limitare il consumo di suolo da parte dei veicoli a motore mediante tassazione della sosta su suolo pubblico, anche in base alla classe ecologica (AreaB a priorità di suolo, non di ingresso); promozione di una mobilità ciclistica diffusa (ogni luogo – tempo – suolo – carico) come modalità prioritaria di mobilità individuale; eliminare dalle politiche pubbliche l’equivoco delle ‘emissioni zero’.

Economia circolare: rendere più chiaro e accessibile il conferimento delle diverse frazioni di rifiuto nello spazio urbano, con segnaletica tattica integrata e multilingue.

Nella scheda seguente possono essere raccolti interventi e azioni puntuali coerenti con gli obiettivi della Missione.

# Raccolta delle azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti:
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti /efficientamento dei processi, reti locali di riscaldamento e raffrescamento, ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature Based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi, laddove disponibili, utili a dare un quadro di dettaglio sulle progettualità presentate.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Nel Climate City Contract possono essere valorizzate strategie, progetti e strumenti che favoriscono il raggiungimento degli obiettivi pur agendo indirettamente sulla riduzione delle emissioni.

Tali azioni dovranno essere sempre in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.
A titolo di esempio, una lista non esaustiva di tipologie di azioni o programmi di azione:

Coinvolgere le comunità nella formulazione di progetti incoraggiando un approccio partecipativo.

Sostenere finanziariamente soggetti o progetti che adottano pratiche in linea con gli obiettivi di riduzione delle emissioni.

Promuovere l'uso di mezzi di trasporto sostenibili come biciclette, mezzi pubblici e veicoli elettrici.

Sensibilizzare i cittadini sull'importanza dell'efficienza energetica nelle abitazioni.

Promuovere l'adozione di tecnologie a basso consumo energetico e pratiche di costruzione sostenibili.

Educare i cittadini sulla corretta gestione dei rifiuti e incentivare il riciclo.

Promuovere abitudini alimentari sostenibili, come la riduzione del consumo di carne e la preferenza per prodotti locali e stagionali.

Coinvolgere attivamente i cittadini nelle decisioni riguardanti la sostenibilità urbana.

Creare piattaforme di partecipazione civica e fornire strumenti per la condivisione di idee e progetti.

Condurre campagne di sensibilizzazione sui cambiamenti climatici e sulle azioni che i cittadini possono intraprendere.

Promuovere la creazione e la manutenzione di spazi verdi urbani coinvolgendo i cittadini nella piantumazione di alberi e nella conservazione della biodiversità locale.

Integrare temi legati alla sostenibilità nei programmi scolastici.

Coinvolgere le scuole in progetti e iniziative a favore dell'ambiente.

Incoraggiare le imprese locali ad adottare pratiche sostenibili e a ridurre l'impatto ambientale delle loro attività.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (Player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi laddove disponibili, utili ad avere un inquadramento generale della realtà in cui operate e a collocare le progettualità presentate nel contesto milanese.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime-seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (Player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Al fine di ottimizzare le sinergie fra le varie attività che il Comune sta portando avanti in tema di decarbonizzazione (PAC, tavoli con gli Energy Managers di istituzioni e imprese cittadine), è prevista una sezione facoltativa della scheda con la richiesta di alcuni dati aggiuntivi laddove disponibili, utili ad avere un inquadramento generale della realtà in cui operate e a collocare le progettualità presentate nel contesto milanese.

Possono essere valorizzati all'interno del City Contract iniziative e progetti recentemente realizzati (conclusi dopo il 2021) in corso, o previsti, rivolti alla riduzione dei consumi energetici, all'adozione di fonti rinnovabili e più in generale alla decarbonizzazione. Vengono incluse anche le azioni non quantificabili in termini di riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 equivalente purché inerenti agli obiettivi della Missione ed in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.

Gli ambiti di intervento considerati sono: transizione energetica; infrastrutture verdi; trasporti e mobilità sostenibile; economia circolare. A titolo esemplificativo si fornisce una lista (non esaustiva) di possibili azioni nei diversi ambiti.
Sistemi energetici: passaggio a pompa di calore, sistemi ibridi, cogenerazione e trigenerazione; introduzione di BMS (building management systems); installazione di pannelli solari termici/fotovoltaici; acquisto di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili con garanzia di origine; adozione di tecnologie più efficienti/efficientamento dei processi, rete locale di teleriscaldamento/raffrescamento ecc.

Edifici/ambienti interni: Nuovi edifici NZEB/ZEB; riqualificazione involucro, sostituzione serramenti, nuovi sistemi di ombreggiamento; rinnovo impianti di illuminazione, introduzione di sensori di presenza/illuminamento; riorganizzazione degli spazi di lavoro, ecc.

Mobilità/trasporti: Introduzione di piattaforme digitali (e.g. MaaS), installazione di device Internet of Things (IoT); logistica urbana sostenibile: microdepositi/cargo bike/flotte green; rinnovo/elettrificazione flotte; messa a disposizione di colonnine di ricarica elettrica; mobility management; facilitazioni e incentivi per l'utilizzo del trasporto pubblico, mobilità dolce, car sharing e car pooling; smart working e modulazione dell'orario di lavoro, ecc.

Economia circolare e rifiuti: Sistemi efficienti di trattamento rifiuti; sistemi efficienti trattamento acque; Azioni/politiche per la riduzione dell'utilizzo di prodotti monouso; Azioni per l'utilizzo di materie prime-seconde e prodotti di riciclo o di origine naturale rigenerabili, ecc.

Infrastrutture verdi e Nature-based solutions: Riforestazione urbana; Nuove piantumazioni; Pareti e tetti verdi; Sistemi di recupero idrico, ecc.

# 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030

# Climate City Contract della Città di Milano

# Scheda di raccolta azioni per la neutralità climatica

Nell'ambito della Missione europea "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", il Climate City Contract della città di Milano conterrà un portfolio di azioni messe in campo dal Comune e dai partner firmatari per costruire la Milano Carbon Neutral al 2030.

Gli interventi pianificati dal Piano Aria e Clima del Comune di Milano costituiranno la base di partenza (baseline) dell'accelerazione che con la Mission si intende imprimere al processo di transizione.

Per raggiungere la neutralità climatica al 2030, Milano ha proposto in sede di candidatura alla Missione una strategia molecolare che punta a raggiungere la neutralità in una serie di aree della città (cosiddette "molecole") interessate da processi di rigenerazione urbana sostenibile, con progetti di punta e modelli di intervento innovativi e integrati potenzialmente replicabili su altre aree della città, e tra loro integrate da reti e infrastrutture energetiche, del verde, della mobilità.

A partire da questa visione, che mette al centro il territorio, è stato individuato un primo gruppo di soggetti rappresentativi dell'ecosistema della città, invitati a costruire insieme all'Amministrazione il contenuto del Climate City Contract (tra questi, player di operazioni di rigenerazione urbana, cooperative edilizie, Utilities e Società partecipate del Comune di Milano che operano in diversi ambiti chiave per la transizione climatica, Fondazioni filantropiche e realtà rappresentative della società civile che si occupano di ambiente).

Lo scopo della presente scheda è di raccogliere dati e informazioni su strategie e progettualità puntuali da valorizzare nell'ambito del Climate City Contract e del suo "Piano di azione".

Nel Climate City Contract possono essere valorizzate strategie, progetti e strumenti che favoriscono il raggiungimento degli obiettivi pur agendo indirettamente sulla riduzione delle emissioni.

Tali azioni dovranno essere sempre in linea con l'orizzonte temporale del documento, che proietta la strategia di Milano al 2030.
A titolo di esempio, una lista non esaustiva di tipologie di azioni o programmi di azione:

Coinvolgere le comunità nella formulazione di progetti incoraggiando un approccio partecipativo.

Sostenere finanziariamente soggetti o progetti che adottano pratiche in linea con gli obiettivi di riduzione delle emissioni.

Promuovere l'uso di mezzi di trasporto sostenibili come biciclette, mezzi pubblici e veicoli elettrici.

Sensibilizzare i cittadini sull'importanza dell'efficienza energetica nelle abitazioni.

Promuovere l'adozione di tecnologie a basso consumo energetico e pratiche di costruzione sostenibili.

Educare i cittadini sulla corretta gestione dei rifiuti e incentivare il riciclo.

Promuovere abitudini alimentari sostenibili, come la riduzione del consumo di carne e la preferenza per prodotti locali e stagionali.

Coinvolgere attivamente i cittadini nelle decisioni riguardanti la sostenibilità urbana.

Creare piattaforme di partecipazione civica e fornire strumenti per la condivisione di idee e progetti.

Condurre campagne di sensibilizzazione sui cambiamenti climatici e sulle azioni che i cittadini possono intraprendere.

Promuovere la creazione e la manutenzione di spazi verdi urbani coinvolgendo i cittadini nella piantumazione di alberi e nella conservazione della biodiversità locale.

Integrare temi legati alla sostenibilità nei programmi scolastici.

Coinvolgere le scuole in progetti e iniziative a favore dell'ambiente.

Incoraggiare le imprese locali ad adottare pratiche sostenibili e a ridurre l'impatto ambientale delle loro attività.

# 1. Introduction

As anticipated in the introduction of Module B-2 (Paragraph 4.2), an in-depth analysis has been carried out in a pilot area to understand the implications of the deep requalification of the entire built heritage of the city and to build a knowledge base and methodology for the definition of implementing tools.

This study simulated the decarbonization of an entire neighborhood through the use of a dynamic simulation software, assessing its effects in terms of energy consumption, CO2eq emissions and costs.

The results of this study have been parametrically extended to the entire territory (and used for estimates related to the COMIEB3 action) and will be subject to further investigations.

In the following sections, the hypothesis adopted, the process and the results are illustrated.

# 2. Methodology

To perform the dynamic simulation of the energy behaviour of buildings on an area scale, we applied the IES ICD software¹.

The work therefore followed the following steps:

choice of the area to be studied
characterization of the current state of the building stock present in the area by use, type of heating systems, energy performance of the building envelope
simulation of the actual state: energy consumption per carrier and CO2eq emissions
definition of the decarbonisation scenario, i.e. definition of the renovation interventions to be applied for the different types of buildings
simulation of the decarbonisation scenario
evaluation of costs associated with the decarbonisation scenario
analysis of the results

# 2.1. Choice of the area and characterisation

A neighbourhood on the north-eastern outskirts of Milan was selected for the study. The area was chosen for the variety of buildings present there and as some urban regeneration and building redevelopment interventions are located there. It is therefore potentially representative of the molecular approach underlying the Milan commitments.

The area, represented in Figure 1, extends over a surface of  $1.5\mathrm{km}^2$  and includes approximately 650 buildings. The map shows some of the interventions underway or planned in the area, including the redevelopment of public residential buildings (ERP) and the Green Between urban regeneration intervention, falling within Reinventing Cities, part of the portfolio of the Action Plan.

The composition of the building stock in the area is mixed, with a clear prevalence of residential condominiums, as illustrated in the graph below (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Distribution of the buildings by typology

With regards to the construction period, based on ISTAT data and data reported in the energy performance certificates, the prevailing periods are the 1961-80 e 1931-45, as illustrated in the graph below (Figure 3).

In order to reconstruct the energy performance of buildings in their current state, we referred to:

for the geometric characteristics, Open Streetmap and the municipal database
for thermal systems, the regional database of thermal systems (CURIT)
for the performance of the envelope, the data reported in the energy performance certificates also collected in a regional database

In order to characterize all the buildings in the area, we grouped the buildings by construction period and intended use, creating archetypes. The performance characteristics attributed to each archetype were defined on the basis of the statistical analysis of the data present in the databases mentioned above.

The figure below (Figure 4) summarizes the sources of the data used, while Table 1 and Table 2 show the characteristics attributed to each cluster of buildings.

## 2.2. Decarbonisation scenario definition

The decarbonisation scenario was built in a simplified form taking into account the following elements:

architectural constraints on historic buildings (&lt;1930), for which insulation of the envelop was excluded (with the exception of the attic) and it was assumed to maintain gas heating
presence of an autonomous or centralized system, a configuration that was also maintained in the decarbonisation scenario
no intervention on buildings built after 2006

The table below summarizes the hypotheses adopted to construct the scenario.

Table 3: Decarbonization scenario

|  Buildings | External walls | Roofs | Windows | Heating system | DHW system  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  <1930 | No interventions | U=0,24 W/m²K | U= 1,4 W/m²K | Condensing boiler (Natural gas) | Boiler (Natural Gas)  |

# 3. Results assessment

Through the use of IES ICD, energy consumption for heating and domestic hot water production and CO2eq emissions were estimated both in the current state and in the decarbonisation scenario.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 5: Comparison of energy consumption by energy vector

As illustrated in Figure 5, there is generally a decrease in demand (due to the efficiency of the building envelope and systems), with a clear reduction in natural gas consumption (91%) against an increase in electricity consumption³, which has increased more than tenfold, due to the transition to a heat pump.

This is reflected in CO2eq emissions (Figure 6), which decreased by 80%, a value that grows to 86% if we consider 100% renewable electricity.

³ For electric energy the following emission factors were considered: current status 0,246 kgCO2eq/kWh, 2030 projection 0,156 kgCO2eq/kWh, 100% renewable 0 kgCO2eq/kWh

Figure 6: Comparison of GHG emissions

The technical evaluation above has been associated with an economic evaluation, in order to quantify the investments necessary for a deep renovation (as outlined in the decarbonisation scenario) of almost all the buildings in the area and the related payback times.

The estimate of the necessary investments was carried out on the basis of unit cost values (per unit of surface area for interventions on the envelop and per unit of power for thermal systems), taken from the following sources:

Ministry of Ecological Transition Decree n° 75/2022 (maximum costs for 110 % tax relief)⁴
cost reported in the Annual Report on tax reliefs published by ENEA⁵

Furthermore, we assumed two scenarios regarding the possible forms of incentives:

75% tax deductions deferred over 10 years (hypothetical ecobonus scenario, currently under discussion)
100% tax deductions (75% national + 25% added by another entity)

Figure 6 illustrates the results of the economic analysis. For interventions on the entire area the estimated investment is between 190 and 275 million euros.

The payback time on investments is medium-high assuming an incentive of 75%: between 18 and 27 years depending on whether the two extremes of unit cost are considered (Mite Decree

and ENEA Report). The payback times are reduced to around 10 years if we consider an incentive that covers 100% of the costs (always in the form of a deduction spread over 10 years).

# 4. Conclusions and next steps

The following considerations are based on the analysis above.

From an energy and emission point of view, an intervention scenario that leads to an 80% reduction in emissions is ambitious, but still feasible.

The investments associated with the realization of this scenario are high and payback times long (especially for the owners of individual real estate units), even with a 75% tax deduction spread over 10 year⁷.

A 100% tax deduction (for example assuming an additional 25% by other parties) would shorten return time.

Starting from emissions reductions, equal to 10 KTCO₂ eq for the pilot area (approximately 650 buildings), we made a first attempt to extend the results of the study from the pilot area to the entire municipal territory. A first tentative evaluation (used for the COMIEB3 action), considering that the entire Milan built heritage amounts to approximately 65,000 buildings and applying the results of the study with a multiplier to the entire building stock, shows that one million tonnes of CO₂ eq reductions might be obtained.

A more accurate assessment is now in progress, based on the following methodology:

calculation of the reduction in energy consumption, of avoided emissions and costs related to the unit of volume for each identified archetype (Figure 7 shows the example of the results of this analysis for residential buildings from the 1961-1980 construction period)
mapping of the entire Milan building stock according to the identified archetypes and calculation of related volumes
application of the unit values referred to in the first point above to the entire building stock

⁶ It can be increased if 100% renewable electricity and biogas are considered
⁷ Assumption of national basis tax deduction, as a result of the in-progress review of superbonus, previously at 100%

We are also evaluating the opportunity to carry out dynamic simulations on other pilot areas, different from a building, energy (for example served by district heating) and urban planning point of view and to include cooling and electricity from photovoltaics (also in relation to the emerging topic of Renewable Energy Communities)

Finally, the use of programs included in the IES tool is being considered within OSS activities, in particular to perform preliminary analysis of efficiency measures application.
