# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 MARSEILLE INTENDS TO BECOME THE LABORATORY WHERE THE MEDITERRANEAN CARBON NEUTRAL, SOCIALLY DYNAMIC CITIES OF TOMORROW WILL BE PIONEERED.

The commitments made by the City of Marseille, the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolis and the Southern Region to this Climate City Contract are part of a long-standing regional dynamic for sustainable energy transition policies and this will be demonstrated in the timeline presented in the "Commitments" section. The motivations behind this are multiple and are clearly set out in the "Commitments" section.

Our common goal is to make Marseille the laboratory where the Mediterranean carbon neutral, socially dynamic cities of tomorrow will be pioneered.

## An attractive location that remains highly sensitive to climate change

Marseille, and the Aix-Marseille Provence Metropolis in general, has strong physical characteristics which make it highly sensitive to climate change. The Mediterranean regions are experiencing a 25% higher rate of global warming than the terrestrial average, the same also applies to the Alpine regions. Marseille is thus doubly exposed:

within its own region, with increased exposure to the consequences of climate change, involving physical risks (forest fires, torrential rains, etc.) and potential health consequences for its population (exposure to heat waves and ozone pollution during the hotter and windless periods of the year, which are often very hot).
the increased consequences of global warming in the southern Alps, reducing snow cover in winter and accelerating the melting and disappearance of glaciers in summer, are putting the city's water supply at risk, both for domestic supply and for that of its industrial and agricultural sectors.

The region benefits from an attractive Mediterranean climate, although it can occasionally be subjected to more violent climate episodes. These climatic characteristics have a strong influence on the region: specific fauna and flora, major risks, renewable energy potential, impacts on air quality, etc. The Mediterranean climate is characterised by very dry summers and rains that can occasionally be very heavy in the spring and during the months of September and October. Cap Croisette, on the southern coast of Marseille, is the driest place in France with an annual rainfall of around 360 mm. In autumn and spring, severe thunderstorms can occur and cause major flooding in the river valleys and urban areas.

Temperatures are high in summer and remain mild in winter. These specific climatic features contribute strongly to the overall attractiveness of the metropolis.

Finally, the territory is subject to two main winds: the Mistral and the South-East wind. The mistral is the dominant wind, it has a considerable influence on the Provence climate since it is cold, dry and can blow in strong gusts. It considerably increases the wind chill factor. It is also much feared during the summer for its role in spreading wild-fires. The rarer south-easterly wind generally brings the rain. It is usually behind the particularly severe thunderstorms that can occur in autumn and spring.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

Marseille is also a very rich reservoir of biodiversity, which must be preserved, notably by combating urban spread and soil artificialisation. In this sense, the re-wilding of the city and policies to enhance and preserve the sea and coastline are key aspects of our Climate City Contract. The city centre of Marseille has lost half of its tree population over the last 75 years.

More resilient buildings, education and awareness-raising initiatives, the re-wilding of the city, are all key subjects in our Climate City Contract.

## Air quality: a major health issue in Marseille

Many sources of air pollution are present in Marseille. According to ATMOSud, the region's air quality monitoring body, "the main contributors to these emissions are the road and maritime transport sectors, the industrial sector and its energy production and transformation branch, and the emissions caused by domestic heating in the residential sector. The railways, services sector and waste management sector are also present. Note the high levels of photochemical pollution across the department, and beyond, during the summer months which is directly related to metropolis' major industrial and urban centres. Air quality has improved in the city over the last twenty years, this is due to technological progress (notably in the transport, industry and energy sectors) as well as more protective road and urban development policies which take air quality into account, ... However some problems remain, whether local (high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, particles, etc.) or more general (particles, ozone), generating high degrees of human exposure to atmospheric pollutants.

,000 Marseilles residents live in an area where the regulatory limit value for nitrogen dioxide is exceeded; the entire population is exposed to PM2.5 particle levels that exceed the current WHO guidelines.

As one of the city's key priorities, the Climate City Contract actions also aim to reduce these public health impacts.

## A region with a high but massively under-exploited energy potential

Marseille is one of the sunniest areas in mainland France with an average annual sunshine of 1550 kWh/m2 - 15 to 30% more than the other French regions - and 300 days of sunshine per year. The Schéma Régional d'Aménagement et de Développement Durable et d'Egalité des Territoires (Regional Plan for Territorial Planning, Sustainable Development and Equality) sets photovoltaic production targets of 600 to 900 GWh per year by 2030 (i.e. 20 to 25% of 2019 electricity consumption) and solar thermal energy production of around 150 GWh.

The development potential of heating and seawater air conditioning (SWAC) networks is also a major asset. The same regional plan sets the target of 2,000 to 3,000 GWh to be supplied by heating networks in Marseille by 2030. The region also has a potential source of bio-waste that could be methanised to produce biogas, the potential of which has yet to be fully quantified.

Considering all of these potential sources, the share of renewable energy in our energy mix is well on its way to being increased significantly, and this is one of the keystones of our Climate City Contract.

# A region marred by significant inequalities

The region's greatest wealth is its population's diversity, with 111 settlement centres each with its own clear urban and historic identity. Marseille is a young, dynamic city in which the population is taking on the challenges of the future through broad democratic processes. The very strong involvement of its citizens, community associations and artists is developing an urban model built on social and ecological justice for the whole of the Marseille region. However, our region remains socially fractured, marred by social inequality. In 2019  $26\%$  of the overall population and  $40\%$  of tenant households were classed as poor, 38 districts are classed as national priority development zones (QPV) due to the poverty level of their inhabitants.

# An industrial-port centre committed to transition

The "Bassins Est" port area is located in the heart of Marseille; on one hand it generates significant economic activity but, on the other, it also generates significant greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric pollutants. To reduce these nuisances, the Marseille-Fos Port (Grand Port Maritime de Marseille - GPMM) has been implementing the CENAQ system for several years, this involves setting up electrical power connections on the quays to serve passenger ships. The electricity production includes a proportion of renewable energy from photovoltaic installations on various port facility structures. Maritime operators are gradually equipping their ships to use this energy during manoeuvres and dockside operations.

The "Bassins Ouest" port area of Port-Saint Louis, Martigues and Fos-sur-mer, is now France's largest industrial port complex covering almost 10,000 hectares. This area's energy consumption is around 4.5 TWh/year. The zone's industrial businesses, along with the GPMM and local authorities, are committed to industrial decarbonisation processes, in 2023 the zone became one of the first to be accepted for the "low-carbon industrial zones" project call. Although these emissions do not fall within the scope of Marseille's regional assessment, it is important to highlight the synergies that exist within its collective approach to the Climate City Contract.

# 1.2 HOW THE CLIMATE CITY CONTRACT INTERACTS WITH THE OTHER FRAMEWORK DOCUMENTS

The main framework documents on which we base our benchmark are:

The Covenant of Mayors, signed by the City of Marseille in October 2021.
The Metropolitan Climate Air and Energy Plan (PCAEM) as proposed by the Marseille Metropolis, adopted in 2021
The 2020-2030 Mobility Plan (PDM) as proposed by the Marseille Metropolis, adopted in 2021
The Regional Plan for Territorial Planning, Sustainable Development and Equality (Schéma Régional d'Aménagement et de Développement Durable pour l'Egalité des Territoires - SRADDET), approved by the Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur Region in 2019
The National Low Carbon Strategy 2, which sets the national framework for carbon neutrality by 2050, adopted by the decree dated 21 April 2020.

The essential elements for understanding the European, national, regional and local context in which the Climate City Contract is situated are presented in the table in chapter 3.2.1.

The Climate City Contract is a document created in response to the Mission on 100 Carbon Neutral Cities by 2030. It is a document that defines the climate challenge action priorities for the Marseille territory. The Contract and the associated initiatives aim for a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

The document has been put together in a spirit of partnership and through the application of a continuous improvement approach. This first version was drafted over a short period of time between the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023, with the mission of collaboratively defining and highlighting the challenges faced by the main greenhouse gas emitting sectors (scopes 1 and 2), the potential for reducing emissions, and the "gaps" that will have to be crossed to achieve a 75% reduction in emissions.

The City of Marseille and Aix-Marseille Provence Metropolis supported by the Southern Region, co-signatories of this contract, hereby present an initial action plan that will enable a significant reduction in emissions. Other actions will be specified as the contract is revised, thanks to the collective dynamics of the territory's socio-economic and NGO parties.

# 1.3 CONTENT OF THE ACTION PLAN SECTION OF THE CLIMATE CITY CONTRACT

The Climate City Contract is made up of 3 sections:

The "commitments" section, presenting the motivations of the signatories, their strategic priorities and providing a formal idea of how they will work together
The "action plan" section, detailing the carbon diagnostic, the defined strategic objectives, an identification of the actions to be completed and a list of projects identified as contributing to the objectives.
The "budget" section, providing a macroscopic evaluation of the finances already in place to achieve a significant reduction in emissions and, most importantly, those that have yet to be finalised.

This document is the "Action Plan" section, it is organised as follows:

The first part (3 - Part A) concerns the Marseille territory's carbon footprint evaluation, all identified orientations and strategies along with an assessment of the gap between current emission levels and the carbon neutrality objectives.

Our approach is detailed in Chapter A of this document.

The second part (4 - Part B) concerns the actions to be implemented in order to achieve these objectives. The action program and its associated indicators are presented in Chapter B of this document.
The third part (5 - Part C) identifies the innovations to be deployed to achieve carbon neutrality.

The conversion of the carbon neutrality gap into real-world financing requirements, both in terms of infrastructure investment and operational measures, is presented in chapter C of this document, this is then further detailed in the "budget" section of the Climate City Contract.

The "Action Plan" section of the Climate City Contract has been drafted according to the template and guidelines provided by Net Zero Cities, it is illustrated by a large number of diagrams, graphs and explanations to ensure that everyone involved can get a full and complete understand of the local issues at stake. The letters used to name the parts of the document refer to those used in the template provided.

The following diagram illustrates the content of this document.

# 1.4 THE CLIMATE CITY CONTRACT'S SPECIFIC SCOPE AND FOCUS

$\triangleright$  Consideration of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions whilst also using a pragmatic approach to influence directly accessible levers.

In an effort to raise awareness regarding carbon neutrality challenges on the scale of the Marseille territory, the City and its partners have decided to include direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the inventory and illustrate some of the indirect emissions data, classifying them into 3 "scopes", in keeping with applicable standards:

Scope 1: direct GHG emissions - as physically emitted within the region - generated by all activities within the Marseille territory
Scope 2: indirect emissions - not physically emitted within the territory - associated with the consumption of electricity and heat/cold within the Marseille territory
Scope 3: the territory's indirect emissions (food, materials brought in, etc.). In order to measure these indirect emissions, the City of Marseille and its partners have decided to illustrate emissions from the food, transport, waste and new-build constructions sectors within the inventory. This scope should be expanded in the future to provide a more complete vision of the territory's carbon footprint (notably as regards the consumption of goods and services by the local population).

However, given the limited room for manoeuvre of the local authorities and the methodological difficulties in monitoring indirect developments within scope 3, the emission reduction targets and trajectories will be initially based on the emission data from scopes 1 and 2.

However, some of the high impact actions identified in the rest of the document, particularly those regarding mobility, food and the circular economy, will have a direct impact on scope 3.

## Specific focus on mobility

The "mobility and logistics" sector is the Marseille territory's biggest greenhouse gas emitter. Consequently it requires particular attention, both in terms of how emissions and targets will be quantified and in the choice of carbon neutrality priorities to be set for 2030.

Methodology for quantifying GHG emissions

The emissions report shown in paragraph A-1 is based on a "land-parcel" approach provided by ATMO Sud, an air quality monitoring body in charge of providing regional greenhouse gas emissions reports. This report only includes the territory's direct emissions. Therefore, for the mobility &amp; logistics sector, this report only reflects emissions generated within the Marseille territory. It does not reflect emissions generated when local residents travel outside of the Marseille territory, nor does it reflect emissions generated by visitors to Marseille, all of which will have a significant impact on GHG emissions, since these largely involve the use of cars over long distances.

In order to complete the land-parcel approach report, global emissions related to road travel by populations within a catchment area are also included, thanks to data provided by the AGAM, the Metropolitan Urban Planning Office. The logistics sector emissions included concern vehicle circulation (Light Utility Vehicles, Heavy Goods Vehicles) within the Marseille territory, emissions of this type generated outside the territory have not been included.

INDDIGO - March 2023
A geographical area’s mobility policy cannot, by its very nature, be satisfied with a land-parcel approach. It will be therefore necessary to account for all movements within, across, into and out of the city.

Moreover, the mobility and logistics transport methods are manifold, interdependent and subject to regional planning policies.

The Mobility Organisation Authority (AOM) is both metropolitan and regional (for interurban services).

This is why the issues raised in the climate city contract and the portfolio actions reflect this catchment area approach, and extend beyond a strict Marseille perimeter.

# 2. CLIMATE CITY CONTRACT ELABORATION PROCESS

## 2.1 INVOLVEMENT OF ALL CONCERNED PARTIES

Mobilisation of co-signatories and technical partners via 8 thematic commissions

The Climate City Contract was put together by 8 thematic commissions set up in September 2022:

Mobility &amp; logistics,
Buildings,
Energy
Circular economy &amp; waste,
Nature in the city.
Urban agriculture and food,
Education and awareness,
Sea &amp; Coast,
Education &amp; awareness

Each commission is chaired by an elected member of the Marseille City Council and an elected member of the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolitan Council, and includes technical advisors from the three local authorities and key institutional partners (ADEME, AGAM, ATMO Sud, AMU, CNRS, etc.).

An initial mobilisation of NGOs, the business sector and institutional partners

In addition to support received during the application phase, a call for contributions launched in September 2022 by the City and the Metropolis gathered more than a hundred decarbonisation project and solution proposals, this has provided raw material for the Climate City Contract and shows that there is a genuine local dynamic in place.

This first consultation will be repeated and enriched through the on-going process associated with the Climate City Contract such that everyone can be more deeply involved in the evaluation of priorities. This will be done in line with the elements which will enhance the contract provided by the European Commission and its Net Zero Cities agency.

The creation of the Citizen's Assembly for the Future, in 2023, will also ensure long-term public involvement with the approach, with a view to an ambitious, fair and united ecological transition in response to the current climate, ecological and social emergency.

A large number of partners, who will play an essential role in achieving the targeted emission reductions, are already involved in this approach and are listed in the "commitment section" of the contract.

Strong governance

The governance principles and processes associated with the existence of the Climate City Contract are detailed in chapter 4 of the "commitment section" of the contract.

A1 - GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INVENTORY FOR 2019

The data relating to Scopes 1 and 2 - greenhouse gases emitted directly in the territory and those associated with electricity consumption - are taken from the CIGALE database, which was completed by ATMO Sud, a partner of the City of Marseille, Aix Marseille Metropolis and the Southern Region. Scope 3 data was estimated using ADEME's Carbon footprint tool.

OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS

Direct greenhouse gas emissions (scopes 1 and 2), reached approximately 2 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent (tCO₂ᵉ), in 2019. This represents 2.3 tCO₂e/inhabitant.

It should be noted that this refers specifically to direct emissions and not the carbon footprint. The carbon footprint should also cover all imports (food, building materials, etc.) as well as emissions generated by the

Direct emissions of greenhouse gases in Marseille in 2019

MtCO₂e

i.e. 2.3 tCO₂e per cap.

Marseille cluster (long-distance transport, etc.). Applying national ratios, the emissions associated with Marseille's 870,000 inhabitants should be around 7.8 MtCO₂e/year. The emissions recorded in Scope 1 and 2 below therefore represent around 25% of the Marseille population's carbon footprint. Initial elements relating to Marseille's carbon footprint (Scope 3) are detailed in section 3.1.6.

Some details on the sectors covered for the scopes 1 and 2 emissions report:

The residential sector includes both private and public housing, which in 2019 included approximately 57,700 single-family homes and nearly 394,000 flats in Marseille.
The services sector includes office buildings, cafés-hotels-restaurants, shops, education &amp; research buildings, health &amp; social care buildings, sport, culture, leisure and community facilities, transport organisations and community housing.
The number of industries in Marseille is limited, the report's scope does not cover the industries of the Fos-sur-Mer Industrial Port Zone (ZIP).
Road transport includes both passenger and freight transport, within Marseille.
Rail transport includes passenger and freight transport within Marseille

Climate City Contract - Action Plan Section INDOIGO - April 2023
Maritime transport includes emissions related to dockside manoeuvres, as well as half of the emissions related to domestic travel, i.e. between 2 French ports.
Air transport is not taken into account in this report, as the airport is located outside Marseille.
‘Waste management’ corresponds to the collection, treatment and recovery of waste produced in Marseilles: this item is practically zero here because the main treatment and recovery units are also located outside the city
The energy branch corresponds to emissions linked to the energy production units located within Marseille, mainly the 2 SWAC units, whose emissions are low
Finally, the emissions from agriculture and forestry correspond to emissions related to livestock or cultivation practices within Marseille.

In order to go beyond these limits, and as part of a genuine ambition to move towards carbon neutrality, it is essential to also assess the emissions related to scope 3, as explained above. A first approach to some of the positions will be proposed in this document.

![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)

## Important points:

The building sector is the most energy-intensive sector, accounting for 59% of energy consumption, ahead of the transport sectors, which in turn account for 31% of energy consumption
But the road transport sector is the most carbon-intensive sector, accounting for 38% of emissions, ahead of the residential (26%) and service (15%) sectors
This is why the road transport, residential and service sub-sectors are the focus of the Climate City Contract: a detailed presentation of this is provided in the following paragraphs, along with exploratory scenarios, based on a highly ambitious mobilisation of emission reduction potentials.

In addition to this regional approach, a more detailed assessment of energy expenditure based on the ATMO data provided along with the various energy unit costs is proposed.

This analysis has been completed for the main energy vectors:

Electricity
Natural gas
Petroleum products
Heat networks
Wood energy

The unit cost of these different vectors varies according to the activity sector.

In addition, energy expenditure has been modelled according to two different assumptions to incorporate the impact of energy cost increases resulting from the war in Ukraine:

Average unit cost since 2017
Average unit cost since January 2022

The following tables show the unit costs (€/MWh) used and their subsequent increases:

Table 1 - energy price trends - INDDIGO

On the basis of these assumptions, the total cost of energy for the Marseille's various activity sectors is €1.6 million per year, when allowing for trends in average energy costs since 2017. Recent price rises have resulted in a total increase of almost €300k (+15%), thus raising annual energy expenditure to €1.9M.

DETAILS BY SECTOR AND DEMONSTRATIONS - SCOPE 1 AND 2

## 3.4.1 TRANSPORT

The transport sector can be broken down into 3 activity sub-sectors:

Road transport
Maritime transport
Rail transport.

![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)

![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)

Air transport associated with private travel by the local population is covered by Scope 3. There are two possible approaches to considering this sector's GHG impacts.

&gt; The first approach is called land-parcel-based and only covers journeys within the geographical perimeter of Marseille. This method is the one used by ATMO, and for the sake of consistency with the other sectors, it is the one we will use for the emissions reports and monitoring.

![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)
Figure 10 - Transport sector energy consumption - Scopes 1 and 2 - Marseille 2019 - ATMO Sud data

Road transport is by far the most energy intensive, accounting for 79% of all transport energy consumption.

For this data set, maritime transport only covers quayside manoeuvres and local domestic crossings, in order to be consistent with the national statistical methods.

Figure 11 - Greenhouse gas emissions from transport - Scopes 1 and 2 - Marseille 2019 - ATMO Sud data

As the share of electricity used in the transport sector is very limited, the proportion of greenhouse gas emissions for the sector follows that of its energy consumption: the road transport sector is responsible for 80% of this sector's greenhouse gas emissions.

The details of emissions from the road transport sector by vehicle type and energy vector are provided below.

Figure 15 - Road transport sector GHG emissions by fuel type - Marseille - 2019 - ATMO Sud data

These two graphs illustrate the continued dominance of combustion engines, notably diesel powered, in the road transport sector. All potential levers for change must be used to take action: reduction of distances, reduction of the use of private cars, alternative mobility to the private car, alternative power sources. These levers correspond to those considered in the Mobility Plan. The expected by-products of improved air quality and therefore better public health in general equally important to the city of Marseille and its partners.

&gt; The second approach is to analyse road transport by "catchment areas". This allows for a better identification of action levers and the evaluation of their potential impact.

The following are the diagnostic elements provided by the Marseille Conurbation Urban Planning Office (Agence d'urbanisme de l'agglomération marseillaise - AGAM) for the preparation of the Mobility Plan (Plan Des Mobilités - PDM) in 2019, relating to the daily movements of the local population on weekdays.

The data comes from a Cerema EMC² certified mobility survey conducted largely during the winter of 2019-2020 (before the COVID 19 pandemic lockdowns).

The use of cars for daily trips during the week accounts for 81% of the GHG emissions related to these types of movement.

An evaluation of weekend travel emissions has been completed but has not been published at this stage. However initial analyses do suggest that the GHG burden is greater for longer distances.

|  Issues :
• Development of the road and rail Metropolitan Express Network (Réseau Express Métropolitain - REM) within the metropolis, with a network of interchange hubs outside the city centre
• Improved access to the St Charles railway station for metropolitan and regional travel | Issues :
Development of public transport on dedicated lanes (TCSP) and public transport within Marseille
Development of REM in the metropolis and the region
Reduction of private car use in the city | Issues :
• Public transport (PT) and cycling network (for internal traffic)
• Better Bus with a High Level of Service (BHLS) and cycling (ring road) routes
• Restriction of the use of private cars | Issues :
• Develop the local use of bicycles
• Make walking easier. However, walking already represents a very high share (41%)  |

→ Important points

○ A land-parcel approach to evaluate and monitor emissions, a catchment area approach to identify issues, action levers and quantify potential
Road transport sector: Top of the GHG emissions table. Behind  $80\%$  of transport sector GHG emissions, and  $36\%$  of the total emissions for the Marseilles territory
○ Combustion engines: Leading source of emissions in the road transport sector, in terms of its energy vector. For 2019 electricity represented less than  $1\%$  of all road transport energy consumption.
In terms of GHGs, the challenges largely concern journeys of more than  $7\mathrm{km}$  (medium and long distance), given the private car's share in these uses, but action on journeys within the urban centre will also be important for environmental and public health reasons, as well as social issues.
○ All potential levers for change must be used to take action: reduction of distances, reduction of the use of private cars inside Marseille, alternative mobility to the private car, alternative power sources. The potential impacts of these major levers are detailed in the next chapter.

# 3.4.2 RESIDENTIAL

Housing in Marseille is composed of:

,758 flats, i.e.  $87\%$  of all housing, responsible for  $71\%$  of the residential sector's GHG emissions
,701 houses, i.e.  $13\%$  of housing, responsible for  $29\%$  of the residential sector's GHG emissions.

For scopes 1 and 2, the residential sector is the region's second largest consumer of energy (3,700 GWh in 2019), and of GHG emissions. It should be noted that these emissions relate to daily energy consumption, the construction/renovation part is not included in this section but elements are presented in the Scope 3 section.

Fossil fuels (49%) and electricity (51%) cover 49% of the domestic hot water needs.

The next chapter presents the quantification of associated potentials.

## Analysis by energy type

Fossil fuels account for almost half of the sector's energy consumption (49%), of which the largest share is natural gas (42% of the total).

Electricity is the main source of energy used, mainly for domestic hot water requirements (51% of requirements), followed by specific electricity requirements, and heating (12% of requirements), cooking (38% of requirements), and finally washing and cooling needs.

# Important points

The residential sector is the territory's second largest source of emissions (28%)
One of the major challenges will be reducing emissions from heating (53% of the sector's emissions) and domestic hot water (29%). Fossil fuels currently account for 70% of domestic heating consumption.
Fossil fuels account for  $77\%$  of the sector's emissions
This data confirms the issues at stake:

Develop energy efficiency and energy saving measures.
Develop heat and cold networks for domestic heating and hot water in the residential sector
Massively increase energy renovation policies
Further exploit the potential of solar thermal energy for domestic hot water

# 3.4.3 SERVICE SECTOR

The service sector is the 3rd most energy-intensive sector (2,900 GWh in 2019), and the 3rd largest source of GHG emissions for scopes 1 and 2.

![img-37.jpeg](img-37.jpeg)

![img-38.jpeg](img-38.jpeg)

# Notable facilities include:

Universities: Étoile, Centre and Luminy faculties
AP-Hopitaux de Marseille: Timone, Nord, Conception, Européen and all other Marseille hospitals (Saint Joseph, Valvert, Edouard Toulouse)
The Chanot-Pharo exhibition and conference centre
Mucem (Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilizations)

![img-45.jpeg](img-45.jpeg)

![img-46.jpeg](img-46.jpeg)

# Important points

The service sector is the territory's third largest sector for emissions (15%)
One major challenge would be to reduce the emissions associated with heating (39% of the sector's total emissions), since fossil fuels currently account for 70% of service sector building heating emissions.
Finally, fossil fuels are behind  $74\%$  of the sector's emissions
This data confirms that energy sobriety and efficiency as well as the application of the service sector decree are major issues to be confronted.

# 3.4.4 INDUSTRY

Industrial sector emissions are included in the territory's direct emissions report and cover a small number of industrial sites within Marseille.

More specific data is subject to non-disclosure rules.

![img-47.jpeg](img-47.jpeg)

![img-48.jpeg](img-48.jpeg)

This section will be presented in greater detail in a future version of the document.

It should be noted that the projected increase in the number of data centres in the territory, both in Marseilles or the metropolis, will result in a very significant increase in electricity consumption (scopes 2 and 3) and in parallel but non-linear CO2 emissions associated with their carbon emitting back-up power sources (scope 1). In order to limit the negative impacts (energy, water, land) of this growth and the competition for access to electrical resources between these new infrastructures and other activities whose decarbonisation will be a priority (docked ships, ship repair, electrification of public transport, etc.), a guidance plan will have to be drawn up collectively, in the short term and involving all parties, to provide a framework for this and make the siting of data centres sustainable (location of data centres, numerous clausus energy, exemplary projects involving the recovery of waste heat or benefits for the territory, etc.).

# 3.4.5 POWER GENERATION

In 2019, the production of renewable energy reached 292 GWh, about  $2.5\%$  of the territory's total energy consumption, this is considered to be a low degree of energy independence.

One of the Climate City Contract challenges will be to significantly increase this figure, notably through heat networks and photovoltaic energy.

![img-49.jpeg](img-49.jpeg)

Level of energy self-sufficiency  $2.5\%$

![img-50.jpeg](img-50.jpeg)
RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION - MARSEILLE - 2019
Figure 30 - Breakdown of renewable energy production by sector - Marseille - 2019 - ATMO Sud data

In this context biomass production refers to a private sector wood-fired heating plant in Marseille's  $1^{\text{st}}$  arrondissement.

The photovoltaic sector in Marseille includes both small and large installations. The City of Marseille, with 60 installations on its property, is responsible for  $10\%$  of this production.

The regional data for 2009 to 2017 shows a significant progression, both in terms of the number of installations and the installed capacity, but this remains a subject with room for further action to encourage greater energy independence and lower energy expenditure:

City of Marseille 10009628

Climate City Contract - Action Plan Section INDDIGO - March 2023
![img-51.jpeg](img-51.jpeg)
Figure 31 - Progress in Marseille's photovoltaic sector between 2009 and 2017 - ORECA data

![img-52.jpeg](img-52.jpeg)

The heat pump section refers to superficial geothermal and aerothermal energy, and is included in the annual renewable energy production report produced by ORECA.

The territory is also home to one of France's largest biomethane production facilities.

The Sormiou plant was constructed in 1987, in the 'calanque' of the same name, it treats slurry from the Géolide sewage treatment plant. Since 2019, this slurry is used to produce biomethane, which is then injected into the domestic gas network.

Nearly 2,500 households in the Soude district, about  $10\%$  of the population of Marseille's 9th arrondissement, are supplied with this locally produced eco-friendly gas. Biomethane is produced directly from the treatment of domestic

![img-53.jpeg](img-53.jpeg)

and industrial sewage from Marseille and 16 of its surrounding municipalities. In 2021, the Sormiou plant produced 27 GWh of biomethane, and could produce up to 40 GWh/year if a proposed extension project is completed. This represents about  $1\%$  of natural gas consumption for 2019.

As for heat and cooling networks, currently active facilities in Marseille include:

2 sizeable seawater air conditioning plants (SWAC), which retail their heat and cold production to third parties: Massileo and Thassalia, which supply about 1000 eq. households with heat. Some schools and municipal buildings are also connected to the network.
+100 technical networks that consume all the heat produced (e.g. the 13 Habitat network in the 13th arrondissement) and many of which rely on natural gas.

The geographical distribution of these networks over the Marseille territory is as follows:

Operations to extend the SWAC networks are planned or underway.

Heat and cooling networks are a potential source for significant major development.

![img-55.jpeg](img-55.jpeg)

$\Rightarrow$  Important points
Energy self-sufficiency is only  $2.5\%$
Innovative installations in place which are likely to be expanded: seawater air conditioning plants, biomethane production plants using sewage treatment by-products to directly supply the domestic networks
There is a high development potential associated with heat and cooling networks powered by renewable and solar energy sources.

# 3.5 REPRESENTATION OF THE MARSEILLE POPULATION'S CARBON FOOTPRINT IN TERMS OF "SCOPE 3" EMISSIONS

To complete this GHG emissions overview following a "Carbon Footprint" logic, the City Council has decided to present 4 complementing emission sources:

food industry,
new-build construction,
waste product emissions,
mobility related elements.

The City council also hopes include emissions related to the purchase of goods and services as well as those related to international shipping and further develop the evaluations included below in the scope 3 section of a future version of this document.

The aim would be to measure the associated emissions and monitor these indirect emissions over the long-term.

## 3.5.1 FOOD INDUSTRY

On the basis of an estimated population of 870,731 for 2019, an average number of 2.5 meals/day, an emission ratio per meal corresponding to an average meal, and a French continental climate, the weight of emissions associated with the food industry is estimated at 1.6Mt CO2e.

This can be compared to the 1.9 MtCO2e included in Scope 1 &amp; 2.

## 3.5.2 NEW-BUILD HOUSING CONSTRUCTION

The total area of individual dwellings built in 2019 (or where work started in 2019) is estimated at 30,169$^{m2}$.

The production of individual housing represented 12 ktCO2e in 2019 (Some carbon accounting rules write off these emissions over 30 years, the annual emissions related to these constructions would then be evaluated at 427 t CO2e.$^{1}$

The total area of collective housing built in 2019 (or where work started in 2019) is estimated at 140,000$^{m2}$.

The production of collective housing represented 94 ktCO2e in 2019 (or 3.1 ktCO2e with a 30-year write-off period).

This heading therefore represents a total of approximately 106 ktCO2e (without taking depreciation into account), i.e. 5.6% of total emissions for scopes 1 and 2.

## 3.5.3 WASTE PRODUCTS

In 2021, emissions from private waste in Marseilles was estimated at around 74.4 ktCO2e, equivalent to almost 4% of the total emissions reported for scopes 1 and 2. The tonnages used for this estimate are specified at the bottom of the page. Further analysis procedures could be used to include professional waste in these analyses.

The uncertainties for this subject are high, and probably underestimated, the emissions related to business waste have not been assessed.
# 3.5.4 MOBILITY

In view of the available data, and in order to ensure consistency between the "land-parcel" approach and the "catchment area" approach explained above, Scope 3 emissions relating to mobility have been calculated on the basis of 3 themes:

Emissions from individual daily week day car journeys within a 100 km radius, excluding emissions from movements inside the city centre.
These are estimated at 1.8 MtCO2e, or approximately  $91\%$  of the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
Air transport emissions. The estimate is based on the assumption that  $40\%$  of total emissions from air travel passing through the local airport (located outside Marseille) can be attributed to travel by Marseille residents or visitors to Marseille.

This therefore involves about 230 ktCO2e in emissions.

This assessment should be completed by the following data:

Emissions from road travel over distances of more than  $100\mathrm{km}$
Emissions from international maritime transport
Emissions from rail transport outside Marseille

# 3.5.5 SCOPES 1, 2 AND 3 AND CARBON FOOTPRINT PER CAPITA

At first view and allowing for the uncertainties formulated above, the overall figures indicate total GHG emissions of around 6 MtCO2e, but this does not include certain key emission sources (consumption of goods and services, international logistics, etc.)

Within this largely underestimated configuration, scope 3 represents about  $65\%$  of the total.

![img-56.jpeg](img-56.jpeg)
Figure 33 - Breakdown of emissions by scope - Marseille - 2019

City of Marseille 10009628

Climate City Contract - Action Plan Section INDDIGO - March 2023
#

Important points

The scope 3 emissions reconstituted in this document represent 65% of the total emissions for the three scopes and can be considered to be underestimated since certain emissions sources have yet to be assessed (consumption of goods and services in particular)
The first issue is road transport, notably travel by Marseille residents outside of the region as well as that of visitors to Marseilles
○ From a carbon footprint perspective, the second issue is food, a source of emissions over which local authorities have limited influence even if it is clearly very important that it be addressed
○ A scope 3 assessment should be extended in future versions of the Climate City Contract to include: emissions associated with construction and public works waste &amp; its reuse, service sector construction, maritime transport (international travel), consumption of goods and services.

# 3.6 CARBON SEQUESTRATION

In thinking about carbon neutrality, it is also important to assess current carbon storage in soils and biomass, as well as the annual sequestration flows. It would also be interesting to illustrate the issues relating to soil sealing and de-sealing.

Land use in the city of Marseille by ground surface type is characterised by the predominance of non-sealed artificial spaces (45%), followed by grasslands (29%). It should be noted that, at 16%, sealed surfaces remain in the minority.

using this data, and the ratios available in the ADO tool, the carbon stock contained in soils is estimated at 6,000,000 tCO2e, with a maximum stock in grasslands (40%), and unsealed artificial spaces, such as parks (39%).

The main priority is therefore not to destroy this stock.

![img-57.jpeg](img-57.jpeg)

Carbon storage

MtCO2e

in the ground

Beyond the notion of stock, it will be a question of positioning annual net sequestration in relation to annual GHG emissions. Annual sequestration amounts to 17,900 tCO2e/year, equivalent to  $0.9\%$  of scope 1 and 2 emissions, which amount to 1.98 MTeqCO2.

![img-58.jpeg](img-58.jpeg)

Annual sequestration of carbon

ktCO2e

per year

It should be noted that posidonia has a very high carbon storage capacity. In fact,  $1\mathrm{km}2$  of this plant could store up to 83,000 tCO2e, i.e. 3 times more than  $1\mathrm{km}2$  of forest.

![img-59.jpeg](img-59.jpeg)

km2 of stored

posidonia

,000 tCO2e

i.e. 3 times more than

km2 of forest

Posidonia meadows are said to absorb  $10\%$  of the carbon captured by the oceans, even though they represent only  $0.2\%$  of their surface area.

The local Posidonia meadows currently cover an area of 107 ha around the Frioul archipelago and 414 ha around the Riou archipelago and along the Calanques coastline.

On the basis of these assumptions, the Posidonia meadows along the Marseilles coastline could store around 43 Mt CO2e, i.e. 7 times the carbon storage in the soil.

As the rate of growth of posidonia is extremely slow, this calls for the implementation of very strong conservations for this essential natural resource.

The annual net sequestration is broken down as follows:

City of Marseille

8

Climate City Contract - Action Plan Section

INDDIGO - March 2023
Wood products used within the territory (according to a ratio per number of inhabitants) sequester 20.7 kteqCO₂/year, which is the largest item
Forests sequester 9.3 kteqCO₂/year
Finally, wetlands sequester 1 kteqCO₂/year

Finally, the urbanisation of land between 2012 and 2018, 60 ha of grassland and agricultural land, emitted an average of 9,300 tCO₂/year (i.e. the equivalent of 0.5% of annual emissions for scopes 1 and 2).

![img-60.jpeg](img-60.jpeg)

## Important points

The carbon stored in Marseille's soil is significant (6MtCO₂e), and there is a challenge to preserve it (zero urbanisation, forest conservation, etc.)
In addition, the annual stored carbon flow is limited: 18 kTeq CO₂/year, 0.25% of the territory's emissions, this flow could be increased by de-sealing the soil and planting trees.
This last carbon sink covers only a small part of the city's emissions, therefore reducing the emissions themselves remains the major lever to be activated to move towards carbon neutrality.

By way of illustration, offsetting 25% of the emissions emitted in 2019 would be equivalent to removing 600 km² of sealed surfaces, where the total surface area of Marseille is only 240 km².

# 4. A2 - ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT STRATEGIES

# 4.1 A 2.1 AND A 2.2 - FRAMEWORK DOCUMENTS TO BE CONSIDERED

Firstly, the following diagram shows the relationships between the various framework documents provided by French legislation and regulations concerning air-energy-climate, from national to local council level:

Figure 34 - Relations between air-energy-climate framework documents in France - CEREMA (additional note: the SRCAE ceased to exist in 2019, the 2021 climate and resilience law creates a link between the Pluriannual Energy Programme and the SRADDET, the PDU have been replaced by PDM which must be compatible with the PCAET)

This shows the principle of hierarchy: a local document (PCAEM) must integrate and be compatible with the SRADDET (Regional Plan for Territorial Planning, Sustainable Development and Equality), which itself must take integrate the Stratégie Nationale Bas Carbone (National Low Carbon Strategy) which, since April 2020, has been setting the national carbon neutrality target for 2050.

# Important points

According to our estimates, emissions in 2030 should fall by  $25\%$ , compared to 2019, with the current policies put in place, notably the mobility plan, the metropolitan climate and energy plan, along with regional and national policies.
The gap to be bridged is therefore  $50\%$

A3 - SYSTEMIC BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY

## 4.3.1 OPPORTUNITIES TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY: EXPLORATORY SCENARIOS

Major transformations will have to be made to head towards carbon neutrality. The initial works presented within the framework of the City Climate Contract focus on the territory's direct emissions (Scopes 1 &amp; 2) and the 3 highest emitting sectors: personal mobility, residential and services.

In a second phase, an analysis of freight transport and local industry should be added to achieve a complete vision of possible evolutions to the territory's direct emissions (Scope 1 &amp; 2).

Furthermore, the reduction of indirect emissions (Scope 3) will be a major task, impossible to achieve in the short term.

There follows a detailed account of the thinking behind the project, including some initial financial information. The scenarios are referred to as "ambitious exploratory" because they will involve major transformations.

These analyses were carried out to measure how global carbon neutrality objectives can be transposed to a very local, urban scale. They have not been modelled, as have other large-scale exercises (Negawatt, ADEME's Transition 2050, SNBC scenarios, etc.), they are the result of estimates by experts in the field, which make it possible to grasp the masses involved.

## 4.3.1.1 Ambitious exploratory scenario for personal mobility

This scenario was developed using mobility data for Marseille, with a "catchment area" approach..

This approach has made it possible to estimate the GHG emission gains obtained by using certain levers in a very ambitious way to reduce emissions relating to daily travel within the Marseille catchment area on weekdays.

The working hypotheses are as follows:

Inclusion of travel within the Marseille urban centre,
Partial inclusion of GHGs related to trade flows, within a 100 km radius
Transit emissions are not included, but appear to be negligible
Only emissions from private cars for weekday travel have been included.
Individual mobility will decrease slightly, with a relatively limited impact on GHG, and there will be a slight population growth, also with a limited impact: these 2 effects are expected to cancel each other out.

The levers selected are the following:

30% of the vehicle fleet will be electric powered by 2030, this is the expected national trend. For the record, the MDP assumption is 10% by 2030 (which was the expected national trend at the time the MDP was drawn up but which was re-evaluated in 2022). Also for the record, a European agreement signed in October 2022 projects a total ban on the sale of diesel, petrol and hybrid vehicles by 2035.
Implementation of the PDME/PDMA/PDMS actions
50% of urban buses and 25% of coaches will be electric (low hypothesis considering the objective of a 100% electric fleet in the territory by 2030)
Increase car use efficiency to 10% (carpooling) with a focus on commuting
Increase in alternative travel methods to the car (except walking, as there is a slight shift from walking to cycling and public transport).

City of Marseille 10009628

Climate City Contract - Action Plan Section INDDIGO - March 2023
very strong shift in the share of cycling (from 2 to 15% for Marseille, compared to the 12% target of the MDP),
a marked increase in the use of public transport (from 16 to 23%).

To achieve this degree of cycling use, 1,100 km of cycling facilities would need to be developed in Marseille by 2030 (€300M cycling plan)
Option: Speed limit reduction to 10 km/h on expressway - additional 2% gain on the whole road sector.

Changes to modal shares for this exploratory scenario can be shown as follows:

![img-64.jpeg](img-64.jpeg)
Figure 37 - changes to modal shares for the exploratory mobility scenario - source AGAM and INDDIGO 2022

A table with more detailed figures is provided in Appendix 3.

In conclusion, the potential for reducing emissions through the daily use of private cars on weekdays is estimated at almost 60%.

![img-65.jpeg](img-65.jpeg)

![img-66.jpeg](img-66.jpeg)

# Important points

By pushing the modal shares of public transport, cycling and car-pooling to the maximum, and assuming a transformation of the vehicle fleet to 30% electric, the gain in GHG emissions relative to the use of individual cars during the week (with a catchment area approach) would be around 60%.
As regards cycling, a 15% modal share means building 700 km of cycle lanes or paths by 2030 (out of the 1,500 km of roads in Marseille) and in addition to the 130 km already planned in the PDM, i.e. 200 million euros.
This gain is extrapolated to 60% for the whole road sector
For distances greater than 15 km, the priority issues are:
Issue 1: modal shift to interurban public transport and sobriety,
Issue 2: support policy for electric vehicles to be redefined

City of Marseille

Climate City Contract - Action Plan Section

INDDIGO - April 2023
Issue 3: carpooling
For distances less than 7.5 km, the issues are:
Issue 1: cycling plan to be strengthened
Issue 2: reducing traffic in the city centre
The city climate contract is an opportunity to continue investigating the most effective levers, to accelerate some of the MDP actions by strengthening their ambition, and to envisage new structural actions.

The feasibility analysis of the levers explored in these scenarios must be the subjected to additional collective analyses to identify more precisely the associated actions that will enable their successful implementation.

## 4.3.1.2 Ambitious exploratory scenario for the residential sector

In the same vein, an estimate of the emission reduction potential of the existing residential sector with the implementation of ambitious levers has been established.

The working hypotheses are as follows:

Weighted GHG emissions shares for individual houses and collective housing units: 29% and 71% respectively
Number of individual houses: 72,061
Number of collective housing units: 379,091

The selected levers are the following:

Energy renovation of 30% of individual houses and flats by 2030, with a 50% reduction target for heating consumption.

This means comprehensive and efficient renovation works, to BBC renovation level, on approximately 21,600 houses and 3,800 apartment buildings (with an average of 30 apartments per building) over 7 years, i.e. between 2,000 and 4,000 houses and 400 to 800 buildings per year.)

Changes to the energy mix by 2030, based on a drastic reduction of fossil fuels and a major development of heat and cooling networks
Petroleum products: from 10% to 0%, i.e. a total ban
LPG: from 2% to 0%, i.e. a total ban
Natural gas: from 58% to 20%, i.e. reduction by a factor of 3
Individual wood energy: from 9% to 10%, i.e. maintaining the current share
Local heating networks: from 9% to 40%, 80% from renewable energy sources and 20% from natural gas. The network share would supply the equivalent of 50,000 housing units/year.

The potential for renewable energies should be investigated in greater detail as part of a master plan for the heating networks.

Electricity: increase from 12 to 30%, i.e. by a factor of almost 3, this allows for an increase in the use of heat pumps
Sobriety actions: lowering temperature settings, switching off electrical appliances, reducing certain household appliances, reducing domestic hot water consumption, etc.

The potential gain from residential sector energy efficiency improvements and energy mix changes is estimated at 25% of the sector's total emissions, this can be broken down as follows:

% of these gains would come from the energy renovation of 30% of the territory's housing units

City of Marseille
Climate City Contract - Action Plan Section
INDDIGO - April 2023
The other 1/4 of the gains would come from greening up the energy mix.

Potential additional gains from energy efficiency actions is estimated at 20%.

Thus, this ambitious exploratory scenario could lead to a 45% reduction in residential sector emissions.

![img-67.jpeg](img-67.jpeg)

Exploratory scenario for residential sector 45% reduction in emissions for the residential sector/2019

An initial look at the financial aspects of the approach would be as follows

Energy renovation of 30% of the territory’s housing units: around €4.5 billion
Development of 100 km of heating and cooling networks: €200 M, to which must be added investments in production units, as well as the costs of necessary works on residential buildings
Household energy efficiency and sobriety actions: M€ 120

![img-68.jpeg](img-68.jpeg)

$\Rightarrow$ Important points:

The proposed exploratory scenario could lead to a 45% reduction in residential sector emissions, from the following levers:

Simple and inexpensive energy efficiency and sobriety actions: gain of around 20%
Massive acceleration in energy renovation works: 2,000 to 4,000 houses and 400 to 800 residential buildings per year on average by 2030, targeting the least energy-efficient housing first
Through the accelerated development of urban heating networks, 80% of which will be supplied by renewable energy sources, to provide approximately 500 GWh by 2030, i.e. 40% of residential needs, or approximately 50,000 housing units: a key issue for the territory, with very significant potential and proven efficiency.
In addition, reduce emissions related to domestic hot water consumption through energy saving actions and renewable energy sources.

## 4.3.1.3 Ambitious exploratory scenario for the service sector

Finally, an ambitious exploratory scenario is proposed for the third largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, the service sector.

Reminder: heating accounts for 39% of the sector’s emissions.

The selected levers are the following:

Implementation of the service sector decree for all public and private service sector buildings, including buildings of less than 1,000 m², a reduction of 40% by 2030, through energy renovation works and other energy efficiency actions, and the implementation of sobriety plans
Changes to the energy mix, with variations according to the type of building, based on the following principles:

No more fuel oil
Reduction in the use of natural gas by a factor of 2
Development of a heating network, 80% of which will be supplied by renewable energy sources

City of Marseille

Climate City Contract - Action Plan Section

INDDIGO - April 2023
Greenhouse gas emission gains from renovation works to the sector's buildings are estimated at 19%, to which should be added the emission reductions from greening up the energy mix which should come to about 8%, this should come to a total gain of 30% for service sector emissions.

The gains associated with sobriety measures are estimated to be around 20%.

Thus, this ambitious exploratory scenario could lead to a reduction of around 50% in service sector emissions.

![img-69.jpeg](img-69.jpeg)

reduction in emissions for the tertiary sector/2019

![img-70.jpeg](img-70.jpeg)

$\Rightarrow$ Important points
The proposed exploratory scenario could lead to a 50% reduction in service sector emissions, through the application of the following levers:

Simple and inexpensive energy efficiency and sobriety actions: gain of around 20%
Energy renovation works on the sector's buildings leading to a 40% reduction in energy consumption for heating
Through the accelerated development of district heating networks, and a drastic reduction in fossil fuels

## 4.3.1.4 Exploratory scenarios for other sectors

Further exploratory work can be established in a future version of the contract.

## 4.3.2 CONCLUSIONS OF THE EXPLORATORY SCENARIOS AND GAPS TO BE BRIDGED

This third stage, known as the "Exploratory Scenarios", has therefore made it possible to achieve a vision of the scale of possible emissions gains that could result from an ambitious mobilisation of potentials: this gain would be around 55% (53%) of emissions compared to those of 2019.

![img-71.jpeg](img-71.jpeg)

Exploratory scenarios

%

reduction in emissions compared to 2019

For the record, the main levers to be mobilised are:

For distances over 15 km: modal shift to interurban public transport, review of policy to support electric vehicles, carpooling
For distances of less than 7.5 km: bicycle plan to be reinforced, reducing traffic in the city centre
Energy sobriety in all sectors
The deployment of energy efficiency measures, and in particular the global energy renovation works on 30% of residential units, the renovation of service sector infrastructure to reduce energy consumption for heating by 40%
The development of heating networks, to provide 40% of total energy requirements for residential use, along with a greening up of the sector,
No more fuel oil usage and a drastic reduction in the use of natural gas.

The following graph illustrates these issues, globally and by sector:

→ Important points

○ Current trends illustrate the gains that can be achieved through current strategies (PCAEM and PDM in particular), and the observed and expected changes that could come from regional and national policies: the reduction in emissions is estimated at -25% in 2030 compared to 2019. The gap is therefore a further 50% in gains before reaching carbon neutrality in 2030.

○ The exploratory scenarios illustrate the possibility of reducing emissions by almost 55% by 2030 compared to 2019. These potentials are very ambitious and require substantial financial, human, technical and political resources.

○ If all these potentials are mobilised, there would remain a residual gap of around 20% (22%) of emission reductions to reach carbon neutrality (keeping 25% of emission offset).

○ The potentials already identified here and the search for other new potentials, will be the subject of more in-depth studies to be completed during 2023, along with a strengthened partnership between the CCC sponsors, in order to enhance the Climate City Contract with ever more ambitious actions, with support from the national government and Europe.

# 4.3.3 THEMATIC AND SYSTEMIC BARRIERS

The main barriers identified by theme are the following:

# Passenger mobility:

A strong local culture of car use and difficult access to many local employment sites without a car. The introduction of constraints to reduce the use of private cars must therefore be accompanied by actions aimed at offering alternative mobility solutions of at least equivalent theoretical capacity along with specific support in terms of change of use and awareness.

Switching to electric vehicles: uncertainty about environmental impacts other than carbon that continue to raise questions (extractivism and the real recycling potential), the cost of electric vehicles is too high for many households (and the supply of second-hand vehicles is still limited), reinforced by uncertainty about the cost of electricity, and the unavailability of recharging points in public spaces, combined with the complexity or even the impossibility of deploying recharging systems in some private car-parks.

Development of cycling: a strong feeling of insecurity both in use and when parking in public spaces.

Modal shift to public transport: still limited on many routes

In addition to the significant investments required, there is a lack of human resources to manage projects and programmes (bicycle plan, studies related to the deployment of heavy transport, etc.)

# Logistics:

Structural projects must be deployed to enable the development of rail freight
There is no significant incentive to switch fleets to electric or bio NGV
Cycle logistics: there is no strong local regulatory incentive, distribution platform sites are difficult to find
Collective use of transport infrastructure (e.g. night tram) could be explored in greater detail

INDDIGO - April 2023
Residential Energy Retrofit:

Incentives for renovation works are limited by a partial regulatory constraint (RT only applies in case of heavy renovation works). Households with the financial means still prefer comfort renovations over energy renovations.
Collective housing units remain highly complex in terms of the number of involved parties
No zero-interest financing tools available
Outstanding debts for high value energy renovation works
Lack of access to accurate and high quality advice
Lack of strong regulatory or fiscal constraints, difficulties in implementing such constraints without also allowing for social criteria
Lack of qualified professionals to meet the demand
Works in the historic city centre remain complex

Energy renovation on service sector buildings

Regulatory constraints being implemented via the service sector decree, will the impact of the regulations be sufficient?
Technical difficulties in monitoring the energy performance of asset portfolios
Distribution of responsibilities between the owner (who should invest but is not confronted with energy costs) and the tenant (confronted with energy costs but unable to plan investments with ROI beyond 15 or 30 years)
Lack of access to accurate and high quality advice
Lack of resources to manage projects

From a systemic point of view, the barriers can be considered as follows:

The constraints are not strong enough to induce the changes necessary for energy transition, both for mobility or energy renovation works
The profound changes needed affect the concepts of individual freedom and comfort which remain obstacles to change even when faced with the climate emergency
The introduction of further constraints remains complicated considering the uncertainties regarding social acceptability and the capacity to support these constraints without increasing the hardship for certain sectors of the population of Marseille.
The lack of investment financing capacity for these transition actions will be a major obstacle.
Associated with this is incapacity to dedicate resources for managing energy transition projects. More generally, the territory lacks the means to develop the appropriate technical engineering and financial capacities.
The time required for administrative procedures, although necessary, is in some cases a hindrance to the implementation of projects, particularly in the field of renewable energy
Decision-making processes requires time for appropriation, acclimatisation and consultation, hence the importance of setting up an ambitious but effective CCC management system.

# 5.1.1 REDUCTION OF SCOPE 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS

The collective commitment is to commit to a drastic reduction in GHG emissions for the Marseille territory by 2030. The first exploratory scenarios were put together collaboratively to propose a trajectory towards reducing direct GHG emissions by  $50\%$  compared to 2019. New actions will be added to the plan at a later stage as part of its on-going, systemic and socially inclusive approach.

## 5.1.2 B 1.3 SUMMARY OF THE CARBON OFFSET STRATEGY

The initial works highlighted the importance of the carbon stored in Marseille's soil, the importance of its conservation (zero net artificialisation) and contributing to its increase (development of nature in the city, de-sealing).

At the same time, work is underway on posidonia and its contribution to local and global carbon sinks.

Further work is needed to define a coherent carbon offset strategy and establish the role that Marseille can play in maintaining and increasing global carbon sinks.

MOB1 - BICYCLE PLAN

|  Description | Carbon neutrality challenges | Parties involved | Budget and the major identified obstacles  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  For the metropolis, the modal share for cycling is 1.2%; the mobility plan aims to increase this figure to 12% by 2030. The cycling plan, which contributes to this objective, aims to achieve a modal share of 5% for cycling by 2024, through the completion of 85 km of key cycling routes, rising to 130 km by 2030, and the development of secondary routes. These routes make up a primary network of 8 lines, and a secondary network which will be defined as part of the Local Mobility Plans later on. In addition, the bicycle plan intends to install 3,600 new bicycle parking spaces by 2024, 60% of which will be secure. Finally, the self-service bicycle hire scheme will be fully electric by 2023.
The cycling plan includes 3 axes and 15 actions: Axis 1: develop the use of bicycles for everyday travel needs, axis 2: promote access to bicycles for as many people as possible. Axis 3: make the territory more attractive and safer for cycling.
Additional analyses on multi-modal usages could be carried out to increase the impact of cycling on commuting. | In 2019, only 2% of journeys were by bicycle.
Several studies have shown a direct link between the modal share of cycling and the number of cycle or low-traffic lanes per inhabitant.
The exploratory scenario highlights a significant GHG reduction potential if the actions already programmed are taken even further. | AMP

MOB3 - REDUCING TRAFFIC IN PUBLIC SPACES

|  Description | Carbon neutrality challenges | Parties involved | Budget and the major identified obstacles  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Organising public space to make the city more ecologically resilient will involve developing or extending 30 km/h speed limit zones, redesigning certain squares, redefining circulation to reduce traffic, deploying more parking controls and setting up dedicated new public transport sites. All of these measures will contribute to limiting the use of cars in the city centre and encouraging alternative transport methods. | 40% of journeys of less than 3 km within the metropolis as a whole are made by foot. However, parked or rolling vehicles occupy a huge majority of the public space.
Limiting the use of cars in city centres is a lever for achieving carbon neutrality. Such policies could also include improve air quality, reduce noise pollution, and improve the quality of roads and public spaces, notably as part of a drive for a more resilient city centre. | AMP

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  The objective of the mobility plan is to increase the modal share of public transport for the metropolitan area from 9% to 13% by 2030.
Many works for the development of heavy infrastructures have been signed off for the years to come:
• Redevelopment of the St Charles railway station
• Extension of tram lines
• Cable transport
• Expansion of the TER (local rail service) offer
• Redevelopment of railway lines to double their capacity
• Electrification of railway lines | Since the metropolis was first established in 2016, it has become the sole Mobility Organising Authority for its catchment area. As such, it has taken over the management of the urban public transport networks and the interurban public transport lines (formerly departmental), which are now included in its scope. The railway network remains under the jurisdiction of the Regional Council.
With two metro lines (Marseille), four tramway lines (Marseille and Aubagne) and 6 High Level of Service Bus lines (4 in Marseille, 1 in Aix-en-Provence and Marignane -Saint-Victoret - Vitrolles - Les Pennes Mirabeau), the Metropolis will have 90 km of High Level of Service Transport in 2019. Half of the one million daily public transport journeys are made on these HLST lines
The challenge will be to raise the target to 22% of the modal share by 2030, through the actions planned in the MDP and the other private car use restriction measures.

The metropolis and the city of Marseille are committed to supporting energy renovation projects on private housing.
Role of the National Government:
On the national scale this is a colossal ambition: 90% of private housing, i.e. 27 million homes, to be brought up to BBC performance levels (80kWh/m2/year). In comparison, the average energy consumption for French private housing is 200kWh/m2/year. The scale of the renovation work will be enormous since this will involve moving from 50,000 BBC renovations per year to 700,000. The largest tools, such as MaPrimeRénov' or social landlord grants, will fall under the responsibility of the Anah or the Anru. | The residential sector is responsible for 25% of the Marseille territory's carbon emissions.

ECD3 - SECURING AND EXPANDING THE DEPLOYMENT OF RESOURCERIES AND THE PIONEER RE-USE PROJECTS

|  Description | Carbon neutrality challenges | Parties involved | Budget and the major identified obstacles  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  The objective of the action is to confirm the deployment of the territory’s first reuse projects and support the scaling up of the territory’s first successful experiments.
As laid out in axis 4 of the PMPDMA (Metropolitan Plan for the Prevention of Household and Assimilated Waste), the objective is "one re-use solution per 45,000 inhabitants, i.e. 20 re-use points across the City".
Nearly fifteen local government supported experimental projects are underway in the metropolitan area. | Re-use and recycling will economise emissions associated with raw material extraction and their transformation into "products".
As for recycling, the process of transforming waste into new raw materials will in itself generate some emissions.
Example of reuse: one returnable glass bottle = 39% less CO2e emissions than a non-returnable glass bottle | AMP Metropolis

|  Description | Carbon neutrality challenges | Parties involved | Budget and the major identified obstacles  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  This action aims to deploy platforms for the storage / offloading of construction site waste for its transformation into resources. This will require identifying the right properties and finding a managing business. The implementation of these platforms must be accompanied by stricter obligations in construction/demolition/rehabilitation contracts favouring the re-use of materials and taking advantage of the obligation to carry out a Product Equipment Material Waste (PEMD) diagnosis for any demolition work. In addition to reducing construction materials logistics distances, these platforms will also increase reuse practices in Marseille. | Re-use and recycling will economise emissions associated with raw material extraction and their transformation into "products". Example of re-use: Steel beams for re-use in construction: re-using 1 tonne of steel prevents the production of between 1410 and 4760 kgCO2e. Reusing 5000 linear metres of 200mm girders = between 182 and 618t tCO2e saved in manufacturing. | AMP Metropolis City of Marseille, Southern Region, ADEME, private businesses | Budget not assessed at this stage

|  Description | Carbon neutrality challenges | Parties involved | Budget and the major identified obstacles  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Axis 3 of the PMPDMA 2019-2025 concerns the recovery of bio-waste. On a nationwide level, bio-waste makes up a third of household waste, i.e. an estimated 231,800 tonnes per year for mainland France. (RPQS AMP figures 2017). For individual housing, this is estimated at 75,700 tonnes/year (AGAM 2011 data for individual housing). The energy transition for green growth law dated 17 August 2015 states that bio-waste should be separated at source across the board by 2025 (article 70.4). Several actions will contribute to this:
Enhancing the value of the "bio-waste" resource by developing individual composting
Enhancing the value of the "bio-waste" resource by developing collective or shared composting
Enhancing the value of the "bio-waste" resource by developing vermicomposting
Combating food waste in the catering industryThe collection of bio-waste from professionals is also a priority, this will be implemented through the mobilisation of support levers for the associated structures | This action will allow the Metropolis to:
Reduce the volume of mixed bio-waste collected;
Reduce the volume of green waste;
Encourage autonomous waste management by inhabitants;
Reduce processing costs and comply with the law.
This will also allow for more involvement in the territory’s circular economy dynamic, the improvement of soil condition and will be a useful part of reducing food waste. In terms of avoided GHG, the reduction is estimated at 6,000 tCO2e (indirect emissions, scope 3) | AMP Metropolis
City of Marseille, Southern Region, ADEME and private sector operators | Financial: The budget for axis 3 of the PMDPMA is around €2.2 million  |

An action relating to the creation of new infrastructures for the recovery and reuse of RDF and plastics is planned but will require further survey works.

NATURE IN THE CITY

# NV1 - RESTORING AND RENATURING CITY SPACES

|  Description | Budget and the major identified obstacles  |
| --- | --- |
|  Marseille is a dual city, with highly urbanised areas including relatively ordinary natural vegetation, inherited from the old feudal estates, and conversely, some extraordinary vegetation features that cover the hills and the Calanques uplands (Calanques National Park).

Landscapes currently occupy 700 hectares, this includes historical parks such as Longchamps and Borely, gardens, landscaping around roads, cemeteries, squares, etc.; this is constantly increasing but remains insufficient.

Indeed, apart from natural reservations such as the Calanques National Park or the rest of the hills, the city of Marseille has a natural landscape shortage. While the WHO recommends 12m² of locally (within 300m) accessible natural landscape per inhabitant, on this scale it has only 4.6m² of public urban landscapes with just 1.8m² in the city centre, unlike Barcelona 7.7m², Toulon 10m², Nice 8.6m², Paris 14m² or Strasbourg 68m².

Although many projects, both in progress and in preparation, are part of the city's renaturing strategy which will involve the creation of parks and gardens inside the city, a constant effort must be made to reduce the lack of square metres per inhabitant necessary for the full development of the city's population. Among the renaturing and rehabilitation projects are the Mélican square (8), the Aygalades park under the supervision of the Euromediterranée OIN, the Labadie garden (13001), the National garden (13003), the Barquière garden (13009), the Anonciades park (13015), the Val d'Hor garden (13011).

The eco-garden label is also being deployed in 8 of the city's parks, including Central de Bonneveine and Bortoli (8th), Colline Saint-Joseph (9th), Saint-Cyr (10th), La Buzine (11th), La Moline (12th), Athéna (13th), and L'Oasis (15th) to ensure more ecologically sound management policies.

Vegetation clearly represents an undeniable asset for achieving the ambition of a sustainable and durable city in the current climate change context.

The ability of plants to sequester carbon is a key factor in dealing with air pollution and improving air quality and public health. The higher the level of vegetation, the greater the benefits of urban heat and thermal comfort resulting in a decrease in the need for air conditioning especially with the current need for energy sobriety.

With this in mind, the City of Marseille's ambition is to develop natural landscapes within the city, to green up public spaces, to renature and restore its parks and gardens.

This ambition is guided by the following philosophy: | Financial: Around €56m in investment will be needed to finance the identified actions as well as a further €650k annual operating budget. This does not include the development of nature in the public space, which will need to be the subject of further analyses.

Associated staff will have to be increased to complete the projects.  |

Implementation of the Soil/Water/Vegetation triptych as the basis for adaptation by 2030
Treat the city as a whole rather than concentrating human and financial resources on just a small number of sites
A fractal logic: strategic perimeter and operation positioning
Definition of actions by urban landscape type
Promotion and organisation of public involvement

This renaturing ambition is also reflected in the Plan Avenir Ecole (Future School Plan) with the de-sealing and renaturing of schoolyards.

The objective in the city-centre, identical to that of the peripheral areas, will be deployed within the strategy defined by the "Sustainable historic centre in Marseille by 2030" study and will be in line with the city "greening up" dynamic by introducing more trees in the city, renaturing existing parks and gardens, and removing sealed tarmac ground coverings.

All of these projects will be implemented with respect for schedules and the civil population.

In this respect, the Tree Plan will involve planting 8,000 urban trees and 300,000 woodland plants, this is scheduled to start in 2023, and will be the first branch of the strategy for a green and carbon neutral city.

This will help to :
Increase the carbon sequestration potential
Create cooling islands and capture air pollution
De-seal ground surfaces
Implement citizen actions

They help to develop ecological functions and contribute to making the city more resilient.

These urban waterway projects city aim to:

Reconnect the major river bed with its minor bed in order to restore its natural hydro-morphological functions: restoration of the major water cycle (connection to the soil and its water table), development of new wetlands, opening up the waterways;
Restore the ecological corridors for both terrestrial and aquatic plants and animals and take on the challenges facing aquatic life and more specifically fish;
Enhance these spaces and change the way citizens look at them and use them: turn them into calm and pleasant paths, educational routes and shaded planted walks in order to chase away the old habits of using waterways as rubbish dumps;
Improving the quality of life for citizens: paths along watercourses provide spaces for walking and significantly improve well-being and other socio-cultural co-benefits;
Reduce the risk of flooding by de-sealing the watershed and improving infiltration.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  This table presents a set of actions aimed at integrating the ‘nature in the city’ concept into planning tools. (PLUi, OAP, etc.).
These actions are a logical continuation of the current PLUi which organises:
• The preservation of almost 99% of the upland heartlands as well as 90% of the territory’s wildlife migration or ecological corridors. These areas offer conditions that favour the movements and life cycles of various species.. These are the fundamental issues for a metropolitan ‘nature in the city’ planning strategy (AMP will be the competent authority), in which the city of Marseille functions as a partner and AGAM is the project manager. This will be the main development axis of the Multiple-Council Local Urban Planning Program (PLUi), and is therefore enshrined in an enforceable regulatory document. It is based on two levers which can be integrated into amendment no. 3:
• Complete the Marseille Provence green and blue infrastructure, by fleshing out and re-grouping the land through graphic boundaries and the identification of project sectors to be renatured. This section includes a significant territorial and regulatory interpretation which is implemented at the same rate as the procedures for modifying the urban planning document. In particular, the following objectives will be included:
• Insert a multi-thematic "Nature in the city, resilience and health" Planning and Development Orientation (OAP) to provide general planning principles for the ‘nature in the city’, water cycle and public health themes. The aim of this is to apply a spirit of education and partnership to develop reflections on environmental issues in operational | Strengthen and promote the deployment of the territory’s sustainable projects within the ecological transition and low-carbon strategy framework | City of Marseille

AA1 - PLAN FOR THE PROTECTION AND RECOVERY OF AGRICULTURAL LAND

|  Description | Carbon neutrality challenges | Parties involved | Budget and the major identified obstacles  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Since the middle of the 20th century, urbanisation and the development of transport infrastructures have led to the gradual disappearance of a large part of the agricultural land around Marseille. The "green belt" on the periphery has been fragmented to the north and east of the city and has almost disappeared in the southern districts. Despite this, the city of Marseille still has some 60 hectares of cultivated land and a potential 120 hectares of agricultural wasteland that could be reclaimed. It has one major asset, the Marseille canal, a structure that supplied water to the old market garden belt. This could be used to return to the traditional gravity-fed irrigation techniques. By resettling farmers the objective of the City and the Metropolis is to encourage eco-responsible agricultural production that follows agroecology principles, as the first link in a sustainable food policy. A real dynamic is underway, as can be seen with the project for an agricultural park of about a hundred hectares in the Hauts de Sainte-Marthe district where farmers have already started working on public land. | Around 1.6MTeq in CO2 emissions are linked to food supplies for in Marseille, i.e. the equivalent of 82% of the direct emissions (scope 1 and 2) of the city's GHG report. Processed food products account for half of human consumption In the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region.

⇒ Increase carbon sequestration potential
⇒ Reduce carbon emissions through short circuits
⇒ Improve the supply of unprocessed local food produce. | City of Marseille

AA2 - LOCAL, SUSTAINABLE, QUALITY FOOD ACCESSIBLE TO ALL

|  Description | Carbon neutrality challenges | Parties involved | Budget and the major identified obstacles  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  In recent years there has been a strong demand for locally sourced high quality produce. Short supply circuits are becoming more structured. Market gardening represents 60% of direct sales. The rest of the production is handled by the MIN des Arnavaux in Marseille. The dynamic is supported by NGO networks, the AMAP, ‘Les Paniers Marseillais’ or other companies that bring consumers and producers together.
The City and the Metropolis aim to support this dynamic, after having carried out an inventory and developing the necessary infrastructures: local sales outlets, food halls as well as direct sales from the farms. To | Our challenges:
=> Change consumption behaviour: less processed food and high carbon impact meat products
=> Give everyone access to healthier and more environmentally friendly food
=> Reduce carbon emissions through short supply circuits | City of Marseille

this end, the municipal educational farms sell their organic produce directly twice a week. The sustainable food policy also includes using educational farms to raise awareness among young people about virtuous eating habits and the Mediterranean diet. The City aims to increase educational activities in school, especially through school dinners. Access to quality food is a key element of the food project. Marseille has a rich network of socially committed NGOs and can rely on a network of social centres maintain their close ties with the population. Fruit and vegetable baskets are distributed across the territory for a special price. Projects are emerging to enable the less well-off to have access to local produce. This can be seen with the "marmites solidaires" project, a joint initiative run by the MIN and the food bank, which organises the collection of unsold food which it processes through professional integration initiatives and distributes to people in need. This project is a model for the social and solidarity economy and it is expected to expand in the future.

AA3 - INNOVATIVE AND EMERGING PROJECTS

|  Description | Carbon neutrality challenges | Parties involved | Budget and the major identified obstacles  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Many private project leaders have expressed their interest in contributing to the construction of a sustainable and quality food policy. These projects are complementary to the projects led by the local authorities and enable them to implement, at their own level, the European "From Farm to Table" strategy, which specifically recommends that the current food system be changed to:
• ensure sufficient, affordable and nutritious food within global limits,
• halve the use of pesticides and fertilisers, as well as the sales of antimicrobials,
• increase the share of land used for organic farming,
• promote more sustainable food consumption and healthy diets,
• reduce food loss and waste,
• combat food fraud in the supply chain,
• improve animal welfare. The majority of projects reconcile production practices with educational actions, and a special effort is made for ecological transition (energy reduction, reducing food waste, organic farming). Some projects are very innovative in terms of their low carbon footprint impact production methods. | Our challenges:
=> Activate all the levers contributing to the implementation of the territory's sustainable food policy and the reducing the carbon footprint impact
=> Encourage innovative projects to change production and consumption patterns towards healthier, less carbon-intensive practices. | City of Agriculture

|  The aim of this action is to green up Marseille's marinas and water sports centres by upgrading of technical port equipment to meet environmental standards, installing renewable energy (photovoltaic), evaluating the electrical conversion of the public and private fleet, and re-equipping of quays. | Marseille has 14 marinas and 3 water-sports centres.
Marinas, are strategic infrastructures for the region's development but are greatly concerned by challenges associated with global warming. These facilities are constantly evolving to provide a public service that meets sustainable development requirements. The Clean Harbours certification lays down certain bases for the reduction of energy consumption in marinas, but a broader vision is becoming indispensable for their modernisation. The marinas, and water sports centres, will be strong vectors in these fields, and can be home to innovations and/or other more common but nonetheless effective practices. | City of Marseille
Metropolis, Southern Region, ADEME, local businesses | Financial: Around €7.5 million (including €7 million for the Clean Harbours) in investment will be required to finance this action.  |

|  This action targets the preservation of posidonia and marine biodiversity through projects involving nurseries, ecological moorings, polluted water management, beach management and macro-waste reduction. | The Mediterranean has one major asset in the fight against climate change: posidonia which functions as a major carbon sink, storing up to 10 times more carbon than forest soils. In Corsica, the analysis of matte cores has revealed very significant carbon accumulations (700 tonnes per hectare).
The local Posidonia meadows currently cover an area of 107 ha around the Frioul archipelago and 414 ha around the Riou archipelago and along the Calanques coastline.
Their decline, brought about by human intervention, throughout the Mediterranean, and in particular in Marseilles, represents a danger both for the species they host and the benefits they provide humans. | City of Marseille

• By making children aware that sustainable development is about the needs of present and future generations.
• By encouraging and adopting environmentally friendly behaviour.
• By helping the children of Marseille to learn to be responsible

## 6.2 C2-SOCIAL AND OTHER INNOVATIONS

Involvement of citizens and stakeholders in the climate transition

Social inclusion will be the cornerstone to achieving climate neutrality in Marseille, in keeping with the municipal commitment to a fairer, greener and more democratic city. Since 2020, a number of actions have been completed to mobilise the parties involved around climate transition and social justice issues. First of all, the city of Marseille organised a dozen "Transition Mondays" sessions. These conference-debates have been a chance to regularly invite everyone involved in the ecological transition process (companies, associations, institutions, citizens) to meet up and exchange on different themes.

The city has systematised the inclusion of all involved parties in the city's policy making decisions: Organising the "Housing Inventory" in November 2022, the 2nd day of the Sustainable Construction Charter in October 2022 and organising a seminar associated with participative workshops on resilient city centre and climate change adaptation including in March 2022. In these development operations, the city has increased the number of its citizen consultation mechanisms: for the Catalans beach, the Place Jean Jaurès or the Place Sébastopol for example.

At the end of 2022, an association was created to support the Cité des transitions project, this involved a hundred or so highly motivated businesses and individuals from Marseille, who will coordinate the networking of transition ecosystems and site them in multiple locations across the city.

In the midst of all these local democracy mechanisms and after a number of consultations, the Citizens' Parliament for the future was officially launched on 15 March 2023 at the Town Hall. This will be a major element of municipal strategy for citizen participation. This assembly of 111 citizens will examine the public administrations political initiatives and, more specifically, it will be involved in monitoring the climate city contract. Initial work will focus on two defined topics:

The use of water, a shared resource threatened by drought.
Tourism, how to welcome visitors and respect the city and its inhabitants.
As well as two further topics that the Parliament will define for itself.

As part of a collective approach to transforming the territory, and in collaboration with the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolis and the Southern Region, the City of Marseille has organised two workshops to bring together all involved parties: businesses on one hand and associations/NGOs on the other, to draw up the Climate City Contract in December 2022.

After launching a inviting everyone to express their interest through an online questionnaire, the Marseille 2030 Mission collected just over 100 proposals, highlighting the dynamism of Marseille's population. There is significant popular support for these projects, depending on their themes, maturity and impact on decarbonisation. Further work will be carried out to identify the different levers of support these projects will require and the role that the Marseille 2030 approach could play in them.

An endowment fund has also been created to mobilise private funding which will be passed on to projects for the decarbonisation of the territory. It aims to support the launch and up-scaling of innovative projects covering all aspects of decarbonisation.

DETAILS OF THE TREND SCENARIO

The following table specifies the assumptions or methodological choices made to produce the trend scenario.

|  Secteur | Scénario tendanciel: Poétiques actuelles - gains/2019  |   |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Objectifs d'émissions en 2030 | Objectifs de réduction en valeur | Objectifs de réduction en % / 2019 | Référence | Commentaires  |
|  Transports routier | 544 378 | -203 494 | -27,2% | PDM : -28% /2017 | Equivalent également à l'objectif du PCAEM appliqué au transport routier (rappet -26% des émissions du transport / 2012)  |
|  Résidentiel | 382 683 | -125 459 | -24,2% | Evolution fil de l'eau | L'application de l'objectif du PCAEM (-19%/2012), reviendrait à un objectif de baisse de 1,2% / 2019. De plus, le fil de l'eau indiqué dans le PCAEM (baisse de 8% entre 2012 et 2030), aboutirait à des émissions plus élevées qu'en 2019. D'où le choix de partir sur l'évolution "fil de l'eau selon extrapolation de la période 2012-2019" qui permet d'intégrer une réelle baisse tendancielle des émissions et de ne pas se pénaliser au regard de l'objectif global.  |
|  Tertiaire | 229 252 | -61 764 | 21,2% | PCAEM : -28%/2012 | L'objectif du PCAEM de 28%/2012 est cohérent par rapport aux données 2019. Le tendanciel du PDAEM également. En revanche, le potentiel de réduction est à éclaircir selon données ATMO.  |
|  Industrie | 159 816 | -66 538 | -29,4% | Evolution fil de l'eau | L'objectif de réduction du PCAEM (-18,6%/2012) ne peut s'appliquer ici. Les caractéristiques de l'industrie sur Marseille sont très différentes de l'industrie sur l'agglo avec la ZIP, et l'application de cet objectif entraînerait une hausse des émissions de 19% par rapport à 2019. Le tendanciel du PCAEM ne serait non plus cohérent avec les données 2019. D'où le choix de conserver le tendanciel "fil de l'eau selon extrapolation de la période 2012-2019", ce qui permet d'intégrer dans le tendanciel la politique nationale de décarbonation du secteur industriel.  |
|  Transports maritimes | 152 377 | -34 907 | -18,6% | Evolution fil de l'eau | Le PCAEM ne fournit pas d'objectif ni de tendanciel spécifiquement sur le secteur maritime. En appliquant le tendanciel transport du PCAEM, l'évolution ne serait pas cohérente avec les émissions 2019. D'où le choix de conserver le tendanciel "fil de l'eau selon extrapolation de la période 2012-2019", ce qui permet d'intégrer dans le tendanciel les actions d'électrification à quai, et les stratégies de décarbonation des principaux armateurs (en particulier CMA-CGM)  |
|  Déchets | 5 465 | 0 | 0% | Evolution fil de l'eau | Le PCAEM ne fournit pas d'objectif spécifique sur ce secteur, ni de tendanciel. Choix de garder le "fil de l'eau selon extrapolation de la période 2012-2019", soit pas d'évolution depuis 2012.  |
|  Branche énergie | 4 520 | -785 | -14,8% | Maintien niveau 2012 | Le PCAEM ne fournit pas d'objectif GES sur ce secteur, ni de tendanciel. L'évolution au fil de l'eau en extrapolant la période 2012-2019 aboutirait à une évolution à la hausse de près de 29%, ce qui ne reflète pas les engagements de production d'ENRR du SRADDET et du PCAEM. D'où le choix de garder le niveau 2012, soit une baisse de près de 15% par rapport à 2019.  |
|  Transports ferroviaires | 3 761 | -717 | -16,0% | Maintien niveau 2012 | Le PCAEM ne fournit pas d'objectif ni de tendanciel spécifiquement sur le secteur ferroviaire. Le fil de l'eau selon extrapolation de la période 2012-2019 aboutirait à une augmentation de 32%. Pour refléter à la fois la politique de développement du train pour les trajets du quotidien et l'électrification, le choix est de garder le valeur 2012, soit une baisse de 16% /2019  |
|  Agriculture | 666 | 20 | -2% | Maintien niveau 2012 | Le PCAEM fixe pour objectif une baisse de 2% des émissions / 2012, ce qui aboutirait à une hausse des émissions de 3% / 2019. D'où le choix de garder le niveau d'émissions de 2012 permettant d'illustrer le soutien à l'évolution des pratiques agricoles  |

DETAILS OF THE EXPLORATORY SCENARIOS

## 7.3.1 DETAILS FOR ALL SECTORS

The table on page 62 of this document resumes the estimated potential gains under ambitious exploratory scenarios.

The methods used by each sector are specified below.

|  Sector | Exploratory scenario development method and assumptions.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Road transport | The exploratory scenario was based on the passenger transport share, which represents 65% of road sector emissions. Note: the use of private cars is behind 61% of all road sector emissions. No exploratory work has been carried out on the logistics share. Therefore, the result of the exploratory scenario for the passenger mobility share has been applied to the whole road sector; significant evolutions could however occur in the logistics sector, with changes to engines (the development of LEZs), and changes to distribution channels.  |
|  Residential | The exploratory scenario has been detailed in the body of the report. It is based on sobriety measures, the renovation of housing, and the changes to the energy mix supplying the sector.  |
|  Service Sector | The exploratory scenario has been detailed in the body of the report. It is based on sobriety measures, the renovation of housing, and the changes to the energy mix supplying the sector.  |
|  Industry | An ambitious hypothesis of a 50% reduction in emissions from this sector was proposed, allowing for European changes to carbon taxation, the decarbonisation of industry being a national priority, and investments, notably those made in the construction of an industry sector for hydrogen production.  |
|  Maritime transport | An ambitious hypothesis of a 50% reduction in emissions from this sector was proposed by the sector's operators, in view of changes to European legislation on maritime transport and the envisaged development of less carbon-intensive fuels. CMA CGM's commitment illustrates this dynamic.  |
|  Waste products | An assumption of a 50% reduction in emissions from this sector has been made, notably considering reduction at source, collection and bio waste recovery policies. In terms of scopes 1 and 2, this sector will not be the priority for reducing emissions.  |
|  Energy sector | A hypothesis of 100% reduction of emissions from this sector has been put forward, considering a total greening up of the territory's energy production.  |
|  Agriculture | The Afterres scenario envisages that the sector's emissions will be halved by 2050, while the exploratory scenario advances this objective to 2030. It should be remembered that in the Marseille territory, this sector represents only 0.03% of total emissions.  |

# 7.5 CITIZENS' ASSEMBLY FOR THE FUTURE : KEY ELEMENTS

A new space for reflection, the Citizens' Assembly for the Future intends to allow citizens to formulate concrete ecological and social transition proposals for the construction of a pilot city. The parliament was launched on 15 March 2023. 111 members of the Marseille population, who had expressed their interest in the Citizen's Parliament for the Future, were chosen at random to exercise their roles as citizens of the future within the parliament for a period of one year (non-renewable).

# What is the Citizens' Assembly for the Future?

It is a new democratic tool that allows a random selection of the people of Marseille to work together on medium and long-term issues, it also aims to get the population more involved in public and political action.

City of Marseille

Climate City Contract - Action Plan Section

INDDIGO - March 2023
,000 citizens from the voting register were selected at random and invited to participate by an email from the city council. They were then invited to express their interest in participating in the parliament.

From those who confirmed their interest a final random selection of 71 was made. This method ensured a representative sample of the population, respecting gender and age group parity across the city's districts and covering all educational backgrounds.

Representatives of the population who reside in Marseille but are not registered on the electoral lists were also selected randomly: 24 people were thus contacted through solidarity associations.

Finally, 16 young citizens of Marseille aged 16 to 18, were identified through educational establishments and selected at random from those of the city's high school students who agreed to participate.

A total of 111 randomly selected citizens constitute the Citizens' Parliament for the Future. They are appointed each year for a non-renewable period of one year.

## How does it work?

The citizens are divided into four working groups of 25 to 30, who meet up once a month, on Saturdays, to work collectively in as a parliament or in groups on themes chosen by the City of Marseille and the assembly itself.

The quality of its work is ensured by the presence of experienced and independent facilitators along with debates and presentations with experts and scientists.

## What is its role?

The Citizens' Parliament for the Future is responsible for formulating opinions, making concrete proposals and expressing wishes on subjects concerning the territory of Marseilles, its operation, public spaces, living environment, etc.

These proposals are forwarded to the City of Marseille and examined by its elected representatives and the specific departments concerned by the issues raised. They may also lead to proposals to be debated by the municipal council

# 1. INTRODUCTION

The Mediterranean is one of the most vulnerable regions as regards global climate change, which will only exacerbate already existing natural hazards (floods, forest fires, etc.), and is also one of the 34 biodiversity hotspots¹ in the world. Intensive and polluting human activities, combined with sea acidification and extreme temperatures, are damaging the Mediterranean's biodiversity and the health of its inhabitants. The Mediterranean has been a centre for economic, cultural and scientific exchange and for interaction in terms of migration since antiquity. This historic uniqueness has resulted in the emergence of a Mediterranean culture and an urban lifestyle of which Marseille is an archetypal example. Marseille epitomises the Mediterranean. From Massilia to the present day, the city has always been a key port and a place of welcome. It is a city of strong contrasts, ranging from new districts to a run-down historic city centre and very poor districts, and from high-tech industries to a survival economy.

In order to meet the twofold challenge of drastically reducing its fossil fuel consumption while seriously addressing the city's social problems, Marseille is adopting a unique, innovative and ambitious perspective on two interconnected approaches:

A top-down approach to sectoral public policies for the decarbonisation of the urban area using all the available technologies appropriate to our city and involving the inhabitants in order to encourage their support and inclusion,
A bottom-up creative, cross-sectoral and human approach to an overall transformation of society which will result in energy sobriety as well as social cohesion and new shared wealth, and which is democratic in nature because it is supported by all the stakeholders in the area, who are being encouraged by the City, the Metropolis and the Region to form an ecosystem.

The hybrid solutions which Marseille will implement through this dual approach will bring about cultural, technical, industrial and behavioural changes. The roadmap followed by this region could become a model for the Mediterranean. Marseille must become an area where carbon resilience is embodied in proactive policies which combine significant investment in social issues with changes in usage and infrastructure. It is about turning the current vulnerabilities into genuine assets.

On the strength of its commitment and political engagement, and the enthusiasm generated by the initial application, Marseille is proud to be joining the ‘100 smart and climate-neutral cities by 2030’ programme. This is the starting point of an unprecedented collective mobilisation to tackle the climate crisis.

Following its selection during the second quarter of 2022, the City began the initial work on the Climate City Contract (CCC) the following quarter with the creation of a launch steering committee involving the Metropolis and the Region. 8 committees worked during the last quarter of 2022 on the development of a first version of the CCC based on the templates provided by Net Zero Cities² in November 2022.

The concept of ‘hotspot’, developed by the NGO Conservation International, designates regions of the world where it is important to act as a priority because their biodiversity is both rich and under threat. As in other ‘hotspots’, the biodiversity of the Mediterranean Basin is marked by a high level of endemic wildlife.

# 2. OUR MOTIVATIONS

In addition to the desire to intensify climate action, collectively joining the ‘100 smart and climate-neutral cities by 2030’ programme meets a range of expectations and aspirations. The motivations of the authorities to collectively make commitments in this document include:

Organising climate-oriented local institutional cooperation: Although the application phase at the end of 2021 underlined the fact that a significant number of local stakeholders aspire to refocus their actions around prioritising the climate, it also underlined the advantage of setting up a method to drive initiatives forward. It was stressed that a collective commitment for the region and the climate (especially from the political sphere) aimed at prioritising cooperation and action regarding the challenge of climate change is necessary in order to involve the whole region in the transformations which need to be achieved.

Supporting the scaling up of transition initiatives brought about by the Marseille ecosystem by mobilising all available resources (community expertise, funding tools, etc.) and by enabling everyone to find their place in this transition.

Setting up funding mechanisms to sustain climate action over the coming decades and mobilise a maximum amount of public (European, national and local) and private funding to support high-impact actions in Marseille.

Building the narrative of a carbon-neutral Marseille based on a shared collective vision which allows everyone to envisage themselves in a new low-carbon lifestyle and which outlines the evolution of the local economy which needs to take place.

Guaranteeing that the transition deployed is fair and helps to combat social inequalities in the region.

# 3. OUR COMMITMENTS REGARDING THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY

The City of Marseille and the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolis supported by the Région Sud, co-signatories of this first version of the Climate City Contract, have been committed for many years to an energy and ecological transition based on solidarity in the face of climatic as well as social, economic and environmental challenges. There have been a number of landmark commitments in the past, which we would like to highlight here.

In 2013, the Région Sud adopted the first version of the Regional Climate Air and Energy Plan (SRCAE), which was subsequently updated and integrated into the Regional Plan for Sustainable Planning and Development for the Equality of Regions (SRADDET), approved on 15 October 2019. This was the first SRADDET to be adopted in France. It includes, among others, the objectives set out in the National Low Carbon Strategy (NLCS). Since 2017, the Region has placed the climate issue at the centre of its action with the Climate Plan ‘A COP in Advance’, which includes 141 actions. From 2017 to 2020, the City and the Metropolis were partners in a European project led by the Région Sud called ‘Nature For City LIFE’.

In 2019, the Metropolis (created on 1 January 2016) ratified its metropolitan project and adopted, among its 12 commitments, that of ‘entering the post-carbon era, to change our air and our energy’. The Metropolis’ goals were reflected in the unanimous adoption in December 2021 of its Metropolitan Climate Air and Energy Plan (PCAEM), the only regulatory document in the region, which aims to reduce greenhouse gases by 14% by 2025, reduce energy consumption by 50% by 2050, cover 100% of needs with renewable energy, adapt the region to climate change and reduce emissions of pollutants and noise pollution (by 25% by 2025). The strategy is broken down into 13 key areas of focus and 100 flagship actions. In addition to this plan, a number of programmes have directly contributed to this initiative’s goals, including the Sustainable Development and Planning Project of the Regional Coherence Plan which includes an objective relating to the artificialisation of land; the inter-communal Local Urban Plan (adopted in 2019) which is constantly being developed with regard to nature in the city and health-oriented urban planning; the Local Housing Plan (adopted in March 2023) which is in line with the
objectives of the PCAEM in terms of energy renovation and emphasises the balance between the renovation of the old stock and new production and, lastly, the establishment of a Low Emission Zone in Marseille.

Between 2018 and 2021, the Metropolis, in close partnership with the City of Marseille, all the communes and Région Sud, drafted the Mobility Plan for the period 2020-2030. 17 ambitious objectives contributing to action in the face of the climate emergency have been retained, including between 2012 and 2030, a 28% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 29% reduction in energy consumption in the transport sector, a doubling of the use of metropolitan transport, a 50% increase in the use of urban transport and an increase in the modal share of cycling to 7%, compared to 1% in 2017.

In 2021, the City of Marseille broke new ground by conducting an experiment and pedestrianising the Corniche Kennedy. It announced, following conclusive results, that this calming of the public space in terms of traffic would be repeated on a monthly basis. At the end of 2021, the City made a more general commitment to the climate and signed the Covenant of Mayors (a covenant also signed by the Metropolis), with the objective of being carbon neutral by 2050, of becoming more resilient and of combating fuel poverty. This commitment will be followed, in 2022, by the launch of a climate action structuring process based on a proven national methodology (Territoire Engagé Transition Ecologique, French version of the European Energy Award).

Also in 2021, the City of Marseille and the Metropolis published the ground-breaking study 'The Historic Heart of Marseille in Transition' as part of the 'PIA2 Investment in the Future Sustainable City' programme. The City, the Metropolis and the Region organised a seminar on climate change resilience measures for cities on 22 March 2022.

At the end of 2021, the City of Marseille will ratify a historic agreement with the State to finance the renovation plan for Marseille's schools, many of which are veritable heatwasters. The Schools Plan aims to renovate the city's 470 schools, 174 of which will be completely renovated or created. It is unprecedented in its scope and should enable all children to be offered decent learning conditions.

The City of Marseille then launched an application for a European Commission climate programme. After gathering around a hundred supporters from the region to put together its application, Marseille was selected from among more than 370 cities to join the '100 Carbon-Neutral Cities by 2030' programme. Seen as a founding act for a new era for Marseille, this designation is an opportunity to launch an unprecedented level of collaborative work around the challenge of climate change and the transformation of Marseille by 2030. The Municipal Youth Council quickly took up the approach and brought a strong message to the European Commission during a visit to Brussels in December 2022.

The Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur Region adopted, in June 2022, a new Regional Plan for Economic Development, Innovation and Internationalisation (SRDEII) 2022-2028. One of the 5 strategic priorities is to promote environmentally friendly economic growth by aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050. Within the framework of the experimental protocol between the State and the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur Region launched at the end of 2022, the Region also wishes to become a pilot region for the deployment of ecological planning in France.

In November 2022, the City of Marseille approved an ambitious Energy Efficiency Plan, aiming for a 10% reduction in the community's overall energy consumption by 2023, then 40% by 2030 and 60% by 2050. The City is committed to taking concrete action on a daily basis to reduce energy consumption (lowering heating, raising the set temperature of air conditioning, etc.) as well as energy efficiency (renovation of the most energy-intensive municipal buildings, better management of ventilation, etc.).

In the same month, the City of Marseille organised for the first time the "États Généraux du Logement" (General Housing Forum) in order to respond to urgent needs and to create the tools to move forward in resolving the housing crisis in Marseille. A series of commitments directly concern the fight against fuel poverty, the development of renewable energy and energy renovation.

Marseille 2030 Climate Target Plan - Climate City Contract – Commitments - Page 5
At the start of 2023, the City of Marseille put in place an ambitious Tree Plan in order to give a major boost to the return of nature to the city with the planting of 308,000 woodland plants, including 8,000 mature trees by 2028.

In 2022, the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolis has been elected European Capital of Innovation, a metropolis that is the cradle of an "innovative diversity" that aims to build, experiment with and replicate the model of tomorrow's Mediterranean city, socially inclusive, resilient to climate change and sustainable.

In 2022, the Climate City Contract was a further step in this story and represented a strong desire on the part of authorities to work together to accelerate the energy transition and contribute to achieving carbon neutrality.

## 4. THE AIM OF THE CLIMATE CITY CONTRACT

The commitment made in this document is first and foremost a commitment to the region's citizens and socioeconomic players to act practically, rapidly and effectively in order to put Marseille on the road to carbon neutrality. Civil society is committed, expectations are high and justified.

To meet these expectations, the City of Marseille, the Metropolis and the Region must share a clear assessment and understanding of the situation, a common ambition, an operational roadmap and an ongoing working process. In this respect, the Climate City Contract has an unprecedented educational and political scope, and is structured primarily with this in mind. It should be noted that the Climate City Contract is an iterative process and that this document is a first step.

On the strength of a common political commitment and shared challenges, the co-signatories of this contract have chosen to work together to share their expertise, to collaborate on the implementation of climate actions, to strengthen the scope and timetable of current actions, to innovate together through experimentation, to develop new methods of mobilising civil society and the economic sphere, and lastly, to look for new sources of public and private funding from local organisations to Europe.

This document constitutes the first version of the Climate City Contract, which binds the City of Marseille, the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolis and the Region to this voluntary, collective and ambitious approach, as well as all the partners carrying out a project in the area. Its purpose is to define a form of governance and a working method which will enable effective collective action in the face of the challenge of climate change in the Marseille area.

The Climate City Contract is based on a template provided by the Net Zero Cities mission and comprises 3 parts:

The 'commitments' section, reflecting the motivations of the signatories, their strategic priorities and a formalisation of their way of working together.
The 'action plan' section, detailing the carbon assessment, the strategic objectives set, an identification of the actions to be carried out and a list of identified projects contributing to the objectives.
The 'funding plan' section which assesses macroscopically the financial resources already mobilised and, above all, the amount still to be committed, in order to achieve the shared 2030 objective.

Marseille 2030 Climate Target Plan - Climate City Contract – Commitments - Page 6
# 5. 2030 OBJECTIVE: AIM FOR A DRASTIC REDUCTION IN EMISSIONS AND MARSEILLE'S ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE

Europe's objective within the framework of the Smart and Carbon-Neutral Cities Mission is twofold:

To create 100 carbon-neutral cities by 2030 by and for citizens (cities are responsible for 70% of GHGs);
To ensure that these cities serve as centres of experimentation and innovation to enable all European cities to follow suit by 2050.

The challenge is immense: the current rate of reduction in the carbon footprint of France is in the order of 1% to 2% per year. A goal of carbon neutrality in 2050 requires a rate of 4% and carbon neutrality in 2030 requires a rate of 10% per year.

As part of the work carried out to draw up this first version of the Climate City Contract, an analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions directly emitted⁴ within the Marseille area concluded that the rate of reduction - without significant action by public authorities or companies and based on a continuation of the trends observed between 2012 and 2019 - would be a 10% reduction in emissions between 2019 and 2030 and a 25% reduction with the deployment of the policies currently under consideration (in particular, the Metropolitan Mobility Plan and the Metropolitan Air and Energy Climate Plan).

These emission reductions are to be set against the following targets, again for 2030 and compared to 2019: a 35% reduction is required in the carbon budgets of the National Low Carbon Strategy, a 75% reduction is required to meet the vision of carbon neutrality, taking into account that the remaining 25% is absorbed by local, national and global carbon sinks.

The collective commitment is to work towards a drastic reduction in the region's GHG emissions as part of the '100 Carbon-Neutral Cities by 2030' mission. The first exploratory scenarios, the result of concerted collective work, propose a trajectory to reduce direct GHG emissions by 50% compared to 2019 levels. New actions will subsequently enrich the plan using an iterative approach of systemic change and the inclusion of citizens.

In order to achieve this ambitious goal, authorities are committed to making Marseille a pilot Mediterranean city for carbon neutrality and to working collectively in order to adapt to climate change.

Marseille 2030 Climate Target Plan - Climate City Contract – Commitments - Page 7
While the focus of the European Mission is first and foremost on the issue of climate change mitigation - and therefore on associated greenhouse gas emissions - the collective commitment also covers the following objectives:

Contributing to the reduction of poverty and to social empowerment will be inseparable from climate action. The region's greatest asset is the diversity of its population, with 111 village-like neighbourhoods each with a strong urban character and history. Marseille is a young and dynamic city in which civil society is seizing the challenges of the future through a widespread demonstration of democracy. The very strong involvement of citizens and associations is encouraging an urban model of social and ecological justice for the Marseille area. However, the region is socially fractured, with strong social inequalities. The rate of poverty reached 26% of the overall population, affecting children in particular and 38 neighbourhoods are designated as national priority neighbourhoods (QPV) because of their inhabitants' level of poverty. The approach must contribute to significantly reducing the rate of poverty in the region.

Combining adaptation to climate change and reduction of GHG emissions so that Marseille can enter a transition which prepares the city for climate change and prioritises adaptation in the investment choices made. This must become one of the fundamentals of the approach by identifying the requirements for adaptation in order to take into account the future climate on the one hand, and on the other hand, to avoid 'maladaptation'5. An assessment of vulnerabilities will have to be carried out as part of the process.

Contributing to improving the region's energy resilience: in the context of the European energy crisis, sobriety and the fight against fuel poverty, in addition to directly contributing to decarbonisation, will help to improve the region's ability to withstand various crises. These approaches are also necessary in order to enter an era of regenerating ecosystems and reducing the use of natural resources.

Improving the health of residents must be a priority in the development of public policies and projects deployed within the framework of the climate transition.

Lastly, increasing employment in Marseille: the transition must create local jobs, enabling Marseille to significantly reduce its unemployment rate (17% in 2019, i.e. 8 percentage points higher than the national average).

Adaptation which fails to reduce vulnerability, and instead increases it.

# 6. KEY PRIORITIES AND STRATEGIC INTERVENTIONS

Through the Climate City Contract, the City of Marseille and the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolis supported by the Région Sud hope to transform their climate commitments into concrete actions which will have a strong impact on the Marseille region. The time has come for action and for projects both in terms of setting an example as a region with regard to the challenge of climate change - in which everyone must play their part - and in terms of improving energy and climate resilience.

After an initial work phase, several committees focusing on various themes identified different priorities for action which were shared between institutions. These are detailed below and should guide the operational work on projects being deployed in the coming years. It should be noted that they will be updated and enriched as the process unfolds.

## Priority 1 - Revolutionise the way people travel in Marseille (Transport &amp; Logistics Committee):

Target high-emission passenger journeys: City-Metropolis journeys, city centre-Metropolis journeys, city centre - rest of Marseille journeys and internal Marseille journeys
Accelerate the 'sobriety' drivers which have a strong potential impact between now and 2030 at a relatively controlled cost (cycling plan, traffic calming of public spaces, reserved lanes for public transport or car sharing, etc.).
Secure funding for the development of major infrastructure projects (Metropolitan Mobility Plan, deployment of EV charging infrastructure, etc.) which are feasible between now and 2030, and for structuring projects with a post-2030 impact (particularly projects supported by the Region and its partners)
Develop inclusive mobility and contribute to the opening up of the northern districts.
Support the transition to low-carbon logistics (rail freight, logistics platforms, zero-emission vehicles, cyclo-logistics, etc.)

## Priority 2 – Decarbonise the housing stock by combating fuel poverty and substandard housing (Housing Committee):

Fight against soil artificialisation by favouring rehabilitation whenever possible
Support and expand the energy renovation of private and social housing
Support the rehabilitation of public tertiary buildings using a comprehensive and exemplary approach. To this end, the City of Marseille's school plan is a priority.
Lead a network of public and private partners, draw up a common reference framework about sustainable construction and combat urban heat islands by acting in particular on the old city center within the framework of the Partnership Development Project (PPA)
Take action on vocational training and the construction industry as a whole, and make the connection between employment supply and demand

## Priority 3 – Scale up sobriety, efficiency and renewable energies (Energy Committee)

Deploy a strategy for energy sobriety in the region at different levels (individuals, organisations, region)
Diversify the local energy mix and support an increase in the use of renewables in Marseille:
Develop a large-scale plan for solar energy (photovoltaic and solar thermal)
Develop heating and cooling networks
Develop new economic &amp; energy models such as local energy communities

## Priority 4 – Reduce, Reuse, Sort and Recycle (Circular Economy &amp; Waste Committee)
Take action to reduce waste at source (increase communication and support for behaviour change, facilitate composting)
Develop reuse, local channels, recycling centres, returns deposits and the circular economy in general (including the construction sector)
Improve sorting and implement the separate collection of bio-waste
Develop the material and energy recovery of collected waste

## Priority 5 – Strengthen our Mediterranean model of a green city (Nature in the City Committee, Urban Agriculture &amp; Food Committee, Sea &amp; Coastal Committee):

Nature in the city:

Increase the tree stock, increase the resilience of the existing stock and restore the urban landscape in order to preserve the ecosystem services provided
Preserve the green network and increase its density by creating new green spaces (continuous/discontinuous) and by ‘re-naturing’ the existing ones
Improve biodiversity functioning through green, blue, dark and brown corridors and involve citizens in the associated projects
‘Bitumen removal’ in order to return water to the soil and help reduce urban overheating
Use nature-based management (sobriety and frugality)

Urban agriculture &amp; food:

Plan to reclaim agricultural land: reclaim the 120 ha of unused agricultural land, install new farmers and develop agroecology and organic farming practices
Increase access to local, sustainable, quality food which is accessible to all: short supply chains, out-of-home catering (RHD), food insecurity, urban vegetable gardens, collective gardens and the fight against food waste, etc.
Make the city's school catering exemplary in terms of local distribution channels, organic products, zero plastic, reduction of waste
Support innovative and emerging projects

Sea &amp; coast

Support a transition to low-carbon marinas and water sports centres
Develop a peaceful, depolluted and ‘re-naturalized’ coastline
Preserve and restore posidonia and marine biodiversity
Protect a unique local feature: archipelagos and islands
Conduct joint international action and the sharing of knowledge
Act on upstream pollution (land-based waste collection devices, education, etc.) and organise pilot projects on cleaning up macro-waste at sea.

## Priority 6 – Raise awareness across the whole region (Education &amp; Awareness-Raising Committee)

Create an educational pathway on the environment which includes an extensive component on climate issues (in particular within the framework of the Regional Educational Project)
Organise the transformation of organisations and professional practices, particularly through training (local authority employees, citizens, companies, etc.)

# 7. ORGANISATIONAL PRINCIPLES

In addition to agreeing on a set of common objectives and theme-based priorities, the partners commit to operating principles which should ensure that the objective is achieved. After the first months of work, the following core principles have been identified:

## A science based approach

The scientific requirements for staying on a 1.5°C global warming trajectory provide the overall framework for the approach. These requirements are translated into concrete objectives which are as operational as possible for each of the actions developed. The aim is to be able to make the link between the targets for reducing emissions, the roadmaps and actions taken, and, where possible, the projects deployed.

In order to ensure that this scientific requirement is indeed one of the guidelines of the approach, a scientific committee was set up in 2022. Its role is to guide the process in its main choices. In practical terms, the scientific committee, composed of some fifteen members (see appendices), can:

Select subjects to put on the agenda for the approach, appoint experts to participate in the working committees,
Advocate and recommend within the iterative process changes to the contract (in terms of content and method)
Request regular evaluations of the programme's progress.

This scientific committee is also used as a means to increase the links between urban action and the world of research within the various projects.

## Institutional co-piloting of the approach: collective governance

The process is initiated by the City of Marseille and piloted collectively with the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolis and the Région Sud. These authorities are actively involved in the various governance bodies (committees, etc.) particularly in order to:

Organise the management and monitoring of actions and projects in the action plan
Facilitate the implementation of the projects identified in the contract: share objectives and requirements, communicate information on the progress of the project, make use of the skills available to speed up the implementation of the projects, provide technical advice on sticking points, identify sources of funding, etc.
Share expertise between authorities in order to make progress on different issues (e.g. cycling facilities, energy renovation, greening the city etc.)
Collectively study the responses which can be given to external project leaders

## An opportunity to promote the region's vitality and creativity

As mentioned in the introduction, the transformation of the region must combine a normative and plan-based approach - breaking down the annual carbon budgets to be respected into actions and projects - and a local creative approach - identifying and facilitating local initiatives which contribute directly to the objective. In the initial stages of the process, the region's stakeholders were sounded out on their willingness to get involved and a first series of projects was identified that they wished to carry out. The remainder of the process should contribute to:

Mobilising local, national and European resources (public and private) to support local initiatives which are directly in line with the mission's objectives. For example, this support could take the form of:
Engineering support to obtain funding,
Setting up agreements to facilitate the roll-out of projects,
Consideration of new solutions in public procurement,
Unlocking direct funding,
etc.

Setting up a working process allowing the involvement of the whole ecosystem in the formulation of their own objectives, the evolution of the approach's priorities, the practical implementation of actions and feedback on requirements. The governance involved at this stage in this first version of the contract remains to be decided.

## A strong citizen involvement

Climate neutrality for Marseille is achievable not only through a reduction of the region's emissions through technology, but also, and more importantly, through the engagement of its inhabitants. Social inclusion is the cornerstone of Marseille's transformation. It will rely on several innovative initiatives which will contribute to the creation of a 'participatory transitional ecosystem' which will produce beneficial changes in community practices.

The first large-scale initiative is the Citizens' Assembly for the Future (ACF), launched on 15 March 2023 by the Mayor of Marseille. Just over one hundred citizens, representative of the population of Marseille and selected at random, will have the task of coming up with concrete proposals for the future of the City of Marseille. These proposals may take the form of opinions*, wishes* or suggestions for discussion*. The first two subjects referred to the City have been those of restraint in the use of water and sustainable tourism in Marseille. The City has agreed to make available to the ACF any information and expertise deemed useful to the ACF's work. A working group will be dedicated to the theme of 'Climate Neutral Marseille in 2030'.

In September 2022, the President of the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolis called on the Development Council - which represents the voice of civil society and citizens (240 members representing socio-economic stakeholders, including 60 citizens) - to work in 2023 on the following question: 'How can we achieve Aix-Marseille-Provence's objectives in terms of transition?' It was asked to submit proposals to elected officials as regards changing lifestyles and consumption patterns in order to drastically reduce the carbon footprint and to adapt to climate and environmental challenges.

In addition to these initiatives, there has been the gradual engagement in the climate crisis of existing forums of discussion (Municipal Youth Council, Metropolitan Youth Council, etc.) as well as the involvement of citizens in all the projects carried out in the region, which is not detailed here but can be seen in part in the action plan section of the contract.

## The implementation of evaluation and shared monitoring

An evaluation of the roadmap's progress by following impact and achievement indicators must be set up, based in particular on the monitoring already carried out within the framework of the SRADDET, the PCAET and the ADEME Region Committed to Ecological Transition initiative. In 2023, the 9 French cities involved in the 100 Cities mission will work together to identify a common set of indicators.

# 8. PROCESS AND SCHEDULE

## Quarterly meetings

The various bodies of governance (Steering Committee, committees, scientific council) will meet quarterly to ensure the management of the process, the actions and the associated projects. A bi-annual meeting, chaired by the signatory authorities, will ensure progress on key actions and projects.

## An iterative process and a broadening of stakeholders

This first version of the contract mentions the commitment of the City and the Metropolis supported by the Region as the foundation of the approach. This is a commitment to enter into an iterative working process both on enriching the understanding of the climate crisis (carbon and energy assessment, analysis of climate change) and its local repercussions and on the regular adjustment of priorities in the portfolio of actions and priority projects.

An initial consultation of the region's stakeholders has been carried out, but the approach is intended to be further enriched by projects from the Marseille ecosystem in future versions of the Climate City Contract.

## An update in 2024 and bi-annual updates

A first update of the Climate City Contract is already planned for 2024. This update will be based mainly on the recommendations of the Scientific Council and the Citizens' Assembly for the Future.

Then, provided that the Climate City Contract proves to be the right vehicle to pilot this type of approach in the next two years, a process of updating the different parts of the contract will be carried out every two years (2025-2027-2029).

## Work schedule 2023-2024

The Marseille 2030 Climate Target Plan approach is intended to be expanded in 2023 and 2024 along the following lines:

Developing local institutional cooperation
Conducting regular committees focusing on different themes and steering committees to monitor the implementation of the projects identified in the action plan
Implementing internal project monitoring within the City of Marseille and regularly sharing progress to identify possible synergies between authorities or with the local ecosystem
Mobilising funding mechanisms
Facilitating a dialogue with the European Commission and the Net Zero Cities platform on the tools available to support local projects
Developing an endowment fund to support a range of local projects
Responding to calls for projects relating to the ‘100 Smart and Carbon-Neutral Cities in 2030’ programme
Creating a collective narrative of a carbon-neutral Marseille which enables everyone to envisage themselves being part of the transformations to be carried out in the area
Supporting local stakeholders developing projects addressing the challenge of climate change
Ensuring that the transition is fair, in particular by leading a working group within the Citizens' Assembly for the Future dedicated to the transformation of Marseille as regards the challenge of climate change.
