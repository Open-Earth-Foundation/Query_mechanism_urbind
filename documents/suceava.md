# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses, and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

On December 12, 2015, during the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21), 195 States, Romania included, adopted the Paris Agreement, which strives to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below +2°C. The European Union has committed under the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030, and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. To achieve these ambitious targets, the European Green Deal was developed, which makes reaching climate neutrality by 2050 legally binding in the EU, and around 1 trillion Euro of public and private funds have been mobilized through the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, to help achieve the target.

VISION: Suceava City in 2030 is a metropolis running largely on renewable energy sources, with a fully decarbonized transport infrastructure, efficient and environmentally friendly public transport, occupied by buildings built to high-energy efficiency standards, quality green spaces, a local circular economy focused on sustainable goods and services and an integrated and efficient waste management system.

In support of the European Green Deal, the European Commission has also set the "100 Carbon Neutral Cities by 2030" Mission. The scope of the Mission is to: Support, promote and showcase 100 European cities in their systemic transformation towards climate neutrality by 2030 and make these cities into experimentation and innovation hubs for all cities, thus leading on the European Green Deal and on Europe's efforts to become climate neutral by 2050. Suceava has been selected as one of the 100 Mission cities and it is committing to increase efforts to achieve climate neutrality and serve as an example for other cities.

This commitment was already approved by the local decision makers and it is included in other (already in implementation phase strategic) documents such as: Integrated Urban Development Strategy 2021-2030 and Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, both designed for Urban Functional Area of Suceava (with two cities and 7 villages from the metropolitan area). Other relevant strategic document is the 2021-2030 Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) – already approved and currently into the implementation phase with several projects linked with energy efficiency and reduction of GHG emission.

Within the framework of existing local strategic documents and their integration and further development to a raised ambition towards the Mission in the CCC process, the Municipality of Suceava acts as a, light house, city with innovative, ambitious and integrated initiatives that approach reduction of energy consumption and GHG emissions. Achieving climate neutrality in a city requires a commitment to reduce sources of GHG emissions as much as possible, for example through the use of renewable energy resources to replace fossil fuels, while offsetting those residual emissions which are too hard to eradicate.

The city vision, born from a collective desire for a cleaner, healthier future, ignited a spark within the community. It fuelled the creation of Suceava's Climate Action Plan, a roadmap towards becoming a Net Zero City. This plan, far from being a mere document, is a testament to the city's commitment, a story of collective action, innovation, and the unwavering belief in a brighter tomorrow.

Recognizing their contribution to the global climate challenge, the people of Suceava, along with the municipality and local stakeholders, embarked on a journey of transformation. They acknowledged the reality – greenhouse gas emissions from various sources, including transportation, buildings and waste, were contributing to the environmental crisis.

On its pathway to became a "green city", with previous achievements like being the first Romanian city with a municipal electric fleet, charging facilities and incentives for electric vehicles, first and only (so far) Romanian city with 100% electric public transport, Suceava City sees the Climate City Contract and Net Zero Cities Mission as the perfect opportunity to continue its efforts and accelerate the implementation of specific actions that will create the local conditions to reach the climate neutrality goals.

City vision: A Resilient Future for Suceava: Embracing Sustainability

Suceava City envisions itself as a thriving green metropolis by 2030, as being a city where:

Clean air and vibrant green spaces replace the haze of pollution, fostering a healthy environment for generations to come.
Renewable energy powers the city, minimizing its carbon footprint and showcasing its commitment to a sustainable future.
Efficient transportation systems, with robust public options and emphasis on walking and cycling, create a
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

more liveable and connected city.

Sustainable practices become the norm, embedded in everyday life from waste management to energy consumption.

To become a climate neutral city, Suceava committed to the following steps:

Carrying out a greenhouse gas inventory to establish where emissions and their values come from;
Developing a climate action plan setting out the strategies and actions needed to reduce emissions; the plan must be aligned with the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development;
Reducing energy consumption - increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, implementing smart grids and promoting alternative means of travel (electric public transport, walking, cycling, etc.);
Increase production and promotion of renewable energy and clean vehicles;
Offsetting carbon emissions - any remaining carbon emissions should be offset by investing in green projects (reforestation, carbon capture and storage, etc.);
Involving stakeholders (residents, businesses, public administration, etc.) collaborating on the implementation of initiatives and promoting a culture of sustainability and sustainable development.

Suceava's story is not just about numbers and targets; it's about the unwavering spirit of a community united in pursuit of a shared vision. It's a testament to the power of collective action and the belief that even the most challenging goals can be achieved when a community comes together, united by hope and a desire to create a better future for generations to come.

The sentence "Environment is not a heritage from previous generation but most likely a loan from the future ones" must be the official statement for all public authorities. The list of the projects and the interventions that are included into the Action Plan and Investment Plan was established together with local and regional stakeholders, as Suceava’s ultimate goal is the reduction of the local GHG emissions by at least 80% till 2030.

# 1 Introduction

The introduction should outline the local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and describe the gap it is addressing in broad terms.

## Introduction - textual element

Suceava Municipality is a public administration institution responsible for local infrastructure, heating, public lighting, public transport, culture, public spaces, green areas, social activities, education utilities and has a budget of 203.229.064 Euro/year (related to 2023). Information and key data about Suceava City are included in Annex 1 at the Action Plan.

Previous actions related to climate neutrality : In the past 15 years there were many investment projects in the field of energy efficiency (public and private buildings), alternative heating production (biomass), rehabilitation of public lighting (LED systems), education buildings, public transport (100 % electric fleet), alternative vehicles (electric municipal fleet, charging stations for EV’s – with incentives for charging also for private owners), traffic management, cycling lanes, electric bicycles and scooters, rehabilitation of central heating system, separate waste collection and recycling system, rehabilitation of the water and sewage system, green areas, rehabilitation of pedestrian (low emission zone) and road infrastructure, city ring. Suceava recognizes the urgent need to address the global climate crisis and minimize its impact on communities, the economy and the environment. It is recognized that the local community is currently contributing to this crisis through greenhouse gas emissions from transport, buildings, waste and other sources.

Suceava Municipality’s Commitments: The municipality's commitment to its responsibility to mitigate climate change is to achieve climate neutrality in terms of climate impact by 2030, and to meet this goal requires a reduction in local greenhouse gas emissions. This is to be achieved through the following actions:

Reduction of greenhouse emissions - emissions levels in Suceava will be reduced through various methods such as: increasing energy efficiency and use of renewable energy, promoting sustainable transport options, increasing the area of green spaces in the city, increasing the use of alternative transport;
Offsetting carbon emissions - the remaining greenhouse gas emissions will be offset by investing in projects such as: renewable energy installations, reforestation;
Encouraging public involvement and community action - so the community will actively participate and take collective responsibility in reducing the locality's greenhouse gas emissions;
Annual progress reports - this will track and report annually on progress at the local level in order to have control over achieving the climate neutrality target;
Conduct community awareness and education campaigns to understand that achieving climate neutrality will require sustained effort and significant investment.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Thus, all stakeholders will be called upon to support and work together to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The municipality has an important role to play in leading the local climate transition towards the goal set by joining the 100 Smart and Climate Neutral Cities Mission by 2030. The role that Suceava will play in the coming period is to become the initiator of the decarbonisation process at local level by providing a concrete example of best practice, thus one of the first cities to commit to involving most of the local stakeholders in the climate transition process.

The actual organization and management of this ambitious process will follow an open approach towards the general public and all stakeholders, so that the focus is on dialogue and collaboration between stakeholders, both through public consultation and information gathering from all sectors of interest, providing opportunities for involvement in an equitable and participatory governance.

Suceava had voluntarily joined the national program "Transparent, open and participatory governance - standardization, harmonization, improved dialogue", carried out by the General Secretariat of the Government and the Ministry of European Affairs, which aimed at improving electronic services and their interoperability, increasing transparency and citizens' involvement in the development process of the city.

Therefore, through the climate contract the local authority shows once again that the Municipality of Suceava aims to involve citizens in the current processes of development of the city, demonstrating a public management oriented towards the citizen and the relevant factors of the local plan.

Fuelled by the success of previous initiatives, like being the first Romanian city with a 100% electric public transport fleet, Suceava saw the Climate City Contract and Net Zero Cities Mission as the perfect opportunity to accelerate their progress.

The municipality, acting as a facilitator and coordinator, embarked on a collaborative journey, bringing together diverse stakeholders - residents, businesses, experts, and public officials - to co-create the action plan.

This collaborative spirit permeated every step of the process. Public consultations and workshops ensured that the plan addressed the community's needs and concerns directly.

The voices and suggestions of citizens became the foundation for identifying and designing projects, ensuring the plan was not just top-down, but truly representative of the collective vision. The resulting action plan lays out a clear roadmap towards achieving climate neutrality by 2030. It outlines ambitious yet achievable goals, like reducing CO2 emissions by 80.6% compared to the 2021 baseline. This ambitious target is not an insurmountable obstacle but a call to action, a shared responsibility embraced by the entire community.

On its pathway to became a "green city", with previous achievements like being the first Romanian city with a municipal electric fleet, charging facilities and incentives for electric vehicles, first and only (so far) Romanian city with 100% electric public transport, Suceava City sees the Climate City Contract and Net Zero Cities Mission as the perfect opportunity to continue its efforts and accelerate the implementation of specific actions that will create the local conditions to reach the climate neutrality goals.

# 3. City vision: A Resilient Future for Suceava: Embracing Sustainability

Suceava City envisions itself as a thriving green metropolis by 2030, as being a city where:

Clean air and vibrant green spaces replace the haze of pollution, fostering a healthy environment for generations to come.
Renewable energy powers the city, minimizing its carbon footprint and showcasing its commitment to a sustainable future.
Efficient transportation systems, with robust public options and emphasis on walking and cycling, create a more liveable and connected city.
Sustainable practices become the norm, embedded in everyday life from waste management to energy consumption.

Suceava's City Challenges and the Stakes: However, the path to this vision is not without its challenges. Climate change poses a real threat, affecting Suceava's environment, economy, and overall well-being. Rising temperatures, increased air pollution, and extreme weather events are all potential consequences if action isn't taken. Beyond the environmental concerns, the people of Suceava worry about the city's long-term prosperity and its ability to attract future generations. They aspire for a city that offers a high quality of life, economic opportunities, and a sense of connection to its rich cultural heritage.

The Climate City Contract (CCC): A Catalyst for Change: The Climate City Contract (CCC) serves as a powerful catalyst for Suceava's ambitions, both climate-centric and beyond. It provides a framework for
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

collaboration and resource mobilization, accelerating the city's existing commitments to sustainability.

Suceava already boasts a significant foundation of successful sustainability initiatives, including its 100% electric public transport fleet.

How the CCC is addressing to Suceava Municipality’s ambitions and engagement to climate neutrality:

The CCC builds upon these achievements by:

Amplifying Suceava's City voice on the global stage: The city gains access to a network of like-minded communities, fostering knowledge sharing and best practice exchange.

Attracting resources and investment: Participation in the CCC opens doors to funding and partnerships, accelerating the implementation of Suceava's ambitious goals.

Boosting innovation and collaboration: The CCC fosters collaboration between public and private stakeholders, encouraging the development of innovative solutions for a sustainable future.

The CCC goes beyond just climate change, contributing to Suceava's broader vision for the future. By promoting sustainable practices and resource efficiency, the city can:

Reduce its dependence on external energy sources, making it more resilient and economically secure.

Position itself as a leader in sustainability, attracting investment and talent, particularly within the green economy sector.

Enhance the overall quality of life for residents, creating a healthier and more vibrant city.

Areas of intervention proposed by thematic working group and included in the Climate City Contract are covering the entire territory of Suceava city and could be defined as following:

Urban mobility - tackling climate change by promoting more energy efficient, "green" transport, sustainable public transport, alternative transport and other sustainable mobility options.

Energy Efficiency - promoting more efficient energy consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by improving the energy efficiency of public and residential buildings, public lighting systems and heating transport and distribution network

Renewable Energy - promoting renewable energy sources, especially solar, to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Public Lighting - improving the energy efficiency of public lighting systems and promoting energy efficient lighting technologies.

Waste Management - addressing waste management and reducing its environmental impact by promoting recycling, separate waste collection and other sustainable waste management methods.

Urban Regeneration and Revitalization of Public Spaces - improving the quality of the urban environment through the development of more environmentally friendly green spaces and other public areas and promoting more sustainable practices in urban construction and development.

Smart citizens and 'open' government - promoting citizen participation in decision-making and developing smart government solutions that support the overall objectives of the Climate City Contract and facilitate better community engagement in climate change efforts.

As regards to the projects included into Action Plan it is important to mention the following:

Grant contracts have been already signed for: electric buses for metropolitan area, charging stations for electric vehicles and buses, smart mobility, rehabilitation and energy efficiency for 6 public buildings, rehabilitation and energy efficiency for 11 residential buildings, waste management and recycling facilities, rehabilitation of central heating distribution and transport network – all these projects are in the implementation phase at the moment
Several other projects concerning green areas, smart mobility, photovoltaic parks, municipal and residential buildings are either prepared for submission or already submitted to financing authorities in 2024
Projects for increasing energy efficiency in residential and public buildings, green areas, photovoltaic parks are in the design phase and will be submitted to financing authorities in 2024

# 2 Work Process Introduction

This section should list the working steps carried out, for example along the NZC Climate Transition Map, or related steps planned as well as outline timeline and milestones for future iterations for the continuous development of the Action Plan.

# Work Process - combination of text and visual elements

General consideration: The Action Plan's preparation was based on adapting EU trends, strategic directions and policies to the specific local context, the whole process being a co-participatory one: although the Municipality coordinated the implementation of the Action Plan, the document was developed by constantly consulting the local stakeholders, because they are the NZC Coalition's pillars and they have been constantly part of the design, innovation and implementation processes for Municipality's projects/initiatives (detailed at page 76 - 77).

Design phase for Action Plan: During the design phase for Action Plan leading staff and public servant from Suceava Municipality had several technical meetings with experts that are part of the project team in order to establish and define the future common actions to be implemented by Suceava Municipality on the road to climate neutrality. Following discussions between the project team from Suceava City Hall and the consultants, a clear schedule for the working groups was established. These meetings were held over two days and each meeting lasted approximately one hour and thirty minutes.

Each working group was based on the themes agreed between the contracting authority and the consultants, and the order of the working groups was set so that each day touched on all the pillars being considered to bring the Municipality of Suceava closer to fulfilling its mission.

The working groups have been named according to the theme as follows: Energy efficiency in public and residential buildings; Alternative energy; Public lighting; Public transport and traffic; Waste management; Water management; Public spaces; Cultural/social/financial/institutional systems.

Public consultation: The online questionnaire is a practical and effective method of obtaining feedback from a large number of respondents in a structured way that can be easily interpreted in analysis. The present questionnaire was completed by 534 inhabitants of Suceava City and aimed to understand the existing situation in the field of climate impact as seen by citizens. The instrument applied determines an overview of the perception and behaviour of citizens regarding climate impact, which contributes to the decision maker regarding future actions to protect the environment.

The questionnaire was published exclusively online and promoted via social media every 2 weeks from January to February 2023. The target group of this consultation phase is the entire population of the Municipality of Suceava, the aim being to identify the needs, the level of concern of the population about climate change and the level of awareness about its causes and consequences (Survey results – Annex 2).

The results from the public survey were presented during each workshops, were discussed with the stakeholders and consist the baseline for identification and design of the projects proposed to be included in the Action Plan. Basically the projects/actions were defined in accordance with citizens needs/comments/suggestions and the actions are directly linked with the problems identified directly by citizens.

More than this, according to Romanian legislation, as the Action Plan (that includes the extended list of projects from the most relevant ones related to climate neutrality were described into details both in Action and Investment Plan) is included into strategic document category, the document was posted on municipality website 30 days before the local council approval, following the public consultation procedure. More public surveys are planned to be done in implementation phase for most relevant and with major impact actions (like the ones concerning energy efficiency in public and residential buildings, smart &amp; sustainable mobility, electric public transport for metropolitan area) and more important during evaluation phase of the projects. This is meant to continue the process of local stakeholders (citizens also) involvement in the mission process having as a direct result the feedback regarding the results, the achievements and also regarding the suggestion for improvements/upgrade of the proposed actions.

The initial meetings were held at the Suceava City Hall, where the relevant local actors were previously invited by official addresses to outline the vision that the Municipality of Suceava must address in order to achieve the objectives assumed in the Mission.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Following initial discussions with the working groups (areas: Energy efficiency in public and residential buildings; Alternative energy; Public lighting; Public transport and traffic; Waste management; Water management; Public spaces; Cultural/social/financial/institutional systems), the first draft of the Climate City Contract was developed.

The process of developing and monitoring of climate neutrality projects (included into the Action Plan) can be divided into several steps:

Identify the current situation: The first step is to identify the current situation of the city's carbon footprint and energy consumption. This may involve analysing existing data or conducting research studies. This step can provide an overview of the city's environmental impact and help identify areas for improvement/intervention.
Setting targets: Once the current situation is known, the next step is to set targets for reducing carbon emissions. These targets should be ambitious but realistic and aligned with global or national climate change commitments.
Determine the key actions that need to be taken: Once targets are set, it is important to determine the key actions that need to be taken to achieve the targets. These actions can be soft (e.g. awareness and education campaigns), medium (e.g. energy efficiency projects) or hard (e.g. investment in renewable energy or electric transport projects). This stage should include an analysis of the costs and benefits of each action and an assessment of the impact on the objectives set.
Prioritize projects: Once key actions are identified, it is important to prioritize them according to their impact, feasibility and cost. This can help to identify the actions with the greatest potential to contribute to the achievement of the objectives without exceeding the allocated budget.
Measuring and monitoring progress: Once projects are implemented, it is important to monitor and measure progress. This can be done through relevant performance indicators such as carbon emissions or energy consumption. It is also important to monitor the budget and time allocated to each project.
How to involve stakeholders: During the process of developing and monitoring a portfolio of climate neutrality projects, it is important to involve stakeholders such as the local community, the private sector, local government and non-governmental organizations. This helps to create a framework for collaboration and to increase the involvement of all stakeholders in making decisions that lead to the achievement of the agreed objectives.

Apart of these actions described above local stakeholders (especially citizens) have been approach and included into the design phase of projects concerning for example residential buildings rehabilitation, green areas that are included in the Action Plan. Designated work groups have been established (with representatives from civil society, public institutions, university, architects, local experts), public surveys and public consultation (including meetings with residents from the buildings that are subject of future interventions) with a specific objective of increase the acceptance of citizens in the actions that the city is taking for its pathway to climate neutrality. These working groups (based on Mayor's decisions) will also work together with the municipality's transition team in the implementation and evaluation phases of each specific project.

Cooperation at national level: In order to support the efforts of Suceava Municipality and the other two municipalities that are part of the mission in Romania a large consortium was created as part of the implementation of the project „NetZeRoCities – National Centre for Competence and solutions for developing climatic neutral smart cities" that started in 2023. The consortium coordinating NetZeRo Cities is composed of Technical University of Bucharest, National Institute for Research and Development in Computer Science ICI Bucharest, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Technical University of Construction Bucharest, "Stefan cel Mare" University of Suceava, Holisun SRL, Beia Cercetare SRL, Datacor SRL, Intelligent Convergent Solutions SRL, SC Building Technology Group R SRL, Orange Romania SA and Robert Bosch SRL.

The Centre of Competence is a secure and efficient structure capable of providing a sustainable, predictable and streamlined environment for the development of research, development and innovation activities with a focus on contributing to climate change and the digital transition. The Centre is conceived as an innovation hub, representing an indicator of excellence in research, development and innovation and acting as a support for cities in successfully accessing funding opportunities under the EU Climate Change Mission and in achieving the EU Climate Change Mission's objectives and key indicators.

The aim is to support access to funding, increase the innovation capacity of the RDI system to create synergies between research and business, and create the critical mass of interdisciplinary skills needed to address the societal challenges associated with the EU Climate Change Mission. The Centre of Competence is a networking
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

tool of excellence to increase the chances of success in the EU Climate Change Mission and the Carbon Neutrality objective.

The main purpose of participating in this project is to benefit from the knowhow of the team members, to transfer the best practice example (already implemented by some of the project members), to identify, adapt and implement pilot projects in Suceava, replicate de existing ones from other Romanian cities. Suceava city would like to benefit from academic and technic knowledge of the project team members and more than this the issue of transferring the best practical solution for increasing the citizen’s/stakeholders involvement into the implementation of Action Plan will be approach.

As referring to the local private sector it is highly important to iterate that we have already started the cooperation in the preparation phase for specific projects from different sector (for example for the electric busses with local public transport operator, for rehabilitation of heating transport and distribution network with local private operator) and for sure we will continue working together in implementation and evaluation phase.

Innovative actions for local governance for AP implementation phase: Suceava Municipality has a special designated transition team that is responsible for managing the entire process of Climate City Contract implementation, monitoring, evaluation and review. The team is composed of experts from different complementary departments within Suceava City Hall: Financial Department, Investment Department, European Projects Department, Legal Department, Urban Strategies Service, Public Procurement Service, Green Areas Directorate, Energy and local utilities Office, Owner Association and Residential Buildings Service, IT Department, Waste Management Department (Urban Energy Manager is it expected to join the team from 2024). The team is open for new members that will be able to join anytime in the next 7 years and it is coordinated by is under the coordination of the European Projects, Investment, Strategy and Local Development Department.

However, since the transition towards climate neutrality is not an individual responsibility, but rather a collective effort, Suceava Municipality, related to the experience in ongoing projects implementation, will launched an invitation to the entire local ecosystem to engage all the key local actors, stakeholders, private and public sector as a local Net Zero City Coalition, with the scope of serving the local climate-neutrality pursuits, it is expected to be created in the first half of 2024. The first step was the agreement signed in 2023 between Suceava Municipality and Suceava “Stefan cel Mare” University from which at least one application for European funding was sent already (pilot project for implementation of LI FI principle).

The local Net Zero City Coalition’s work will focus on using already-existing local strategic documents (e.g., SUMP, SECAP, IUDS), out of the willingness to ensure the continuity and sustainability of priorities that were established through previously-approved framework papers but especially on the Action Plan implementation, monitoring, reiteration and evaluation in direct correlation with the Mission’s requirements and local objectives &amp; commitments. Maximizing the resulting effects and the impact of actions will be achieved through efficient communication, local commitment of the all involved stakeholders, common actions seen as a complementary component to the implementation and monitoring processes.

Within its efforts to engage stakeholders and citizens to local actions related to climate neutrality another initiative (linked with city hall website) was launched in the second half of 2023, called Canter for Innovation and Civic Imagination with the main objective as increasing the degree of citizen involvement in the process of adopting and applying decisions of public interest, but also increasing citizens’ trust in local administration. Thus, the framework is created for defining the active role of the citizen, respectively the transmission of ideas, proposals and suggestions in the development and implementation of public projects especially the ones included in the Action Plan.

The internal Municipality’s transition team includes public servants with experience in management, finance, technical, evaluation, publicity and dissemination. There are regular meetings with all involved persons: once per week in the presence of leading staff, at least twice per month with representatives from construction companies and private operators (if necessarily) and also anytime when it is required for the smooth implementation of the projects. Apart of this for the final evaluation for each project, a service contract is required with an external expert that has to evaluate and certify the project impact.

Additional to these aspects in order to ensure a good control in the implementation, specialized structure composed of people with experience in energy efficiency, key people from various departments of the local authority, interested local actors, to ensure the monitoring and reporting of activities assumed by the plan are organized. For the activities related to estimation of emission reduction and measurement, the impact of

investments we usually use to contract external experts, perform public surveys and organize workshops with local stakeholders.

The ongoing projects that are already into the implementation phase (with a total amount of 130.000.000 Euro) - are related to energy efficiency in public and residential buildings, green (100 % electric) public transport, sustainable mobility, photovoltaic park, rehabilitation of green areas, digitalization of public administration's services. This as to demonstrate that the municipality has already started the actions that have as direct objective climate neutrality at local level and reduction of GHG emissions.

All these ambitions mentioned above are expected to generate real, significant, measurable changes/improvement of the life quality in Suceava city and radically reduce GHG emissions. On the roadmap for transformation of these priorities from strategy to reality, all the local stakeholders will be involved actively and responsible for achieving the climate neutrality efforts. Thus, depending on their individual expertise, all the signatory stakeholders will contribute to fulfilling the strategic interventions mentioned above. They will provide expertise to the municipality and will be co-involved in various local projects (together with specific stakeholders and Municipality) that will lead to achieving the assumed climate neutrality.

Together with the Investment Plan, the Action Plan resulted in an integrated proposal that will help Suceava City to reach the local climate-neutrality goal and its related targets.

A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

## Sources of information for baseline inventory:

### 1. Suceava Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (for Suceava urban functional area)

This strategic document provides information regarding mobility measures, general description of actions/initiatives (associated with estimation of CO2 emission reduction) but the information was of course connected mainly with transport sector. Other useful information was collected from different local public institutions, from National Institute of Statistics reports, public CCTV network periodic reports and from traffic studies performed into the city.

### 2. Suceava Integrated Urban Development Strategy (for Suceava urban functional area)

This strategic document provides information regarding local context, vision and list of proposed actions/initiatives/projects (associated with estimation of CO2 emission reduction) and the information were of course connected mainly with all sectors (building, energy, waste, transport)

### 3. Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan – Suceava city

This strategic document was used as a source of information and for the calculation methods. Even the baseline for the SECAP is 2019 during design phase for the Action Plan, updated information (energy consumption, modal split, fuel consumption) were collected from public institutions, private sector, energy production and distribution sector, energy and natural gas providers in order to upgrade the calculation for year 2021. Even the information was not included into a new version of SECAP the same methodology was used for calculation of energy used in different sectors and GHG emissions in all sectors.

For this reason, the SECAP was the main strategic document during the process of design the Action Plan. SECAP 2021- 2030 for Suceava city provides detailed information regarding energy demand calculation for different sectors (except industry and agriculture), takes into account estimations from the other strategic documents, provides detailed information on CO2 emissions calculation and what used methodology for different sectors in the city (except agriculture) and more important includes energy and CO2 estimations for 2030.

An important source of information was the existing technical documentation related to current (implementation phase) of future investment projects that are linked with energy efficiency and CO2 reduction like: rehabilitation and energy efficiency in public and residential buildings, electric metropolitan transport, photovoltaic parks, green areas, energy efficiency in schools, high schools, waste and water management. Same situation regarding sources of information is linked with the existing final technical reports for municipality's project that have already been implemented as:

Rehabilitation and energy efficiency of public lighting
Increase the energy efficiency for municipal and residential buildings
Municipal electric vehicles (including pilot project for renewable energy production using photovoltaic panels) and charging stations
Municipal 100 % electric public transport
Smart and sustainable urban mobility projects

The technical documentations include energy audits and estimation for energy and emission reduction connected to different case studies and linked with constructed surface and for this reason we were able to have both baseline information and estimated values for energy consumption and CO2 emissions for the period of 2024 – 2030.

Information for other GHG, a part of CO2, were not available both on local and national level and for this reason future actions need to be undertaken by Suceava Municipality in partnership with Environmental Protection Agency and Suceava University in order to secure funding for pilot projects that will be able to provide database information, measurements and other details about GHG in general.

Even information/data related to all sectors included in the Action plan template were not available in local strategic documents (like SECAP) calculation have been made by using information available on the annual reports from the National Institute of Statistics and other technical and financial reports/paper works (for example there were no information in SECAP regarding AFOLU sector). In regards with all pollutants included in the section A1.2 there were consolation with experts from Environmental Protection Agency and searching for information in the periodic reports from local agency and national level (ministry). In the end, there were information only for CO2 and in the next period, Suceava Municipality and local stakeholders should address specific actions/measures/activities in order to create the infrastructure and local procedures for data collection related to other important GHG. In order to create formal conditions for more accurate and regular collection of data related

to energy consumption and GHG emissions. Suceava Municipality rely on the results coming from the implementation of the project „NetZeRoCities – National Centre for Competence and solutions for developing climatic neutral smart cities” that started in 2023. The Centre of Competence is a secure and efficient structure capable of providing a sustainable, predictable and streamlined environment for the development of research, development and innovation activities with a focus on contributing to climate change and the digital transition. The Centre is conceived as an innovation hub, representing an indicator of excellence in research, development and innovation and acting as a support for cities in successfully accessing funding opportunities under the EU Climate Change Mission and in achieving the EU Climate Change Mission's objectives and key indicators. Related future actions one of the most important activity in the next 10 years will be the monitoring of the proposed actions implementation and more important the evaluation of the impact and indicator’s achievement after project implementation period.

## 2021 – BASELINE YEAR

The information and calculation made for the CO2 emissions related to the amount of energy consumption for each sector were done by using IPCC 2006 methodology and estimated values were done where that information were not available.

The baseline information for 2021 are:

CO2 emissions for 2021: 289.055 t CO2/year

Energy consumption for 2021: 958.112 MWh/year

## Buildings - estimation made by using 2021 as a baseline year

Information related to the energy requirements of public buildings, residential buildings and tertiary buildings were not available in the SECAP (for the year 2021), but during design phase for the Action Plan, updated information (energy consumption, modal split, fuel consumption) the information were collected from public institutions, private sector, energy production and distribution sector, energy and natural gas providers in order to upgrade the calculation for year 2021. Even the information was not included into a new version of SECAP the same methodology was used for calculation of energy used in different sectors and GHG emissions in all sectors. CO2 emissions in tons/year were calculated by using the conversion factor and each type of energy in MWh/year. Regarding the calculation of the amount of electric energy consumption for building sector data were use from the local energy providers, the natural gas volume is linked with heating (but information was also available from the gas provider at local level), the amount connected to biomass comes from the private company that is operating the central heating power plant and wood is connected to house heating (main individual ones not collective apartments buildings).

486.063 MWh/year – total
Biomass: 113.116 MWh/year
Natural gas: 300.966 MWh/year
Wood: 24.134 MWh/year
Electric energy: 47.847 MWh/year

149.647 tons CO2 emissions (51,77 % from total CO2 emissions)

## Transport sector - estimation made by using 2021 as a baseline year

The information linked with energy consumption for transport sector and amount of CO2 emissions were collected from the municipality annual reports (regarding charging station), reports from the local transport company (regarding consumption and emissions related to electric busses), traffic studies, traffic police reports, statistic reports and other strategic documents (SUMP) in connection with private transport sector and local modal split and calculation have been made with same methods used in SECAP.

326.821 MWh/year – total
LPG: 16.296 MWh/year
Diesel: 150.103 MWh/year
Gasoline: 158.259 MWh/year
Electric energy: 2.163 MWh/year

84.764 tons CO2 emissions (29,32 % from total CO2 emissions)

Waste sector - estimated at 5% from total CO2 emissions

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

The information for energy consumption and emissions coming from waste sector were, partially available from the municipal waste operator and form annual statistic reports. Beside this when calculation has been done for Action Plan we chose to estimate that these are 5% from the total city's emissions. This amount was established by taking into account available scientific documents (as Science Direct.com). Also the assumption was that the 5% percentage will be set also for 2030.

53.198 MWh/year – total
Diesel: 51.546 MWh/year
Electric energy: 1.652 MWh/year

14.291 tons CO2 emissions (5,16 % from total CO2 emissions)
Industrial Process and Product Use - estimated at 13,3% of total CO2 emissions

The percentage was determined after the consultation of local strategic documents and information available from the National Institute so Statistics and in the same way the percent for electric energy was established at 70% and for natural gas at 30%.

As related to the economic sector Suceava has the following distribution:

|  Activity sector | Share(%)  |
| --- | --- |
|  Agriculture, forestry and related services | 1.42  |
|  Commerce | 38.10  |
|  Construction | 7.78  |
|  Heavy industry (metallurgical industry, chemical industry, metal construction industry, etc.) | 0.34  |
|  Light industry (food, textile, furniture and woodworking, etc.) | 0.19  |
|  Education, health and social work | 3.52  |
|  Production and supply of electricity and heat, gas and water, water capture, treatment and distribution | 2.75  |
|  Recovery and disposal of waste and sewage | 5.37  |
|  Services | 38.90  |
|  Tourism services | 1.64  |

88.401 MWh/year – total
Natural gas: 46.970 MWh/year
Electrical energy: 41.431 MWh/year

38.531 t CO2 emissions/year (13,3 % from total CO2 emissions)
Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use - estimated at 0,4 % of total CO2 emissions

For this sector we consider that the energy consumption and CO2 emissions can be estimated at 0,4% from the total city's emissions, according to available data coming mainly from the National Institute of Statistics but also from other technical and financial reports/paper works. This percent is divided as: 70% for Diesel and 30% for energy. The Agriculture sector is less present in the city of Suceava and in this case maintenance costs for public park and green areas were taken into consideration.

3.639 MWh/year – total
Diesel: 3.131 MWh/year
Electric energy: 508 MWh/year

1.192 t CO2 emissions (0,41 % from total CO2 emissions)
– SUCEAVA” GREEN” CITY

Suceava is to become a green city in 2030 with full electric public transport (including metropolitan area), sustainable and efficient public transport (separate lanes for PT, priority in intersection, incentives for PT passengers), alternative mobility (with facilities for electric vehicles), entire municipal (public buildings, electric public transport, public lighting, educational units) electric energy consumption provided from renewable sources (solar), recycling facilities for municipal waste, circular economy, energy efficiency in all municipal buildings and at least 50% of residential ones, green areas and SMART innovative technologies for a better quality of life into the city.

# A-2.2: Description &amp; assessment of policies

General consideration: Suceava Municipality has the strategic documents recently updated (IUDS, SUMP, SECAP, Clean Transport Plan, City Heating Strategy). The General Urban Plan was also updated in 2023.

All these current policies are sufficient to support Suceava Municipality meeting its targets for climate neutrality.

These strategic documents include activities, policies, actions and projects that are focus on climate change challenges, improve the quality of life, sustainable mobility, increase of energy efficiency, reduction of energy consumption and GHG emissions, alternative ways of travelling, production of energy from renewable sources.

All current policies and local strategies are referring to specific chapters/domains/field of actions/project ideas included in the Action Plan, with specific actions, ideas, outcomes, investments. One of the most important aspect is that these local strategic documents and policies were designed in cooperation with relevant local stakeholders, were approved by the local decision makers and are the local background that allows the municipality to secure funding for projects implementation and more relevant are the framework (with specific technic, economic, social and environmental information) for the local sustainable development and the roadmap to climate neutrality. These strategic documents include activities, policies, actions and projects that are focused on climate change challenges, improve the quality of life, sustainable mobility, increase of energy efficiency, reduction of energy consumption and GHG emissions, alternative ways of travelling, production of energy from renewable sources. But more important, these strategic documents include also specific references to available and suitable funding opportunities for each action/project mentioned in the documents.

# 2.Strategies and Policies:

## Romania Urban Policy – National Policy

The Romanian Urban Policy was adopted in 2021 and includes four major objectives (green &amp; resilient, just &amp; inclusive, competitive &amp; productive &amp; well-governed cities).

The second priority of the strategic document is "Creating liveable and climate-smart cities, by developing green-blue infrastructure to mitigate and adapt to urban risks". The policy includes measures linked to reducing of air pollution and sustainable urban mobility.

All interventions planned are aligned with the objectives and priorities of the Urban Policy, particularly focusing on the development of Suceava Urban Functional Area.

## The National Integrated Plan for Energy and Climate Change 2021 – 2030 (NIPECC) – National Plan

The National Plan for Energy and Climate Change was adopted in 2019 and was elaborated in accordance with the EU energy policy framework, detailing the main objectives.

According to the Plan, Romania aims to increase its share of energy from renewable sources in the total energy consumption by 2030 by increasing the installed capacity of wind and photovoltaic plants. Suceava is one of the three urban authorities, which have joined the 100 Cities Mission, and it is aligned with the objectives of the NIPECC in terms of reducing GHG emissions.

## North - East Regional Development Plan 2021 – 2027 – Regional Plan

This strategic documents will be the guideline for ERDF funding related to projects proposed in the Investment Plan. The Plan is identifying the main challenges, including the following: the regional and urban-rural disparities are significant, the energy efficiency of buildings is low (with a particular focus on urban areas), urban

areas require measures to extend green infrastructure, develop sustainable urban mobility,

Strategic Priority 3: A region with environmentally friendly approach – energy efficiency in public and private buildings, green infrastructure, production of energy from renewable sources

Strategic Priority 4: A region with sustainable multimodal urban mobility- transition to a zero emissions transport

Strategic Priority 5: An accessible region

The projects included in the Action and Investment Plan are according with the priorities mentioned in the North-East strategic document.

## Green Transport for a Green City – Local Policy

The “green transport” policy was promoted at local level. Since early 2022 public transport is 100 % electric and the Municipality is currently implementing projects in order to extend the “green public transport” concept to metropolitan/functional area. Suceava was the first city with electric busses for public transport and now is the only Romanian city with 100 % electric public transport.

The Municipality also implements the Green Fridays project, which offers citizens access to free public transport each first Friday of the month.

Also Suceava was the first city with a municipal electric fleet, with more than 44 charging station for electric vehicles, 10 electric municipal bikes, incentives (as free charging and free parking for residents using an electric vehicle). The Green Transport Policy will be continued as a major contributor to the net zero objective. Further approaches to encourage the use of public transport, extend the electric public transport to entire metropolitan area, incentives for purchase and use of electric vehicles, 50 new charging stations for electric vehicles including urban planning regulations that encourage the development of private charging stations.

## Suceava - Green City – Local Policy

The Green City Policy aims are the rehabilitation of 140 ha of green public areas, planting 5.000 new trees and creating green corridors along the main streets and boulevards in the city.

Implementing the Green City Policy is directly linked with the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission Action Plan, through the creation of carbon sinks, as well as an extended air, soil and water quality monitoring system. The Green City Policy will be expanded in order to include measures related to green roofs and facades.

## Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan 2021-2030 (SECAP) – Local Action Plan

The SECAP is a strategic document targeting the reduction of GHG emissions, elaborated according to the methodology of the Covenant of Mayors on Climate and Energy. The SECAP identifies stationary energy and transport as the main sectors responsible for GHG emissions.

Most significantly, the plan highlights that buildings account for approx. 52 % of total emissions (particularly residential), while transport is responsible for approx. 30%. Therefore, the action plan addresses stationary energy with priority. Considering the high emissions from residential buildings, measures to accelerate interventions for energy efficiency are required.

## Integrated Urban Development Strategy for Suceava Urban Functional Area 2021 – 2030 – Local Strategy

The strategic document covers the level of the Urban Functional Area (two cities and 8 villages from the metropolitan area) and includes initiatives related to transition to climate neutrality:

Specific Objective no. 3 - Carbon neutral, green and resilient city aims to ensure an environmentally friendly development of the Municipality and its urban functional area so that GHG missions are reduced by 50% by 2030, through the following priorities:

Priority 3.1: Increasing energy performance at the level of collective housing complexes;

Priority 3.2: Increasing energy performance in public buildings and public lighting systems;

Priority 3.3: Investments in the central heating system and renewable energy supply infrastructure

The strategic document offers the strategic guidelines for becoming a climate neutral at the urban functional area level.

## Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan for Suceava Urban Functional Area – Local Strategy

The document was developed for Suceava Urban Functional Area and it is focuses on reducing carbon emissions, promoting green/alternative means of transport, sustainable mobility and increasing quality of life.

The SUMP includes interventions on the road infrastructure, public transport, freight transport, alternative mobility, traffic management, alternative ways of traveling, promotion of cycling and walking.

The main project is the one concerning metropolitan system of public transport (operated with 100 % electric busses), project that is currently into the implementation of first phase. This will create facilities for increasing

the number of PT passengers in the urban functional area and reduce GHG emissions.

As the transport sector is the second source of CO2 emissions in Suceava, the Suceava team will focusses on implementation of the actions included in SUMP as for the first time the strategic document is covering the urban functional area (two cities and 7 villages).

# City Heating Strategy Suceava 2020-2030 – Local Strategy

The main objective of Strategy is to identify technical and financing solutions for increasing the energy efficiency of the central heating system, in order to encourage using the centralized heating system (as Suceava is the only city in Romania having a city heating plans using only biomass).

The main intervention is to be done in rehabilitation and increase energy efficiency of the transport and distribution network (more than 255 km), modernize and digitalize of thermal points.

# 3. Action Plan

The goals included in the Climate City Contract are covering (in an integrated vision and overall approach) the entire goals and ideas included in the already local approved strategic documents (local development strategy, sustainable urban mobility plan, sustainable energy action plan) as the Action Plan is acting like an "umbrella strategic document", for the entire city territory with a strategic, sustainable approach aimed at achieving objectives that determine the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions mainly (and as a tangible result from implementation of the actions) but more important with a direct effect on local economic development, improving the quality of life, creating strategic partnerships between local stakeholders and local administration and direct benefits for each single citizen (with connections to public transport, smart mobility, energy efficiency, heating, alternative energy and waste recycling), for public administration in relationship with common initiatives with academic and private sector for research, innovation and sustainable projects/actions and for any other local stakeholder included in the local Net Zero Coalition.

But the Action Plan includes specific and integrated actions/projects and targets related to GHG emission reduction, with detailed technical documentation, financial information, implementation costs, milestones, indicators, results, stakeholders involved in implementation phase, actions that are additional that the ones already identified in existing strategic documents and that have been proposed as a result of the CCC process and are entirely responsible for the emission reduction targets assumed by Suceava Municipality in its pathway to achieve climate neutrality.

Some of the main objectives for this common effort in AP implementation are: ensure the citizen's right of access to any public information, improve communication between local public administration institutions of Suceava municipality;
But in the same time the civil society is consider to be one of the most important stakeholder and there was consultation not only while performing the plan but for almost each major investment and action implemented at local level.
In the end the involvement of the citizens is consider to be highly important in the social innovation, civic co-design processes that are requested for Suceava's transition to climate-neutrality. | The main interests of citizens are related to the quality and cost of life into the city, healthy way of living, civic responsibility and involvement, environment protection, green spaces, climate changes’ impact.
Works need to be done for changing behaviour to a climate neutral one, for actively involvement in local initiatives like: environmentally ways of traveling, separate waste collection, recycling, reduce the energy consumption, for replication of municipal projects (energy efficiency in buildings, green roofs and facades) and in general for involvement of citizens in the administration process of the city, by participating, for consultative purposes, in the process of elaboration of public policies for urban development and in the decisions adopted by the local public administration of Suceava City.  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

The list of local stakeholders included into the stakeholder’s map is linked directly with system barriers and opportunities as each of them has specific skills, levers and expertise that can directly contribute to a successful implementation of the proposed actions from the Action Plan.

Almost all the stakeholders are connected with specific domains/field of intervention (example: energy efficiency, sustainable urban mobility, central heating, public and residential buildings, research and development) and their abilities and experience are meant to add value, support and directly influence the roadmap to climate neutrality for Suceava City.

The most relevant aspect is that the cooperation between local public administration and relevant stakeholders (most of them nominated in the stakeholders map) for the next 7 years it is a continuous process as previous initiatives/projects/actions have been already developed /implemented in the past 15 years (as a specific example we will nominate the common initiative between municipality and local public transport operator that begun in 2020 with implementation of sustainable 100% electric public transport that has been expended (starting from 2024) with new facilities – electric buses, green wave and separate lanes for public transport, public transport monitoring and information centre).

## A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers and opportunities – textual elements

Suceava Municipality has the strategic documents recently updated (IUDS, SUMP, SECAP, Clean Transport Plan, City Heating Strategy). As regarding the city planning and development documents The General Urban Plan was also updated in 2023. These strategic documents include activities, policies, actions and projects that are focus on climate change challenges, improve the quality of life, sustainable mobility, increase of energy efficiency, reduction of energy consumption and GHG emissions, alternative ways of travelling, production of energy from renewable sources.

Suceava city has taken significant steps towards climate neutrality, which is already an assumed goal in the local strategic documents.

Previous achievements: In the past 15 years there were many investment projects in the field of energy

efficiency (public and private buildings), alternative heating production (biomass), rehabilitation of public lighting (LED systems), education buildings, public transport (100 % electric fleet), alternative vehicles (electric municipal fleet, charging stations for EV's – with incentives for charging also for private owners), traffic management, cycling lanes, electric bicycles and scooters, rehabilitation of central heating system, separate waste collection and recycling system, rehabilitation of the water and sewage system, green areas, rehabilitation of pedestrian (low emission zone) and road infrastructure, city ring.

Challenges at local level: Suceava recognizes the urgent need to address the global climate crisis and minimize its impact on communities, the economy and the environment. It is recognized that the local community is currently contributing to this crisis through greenhouse gas emissions from transport, buildings, waste and other sources. The municipality's commitment to its responsibility to mitigate climate change is to achieve climate neutrality in terms of climate impact by 2030, and to meet this goal requires a reduction in local greenhouse gas emissions.

This is to be achieved through the following actions:

Reduction of greenhouse emissions - emissions levels in Suceava will be reduced through various methods such as: increasing energy efficiency and use of renewable energy, promoting sustainable transport options, increasing the area of green spaces in the city, increasing the use of alternative transport;
Offsetting carbon emissions - the remaining greenhouse gas emissions will be offset by investing in projects such as: renewable energy installations, reforestation;
Encouraging public involvement and community action - so the community will actively participate and take collective responsibility in reducing the locality's greenhouse gas emissions;
Annual progress reports - this will track and report annually on progress at the local level in order to have control over achieving the climate neutrality target;
Conduct community awareness and education campaigns to understand that achieving climate neutrality will require sustained effort and significant investment.

On our road to reduce GHG emissions, we have encountered a number of barriers and milestones. From all these Suceava City has been able to find solutions for more than 80 %, but we do expect to face same similar ones in the next 7 years while the implementation phase of the projects mentioned in the Action Plan will started.

Even Suceava city has experience in the field of climate neutrality the task to decrease emissions becomes more difficult and complex and for this reason more systemic approach has to be taken to tackle the barriers.

Identified barriers: Summarising the barriers that Action Plan aims to approach:

Infrastructure – the main part of residential and public buildings was built before 1990 and for this single reason all these buildings are far than “environmentally friendly”, with very few of none energy efficiency investments, with a high level of energy consumption as more than 50 % are using natural gas for individual heating plant. Even technical solution is available since early 2000 there very few investments in building rehabilitation and energy efficiency have been made in the past years so addressing the housing and building sector is one of the main goal for the Action Plan.

National regulation and legislation – the construction permits and authorization for installation of solar and photovoltaic panels and for the connection to the national grid (in case of solar energy) are still difficult to obtain, the amount of requested official documents is quite high, there are a significant number of public institutions involved in the process, the amount of paper work and level of technical documentation is (probably) higher than any other European Union country. The level of bureaucracy is still high and even for municipalities the road from idea to implementation phase is still high and we have to mentioned at least 12 months for the entire process. All these need to be addressed in details by municipality and the other actors involved in implementation of the Action Plan.

Funds – The costs for implementation of the Action Plan initiatives and funding the intervention for climate neutrality barriers associated with the climate-neutrality are very high in comparison with the local budget of Suceava city. The local budget can cover only a small part of these costs so the Municipality still has to focus on external sources from which the most important are non-reimbursable funds in the NRRP and RP. Suceava city has experience in securing external sources but one of the main barrier is related to development of Public Private Partnership projects at local level and also as private sector is sometime difficult to approach (but still has a significant impact on city pollution and a high level of GHG emissions) one of the main challenges for Suceava Municipality will be to find the most appropriate way of motivating private investors to implement climate

neutrality projects in their business from industry, commerce and services sectors.

**Communication and working with citizens and stakeholders** - there are still gaps and less functional structures and methods connected with communication, transparency of public administration activity and initiatives, public consultation and common initiatives between public sector, private one and citizens. Work need to be done for reducing the gap between the public administration and citizens, urban and metropolitan environment, for increasing the level of acceptance, understanding, cooperation and communication between all stakeholders involved.

**Behaviour change** – there is always a major barrier when behaviour need to be changed like using less the own vehicle and switch to alternative ways of travelling (public transport, bikes, electric vehicles) or act and live responsibly in order to reduce the level of GHG emissions, increase energy efficiency and reduce the quantity of waste, increase the recycling percentage. The change is influenced in this specific case also by the living costs and the own contribution costs for investments (in case of residential buildings rehabilitation projects for example). Specific methods and actions need to be addressed as without a significand change in citizen’s behaviour the success of climate neutrality projects could be seriously affected.

The goals included in the Climate City Contract are covering (in an integrated vision and overall approach) the entire ideas included in the already local approved strategic documents (local development strategy, sustainable urban mobility plan, sustainable energy action plan) as the Action Plan is acting like an “umbrella strategic document” for the entire city territory with a strategic, sustainable approach aimed at achieving objectives that determine the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions mainly (and as a tangible result from implementation of the actions) but more important with a direct effect on local economic development, improving the quality of life, creating strategic partnerships between local stakeholders and local administration and direct benefits for each single citizen (with connections to public transport, smart mobility, energy efficiency, heating, alternative energy and waste recycling), for public administration in relationship with common initiatives with academic and private sector for research, innovation and sustainable projects/actions and for any other local stakeholder included in the local Net Zero Coalition.

However, since the transition towards climate neutrality is not an individual responsibility, but rather a collective effort, Suceava Municipality, related to the experience in ongoing projects implementation, will launched an invitation to the entire local ecosystem to engage all the key local actors, stakeholders, private and public sector as a local Net Zero City Coalition, with the scope of serving the local climate-neutrality pursuits, it is expected to be created in the first half of 2024. The first step was the agreement signed in 2023 between Suceava Municipality and Suceava “Stefan cel Mare” University from which at least one application for European funding was sent already (pilot project for implementation of LI FI principle).

**4. Key findings**: Taking into account the key findings listed above, the main factors that can contribute to achieving climate neutrality in Suceava are:

Adopt ambitious climate policies and plans: The municipality should develop ambitious climate policies and plans that include concrete measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote renewable energy and encourage sustainable development practices.
Promoting renewable energy: Suceava should continue to encourage the use of renewable energy, including solar, wind and hydropower, through policies and projects that encourage the installation of solar panels on buildings and wind turbines in appropriate areas.
Modal shift: Changing the mode of transport by promoting clean urban mobility, such as cycling, electric public transport or other clean modes of transport, will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from road transport.
Improving energy efficiency: Improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings through measures such as thermal insulation, installation of double-glazed windows and changing heating systems will reduce energy consumption and therefore greenhouse gas emissions.
Promoting the circular economy: The circular economy should be promoted at local level through recycling and re-use of waste, reducing the amount of waste generated and implementing projects that encourage the use of recycled materials.
Community involvement: Community involvement is crucial to achieve a transition to climate neutrality. practices to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions at individual level should be encouraged, but also by involving citizens in the planning process of sustainable and innovative urban

development

More than this, according to Romanian legislation, as the Action Plan (that includes the extended list of projects from the most relevant ones related to climate neutrality were described into details both in Action and Investment Plan) is included into strategic document category, the document was posted on municipality website 30 days before the local council approval, following the public consultation procedure. More public surveys are planned to be done in implementation phase for most relevant and with major impact actions (like the ones concerning energy efficiency in public and residential buildings, smart &amp; sustainable mobility, electric public transport for metropolitan area) and more important during evaluation phase of the projects. This is meant to continue the process of local stakeholders (citizens also) involvement in the mission process having as a direct result the feedback regarding the results, the achievements and also regarding the suggestion for improvements/upgrade of the proposed actions.

Continue learning process: In regards with the lessons learned by the transition team members during the development of the Action Plan, these are connected with:

Learnings:

☐ Collaboration is crucial: The various initiatives involving universities, stakeholders, and citizens showcase the importance of collaboration in achieving complex goals like climate neutrality.

☐ Pilot projects are valuable: Testing innovative solutions through pilot projects allows for learning and improvement before wider implementation.

☐ Capacity building is essential: Equipping the administration with the necessary knowledge and skills is crucial for effective project management and decision-making.

Effectiveness:

☐ Transparency and engagement: Platforms like the Centre for Innovation and Civic Imagination (CIIC) and public consultations foster trust and encourage citizen participation, potentially leading to better solutions and stronger support.

☐ Flexibility and adaptation: The focus on adaptable financing and monitoring with evaluation allows for adjustments based on learning and changing circumstances.

Obstacles:

☐ Without information on specific challenges, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact obstacles Suceava City faces. However, common obstacles in climate neutrality efforts include securing long-term funding, overcoming public resistance to change, and ensuring effective coordination between different stakeholders.

Opportunities:

☐ Suceava's focus on collaboration and capacity building creates opportunities for knowledge sharing and learning from other cities facing similar challenges.

☐ The initiatives promoting citizen engagement need to be further strengthened to encourage active participation in decision-making and solution development. This will lead to more innovative and socially acceptable solutions.

☐ By addressing potential social and economic concerns and highlighting the co-benefits of climate action, Suceava can garner broader public support and encourage wider participation.

Beside these above mentioned aspects for the next steps in Suceava Municipality road to climate neutrality we have been able to identified some key aspects:

Evaluate Existing Initiatives:

☐ Assess the effectiveness of the key initiatives mentioned in the Action Plan, such as the development of electric vehicle infrastructure and the Urban Lab for Green Cities. This evaluation should consider factors like emission reduction achieved, cost-effectiveness, and public acceptance.

☐ Based on the evaluation, Suceava can prioritize scaling up successful initiatives and revise or discontinue initiatives with limited effectiveness (for the next stage and the revising phase of the CCC).

Align with City Vision:

☐ Consider Suceava's long-term vision for the future, as outlined in any strategic documents or public pronouncements. This vision might emphasize aspects like improved air quality, a healthy environment, or a thriving green economy.

☐ Prioritize actions that directly contribute to achieving the city's vision and ensure a just transition towards climate neutrality.

Additionally:
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

☐ Engage with stakeholders: Conduct consultations with citizens, businesses, and other relevant stakeholders to understand their priorities and concerns regarding climate action. This input can help refine Suceava's action plan and ensure it addresses the needs of the community.

☐ Monitor and adapt: Regularly monitor the progress of implemented actions and adapt them based on the results and changing circumstances.

As a conclusion in terms of barriers influencing the achievement of the 2030 emission reduction target, we mention:

Limited financial resources - implementing emission reduction measures can be costly, which can be a barrier for local authorities, the private sector and the community at large.
Behaviour and mind-set change - Suceava residents need to change their behaviour and adopt emission reduction practices, but this change can be difficult and may take time.
Lack of information and awareness - many residents and businesses may not be sufficiently informed about the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and the benefits of reducing them, which can prevent effective measures from being implemented.
Lack of adequate infrastructure - implementing measures to reduce emissions requires adequate infrastructure, such as public transport networks, separate waste collection systems or smart electricity grids.
Lack of collaboration between sectors - implementing effective emission reduction measures requires close collaboration between different sectors, such as transport, energy and the residential sector, but this can be difficult to achieve due to differences in interests and perspectives.
Insufficient or non-existent regulations - regulations and policy at national and local level can play an important role in promoting emission reductions, but in some cases, they may be insufficient or non-existent, which can hinder the implementation of effective emission reduction measures.
Climate change itself - while it is important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, climate change itself can affect Suceava's ability to implement emission reduction measures and its ability to adapt to climate change.

Involvement of local stakeholders:

As for involvement of relevant stakeholders (as detailed in several sections of the Action Plan) Suceava Municipality plan is to:

Continue using the already active (existing) institutionalised stakeholders mechanisms like budgetary participation, local partnership with owners associations, Centre for Innovation and Civic Imagination (CIIC), local thematic working groups / committees (for several domains like urban planning, green areas, energy, residential buildings), public consultation process/platform – before, during and after implementation of local strategies/actions/initiatives/investments/projects and local stakeholders support groups (initiated as part of projects financed through European programmes like URBACT,CIVITAS, INTEREEG). These groups have been created in the past 15 years and there are still active as there is a strong local partnership for different domains (sustainable urban development, green areas, electric vehicles, urban markets)
Develop new mechanisms like Net Zero Coalition, local RDI initiatives/projects like „NetZeRoCities – National Centre for Competence and solutions for developing climatic neutral smart cities“, URBAN LAB, ongoing European projects like KARMA - Circular Economy in the Construction Sector - Acting Today for a Better Future with local working stakeholders group for implementation of circular economy concepts (reduce the municipal waste and increase the percentage of waste recycling)
Extend the communication/dissemination and replication activities (related to NZC and climate neutrality) to regional and more important to national level by involvement of other relevant stakeholders for other Romanian cities that are not part of the Mission (through NZC mirror national program).

Commitment: Suceava's City story is one of resilience, community spirit and a commitment to shaping a brighter future. By embracing sustainability as a core value and leveraging the opportunities offered by the CCC, Suceava City will ensure a thriving green metropolis for generations to come.

This vision, born from a collective desire for a cleaner, healthier future, ignited a spark within the community. It

fuelled the creation of Suceava's Climate Action Plan, a roadmap towards becoming a Net Zero City. This plan, far from being a mere document, is a testament to the city's commitment, a story of collective action, innovation, and the unwavering belief in a brighter tomorrow.

Recognizing their contribution to the global climate challenge, the people of Suceava, along with their dedicated municipality, embarked on a journey of transformation. They acknowledged the reality – greenhouse gas emissions from various sources, including transportation, buildings, and waste, were contributing to the environmental crisis.

Fuelled by the success of previous initiatives, like becoming the first Romanian city with a 100% electric public transport fleet, Suceava saw the Climate City Contract and Net Zero Cities Mission as the perfect opportunity to accelerate their progress. The municipality, acting as a facilitator and coordinator, embarked on a collaborative journey, bringing together diverse stakeholders - residents, businesses, experts, and public officials - to co-create the action plan.

# A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

General consideration: Suceava City has been working in the past 10 years in order to identify the list of policies, actions, projects and interventions that need to be implemented in line with the roadmap to achieve the climate neutrality, the level of GHG reduction assumed by local strategic documents and the goals regarding proposed targets for improving the quality of life into the city.

Suceava City has established strategic partnership with universities from major Romanian cities (but with private operators also) as part of "NetZeRoCities – National Centre for Competence and solutions for developing climatic neutral smart cities" project, for whom the main objective is to work together in the field of exploring new dimensions of a smart and sustainable city as: smart and sustainable mobility, alternative "green" energy production, energy efficiency, environment protection, waste water handling, waste recycling, public health, heating and governance models.

The entire process has been done in collaboration with local stakeholders, it is a direct result of public consultations, meetings with local decision makers, representatives of owner's association, private sector, university sector and representatives from public institutions and more important each single characteristic form all city areas were taking into consideration, analysed and included into the local strategic documents.

As transition to climate neutrality is a complex and challenging process each single aspect need to be considered, each specific details for different city areas and sectors (heating, energy, transport, building, green areas) was analysed and specific solutions were identified for all sectors, was discussed with local stakeholders and experts in order to create the appropriate conditions for a smooth approach to the climate neutral goals assumed by the municipality.

Each single project/action from the Action Plan will act as indicators for what is needed within the whole city and in the same time will contribute to the general city objectives and goals.

Previous achievements: Several pilot projects have been designed, implemented and evaluated (green roofs, alternative energy sources, electric bikes, alternative public transport) with the main purpose of testing the innovative ideas/solutions that will have to be replicated at city scale level. Collaboration with citizens and local stakeholders have been done in different and specific ways and public consultations were mandatory for design of the projects that affect public and green areas, development of the local budget, design of local strategic documents like SECAP and SUMP.

One of the major project concerning system demonstrations for reduced emissions from transport is focusing on development of local infrastructure for electric vehicles charging together with introduction of public and private electric vehicles. The pilot project started in 2018 with 15 EV's for the municipal fleet and with 28 charging station for electric vehicles, followed by the second phase that consist in 14 new charging station, in 2022, that have as a direct result more than 280 private electric vehicles registered in Suceava city by the end of 2023.

Another goal for Suceava municipality (identified in the proposed projects from the Action Plan) is to reduce the largest sources of emissions from transport and increase the level of waste recycling into the city.

The most relevant actors/stakeholders directly involved both in design and implementation of the projects included in the Action Plan sign the Climate Neutrality Commitments document and together with important local stakeholders it was created the local framework for project implementation that concur to climate neutrality.

The Climate Neutrality Investment Plan for Suceava city also identifies different actors' investment needs to
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

implement the necessary actions even the main financial effort is to be done by local public authority.

Involvement of stakeholders (including citizens) local innovative model: The municipality started the implementation of actions for climate neutrality way before 2023 when the application was approved and the city was included into the list of 100 efficient and climate neutral cities and this is a prove of Suceava’s commitment to NZC programme and policy, but the process of Action Plan’s projects implementation requires developed forms of collaboration and dialogue between all stakeholders involved into planning, implementation and monitoring of proposed measures.

Suceava Municipality developed the collaboration with local stakeholders in order to improve efficiency, decision-making transparency and cross-border collaboration between public institutions, business environment, citizens and civil society. As a result, the municipality created (in 2018) the "budget participatory" platform, through which local stakeholders, citizens and members of the local community have the possibility to establish and propose a series of sustainable local development projects, in the field of energy efficiency, mobility, pollution reduction and to participate actively to define and prioritize process for local investment including financial aspects.

Local stakeholders (especially citizens) have been approach and included into the design phase of projects concerning for example residential buildings rehabilitation, green areas that are included in the Action Plan. Designated work groups have been established (with representatives from civil society, public institutions, university, architects and local experts), public surveys and public consultation (including meetings with residents from the buildings that are subject of future interventions) with a specific objective of increase the acceptance of citizens in the actions that the city is taking for its pathway to climate neutrality.

These working groups (based on local city decision) will also work together with the municipality’s transition team in the implementation and evaluation phases of each specific project.

The internal Municipality’s transition team includes public servants with experience in management, finance, technical, evaluation, publicity and dissemination.

Apart of the public consultation process from the design phase for the climate contract more public surveys/consultation are planned to be done in implementation phase for most relevant and with major impact actions (like the already organised ones concerning energy efficiency in public and residential buildings, smart &amp; sustainable mobility, electric public transport for metropolitan area) and more important during implementation and evaluation phase of the projects. This is meant to continue the process of local stakeholders (citizens also) involvement in the mission process having as a direct result the feedback regarding the results, the achievements and also regarding the suggestion for improvements/upgrade of the proposed actions.

There are regular meetings with all involved persons: once per week in the presence of leading staff, at least twice per month with representatives from construction companies and private operators (if necessarily) and also anytime when it is required for the smooth implementation of the projects. Apart of this for the final evaluation for each project a service contract is required with an external expert that has to evaluate and certify the project impact.

Additional to these aspects in order to ensure a good control in the implementation and to ensure the monitoring and reporting of activities assumed by the Action Plan, specialized structure composed of members with experience in energy efficiency, key people from various departments of the local authority, interested local actors, are organized.

For the activities related to estimation of emission reduction and measurement the impact of investments we usually use to contract external experts, perform public surveys and organize workshops with local stakeholders.

More than this in relationship with stakeholders involvement we have to mention that each year there are annual assembly for 136 owners associations (with more than 38.500 apartments) and a representative from municipality’s staff is being present to each one of these with (among others) the objective of presenting the local strategy for next year, the projects that are proposed to be implemented and to facilitate the transfer of information / needs / requirements from the citizens to local public administration. All feed backs are taking into consideration and included in the annually municipality plan for investments.

Within its efforts to engage stakeholders and citizens to local actions related to climate neutrality another initiative (linked with city hall website) was launched in the second half of 2023, called Centre for Innovation and Civic Imagination (CIIC) with the main objective as increasing the degree of citizen involvement in the process of adopting and applying decisions of public interest, but also increasing citizens' trust in local administration.

Thus, the framework is created for defining the active role of the citizen, respectively the transmission of ideas,
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

proposals and suggestions in the development and implementation of public projects especially the ones included in the Action Plan. Public debates will be held on various topics of interest, in which representatives from various fields of activity will participate, such as: education, health, social assistance, infrastructure, environmental protection, public administration, culture, local councillors of the Municipality of Suceava, employees from Suceava City Hall, representatives of civil society and the business environment of Suceava City and other interested factors.

The topics of debate for CIIC Suceava are matters of general interest - public policies of urban development, strategies, sustainable development, urban planning, environmental protection, etc. and will cover the areas of construction, social assistance, public order and peace, urban planning, sport, education, culture, budget - finance, functioning of public services of local interest. The points of view expressed at the meetings will help to shape decisions in terms of focusing on the needs of local stakeholders (citizens, business, education, NGOs). At the same time, CIIC Suceava plays an essential role in reinvigorating the civic and initiative spirit of citizens, increase transparency and long-term strategic planning with results on improving the performance of local public administration.

The Centre is a permanent laboratory in which various forms of collaboration between relevant local actors in the municipality are developed. It will also test new ideas and innovative projects, aiming to use the creative potential of the Suceava community to develop urban innovation policies.

As referring to the entities mentioned in C1.1 section we have to add that we have already started the cooperation in the preparation phase for specific projects from different sectors (for example for the electric busses with local public transport operator, for rehabilitation of heating transport and distribution network with local private operator) and for sure we will continue working for implementation and evaluation phase

In this regard, CIIC Suceava has the following objectives:

ensure the citizen's right of access to any public information;
improve communication between local public administration institutions of Suceava municipality;
involve citizens in the administration of the city, by participating, for consultative purposes, in the process of elaboration of public policies for urban development and in the decisions adopted by the local public administration of Suceava City;
bring to the attention of the local authorities of the municipality of Suceava the needs and problems of the citizens, as well as formulating suggestions for their solution;
formulate recommendations on the upgrading of public services and local infrastructure;
identify possible financial, material and human resources that could contribute to improving the administration of the city, and proposing solutions for a better use of them;
in achieving the proposed aims and objectives, CIIC Suceava will communicate with the relevant department of Suceava City Hall.

Local/National/European level of collaboration : In the next 2 years Suceava Municipality will implement a project having as a direct objective : to strengthen the knowledge of sustainable urban development, innovation, incubation and coordination skills for net-zero transition and specific climate-neutrality programmes and the key tools needed to deliver them in an integrated way in the Suceava administrations. Some of the activities are :

Action plan for increasing the capacity for sustainable innovation within the administration;
Analysis of existing capacity within Suceava to identify, develop and manage climate-neutrality projects to identify the capacity needs required to address gaps, leverage resources and enable future progress within the administration;
Centralisation of existing strategies, action plans, current and future projects linked to climate neutrality to enable the development of an action plan for strengthening internal capacity in terms of processes, governance, skills, collaboration and impact monitoring;
Good practice study visits for knowledge transfer and inspiration on urban climate-neutrality (in cooperation with a city partner from Norway).

Together with Suceava University and external experts we will create a local initiative called Urban Lab for Green Cities to enable climate-neutral and smart city solutions with the direct impact on encouraging social innovation, entrepreneurial education and public involvement from citizens, community groups and businesses in developing solutions that can be locally implemented in Suceava, prioritisation of most viable solutions aligned to
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

the main areas of climate-neutrality impact from the climate city contract and increase administrative capacity for climate - neutral urban governance.

A series of 7 workshops dedicated to a group of representatives from Suceava Municipality administrations involved in the urban, economic, social and environmental development of the district to strengthen their capacity in developing, financing, managing and partnering for impact on climate-neutral projects will be organized.

These workshops will include a theoretical component that will cover the innovation process and design thinking methods adapted to the roles and skills required by public administration for net-zero transition: innovation process for net-zero urban transition; systems thinking and stakeholder mapping; participatory methods for urban planning; foresight techniques for designing a successful climate-neutral city; ecosystem immersion for creative solutions; validation process and implementation roadmap; governance, funding and partner ecosystems.

Workshops will run in parallel with the incubation phase for climate-neutral solutions (A3) to enable administration representatives to apply theoretical knowledge from workshops practically in the management process for solution development.

The activities will include also common workshops and site visits with fellow Romanian Mission Cities Bucharest and Cluj Napoca and will focus on designing a monitoring process that can enable the future involvement of local actors and citizens as well as a set of recommendations for the institutional setting necessary to pursue the monitoring &amp; evaluation activities and to inform the different decisional layers within the local administration, discuss progress, shared climate neutrality objectives and learnings from the programme and opportunities for collaboration.

Roadmap to implementation: As a conclusion the roadmap from a project idea to a successful implementation for all the actions included in the Action Plan and not only these ones need to include a specific approach that need to include at least the following milestones:

SMART objectives and goals
A continue activity for monitoring, evaluation and, if necessarily, adjustment of technical solution and investment plan
Real and permanent communication with all local stakeholders, collaboration with the other Romanian cities engaged in NZC programme, with experts from European Commission and other European city partners
Sustained support and engagement from local decision makers
Adaptation of the investment approach for each single action/policy
Dissemination, communication and best practice transfer
Adaptable, flexible and "cost effectiveness" financing scheme

Recognizing their contribution to the global climate challenge, the people of Suceava, along with their dedicated municipality, embarked on a journey of transformation. They acknowledged the reality – greenhouse gas emissions from various sources, including transportation, buildings, and waste, were contributing to the environmental crisis. Fuelled by the success of previous initiatives, like becoming the first Romanian city with a 100% electric public transport fleet, Suceava saw the Climate City Contract and Net Zero Cities Mission as the perfect opportunity to accelerate their progress.

The municipality, acting as a facilitator and coordinator, embarked on a collaborative journey, bringing together diverse stakeholders - residents, businesses, experts, and public officials - to co-create the action plan.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways- textual and visual elements

(Describe, visualise, and contextualise pathways listed above)

Suceava's city journey towards a Net Zero City is paved with several key pathways, each with its own set of actions, expected outcomes, and potential benefits. By focusing on specific systemic levers, the city aims to achieve early changes within the next 1-2 years, leading to significant late outcomes by 2030. These outcomes will not only directly reduce GHG emissions but also generate a multitude of indirect impacts (co-benefits) that enhance the overall well-being of the city and its residents.

# Energy Systems:

Upgrading the city's energy infrastructure and promoting renewable energy production through solar parks are crucial early steps. These actions are expected to improve efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and ultimately, contribute to cleaner air and a more sustainable future for Suceava.

Mobility &amp; Transport: Transforming the public transport system (on metropolitan area) to be  $100\%$  electric, coupled with promoting alternative modes of transportation like cycling, will significantly reduce reliance on private vehicles and their associated emissions.

This shift will not only contribute to cleaner air but also improve public health, reduce traffic congestion, and enhance accessibility for residents.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

Waste &amp; Circular Economy: Modernizing the waste management system and implementing robust recycling policies will not only reduce energy consumption but also divert significant waste from landfills, leading to a more circular economy and resource conservation. Additionally, this pathway can create new job opportunities in the recycling sector.

Green Infrastructure &amp; Nature-Based Solutions: Investing in green spaces through park rehabilitation, tree planting, and implementing the "15-minute city" concept will not only improve air quality and public health but also enhance the city's aesthetics and provide valuable recreational opportunities for residents.

Built Environment: Enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings through innovative solutions like HEMS and photovoltaic panels will contribute to reduced reliance on fossil fuels for heating, leading to lower heating costs for residents and improved air quality. By actively pursuing these pathways, Suceava City can effectively address climate challenges, create a more sustainable and resilient city, and ultimately, shape a brighter future for generations to come. The Module B-3 table, Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning, provides a comprehensive breakdown of all the relevant actions for this plan. It describes the indicators and desired targets for each individual project included in the Action Plan. The quantified effects of the impact pathways emerge from the indicators proposed for their measurement and evaluation, which allow a clearer understanding of the generated systemic changes.

Thus, the target values proposed in Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning, together with their related metadata sheets, will allow us to properly evaluate the progress of the implemented actions and to study the status of our journey towards climate neutrality.

The Action Plan includes specific and integrated actions/projects and targets related to GHG emission reduction, with detailed technical documentation, financial information, implementation costs, milestones, indicators, results, stakeholders involved in implementation phase, actions that are additional that the ones already identified in existing strategic documents and that have been proposed as a result of the CCC process and are entirely responsible for the emission reduction targets assumed by Suceava Municipality in its pathway to achieve climate neutrality.

The Action Plan's vision, born from a collective desire for a cleaner, healthier future, ignited a spark within the community. It fuelled the creation of Suceava's Climate Action Plan, a roadmap towards becoming a Net Zero City. This plan, far from being a mere document, is a testament to the city's commitment, a story of collective action, innovation, and the unwavering belief in a brighter tomorrow.

Recognizing their contribution to the global climate challenge, the people of Suceava, along with their dedicated municipality, embarked on a journey of transformation.

and private buildings, dissemination and awareness campaigns, replication and changing behaviour trough a, climate neutral, one for citizens.

Implementation of a "pilot project" for a climate neutral city neighbourhood and ideas for replication.

Each of the signatories of the Commitments Document were part of local working groups in the CCC preparation process, they are partners with municipality in common investment projects from some of these are included in the Action Plan.

In some specific actions we have already started the cooperation in the preparation phase for specific projects from different sector (for example for the electric busses with local public transport operator, for rehabilitation of heating transport and distribution network with local private operator) and we will continue working for implementation and evaluation phase, as these projects are into the implementation phase already with the grant contracts signed in 2023 or 2024.

Suceava Municipality sees the Climate City Contract as a living document, that will be updated and upgraded, as for implementation monitoring sessions will be organized, along with annual re-iteration sessions, in order to fix the necessary updates, depending on the evolution of the local / regional / national / European context and the new European and national directives to be set with regards to climate neutrality and also to get engagement from a local / regional mix of private and public actors. More details regarding the connection between signatories and actions are to be found in table 6, 7 and 14 from the Investment Plan.

All the action there are included in the Action Plan are expected to generate real, significant, measurable changes /improvement of the life quality in Suceava city and radically reduce GHG emissions. On the roadmap for transformation of these priorities from strategy to reality, all the local stakeholders will be involved actively and responsible for achieving the climate neutrality efforts. Thus, depending on their individual expertise, all the signatory stakeholders will contribute (during design, implementation and evaluation phase) to fulfilling the strategic interventions mentioned above. They will provide expertise to the municipality and will be co-involved in various local projects (together with specific stakeholders and Municipality) that will lead to achieving the assumed climate neutrality.

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

Suceava Municipality will continue to update the local strategic documents for the period 2030-2038 in order to identify the specific actions, main actors, the most efficient approach and financial sources with the main goal of continue the local efforts for reduction of GHG emissions, increase energy efficiency, reduce the energy consumption, increase the production of “green energy” and improve the quality of life into the city.

Total emissions that are not accounted in this Action Plan: 55.903 t CO2/year (19,34%).

The Net-Zero City Action Plan brings together all major interventions planned by the Municipality to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The activities and proposals described in this plan include priority projects from local strategies and were estimated to reduce CO2 emissions to a target of 80,66%.

Offsetting measures are already included in the current Action Plan, as the proposed interventions include major carbon sink projects (rehabilitation and/or expansion of the existing parks/green areas, planting of 150.000 trees, metropolitan green belt, energy efficiency in residential buildings), with an offsetting effect that was accounted for in the 80.66% target. The strategy to address these residual emissions will give priority to local offset projects, and in particular to sinks and nature-based solutions projects, which also bring great co-benefits, particularly for the ecosystem services they provide and which have become essential for adaptation to climate change (temperature regulation, flood prevention, etc.) and for improving the quality of life in key aspects such as better physical and mental health and in a more democratised way, developing these systems in public spaces and proximity.

Priority will therefore be given to the local natural carbon sinks, projects/actions/initiatives, especially creation of new green areas, planting trees (150.000) resistant to climate change, with a high CO2 absorption capacity, addressing also to flood mitigation and biodiversity, that which will constitute a plant protection curtain (against noise) and reduce urban pollution in different location from Suceava City as: Manastirii Hill (11 hectares - 110.000 trees), Tineretii Neighbourhood (2 hectares - 1.800 trees), Europa Neighbourhood (2 hectares - 1.800 trees), Burdujeni Sat Neighbourhood (14 hectares- 40.000 trees), increasing the green infrastructure in the city, with specific investments for creating new urban habitats and protection of the existing wild nature, (Suceava river banks 221 hectares), with ecosystems that have high carbon sink potential.

The proposed local strategy/approach (carbon sink projects) for residual emissions includes also:

Buildings – as buildings are responsible for 59,51 % of the total CO2 emissions more specific actions need to be implemented like: continue the rehabilitation of the entire municipal distribution networks, increasing the energy efficiency of residential buildings (additional 8000 apartments), energy efficiency in private buildings, energy efficiency in public buildings (there are not under municipality’s administration – County Council, other public institutions) promoting the adoption of the new principle for all new buildings (especially in private sector), increase the utilisation of renewable energy sources solar, wind, biomass), heat storage technology, heat pumps, HEMS, carbon capture and storage technologies. Special attention need to be taking into consideration related to changing behaviour and acceptance of climate neutral intervention among citizens.

Transport – the proposed intervention from the Action Plan will be replicated and implemented at large scale covering the entire surface of Suceava City. Municipality is determined to implement actions like: extension of cycling facilities, congestion charge, extension of pedestrian facilities and Low Emission Areas, incentives and promotion campaigns for use of alternative ways of travelling and alternative vehicles (especially electric vehicles), sustainable urban mobility initiatives (reduce the number of private vehicles with classic engine, reduce traffic congestion), increase the attractively of PT and number of passengers, travel plans for different social categories (with accent to sustainable and alternative way of travel). Also with referring to the infrastructure there will be initiatives in the same scenario attempt to reduce traffic inside the city area, like

O

construction of city ring, constructing new transportation infrastructure and by implementing new local public policies that encourage inhabitants to embrace a more climate-neutral way of living and moving with a direct result in reduction of CO2 emissions associated with transportation.

**Waste** – actions will follow the pathway to reduce the impact of waste against environment like: upgrade the municipal waste management system, increased selective waste collection facilities, change citizens behaviour and encourage them to participate to municipal’s efforts for separate waste collection and recycling, increase the percentage of construction waste recycled, extend the concept of circular economy, increase the utilisation of recycled materials into construction sector, innovative actions (compost stations, cooking oil recycling facilities).

**IPPU** – private sector will be encouraged to extend the implementation of measures regarding energy efficiency (including commerce and services), increase the investments in alternative energy production units (solar, wind), increase the number of alternative vehicles in private fleets, increase the utilisation of recycled materials into production processes and more important develop the number of local projects implemented by Public Private Partnership entities.

**AFOLU** – actions will be related to promote economic efficiency of local markets, sustainable production of local goods, sustainable development and conservation of green spaces.

Suceava City will continue working in the next 10 years in order to identify the list of policies, actions, projects and interventions that need to be implemented in line with the roadmap to address the residual emissions, the level of GHG reduction that will be identified and assumed by local strategic documents and the goals regarding proposed targets for improving the quality of life into the city.

Transition to climate neutrality is a complex and challenging process, but the next step related to residual emissions is expected to be a complex and provocative. For this reason, each single aspect need to be considered, each specific details for different city areas and sectors (heating, energy, transport, building, green areas) will have to be analysed, specific solutions, replicated or innovative ones, need to be identified for all sectors, discussed with local stakeholders and experts in order to create the appropriate conditions for a smooth approach to the goals assumed by the municipality in relationship with residual emissions.

Based on the local experience in the field of energy efficiency projects and also on the knowledge that will accrue from the implementation of the Action Plan, Suceava Municipality, through its Transition Team, we consider that we will be able to achieve our ambitions related to residual emissions and continue the local efforts for becoming a nearly zero GHG emissions city.

The following aspects will be considered for approaching the residual emissions:

**Cumulative effect**: Repeated and sustained efforts over time can lead to a more significant and lasting reduction in emissions compared to short-term bursts of activity.

**Technological advancements**: Technological innovations in areas like renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation are constantly evolving. More time allows for the adoption and integration of these advancements into the city's strategies, potentially leading to solutions that are more effective.

**Behaviour change**: Encouraging sustainable behaviour changes among citizens takes time and sustained effort. Continued awareness campaigns, education initiatives, and infrastructure improvements over a longer period can lead to a gradual shift towards more sustainable practices.

**Learning and adaptation**: Implementing and monitoring the effectiveness of strategies takes time. The document emphasizes ongoing analysis and adaptation based on experience and knowledge gained over time. This iterative approach can lead to continuous improvement and refinement of the strategies, potentially leading to greater impact in the end. Finally, in any case, carbon sequestration by artificial techniques will be developed and carbon credits will be included in the NETZERO strategy to ensure the achievement of neutrality.

C-1.2: Description of organisation and governance interventions – textual and visual elements

Improved local/internal organisational and governance models:

The municipality has an important role to play in leading the local climate transition towards the goal set by joining the 100 Smart and Climate Neutral Cities Mission by 2030. The role that Suceava will play in the coming period is to become the initiator of the decarbonisation process at local level by providing a concrete example of best practice, thus being the first city to commit to involving most of the local stakeholders in the climate transition process.

The internal Municipality’s transition team includes public servants with experience in management, finance, technical, evaluation, publicity and dissemination. There are regular meetings with all involved persons: once per week in the presence of leading staff, at least twice per month with representatives from construction companies and private operators (if necessarily) and also anytime when it is required for the smooth implementation of the projects. Apart of this for the final evaluation for each project, a service contract is required with an external expert that has to evaluate and certify the project impact.

Additional to these aspects in order to ensure a good control in the implementation, specialized structure composed of people with experience in energy efficiency, key people from various departments of the local authority, interested local actors, to ensure the monitoring and reporting of activities assumed by the plan are organized. For the activities related to estimation of emission reduction and measurement, the impact of investments we usually use to contract external experts, perform public surveys and organize workshops with
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

local stakeholders.

As almost all public authorities, Suceava Municipality has an internal monitoring and evaluation system for capital investment planning with representatives from different departments, but considering the complexity and high importance of the investments included in the Action Plan we will need to upgrade and constantly update the internal system especially for the monitoring of process-mapping deviation.

The transition team members (that are responsible for planning &amp; reporting) skills and commitments are essential as usually approved reports are mandatory for the reimbursement of costs.

In order to create the condition for dissemination and replication of the Action Plan projects/objectives/actions at national level Suceava Municipality will work together with Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca as climate neutrality ambassadors for Romanian cities.

This actions have already started and few distinct activities have been organized at national level (one in Bucharest where all three cities were able to present their local strategies for next 7 years) and the most relevant one is the event in Cluj Napoca where decision makers from national, regional and local administration have signed an agreement that establish the terms for future cooperation with other cities from Romania on their pathway for becoming climate neutral.

Each specific department (technical, financial, monitoring and implementation) has established his own internal procedures and the ones related to cooperation with other departments therefor at the institutional level to ensure the appropriate framework for successful implementation of the climate neutrality actions.

European projects department is the main responsible (along with the Transition Teams members - different experts from different departments) for design, funding, implementation and evaluation of the projects/initiatives included into Action Plan. For the moment, our efforts are concentrated to preparation of technical documentation in order to secure financing from ERDF and other external sources mainly for the implementation of climate neutral initiatives included and assumed in the Action Plan and in parallel to implementation of the already granted contracts for local climate neutral investments.

The actual organization and management of this ambitious process will follow an open approach towards the general public and all stakeholders, so that the focus is on dialogue and collaboration between stakeholders, both through public consultation and information gathering from all sectors of interest, providing opportunities for involvement in an equitable and participatory governance.

Therefore, through the climate contract the local authority shows once again that the Municipality of Suceava aims to involve citizens in the current processes of development of the city, demonstrating a public management oriented towards the citizen and the relevant factors of the local plan.

Cooperation at national level: In order to support the efforts of Suceava Municipality and the other two municipalities that are part of the mission in Romania, the Project „NetZeRoCities – National Centre for Competence and solutions for developing climatic neutral smart cities".

The consortium coordinating NetZero Cities is composed of POLITECHNIC University of Bucharest, National Institute for Research and Development in Computer Science ICI Bucharest, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Technical University of Construction Bucharest, "Stefan cel Mare" University of Suceava, Holisun SRL, Beia Cercetare SRL, Datacor SRL, Intelligent Convergent Solutions SRL, SC Building Technology Group R SRL, Orange Romania SA and Robert Bosch SRL.

The Centre of Competence is a secure and efficient structure capable of providing a sustainable, predictable and streamlined environment for the development of research, development and innovation activities with a focus on contributing to climate change and the digital transition.

The Centre is conceived as an innovation hub, representing an indicator of excellence in research, development and innovation and acting as a support for cities in successfully accessing funding opportunities under the EU Climate Change Mission and in achieving the EU Climate Change Mission's objectives and key indicators.

The aim is to support access to funding, increase the innovation capacity of the RDI system to create synergies between research and business, and create the critical mass of interdisciplinary skills needed to address the societal challenges associated with the EU Climate Change Mission. The Centre of Competence is a networking tool of excellence to increase the chances of success in the EU Climate Change Mission and the
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Carbon Neutrality objective.

The main objectives of the Competence Centre are:

Methodologic framework
Establishing the methodological framework for the Competence Centre, focusing on supporting Romanian cities in achieving Climate Neutrality, with a focus on the requirements of individuals, local businesses, local governments and regional and national authorities.

Governance of Climate Neutral Cities
Establish city governance models and policies for climate action. Inspired by what has worked for peer cities in the EU and adapted to local and regional administrative, economic and social barriers and needs, Governance will support a systemic transformation of Romanian cities, following a holistic approach to promote innovation and implementation of measures.

The Competence Centre will propose plans (integrated and multi-level governance) and help local administrations to take a strategic, holistic and long-term approach to climate investments, including the collaboration of all relevant actors in the city.

Collaboration platform
Design and implement a Competence Centre Platform to support collaboration between national and European institutions to achieve Climate Neutrality, integrating social inclusion, diversity and participation of all stakeholders in communities.

Climate Actions Services
Increase and improve the introduction of enabling technologies (digitalization) in cities and support the transition to green technologies in areas such as sustainable mobility, energy efficiency or green urban planning to achieve Climate Neutrality. The aim is to demonstrate a systemic innovation approach to green transition in governance, transport, energy, construction and recycling, supported by strong digital technologies (i.e. systemic innovation in the urban investment value chain).

Drivers for Climate Neutral Cities and Smart Campuses
Developing best practices (for green and digital twin transformations) to fully harness greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution data to implement smart mobility, smart energy grid delivery, improved energy efficiency in buildings, water and waste management, and more, leading to increased awareness of climate change. The aim is to build an Innovation Hub (Smart Campus) for cities in Romania to inspire, learn and replicate ideas and solutions from the EU Climate Change Mission.

Net Zero Competence Centre
Defining the operational, financial and legal conditions for the creation of the Competence Centre to ensure its future sustainability.

The main purpose of participating in this project is to benefit from the know-how of the team members, to transfer the best practice example (already implemented by some of the project members), to identify, adapt and implement pilot projects in Suceava, replicate de existing ones from other Romanian cities.

Suceava city would like to benefit from academic and technic knowledge of the project team members and more than this the issue of transferring the best practical solution for increasing the citizen's/stakeholders involvement into the implementation of Action Plan will be approach.

As referring to the entities mentioned in C1.1 section we have to add that we have already started the cooperation in the preparation phase for specific projects from different sectors (for example for the electric busses with local public transport operator, for rehabilitation of heating transport and distribution network with local private operator) and for sure we will continue working together for implementation and evaluation phase.

|  In recent years, one of the main focuses of Suceava municipality was energy efficiency and also Suceava city is working hard on resilience and flexibility for the green economy. Some of the previous projects are: • Electro mobility – electric vehicles for a green municipality • Modern and efficient public lighting management in Suceava Municipality- modernization of the public lighting on the entire area of Suceava Municipality and replacement of classical lighting units with LED lighting units in the educational units of Suceava Municipality • Integrated system of ecological public transport in Suceava Municipality • Increasing the energy efficiency of the Suceava City Hall building • APPLIED – Computerized, Quality and Accessible Local Public Administration for All in Suceava, • CARD4ALL – Connecting Cities, Citizens and Services - a city accessible to all citizens • Revitalization of urban public space in Suceava • ALTERECO – A demonstration of transport ALTER natives to protect the Ecology of Europe • MATRA KAP – Improvement of Solid Waste Management System for Suceava City • CATCH – Clean Accessible Transport to protect Community Health • SMILE – Towards Sustainable Mobility for people in urban arEas  |   |   |   |   |   |
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

PLUME – Clean Cities for a Clean Europe
SWAM – Facilities for separate waste collection and recycling

The ongoing projects that are already into the implementation phase (with a total amount of 130.000.000 Euro) - are related to energy efficiency in public and residential buildings, green (100 % electric) public transport, sustainable mobility, photovoltaic park, rehabilitation of green areas, digitalization of public administration’s services. This as to demonstrate that the municipality has already started the actions that have as a direct objective climate neutrality at local level and reduction of GHG emissions.

Suceava Municipality focusses on local stakeholders (especially citizens) involvement in projects design, implementation and monitoring. There will be actions and specific efforts to bring relevant stakeholders together and involve them in a co-creation process, often in very practical contexts such as sustainable mobility, cycling, energy efficiency in each neighbourhood.

The projects proposed for implementation in the Action Plan combine specific actions related to climate and health and also testing of specific ways of working both in designated areas and at city level, changing behaviour, transfer of best practice example form national and European cities and in the end integrate the learnings in a governance model for scaling these solutions in the city as a whole and in other cities.

A special attention will be allocating to Public Private Partnership projects and for specific actions that are related to private sector (industrial, commerce, services) that will be encouraged to replicate the public sector ideas and solutions.

The performance and monitoring indicators of the actions proposed in the Action Plan are represented by the final annual energy consumption and associated CO₂ emissions, which will be compared with the values determined by the Emission Reference Inventory for the chosen reference year, 2021, as well as with the achievement of the proposed targets.

In order to ensure a good control in the implementation, it is recommended to set up a specialized structure composed of people with experience in energy efficiency, key people from various departments of the local authority, interested local actors, to ensure the monitoring and reporting of activities assumed by the plan. It is recommended that the specialized structures carry out the following activities in order to successfully meet the objectives proposed by the plan:

Regular monitoring of the progress of actions and assessment of their impact;
Periodic reporting of local actors on the results of the plan;
Participation in local, national or international events to benefit from the experience of other municipalities regarding the implementation of Action Plan.

Some of the necessarily conditions that have to be simultaneously created at local level for the successful implementation of the proposed actions are:

Financing: the total amount necessary need to be either allocated or secured from local budget, central budget, National Operational Programs, NRRP other European funds and private funds.
Human resources: public servants, consultants, external experts and stakeholders will have to be allocated and trained to work together for a common purpose
Team city and spirit: citizens especially and stakeholder’s engagement are essential for successful implementation of the actions.
Working venues and infrastructure: allocation of working spaces designated to the NZC mission, equipment, materials and promotion materials for activities like Net Zero Caravan, Civic Innovation events (replicated from Cluj Napoca experience), workshops and dissemination campaigns.

# 6 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for further refining the Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract.

# Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration - textual elements

# 1. Integrated Communication Strategy:

Maximizing the resulting effects and the impact of actions is achieved through efficient communication, a complementary component to the implementation and monitoring processes.

Citizens and the main stakeholders should be informed, by categories of recipients, by sending correct messages and on the understanding of the recipient, so that the categories of public and citizens - beneficiaries of public services, perceive the direct benefits resulting from the measures implemented.

The flow of information must often be directed at influential political factors at national and international level, by organizing a strong lobbying activity, leading to obtaining the necessary sources of funding to materialize the actions envisaged in the SECAP and Action Plan.

Specific objective 1: Increasing stakeholder's awareness of the importance and benefits of implementing measures to improve energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources.

Specific objective 2: Education and training at all levels for the awareness and gain of the local community by the local administration in order to implement the actions included in the Action Plan.

# Specific actions:

Organizing events that have as a scope:

Informing and raising awareness among end consumers about the importance and benefits of implementing energy efficiency measures;
Promoting the use of energy-efficient equipment and appliances, as well as renewable energy sources, for final consumers;
Information on existing energy labelling systems, standards and norms aimed at improving the energy efficiency of products and services, including buildings and vehicles;
Promoting energy efficiency mechanisms and financial instruments for energy saving;
Reducing the environmental impact of industrial activities and the production, transport, distribution and consumption of all forms of energy;
Promoting high energy efficiency technologies, modern measurement and control systems, as well as energy management systems, for monitoring, continuous assessment of energy efficiency and forecasting of energy consumption;

Measure 7.7: Development of information, education or specialized training programs for both providers and users of public services, with the aim of training skills for the rational and efficient use of energy in the operation of buildings and facilities.

Through a clear communication and promotion strategy, the local actors will be permanently informed and motivated about the content of the Action Plan as well as about its implementation phases.

This will aim to the communication of messages in a clear and correct manner to all categories of recipients concerned, through favourable communication channels, in order to avoid and reduce the risks of the target audience - the community, not perceiving the direct benefits resulting from the measures implemented according to the Action Plan. The objectives of the Communication Strategy of the Action Plan for the City of Suceava are the following:

To increase and consolidate the degree of notoriety of Suceava Municipality Climate Neutrality Action Plan.
To raise awareness of its role and contribution to the community.
To increase the level of information of the beneficiaries of this action.

The communication strategy of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan for the City of Suceava will focus on achieving the following steps, which are necessary for the successful implementation of this action.

# Message specification

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

The message specification will emphasize the effect it will produce in order to achieve the desired result. The message will convey most of the objectives contained in the Climate Neutrality Action Plan such as the measures to be implemented, but also the expected results that will belong to the technical sphere. The construction of the message will take into account the target groups, as well as their level of knowledge in the field, so the awareness / familiarity with the subject will be easily reached.

The communication strategy will have the following set of indicators:
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Level of awareness regarding the Suceava Municipality Climate Neutrality Action Plan;
The level of confidence in the implementation measures of Suceava Municipality Climate Neutrality Action Plan;
Information and publicity materials;
Information and communication events;
Studies performed to determine the degree of satisfaction of the target audience

The results will be centralized, interpreted and in case new solutions are required, other scenarios will be developed for adaptation and control over the implementation process of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan in general, of the Communication Strategy in particular.

Each Climate Neutrality Action Plan related communication activity will be monitored, measuring its media impact, reflected in media coverage. There will be a monitoring of articles / interviews in the press and a file containing promotional materials (brochures / leaflets, etc.) made by the Municipality of Suceava, as well as materials from the press promoting SECAP or related actions, all of which are archived.

## 2. Create the appropriate local conditions for implementation of the Action Plan

The Municipality has the obligation to employ / recruit the appropriate technical expert for the position of City Energy Manager that is able to provide consultancy and technical assistance for planning, implementation and monitoring of measures/projects that are aim to increase energy efficiency. The City Energy Manager together with other experts from the Municipality will have to provide the support for data collection, monitoring and implementation of the energy related projects, as:

Preparation of legally required reports and information to the Energy Efficiency Directorate of the Ministry of Energy and to other public authorities that legally require information
Monitoring the application and implementation of the Energy Efficiency Improvement Program (EEIP) and regularly informing those responsible for the implementation of the Program on how it is being carried out and providing specific support.

Suceava Municipality and the other two municipalities that are part of the mission in Romania will benefit from the implementation of the project „NetZeRoCities – National Centre for Competencue and solutions for developing climatic neutral smart cities” that started in 2023.

The consortium coordinating NetZero Cities is composed of universities, public institutions, independent experts, private companies with the main objective: providing a sustainable, predictable and streamlined environment for the development of research, development and innovation activities with a focus on contributing to climate change and the digital transition.

The aim is to support access to funding, increase the innovation capacity of the RDI system to create synergies between research and business, and create the critical mass of interdisciplinary skills needed to address the societal challenges associated with the EU Climate Change Mission and it is a networking tool of excellence to increase the chances of success in the EU Climate Change Mission and the Carbon Neutrality objective.

The process of developing and monitoring a portfolio of climate neutrality projects (included into the Action Plan) can be divided into several steps:

Identify the current situation: The first step is to identify the current situation of the city's carbon footprint and energy consumption. This may involve analysing existing data or conducting research studies. This step can provide an overview of the city's environmental impact and help identify areas for improvement/intervention.
Setting targets: Once the current situation is known, the next step is to set targets for reducing carbon emissions. These targets should be ambitious but realistic and aligned with global or national climate change commitments.
Determine the key actions that need to be taken: Once targets are set, it is important to determine the key actions that need to be taken to achieve the targets. These actions can be soft (e.g. awareness and education campaigns), medium (e.g. energy efficiency projects) or hard (e.g. investment in renewable energy or electric transport projects). This stage should include an analysis of the costs and benefits of each action and an assessment of the impact on the objectives set.
Prioritize projects: Once key actions have been identified, it is important to prioritize them according to their impact, feasibility and cost. This can help to identify the actions with the greatest potential to contribute to the achievement of the objectives without exceeding the allocated budget.
Measuring and monitoring progress: Once projects are implemented, it is important to monitor and measure progress. This can be done through relevant performance indicators such as carbon emissions or energy consumption. It is also important to monitor the budget and time allocated to each project.
How to involve stakeholders: During the process of developing and monitoring a portfolio of climate neutrality projects, it is important to involve stakeholders such as the local community, the private sector, local government and non-governmental organizations. This helps to create a framework for collaboration and to increase the involvement of all stakeholders in making decisions that lead to the achievement of the agreed objectives.

The main purpose of participating in this project is to benefit from the knowhow of the team members, to transfer the best practice example (already implemented by some of the project members), to identify, adapt and implement pilot projects in Suceava, replicate the existing ones from other Romanian cities.

Suceava city will to benefit from academic and technic knowledge of the project team members and more than this the issue of transferring the best practical solution for increasing the citizen's/stakeholders involvement into the implementation of Action Plan will be approach.

# 3. Early start for projects implementation and permanent innovation

Even the Action Plan is to be submitted in June 2024 and the Climate City Contract has not been signed yet Suceava Municipality has already begin the implementation of many climate neutrality-related investment projects financed by NRRP (14 projects for energy efficiency of public and residential buildings, smart city, green public transport, circular economy and most important: rehabilitation of the central heating network

#

system and photovoltaic park - have been submitted and grant contacts have been signed already). Technical documentation was finalized and are ready to be submitted for financing by the 2021-2027 Regional Plan (North East) (urban renewal, green areas, green corridors, electric buses, charging stations, cycling infrastructure, energy efficiency in public and private buildings etc.).

# 4. National/local level of cooperation

In order to create the condition for dissemination and replication of the Action Plan projects/objectives/actions at national level Suceava Municipality need to cooperate with Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca as climate neutrality ambassadors for Romanian cities.

This actions have already started and few distinct activities have been organized at national level (one in Bucharest where all three cities were able to present their local strategies for next 7 years) and the most relevant one is the event in Cluj Napoca where decision makers from national, regional and local administration have signed an agreement that establish the terms for future cooperation with other cities from Romania on their pathway for becoming climate neutral.

Apart of the public consultation process from the design phase for the climate contract more public surveys are planned to be done in implementation phase for most relevant and with major impact actions (like the already organised ones concerning energy efficiency in public and residential buildings, smart &amp; sustainable mobility, electric public transport for metropolitan area) and more important during evaluation phase of the projects. This is meant to continue the process of local stakeholders (citizens also) involvement in the mission process having as a direct result the feedback regarding the results, the achievements and also regarding the suggestion for improvements/upgrade of the proposed actions.

Local stakeholders (especially citizens) have been approach and included into the design phase of projects concerning for example residential buildings rehabilitation, green areas that are included in the Action Plan. Designated work groups have been established (with representatives from civil society, public institutions, university, architects and local experts), public surveys and public consultation (including meetings with residents from the buildings that are subject of future interventions) with a specific objective of increase the acceptance of citizens in the actions that the city is taking for its pathway to climate neutrality. These working groups (based on local city mayor decision) will also work together with the municipality's transition team in the implementation and evaluation phases of each specific project.

Within its efforts to engage stakeholders and citizens to local actions related to climate neutrality another initiative (linked with city hall website) was launched in the second half of 2023, called Centre for Innovation and Civic Imagination with the main objective as increasing the degree of citizen involvement in the process of adopting and applying decisions of public interest, but also increasing citizens' trust in local administration. Thus, the framework is created for defining the active role of the citizen, respectively the transmission of ideas, proposals and suggestions in the development and implementation of public projects especially the ones included in the Action Plan.

# 5. Working together at European level

As being part of 100 climate neutral European cities family Suceava Municipality need to work together will other European city partners that are sharing the same objectives related to energy efficiency and GHG emission reduction. This will facilitate the transfer of best practice solution and know how between European cities, will facilitate access to innovative and energy efficient technologies and solutions and will create the condition for a smoothest transition to climate neutrality at European level.

In the same time, as experienced while the Action Plan was designed, Suceava Municipality is keen to continue working together with experts nominated by the European Commission trough NetZeRo Cities Project in order to have access to technic and specialized support for the projects related to energy transition towards climate neutrality that the Municipality is implementing.

# 6. Monitoring the implementation of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The performance and monitoring indicators of the actions proposed in the Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Suceava Municipality are represented by the final annual energy consumption and associated  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions, which will be compared with the values determined by the Emission Reference Inventory for the chosen reference year, 2021, as well as with the achievement of the proposed targets. In order to ensure a good
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

control in the implementation, we will set up a specialized structure composed of people with experience in energy efficiency, key people from various departments of the local authority, interested local actors, to ensure the monitoring and reporting of activities assumed by the plan. This specialized structures will have to carry out the following activities in order to successfully meet the objectives proposed by the plan:

Regular monitoring of the progress of actions and assessment of their impact;
Periodic reporting of local actors on the results of the plan;
Participation in local, national or international events to benefit from the experience of other municipalities regarding the implementation of Action Plan.

Monitoring the implementation of the Action Plan is an important action as it can lead to measures to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the event of delays in targets. An important chapter in the monitoring process is the quantification of the amounts spent from the reference year to the monitoring year for the implementation of the proposed measures. Expenditure will be presented separately on two components: direct expenditure (actually used to implement the measures) and indirect expenditure (amounts spent on salaries, consultancy, dissemination, etc.).

The Climate City Contract will go through an annual review and update process, based on iteration sessions organized by the Net Zero City Coalition. Thus, based on the learning gained through the daily implementation of the Action Plan, the Municipality and its transition team will intervene with improvements in the content of the CCC related documents.

As we stated, we will use a model of reflexive governance, in which participation and deliberation across the Net Zero City Coalition will help us implement an intervention system based on common commitment, by taking into account the perspectives of all the actors involved. During the annual iteration sessions for CCC review, all the knowledge systems provided by the Net Zero City Coalition members will be activated, and the results of the consultations with them will be recorded in the updated version of the documentation.

Citizens' involvement will play an important role in this regard. Thus, both the elaboration of the Action Plan and its implementation, respectively its update, will allow us to continue using, developed and upgrade exiting innovative governance model (already described in this initial version of the Action Plan), with information that will be reflected in the future iterations for the CCC review.

The internal management teams (for each project) includes public servants with experience in management, finance, technical, evaluation, publicity and dissemination. There are regular meetings with all involved persons once per week in the presence of leading staff, at least twice per month with representatives from construction companies and private operators (if necessarily) and also anytime when it is required for the smooth implementation of the projects. Apart of this for the final evaluation for each project a service contract is required with an external expert that has to evaluate and certify the project impact.

Additional to these aspects in order to ensure a good control in the implementation and to ensure the monitoring and reporting of activities assumed by the Action Plan, specialized structure composed of members with experience in energy efficiency, key people from various departments of the local authority, interested local actors, stakeholders are organized and will be active in the implementation phase for projects included in Action Plan.

Suceava Municipality has a special designated transition team that is responsible for managing the entire process of Climate City Contract implementation, monitoring, evaluation and review. The team is composed of experts from different complementary departments within Suceava City Hall: Financial Department, Investment Department, European Projects Department, Legal Department, Urban Strategies Service, Public Procurement Service, Green Areas Directorate, Energy and local utilities Office, Owner Association and Residential Buildings Service, IT Department, Waste Management Department (Urban Energy Manager is it expected to join the team from 2024).

The team is open for new members that will be able to join anytime in the next 7 years and it is coordinated by is under the coordination of the European Projects, Investment, Strategy and Local Development Department.

However, since the transition towards climate neutrality is not an individual responsibility, but rather a collective effort, Suceava Municipality, related to the experience in ongoing projects implementation, will

#

launched an invitation to the entire local ecosystem to engage all the key local actors, stakeholders, private and public sector as a local Net Zero City Coalition, with the scope of serving the local climate-neutrality pursuits, it is expected to be created in the first half of 2024.

Net Zero City Coalition’s work will focus on using already-existing local strategic documents (e.g., SUMP, SECAP, IUDS), out of the willingness to ensure the continuity and sustainability of priorities that were established through previously-approved framework papers but especially on the Action Plan implementation, monitoring, reiteration and evaluation in direct correlation with the Mission’s requirements and local objectives &amp; commitments.

Maximizing the resulting effects and the impact of actions will be achieved through efficient communication, local commitment of the all involved stakeholders, common actions seen as a complementary component to the implementation and monitoring processes.

The inventory of greenhouse gas emissions must be restored after a period of at least 4 years, according to the recommendations issued by the Covenant of Mayors.

The recalculated emissions can thus be compared with the emissions in the reference year, in accordance with other indicators (population evolution, economic data, etc.) in order to obtain relevant conclusions about the state of implementation of the Action Plan.

Once some of the proposed measures have been implemented and the emissions inventory has been revised, the Municipality:

May revise estimates for the final forecast year (2030) based on information gained from implemented actions;
It can maintain the estimates reported in the Action Plan, if they are in line with the savings made during the implementation of the measures.

(Source: http://www.maphill.com/romania/suceava/panoramic-maps/physical-map/)

The slopes of the terrain are quite varied. Most of them, about 60% of the surface of the territory, are below 3°, 25% of the territory has slopes between 3 and 10°, and 15% of the territory has slopes above 10°.

The main landforms in the city and the surrounding area, of Quaternary age, can be classified into three major groups:

The plateaus, widely undulating, represented by Zamca hill and Cetății hill. The ridges are found only in the southeastern part of the city;
the deluvial slopes (about 25% of the surface), appeared as a result of the active dynamics of the geomorphological processes (landslides, splash and linear erosions), are found especially in the upper basin of Târgului valley, on the western and south-eastern slopes of Zamca Hill and on the right slope of Suceava;

Covenant of Mayors

&gt; Alluvial plains, modeled in the form of steps, have embedded characteristics.

These were detached as steps by the successive deepening of the Suceava riverbed thusly:

A step between 0 and 2 m, floodable;
A higher step between 2 and 4 m, periodically flooded;
the last step between 4 and 7 m is the highest of the plain.

In addition to these three steps of the plain, there are six more terraces:

20-25 m terrace in the area of the former Burdujeni slaughterhouse;
60-70 m terrace, Burdujeni hill;
100 m terrace, Viei hill and Monastery hill;
terrace of 130-140 m, Velnița hill;
150-160 m terrace, Țarinca hill;
180-190 m terrace, Căprăriei hill.

## 2.4. Climate

The northern position of Suceava Municipality determines a temperate-continental climate with Baltic influences, with a cooler and wetter character, largely due to the Atlantic and continental anticyclones.

The northern air brings snow in winter and cold rains in spring and autumn. From the east there are continental climatic influences with drought in summer, clear skies, frost and blizzards in winter. Precipitation in the form of rain represents 70-80% of the total. The lowest amounts of precipitation are recorded in February, and the most abundant amounts are usually in May and June.

The city of Suceava is located in climate zone IV with the conventional calculation temperature $\theta_{\mathrm{e}} = -21^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, and the northern position of Suceava determines a temperate-continental climate with Baltic influences, with a cooler and wetter, largely due to Atlantic and continental anticyclones.

The number of degrees-days for the heating period is 3865. The average heating period is 222 days per year (according to SR 1907/1997).

## 2.5. Hydrographic network

From a hydrographic point of view, the Suceava Municipality is located in the hydrographic basin of the Siret River through its tributary on the right side of the Suceava River.

The Suceava River springs from the Lucina massif and has a length of $170~\mathrm{km}$, and on the territory of Suceava Municipality it has a general direction of northeast-southeast flow and crosses the territory of the municipality from northwest to southeast.

For the most part, the course of the river is lined with dams on both banks, and the depression corridor created by erosion by this river reaches widths of up to $2\mathrm{km}$.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

On the right side, the river Suceava receives as tributaries the streams Șcheia and Cetății, and on the left, the streams Depoului, Dragomirna (on which Dragomirna Lake was arranged to supply water to the city), Mitocul, Podu Vătafului, Varnița and Mereni.
Suceava Municipality Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan

Covenant of Mayors

Scheia stream has a winding course with asymmetrical slopes and partially forms the natural border with Șcheia commune.

Lakes are arranged on the Cetățuia valley and its tributaries.

The course of this stream shows sudden changes of direction, and on the territory of the city there are asymmetrical slopes, the one on the right side specific to the cuestas.

The Suceava River creates a 1.5 km wide riverbed near the city, mostly non-fluodable, as a result of the measures to dam and protect the space affected by the industrial and leisure area. Over time, the Suceava River has undergone successive movements to the South-Southwest, leaving behind the opposite side of the old riverbed in the form of terraces.

## 2.7. History¹²

Archaeological discoveries attest, on the site of the current city, the existence of free Dacian settlements. They have been inhabited since the earliest period of human society, the Paleolithic. Excavations near the Fortress of Suceava have

confirmed an ancient settlement from the early Neolithic period, 7000 years ago, of the Criș culture.

From the Bronze Age (2nd millennium BC), two tombs in stone boxes have been found, discovered in the western part of the city. There is other evidence of the existence of human settlements in the Iron Age, the first millennium BC.

For the first centuries of our era, vestiges of the free Dacians were discovered, on the left bank of the Scheia stream, from the 2nd - 3rd century AD, which by the type of houses, the technique of pottery - prove ancient Dacian traditions and the influence of Roman civilization. (From the same period, there is still a cemetery in the area of Ana Ipătescu Street).

The old village settlements date back to the migration of peoples, which in the 14th century were grouped in the eastern part of the current city, where the first nucleus of the future medieval city was formed.

The transformation of the rural settlement into an urban settlement reached its peak in the 14th century, which determined Petru I Mușat (1375-1391) to change his royal residence from Siret to Suceava, which thus became for more than two centuries, the capital of Moldavia (from 1388 - 1566). That is when the royal courts and the Mirăuți church (the first metropolitan cathedral) as well as the Șcheia Fortress and the Fortress of Suceava were built.

For two centuries 15th - 16th, Suceava occupied a prominent place in the history of Moldavian cities, being the most important center of production of goods and internal and external trade, as well as the main customs crossing point of the country through which all the merchant caravans were forced to pass.

However, the heyday of Suceava was reached during the reign of the great ruler Stephen the Great (1457-1504), who gave it increased attention, consolidating the Fortress, the Royal Court, adding new and important constructions to the city, taking care of its economic and cultural development.

In the summer of 1476, the ambitious Muhammad II tried his luck under the city walls, but the strong resistance of the Moldavians shattered his will for victory and forced him to retreat shamefully. Stefan had made Suceava a strategic point of his defense system. In 1497, for 21 days and nights in a row, the Ottoman cannons struck the walls, but they remained unshaken. The fortress was never conquered by force of arms.

Covenant of Mayors

The successors of Štefan cel Mare - Bogdan cel Orb, Štefăniță Vodă, but especially Petru Rares, continued the policy of their predecessors, contributing to economic, artistic and cultural development of Suceava.

On May 21, 1600, the armies of the Voievod Mihai Viteazul entered the Fortress without a fight, thus concluding the act of the first Union of Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldavia. On May 26, Ioan Capturi, the new Burgrave of Suceava, swears allegiance to the great Voivode who called himself "lord of Wallachia and Transylvania and of the whole country of Moldavia."

Without reaching the level of the age of Stephen the Great - Petru Rares, Suceava experienced a new moment of economic and cultural flourishing during the reign of Vasile Lupu (1634 - 1653), followed by its decline favored by the destruction caused by the Turkish-Polish wars. Gradually, the favorite residence of Petru Rares's descendants became Iași, although Suceava was not suddenly abandoned.

From the second half of the 17th century, the city began to decline at an accelerated pace. The Fortress is destroyed so that it cannot be used by the hostile rulers of the Ottoman Porte or by the Polish armies in conflict with the Turks.

In 1775, northern Moldavia came under Austrian rule. Under Habsburg rule this territory is called Bukovina. Passing first to the province of Galicia, in 1849 it became an autonomous province and depended directly on the Austrian imperial crown. Bukovina was divided into two regions - Suceava and Chernivtsi. From 1868, Suceava became a county capital. In 1860 the boys' gymnasium was established, in 1871 the court, then a barracks and a hospital. Towards 1871, a railway line was built to Itcani, from Dornești, connecting Burdujeni with old Romania. At the beginning of the 20th century, the power plant was built, the water and sewerage installation was introduced, and several credit banks were set up.

On November 6, 1918, Suceava was liberated from foreign rule, at that time numbering 1 424 houses with 10 200 inhabitants.

In the interwar period, Suceava - the capital of the county with the same name is developing slowly from an economic point of view. Suceava was more of a trading center, where the products of the mountain and plain area were exchanged. On the eve of the Second World War, the city industry was represented by only two mills, a sausage factory, a sugar factory, a pigment factory, an oil press, two tanneries and craft workshops. During this period, the "Štefan cel Mare" boys' high school, a girls' high school, a commercial gymnasium, a boys 'industrial gymnasium, and a girls' vocational high school, two primary schools and two kindergartens operated in Suceava.

After the Second World War, Suceava experienced an economic and social development under the communist regime. Thus, the most important industrial structures that processed raw materials from this part of the country (paper mills, wood processing, machinery and equipment, glass, food industry, light industry) were concentrated in the northeastern part of the city, on the shores of Suceava, and in the west, in the Șcheia area.

The rapid industrialization of Suceava, since the 1960s, has led to the construction of new housing estates, as well as public buildings, a new hospital with over 700 beds, a cultural center, the Institute of Higher Education, hotels, parks and new markets. As another consequence of the industrial development, the transport increases, so we mention the Salcea airport (12 km from the city), the modernization of the three train stations, the public transport.

After 1989, the Suceava Municipality experienced an economic decline, as a result of the restructuring of the national economy, which determined that the large companies to restrict their activity, most of them reaching dissolution. Gradually, private economic agents appear on the market, which, together with services and trade, are beginning to shape a revival of the city's economy. With the "invasion" of hypermarkets, the city of Suceava is gradually transformed into a polarizing shopping center for the entire northern part of Moldova.

## 2.8. Socio-economic characteristics 13

The development of economic activities involves the generation of travel with a significant share in both the transport of people and the transport of goods (by ensuring the flow of raw materials, materials and finished products).

Covenant of Mayors

The main road network that connects Suceava Municipality with the component localities of the functional urban area and with the major urban centers of Romania consists of 4 highway segments, 8 European road segments and 6 county road segments. The connection between Suceava and localities in the functional urban area, such as Rădăuți and Fălticeni is ensured by the European road E85.

The European road E58 provides the connection with Botoșani, DN29A with Adâncata, Zvoriștea and Dorohoi, and DN17 with Stroiești, Iliești, Păltinoasa and Gura Humorului.

The road network is mainly arranged radially. The northwestern entrance to the city is by the E85 road, the north entrance by DN29A, the eastern entrance by E58, the southern one by E85, and the western one by DN17. Suceava has a bypass next to the localities of Șcheia and Sfântul Ilie DN2-DN17-DN2. Currently, there is a project idea for the eastern bypass of the municipality that would link DN2 with DJ 29 to Botoșani. The project is in the records of CNAIR and has an estimated value of 22.5 million EURO, to be implemented in the period 2024-2030.

The connections between the mentioned entry / exit points to the municipality are made by:

Sofia Vicoveanca Boulevard, on the southern side of the city
Humorului Street, on the western side of the city
Chernivtsi Street, on the western side of the city
Grigore Alexandru Ghica Street, on the NW direction
22 December 1989 Street, on the northern side of the city
Cuza Voda Street, on the eastern side of the city

The existing street plot consists of streets of different categories, from wide-profile streets to narrow streets. This situation has resulted from the development of the city during its history. Thus, the old part of the city has winding streets, with low geometric elements, which no longer correspond to the existing traffic values. To these were added new streets with wide cross-sections. There have also been arterial bypasses in the municipality, which ensure the diversion of transit traffic outside the city in all directions.

The road network includes Category II Streets (connecting roads, which provide major traffic between functional and residential areas), Category III Streets (collectors, which take traffic flows from functional areas and direct them to connecting streets), and IV (for local use, which provide access to housing and for regular or occasional services).

# Rail transport

Rail transport is a sector of major interest for Romania, including in the context of EU policies over the last 25 years to increase the modal share of rail transport. For the development of a competitive railway industry, the European Commission's efforts have focused on opening up rail transport to market competition, improving interoperability and safety in rail transport, and developing transport infrastructure.

The municipality of Suceava is connected to the European railway network TEN-T Core by the highway 500 (Bucharest, Ploiesti, Buzau, Focșani, Adjud, Roman, Pașcani, Suceava) which enters the municipality through the southeast and the highway 502 (Suceava - Vama - Floreni - Ilva mică) which enters the municipality through the west and is connected to line 500 between Suceava Nord and Suceava Burdujeni stations.

The Pașcani - Dărmănești section of line 500, a section with a double and single electrified line, which would be modernized in the period 2021-2025, is in the pending project phase. The railway connection with Ukraine is made on the Dărmănești - Vicșani section, a section with a simple non-electrified line, for which there is an electrification and modernization project in preparation, to be implemented in 2021-2025, according to the data from the General Transport Master Plan of Romania. The Vicșani - Vicșani Border line - simple non-electrified - is also in the project preparation phase for electrification and modernization for the period 2021-2025.

Highway 502 (Ilva Mică - Suceava), double and single electrified line is in the project phase waiting for modernization in the period 2025-2030. This would ensure the connection with Hungary on the route Ilva Mică - Dej - Cluj-Napoca - Oradea - Arad - Curtici - Border.

The connection with the Republic of Moldova is not ensured at present, the nearest destination being Ungheni, on the route Suceava-Verești - Dolhasca - Pașcani - Târgu Frumos - Iași - Ungheni Prut. The double electrified line Roman - Iași with connection Pașcani is in the project phase waiting for modernization in the period 2021-2025 according to the General Transport Master Plan of Romania.

To increase passenger traffic, the airport was closed between January 2014 and October 2015 for modernization and expansion. The concrete runway was paved and widened, a new control tower was built and an instrument landing system was introduced.

Suceava Airport is located in the city of Salcea, on the E58 road, at a distance of 12 km east of the city center and 30.5 km from the Botosani Municipality.

From the center of Suceava you can reach the airport by car or by public transport. The airport is not included in the coverage area of the local public transport, the company TRANS CM providing transport services at an interval of one hour, between 4:00 and 23:00, on route 171 (Obcini - Burdujeni Station - Airport). The journey by public transport from the city center to Suceava Airport is about an hour, compared to 20 minutes by car. The establishment of new public transport lines linking the airport to all neighborhoods of the municipality, would help to make it more accessible.

The 2020 SARS COV-2 pandemic has meant a significant reduction in international air traffic. In April 2020, after the quarantine was instituted in Suceava, most flights to and from Germany and England were cancelled.

The reduction of traffic at Suceava airport created, according to Suceava County Council, losses of 6 million lei. At the same time, the pandemic adaptation costs put additional pressure on the airport budget and it had to accept the state aid granted by the Romanian Government. The situation has improved during the summer season, due to the relaxation of traffic restrictions.

Despite the current context caused by the SARS COV-2 pandemic, the Suceava County Council has invested 3.3 million euros to expand the terminal with a space of 1,400 square meters to improve the airport's handling capacity to 300 passengers per hour. The airport will also continue to expand its parking lots and transport connections with Suceava by creating two access roads from Burdujeni and Dumbrăveni.

In spite of the challenges posed by the SARS COV-2 pandemic, Suceava International Airport is essential for the economic development of the North East Region. The airport can increase the mobility of the population in the area and the tourist potential, but a better connection with the city of Suceava is needed.

## Local public transport

In order to encourage citizens to use sustainable modes of transport, it is necessary to implement an efficient public transport network. In recent years, European cities have implemented a number of initiatives to increase the quality and frequency of public transport use, but so far there has been no significant reduction in the use of personal cars. Some air quality indicators have improved slightly, but greenhouse gas emissions from road transport have continued to rise steadily and many cities continue to exceed EU safety thresholds for pollution.

A higher percentage of the municipality's population compared to the national average is satisfied with the transport services in Suceava. Thus, 67% of the inhabitants of Suceava are satisfied with the public transport, 27% of the inhabitants declaring themselves very satisfied. A percentage of 6% of those interviewed stated that they are very dissatisfied with public transport in Suceava.

Following public consultations, it emerged that although all taxi dispatchers have mobile applications for taking orders (TIN Taxi, CIP Taxi), none of the taxi companies in Suceava operate accessible cars for people with disabilities. Better taxation legislation and drastic quality control methods (drastic penalties if taxi drivers are not fitted, if rides are refused, if taxis are not cleaned, etc.) as well as allowing alternative Uber-type transportation services to create competition, would contribute to raising the level of services provided.

## Intercity transportation

The intercity routes in Suceava County are operated by private operators licensed by ARR and were assigned to them by public tender by the Suceava County Council. They have more commercial activity than public passenger transport, without the application of the urban transport standards in force and the Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council on public passenger transport services by rail and by road and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) Nos 1191/69 and 1107/70.

According to the information provided by the Suceava County Council, the intercity routes that are connected with the Suceava Municipality are:

Forests of landscape interest around cultural monuments. This includes the forests around the Fortress of Suceava and the Zamca Fortress,
Forest strips around hotels, motels, tourist cabins,
Forests for the conservation and intensive development of game and recreation through hunting of special interest - Pătrăuți.

In residential areas, green spaces are represented by hedges and grassy areas.

## 2.11. Urban planning regulations

Increasing the energy performance of buildings is an action of major and general interest in the context of saving energy in buildings, improving the built urban environment and protecting the environment.

The energy performance of buildings is expressed by the following performance indicators:

energy class;
total specific energy consumption;
CO₂ equivalent emission index.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

The promotion of measures to increase the energy performance of buildings, taking into account the external climatic conditions and location, the requirements of indoor comfort in terms of costs, energy performance requirements, and to improve the urban appearance of localities is regulated by Law no. 372/2005 on the energy performance of buildings.

Thus, in accordance with the provisions of Law no. 372/2005 on the energy performance of buildings, new buildings, for which the reception at the end of the works is carried out starting with December 31, 2020, will be buildings with an energy consumption from conventional sources that is almost equal to zero. As an exception,
Suceava Municipality Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan
Covenant of Mayors

new buildings owned / managed by public administration authorities to be received after 31 December 2018 will be buildings with an energy consumption from conventional sources that is almost zero.

At the same time, following the review of its implementation, Directive 2010/31 / EU was amended in 2018 by Directive (EU) 2018/844, in order to accelerate the cost-effective renovation of existing buildings and the promotion of smart technologies in buildings. Under the Clean Energy Package, the revised Directive complements energy efficiency legislation. The aim of the Directive is to improve the energy performance of buildings in the EU, taking into account different climatic and local conditions.

EU countries need to set optimal minimum energy performance requirements. These should be reviewed every five years.

They must cover the building, its components and the energy used for:

heating the building;
cooling the building;
domestic hot water;
ventilation;
lighting;
other technical systems of the building.

Directive (EU) 2018/844 also requires EU countries to develop long-term renovation strategies to support the renovation of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, into a highly energy efficient and decarbonised building stock by 2050. Strategies shall set out a roadmap with measures and domestically established measurable progress indicators, taking into account the EU's 2050 long-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% compared to 1990.

The roadmap should include guidelines for 2030, 2040 and 2050 and specify how they contribute to the achievement of the EU's energy efficiency targets, in line with the Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU.

In addition, the revised directive:

extends the scope of the current inspection regime for heating and air conditioning systems to include combined (ventilated) systems and to take into account the performance of systems under typical operating conditions;
encourages the use of information and communication technologies and intelligent building automation and control technologies;
Suceava Municipality Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan
Covenant of Mayors

&gt; supports the launch of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles in the car parks of buildings by requesting the installation of ducting infrastructure and recharging points;
&gt; introduces a “smart readiness indicator” to assess the ability of buildings to adapt to occupant needs, optimize their functioning and interact with the network.¹⁹

The level of energy required for buildings with an energy consumption from conventional sources of almost zero, is established by technical regulations, differentiated by areas with potential from renewable energy sources and is regularly updated, depending on technical progress. In order to increase the energy performance of buildings and the transition to buildings with an energy consumption from conventional sources that is almost equal to zero, the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration, as the competent authority of the central administration, initiates normative acts promoting measures that are mainly aimed at:

&gt; adequate use of structural funds to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, especially housing;
&gt; efficient use of funds attracted from public financial institutions;
&gt; coordinating the use of European Union funds with national ones, in order to stimulate investments in energy efficiency, in order to achieve national objectives;
&gt; management of financial resources allocated from public funds for financing, in accordance with the law, the elaboration of technical-economic documentation, energy performance certificates, technical expertise reports and energy audit, as well as for the execution of major building renovation works included in programs to increase the energy performance of buildings.

Local government authorities may finance, within the limits of funds approved annually for this purpose in local budgets, the execution of major renovation works on residential buildings and buildings of public interest and utility, included in programs to increase the energy performance of buildings. Thermal rehabilitation can also be done from non-reimbursable sources, such as the Regional Operational Program.

Considering that ACET SA Suceava is in the evaluation phase of the project "Development of water and wastewater infrastructure in Suceava County" - the priority axis of the Large Infrastructure Operational Programme which was to be implemented in the period 2014-2020, it was estimated that at the end of the year 2020, all the residential areas of the municipality, both the existing ones and those provided by the urban plans elaborated by the Suceava municipality, would have a public water distribution infrastructure, as well as wastewater collection.

## Public sewerage system

Suceava has a predominantly unitary sewerage system for collecting and transporting domestic water and for receiving rainwater. Only in some areas, in the city center and in the Itcani and Burdujeni neighborhoods, rainwater from the catchment areas and domestic wastewater are collected in a separating / dividing system. The entire public sewer system is approximately 275 km long.

The wastewater collection system is divided by the Suceava River into two main collection areas. The part located south of the Suceava River (right bank of the river) collects wastewater from the city center and the Scheia neighborhood. The
Suceava Municipality Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan

Covenant of Mayors

network located north of the Suceava River (left bank of the river) collects wastewater from the Valea Suceava shopping area and partly from the Burdujeni and Itcani neighborhoods.

The sewer system includes:
the collector network,
two retention basins,
seven wastewater pumping stations,
Suceava treatment plant.

According to the information provided by the ACET company, the operating area of the company in Suceava, in 2015, includes the following categories of users:

the hot water pumping station in the thermal transport network stage I and II on the premises of SC Bioenergy SA,
the thermal transport networks belonging to SC Thermonet SA (Bioenergy-CT2 section) which ensure the connection between the thermal power plant and the concessioned networks with a length of 3.3 km. Two economic agents are supplied from this network,,
The concessioned thermal transport networks have a total length of pipes of 54.525 km located above ground in proportion of 31.93% of the total length, respectively 68.07% underground. They transport the thermal agent between CT2 and the thermal points.

The routes of the hot water transport networks are of the radial type, with transverse connections between the district heating systems to ensure the supply of consumers in safe and efficient conditions..

Of the total transport pipelines of 54.53 km total length:

23,87 km rehabilitated with pre-insulated pipes with damage monitoring wire,
30,66 km classic pipes with low efficiency insulation.

The thermal transport networks, owned by the Suceava Municipality are located both overhead - about 31.93% and underground - 68.07%. They are composed of steel pipes with diameters between Dn 500 and Dn 700, in a 44.56% pre-insulated system and respectively insulated with mineral wool mattresses (for pipes installed above ground) for 28.20% or 2 layers of bituminous fiberglass felt for pipes mounted in thermal ducts for 27.24%.

The transport system in the Suceava Municipality, concessioned by SC Thermonet SRL, includes the following lines in operation, as follows:

The Line between CT2 and the C1 bifurcation chamber of the I and II Lines, with 1xDn700 mm and 2xDn500mm pipes that supply 37 urban thermal substations (PT) under concession (16 PT fed from the I Line and 21 PT fed from the II Line) and 11 PTs from third parties with distribution own (DP),

Suceava Municipality Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan
Covenant of Mayors

The networks include:

bends or pipe segments, reductions for the modification of the transport section for the thermal agent,
steel flanged non rising stem gate valves, with manual actuation and after 2007 valves with spherical impeller were installed, and for diameters larger than 200 mm with actuator reduce
movable supports (with sliding, rolling or after rehabilitation E-Muff One time compensators) or fixed (with profiles embedded in the construction elements, with flanges and stop plates or concrete block with shield) that take over and transmit to the ground, through thermal channels, static and dynamic loads,
thermal insulation from mineral wool mattresses protected with black or galvanized sheet (for pipes installed above ground) for 28.20% or 2 layers of bituminous fiberglass felt for pipes mounted in thermal channels for 27.24%, respectively insulation related to pre-insulated pipes with polyurethane foam and protective jacket in a proportion of 44.56%, corresponding to a minimum temperature loss (for these pipes the insulation and sealing of the welded joints of the pipe ends is done with the help of sleeves of the same material as the mechanical protective jacket of the pipe insulation, as well as with the help of polyurethane foam injection installations),
construction elements (pillars, supports, thermal ducts, concrete chambers).

The thermal transport network supplies the following thermal substations:

11 thermal substations with their own distribution belonging to other institutions,
48 thermal substations operated by SC Thermonet SRL which supply apartments in block-type buildings, private houses, economic agents and municipal buildings.

In the thermal substations, the preparation of the thermal agent for heating and of the domestic hot water is performed using as primary agent the hot water from the thermal energy transmission system.

The existing thermal substations in Suceava Municipality operate, either according to direct schemes of connection to the two-tube transport system, or according to schemes with two-stage series connection for the preparation of hot water for consumption.

Currently, the buildings and equipment related to the 48 urban PTs are in operation of the centralized heat supply system in Suceava Municipality.

The current technical condition of the unrehabilitated thermal substations is unsatisfactory, mainly due to the age of the equipment and installations, between 24
Suceava Municipality Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan
Covenant of Mayors

and 50 years. Worn and obsolete, they operate with low efficiencies, are provided with minimum measurement and control installations (manometers, thermometers), very few of them being equipped with metering and automation installations. Many of the machines and equipment of the thermal substations have remained unchanged since commissioning, respectively heating circulation pumps, hot water pumps, add-on pumps, expansion system, etc.

Existing electric pumps have had a considerable service life, operate at low efficiencies of about 50%, which leads to high electricity consumption and low performance and they are not adequate to the characteristic of the distribution networks, modifiable by the installation of cost allocators at the level of the apartments in condominiums.

The secondary thermal networks related to the 48 Thermal Substations, with a total pipe length of 322 km are composed of 4 or 3 pipes::

two heating pipes,
a hot water supply pipe,
a hot water recirculation pipe.

These ensure the distribution of the heating medium and the domestic hot water from the heating substations to the final consumers.

The rehabilitation program of the transmission and distribution networks, as well as of the thermal substations in the Suceava Municipality, started in 2007 and was carried out as follows:

in 2007, 9 thermal substations were rehabilitated (indoor installations and related distribution networks) and the section C2 - C18 primary circuit networks (Line I),
in 2008, two thermal points were rehabilitated (indoor installations and related distribution networks),
in 2009, 5 thermal points were rehabilitated (indoor installations and related distribution networks) and 5.8 km route of primary circuit networks,
in 2010, 0.8 km of primary circuit networks were rehabilitated and modernization works were carried out at 2 thermal substations.

The secondary thermal networks are composed of 4 or 3 pipes (two for heating and one for domestic hot water, respectively for the rehabilitated areas there is also an a.c.c. recirculation pipe). These pipes have diameters between Dn15 and Dn300 and are usually located underground in thermal ducts. Their thermal insulation is made of mineral wool, protected with polyethylene foil or asphalted cardboard, or polyurethane foam insulation for the networks of 16 thermal substations. Their age is between 8 and 50 years.

Out of the total distribution pipes, only 38.45% were rehabilitated, and 253.71 km, respectively 62.55% are unrehabilitated pipes.

## 2.17. Economic profile 27

The development of Suceava municipality has seen a constant increase over time, it being closely linked to the evolution of demographic phenomena.

Through the status obtained in 1968, following the administrative-territorial reorganization of the country, the Suceava Municipality became a polarizing center of the area, developing at an accelerated pace, thanks to the policy of forced industrialization. The domestic and international economic and political situation after 1989 adversely affected the Suceava industry, causing the loss of markets, increasing competition through the penetration of imported products in traditional markets.

In the current economic context that the Suceava Municipality is going through, there is a tendency of dissolution of the industrial area in the Suceava river meadow, an area that is rapidly transforming into a commercial one and probably in the future a mixed residential-commercial area.

With the "invasion" of hypermarkets since 2003, the city of Suceava is gradually transformed into a polarizing shopping center for the entire northern part of Moldova.

On 31.12.2011, the total number of existing merchants on the territory of Suceava was 8 318, structured as follows:
&gt; 2 251 - natural person merchants,
&gt; 6 057 - legal person merchants,
&gt; 10 - co-operative society merchants.

According to the form of organization, the structure of merchants with headquarters in Suceava, on 31.12.2011 is as follows:
&gt; 129 - joint stock companies,
&gt; 5 890 - limited liability companies,
&gt; 33 - general partnerships,
&gt; 1 - limited partnerships,

Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan of Suceava Municipality

Covenant of Mayors

2 - autonomous administrations,
1 - credit union organization,
1 - agricultural cooperative,
2 251 - natural persons, family businesses or individuals.

The current economy of the municipality is based on trade, service activities, industry, agricultural activities, transport, tourism, construction.

The most important companies in terms of the number of employees as well as the turnover in 2007, in Suceava Municipality, are the following:

SC AMBRO - GRUP HOFFMAN SA - manufacture of cardboard and paper,
SC BETTY ICE SRL - food industry,
SC CONSUC SA - food industry,
SC EUROSPEED SRL - road transport of goods,
SC ACI - AG SRL - construction,
SC GENERAL CONSTRUCT SRL - construction,
SC FONTUR SRL - industrial products,
SC MONDECO SRL - waste processing,
IULIUS MALL - SHOPPING CITY SUCEAVA - commerce,
REAL HIPERMARKET - commerce,
SC MUSATINII SA - printing,
SC BERMAS SA - beer production,
SC DENIS SRL - footwear / leather production,
SC MOPAN SA - panification,
SC MUHA SRL - construction,
COMPLEX HOTELIER ZAMCA - tourism.

In 2007, the share of the number of companies active in economic activities is presented in the table below.

|  Activity sector | Share(%)  |
| --- | --- |
|  Agriculture, forestry and related services | 1.42  |

The largest number of active companies in Suceava Municipality, at the level of 2007, carried out activities in services (38.90%) and commerce (38.10%).

Regarding the industrial field, the following conclusions can be drawn at the level of Suceava municipality:

developing entrepreneurial culture, due to the existence of experts in the field of industrial activities,
the emergence in a fairly large number of SMEs with specific activities in the field of industrial activities,
high adaptability and flexibility of SMEs in this field to the new conditions and opportunities,
intensive development of the construction and commercial sectors, these areas being represented in a fairly high percentage of SMEs,
making large investments in the field of trade, due to the high potential of this field,
the paper and paper products manufacturing sector is developed at the city level.

## 2.18. Climate change

Climate change is leading to an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, rising global average temperatures, rising sea levels and shrinking ice caps. The main cause of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, reducing this phenomenon is a priority for all countries of the world.

To this end, our country has developed the National Climate Change Strategy 2013 - 2020, which:

aims to minimize the effects through actions of adaptation and mitigation to climate change;
explains and illustrates the two key components of the climate effort: that of preventing and combating the effects of climate change (through actions
Suceava Municipality Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan
Covenant of Mayors

aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions - GHG emissions) and that of adequate adaptation with minimal damage in the context created by climate change already underway;

provides essential data and information on climate changes that have affected and will affect Romania;
presents data and information relevant at a general level regarding the contribution of each sector to GHG emissions and the way in which human activity (through production or consumption / use processes), together with natural processes lead to these emissions;
proposes types of key measures to be implemented in each sector to reduce GHG emissions and to adapt to the effects of climate change;
briefly describes the global situation, which calls for consistent policies to prevent and combat climate change and its effects;
provides guidance on the measures and policies to be adopted, using the European Structural and Investment Funds for the financial years 2014-2020. The European Commission has considered this document mandatory in the preparation of the Partnership Agreement for the absorption of EU funds 2014-2020;
reviews the main action programs at national level with impact in the field of climate change in different sectors: industry, transport, forestry, agriculture, urban, etc.;
substantiates the principles that will be the basis for the elaboration of action plans and programs at a sectoral level, establishes the general and specific objectives that will have to be achieved through future measures and actions, established according to the concrete specifics of each sector.

Conceived as a dynamic document, reflecting a constantly changing reality, the Climate Change Strategy will be developed and completed along the way, with the support and experience of a group of World Bank experts. Thus, in the autumn of 2015, the National Strategy on Climate Change was extended, so that, until 2050, it will cover a wider horizon, but keeping two major benchmarks: 2020 and 2030.

This strategy will become a benchmark for Romania's "green growth", i.e. economic development based on low greenhouse gas emissions.

The strategy will be strengthened on the basis of a macroeconomic assessment, based on sectoral and cross-sectoral impact modeling. It will assess in detail the prospects, options, costs and benefits of the measures to be applied for Romania to ensure a solid and sustainable development in the medium and long term, in the conditions of major obligations to prevent and combat climate change.

Also, the Strategy will be implemented on the basis of a concrete plan, which will include actions, deadlines, specific responsibilities for each sector and institution, but also criteria and indicators for assessing how the objectives have been met.²⁸

Regional and local climate change will affect ecosystems, human settlements and infrastructure. Changes in temperature and forecast rainfall can lead to changes in vegetation periods and changes in the boundaries between forests and pastures. Some extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts, floods and the like will be more frequent, with increased intensity and consequently higher risks for significant associated damage.

For international decision-makers, global warming raises two major concerns:

the need to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in order to reduce the anthropogenic influence on the natural climate system;
the need to promote policies and measures to adapt to the foreseeable effects of climate change, mainly due to the inertia of the climate system.

During the first decade of this century, Romania faced a series of extreme meteorological phenomena, which determined both the production of floods and the appearance of dry areas:

in 2005 - the historical floods produced on the inland rivers, caused both the loss of 76 human lives and great material damage;
in 2006 - the historical floods that took place on the Romanian sector of the Danube as well as the floods produced on the inland rivers caused, again, important material damages;;
in 2007 - the worst drought in the last 60 years.

The areas affected by the drought have expanded in recent decades and the most affected areas are those located in southern and southeastern Romania. Over the last 30 years, the effects of droughts have become more and more frequent and extended in time and space throughout the country. Extreme weather, floods and droughts result in both loss of life and significant economic losses in all sectors of activity, such as agriculture, transportation, energy supply, water management and the like, and global climate patterns indicate that that the frequency and intensity of these events will increase.²⁹

In Romania, an average annual heating of the same magnitude as the one projected at European level is estimated, between $0.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, for the period 2020 - 2029 and between $2.0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and $5.0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for 2090 - 2099, depending on the scenario approached. From the point of view of precipitation, over $90\%$ of the models used, project in Romania, for the period 2090 - 2099, the production of severe droughts in summer.

These medium- and long-term weather forecasts justify the call for immediate action by decision-makers involving:

monitoring the impact of climate change as well as the associated social and economic vulnerability;
integrating measures to adapt to the effects of climate change into development strategies and policies at sectoral level, as well as harmonizing these measures with each other;
identifying urgent measures to adapt to the effects of climate change in critical socio-economic sectors.

In the field of energy, due to the effect of climate change, the demand for energy for winter heating is expected to decrease as a result of the increase in the global average temperature, which will not compensate, however, for the increase in energy consumption required for the operation of air conditioners and coolers on hot days.

One of the most urgent directions of action in the context of climate change is the adaptation of the built-up living space. Given the growing number of people living in cities affected by climate change, urban planning and development must be a priority. A measure of adaptation to climate change for the built space is to correct
Suceava Municipality Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan

Covenant of Mayors

existing construction standards and norms so that they correspond to future climatic conditions and extreme weather events. Another measure to adapt to the effects of climate change is to introduce more efficient heating and cooling systems and to inform the urban population about the risks of climate change.

In the transport sector, in addition to sustainable transport infrastructure, means of transport must also be adapted or designed to be resilient to the effects of climate change. The promotion of alternative transport such as walking or cycling, adaptable to existing infrastructure can be achieved by reorganizing the urban space.

The climatic scenarios for the period 2080 - 2099, compared to 1980 - 1999, indicate a considerable warming, and in the period 2080 - 2099 no temperatures of  $0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  will be reached. The highlighted climate models indicate a high degree of aridity, and for August, in the period 2020 - 2039, this index even reaches values characteristic of the type of arid climates.

Equally important is monitoring the impact of climate change in priority sectors, namely:

Industry
Agriculture and Fisheries
Tourism
Public health
Constructions and Infrastructure
Transportation
Water resources and flood protection
Forests
Energy
Biodiversity
Insurance
Recreational activities
Education.

The main effects and threats posed by climate change – including extreme events – heat waves, droughts, floods, and the like – must be identified and quantified for each of these priority sectors, and at the same time opportunities must be identified to adapt these sectors to the effects of climate change which can be significant and which are often overlooked by decision makers.

## ACTUAL ORGANIZATION OF WORKING MEETINGS

On 28.04.2022, the list of the 100 cities selected following the completion of the selection process under the Horizon Europe Program, Smart and Climate Neutral Cities Mission - 100 Climate Neutral Cities by 2030 was announced. Thus, Suceava was selected as one of the 100 cities that will become climate neutral by 2030 out of 377 cities from all EU Member States and nine associated countries and negotiating associations that submitted applications.

The next step is for each participating city to draw up, sign and implement the Climate City Contract. The contracts will set out plans for the city to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 and will include an investment plan. These will be created together with local stakeholders (consulting firms, private sector, academic sector, civil society) and citizens, with the help of a Mission Platform (which is led in the first phase of the Mission by the NetZeroCities project).

By joining the EU Mission, the municipality of Suceava aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase local energy efficiency and improve the quality of life in Suceava.

In the framework of the consultancy services contract for the implementation of the "100 Climate Neutral Cities by 2030" mission of the Horizon Europe program, the consultant SC URBAN SCOPE SRL moderated and prepared the working meetings with the members of the Local Group, together with the project team of the Municipality of Suceava.

The reason for the involvement of the consultancy team in the organization of these initial meetings is to facilitate in a more efficient way the transfer of knowledge and experience in the field of implementation of the favorable actions. The delegated consultant team has extensive experience in strategic planning documents and consultations on different themes, so the involvement from the organizational phase has added to the quality of the proposed activities.

Following discussions between the project team from Suceava City Hall and the consultants from SC URBAN SCOPE SRL, a clear schedule for the working groups was established. These meetings were held over two days and each meeting lasted approximately one hour and thirty minutes. Each working group was based on the themes agreed between the contracting authority and the consultants, and the order of the working groups was set so that each day touched on all the pillars being considered to bring the Municipality of Suceava closer to fulfilling its mission.

The working groups have been named according to the theme as follows: Energy efficiency in public and residential buildings; Alternative energy; Public lighting; Public transport and traffic; Waste management; Water management; Public spaces; Cultural/social/financial/institutional systems.

The initial meetings were held at the Suceava City Hall, where the relevant local actors were previously invited by official addresses to outline the vision that the Municipality of Suceava must address in order to achieve the objectives assumed in the Mission. The meetings took place between 02-03.11.2022, and in order to efficiently summarize the way the initial Working Groups' activity was carried out, we present the following centralizing table:

|  Group name | Group type | Starting date TIME:  |

# 1 Introduction

Suceava Municipality recognizes the urgent need to address the global climate changes/challenges and minimize its impact on communities, the economy and the environment. It is recognized that the local community is currently contributing to this crisis through greenhouse gas emissions from transport, buildings, waste and other sources.

As a signatory of the Covenant of Mayors, Suceava municipality has developed a strategy to reach climate neutrality in the shape of a strategical document entitled “Sustainable energy and climate action plan of Suceava municipality 2021-2030”. The SECAP is a programmatic and strategic document that defines the actions and measures that will be taken at local level, in order to achieve the overall goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 55% by 2030, compared to the reference year chosen (2015).

Suceava Municipality is a public administration institution responsible for local infrastructure, heating, public lighting, public transport, culture, public spaces, green areas, social activities, education, utilities and has a budget of 203.229.064 Euro/year (related to 2023).

In the past 15 years there were many investment projects in the field of energy efficiency (public and private buildings), alternative heating production (biomass), rehabilitation of public lighting (LED systems), education buildings, public transport (100% electric fleet), alternative vehicles (electric municipal fleet, charging stations for EV’s – with incentives for charging also for private owners), traffic management, cycling lanes, electric bicycles and scooters, rehabilitation of central heating system, separate waste collection and recycling system, rehabilitation of the water and sewage system, green areas, rehabilitation of pedestrian (low emission zone), road infrastructure, city ring. Suceava Municipality recognizes the urgent need to address the global climate crisis and minimize its impact on communities, the economy and the environment. It is recognized that the local community is currently contributing to this crisis through greenhouse gas emissions from transport, buildings, waste and other sources. The municipality's commitment to its responsibility to mitigate climate change is to achieve climate neutrality in terms of climate impact by 2030, and to meet this goal reduction in local greenhouse gas emissions is required.

On its pathway to become a "green city", with previous achievements like being the first Romanian city with a municipal electric fleet, charging facilities and incentives for electric vehicles, first and only (so far) Romanian city with 100% electric public transport, Suceava City sees the Climate City Contract and Net Zero Cities Mission as the perfect opportunity to continue its efforts and accelerate the implementation of specific actions that will create the local conditions to reach the climate neutrality goals.

City vision: A Resilient Future for Suceava: Embracing Sustainability

Suceava City envisions itself as a thriving green metropolis by 2030, as being a city where:

Clean air and vibrant green spaces replace the haze of pollution, fostering a healthy environment for generations to come.
Renewable energy powers the city, minimizing its carbon footprint and displaying its commitment to a sustainable future.
Efficient transportation systems, with robust public options and emphasis on walking and cycling, create a more liveable and connected city.
Sustainable practices become the norm, embedded in everyday life from waste management to energy consumption.

Suceava City Challenges and the Stakes: However, the path to this vision is not without its challenges. Climate change poses a real threat, affecting Suceava’s environment, economy, and overall well-being. Rising temperatures, increased air pollution, and extreme weather events are all potential consequences if action is not taken. Beyond the environmental concerns, the people of Suceava worry about the city's long-term prosperity and its ability to attract future generations. They aspire for a city that offers a high quality of life, economic opportunities, and a sense of connection to its rich cultural heritage.

The Climate City Contract (CCC): A Catalyst for Change: The Climate City Contract (CCC) serves as a powerful catalyst for Suceava's ambitions, both climate-centric and beyond. It provides a framework for collaboration and resource mobilization, accelerating the city's existing commitments to sustainability. Suceava
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

already boasts a significant foundation of successful sustainability initiatives, including its 100% electric public transport fleet.

The CCC builds upon these achievements by:

Amplifying Suceava's City voice on the global stage: The city gains access to a network of like-minded communities, fostering knowledge sharing and best practice exchange.
Attracting resources and investment: Participation in the CCC opens doors to funding and partnerships, accelerating the implementation of Suceava's ambitious goals.
Boosting innovation and collaboration: The CCC fosters collaboration between public and private stakeholders, encouraging the development of innovative solutions for a sustainable future.

The CCC goes beyond just climate change, contributing to Suceava's broader vision for the future. By promoting sustainable practices and resource efficiency, the city can:

Reduce its dependence on external energy sources, making it more resilient and economically secure.
Position itself as a leader in sustainability, attracting investment and talent, particularly within the green economy sector.
Enhance the overall quality of life for residents, creating a healthier and more vibrant city.

Suceava's City story is one of resilience, community spirit and a commitment to shaping a brighter future. By embracing sustainability as a core value and leveraging the opportunities offered by the CCC, Suceava City can ensure a thriving green metropolis for generations to come.

This vision, born from a collective desire for a cleaner, healthier future, ignited a spark within the community. It fuelled the creation of Suceava's Climate Action Plan, a roadmap towards becoming a Net Zero City. This plan, far from being a mere document, is a testament to the city's commitment, a story of collective action, innovation, and the unwavering belief in a brighter tomorrow.

Recognizing their contribution to the global climate challenge, the people of Suceava, along with their dedicated municipality, embarked on a journey of transformation. They acknowledged the reality – greenhouse gas emissions from various sources, including transportation, buildings, and waste, were contributing to the environmental crisis.

Fuelled by the success of previous initiatives, like becoming the first Romanian city with a 100% electric public transport fleet, Suceava saw the Climate City Contract and Net Zero Cities Mission as the perfect opportunity to accelerate their progress. The municipality, acting as a facilitator and coordinator, embarked on a collaborative journey, bringing together diverse stakeholders - residents, businesses, experts, and public officials - to co-create the action plan.

This collaborative spirit permeated every step of the process. Public consultations and workshops ensured that the plan addressed the community's needs and concerns directly. The voices and suggestions of citizens became the foundation for identifying and designing projects, ensuring the plan was not just top-down, but truly representative of the collective vision.

The resulting action plan lays out a clear roadmap towards achieving climate neutrality by 2030. It outlines ambitious yet achievable goals, like reducing CO2 emissions by 80,66% compared to the 2021 baseline. This ambitious target is not an unreachable obstacle but a call to action, a shared responsibility embraced by the entire community. Suceava's story is not just about numbers and targets; it is about the unwavering spirit of a community united in pursuit of a shared vision. It's a testament to the power of collective action and the belief that even the most challenging goals can be achieved when a community comes together, united by hope and a desire to create a better future for generations to come.

The CCC has opened a door to a multitude of opportunities for Suceava:

Accelerating Existing Sustainability Initiatives: The CCC provides a platform for amplifying Suceava's existing efforts in areas like clean energy, sustainable transportation and waste management. The city can leverage the CCC framework to attract resources, expertise and partnerships, accelerating the implementation of its vision.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Boosting Innovation and Green Technologies: The collaborative spirit of the CCC fosters an environment for knowledge sharing and innovation. Suceava can learn from other cities and adapt successful green technologies to its specific context. This collaborative approach accelerates the development and implementation of innovative solutions, pushing the boundaries of what is possible.
Enhancing the City's Profile and Attracting Investment: By actively participating in the CCC, Suceava positions itself as a global leader in sustainability. This enhanced reputation attracts investment and talent, particularly within the green economy sector, further fuelling the city's sustainable transformation.

Building a Strong Foundation for Collaboration: Suceava already boasts a strong foundation for climate action, built upon the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders:

Municipal Leadership: The city's leadership has demonstrated a strong commitment to sustainability, actively spearheading initiatives and fostering collaboration among stakeholders.
Engaged Citizens: Suceava residents are passionate about the environment and actively participate in public consultations and workshops, shaping the city's sustainability agenda.
Local Businesses and Organizations: Businesses and organizations in Suceava are increasingly integrating sustainability practices into their operations, contributing to the city's overall progress.

This collaborative ecosystem, nurtured by the CCC, empowers Suceava City to effectively address climate challenges and work collectively towards a greener future. Through this united effort, Suceava aims to become a shining example of a city that prioritizes both environmental stewardship and community well-being.

The Climate City Contract's preparation was based on adapting EU trends, strategic directions and policies to the specific local context, the whole process being a co-participatory one: although the Municipality coordinated the implementation of the Action Plan, the document was developed by constantly consulting the local stakeholders, because they are the NZC Coalition's pillars. During the design phase for Action Plan leading staff and public servant from Suceava Municipality had several technical meetings with experts that are part of the project team in order to establish and define the future common actions to be implemented by Suceava Municipality on the road to climate neutrality. Following discussions between the project team from Suceava City Hall and the consultants, a clear schedule for the working groups was established. Each working group was based on its themes agreed between the contracting authority and the consultants, and the order of the working groups was set so that each day touched on all the pillars being considered to bring the Municipality of Suceava closer to fulfilling its mission. The results from the public survey were presented during each workshop, were discussed with the stakeholders and consist the baseline for identification and design of the projects proposed to be included in the Action Plan. The projects/actions were defined in accordance with citizens' needs/comments/suggestions and the actions are directly linked with the problems identified directly by citizens. Thus, all stakeholders will be called upon to support and work together to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

The municipality has an important role to play in leading the local climate transition towards the goal set by joining the 100 Smart and Climate Neutral Cities Mission by 2030. The role that Suceava will play in the coming period is to become the initiator of the decarbonisation process at local level by providing a concrete example of best practice, thus being the first city to commit to involving most of the local stakeholders in the climate transition process. The actual organization and management of this ambitious process will follow an open approach towards the general public and all stakeholders, so that the focus is on dialogue and collaboration between stakeholders, both through public consultation and information gathering from all sectors of interest, providing opportunities for involvement in an equitable and participatory governance.

VISION: Suceava City in 2030 is a metropolis running largely on renewable energy sources, with a fully decarbonized transport infrastructure, efficient and environmentally friendly public transport, occupied by buildings built to high-energy efficiency standards, quality green spaces, a local circular economy focused on sustainable goods and services and an integrated and efficient waste management system.

Overall, it is important that all stakeholders work together to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Taking an integrated approach, combining policies, clean technologies and innovations as well as individual actions, can lead to significant emission reductions.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Within the framework of existing local strategic documents and their integration and further development to a raised ambition towards the Mission in the CCC process, the Municipality of Suceava acts as a, light house, city with innovative, ambitious and integrated initiatives that approach reduction of energy consumption and GHG emissions.

Achieving climate neutrality in a city requires a commitment to reduce GHG emissions as much as possible, for example through the use of renewable energy resources to replace fossil fuels, while offsetting those residual emissions which are too hard to eradicate.

To become a climate neutral city, the following steps are planned:

Carrying out a greenhouse gas inventory to establish where emissions and their values come from;
Developing a climate action plan setting out the strategies and actions needed to reduce emissions; the plan must be aligned with the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development;
Reducing energy consumption - increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, implementing smart grids and promoting alternative means of travel (electric public transport, walking, cycling, etc.);
Increase production and promotion of renewable energy and clean vehicles;
Offsetting carbon emissions - any remaining carbon emissions should be offset by investing in green projects (reforestation, carbon capture and storage, etc.);
Involving stakeholders (residents, businesses, public administration, etc.) collaborating on the implementation of initiatives and promoting a culture of sustainability and sustainable development.

Suceava's city story is not just about numbers and targets but it is about the unwavering spirit of a community united in pursuit of a shared vision. It's a testament to the power of collective action and the belief that even the most challenging goals can be achieved when a community comes together, united by hope and a desire to create a better future for generations to come.

According to the actions included in the Action Plan the overall goal is the reducing CO2 emissions with 80,66% by 2030, compared to the reference year chosen (2021).

## 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

In 2018 the city of Suceava committed to implementing EU climate and energy objectives by joining The EU Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy. As part of this commitment, Suceava Municipality has developed a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan in order to meet until 2030 the targets proposed by the European Union for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by more than 55% compared to the emissions generated in the administrative territory, taking into account the reference year 2015. According to the actions included in the Action Plan the overall goal is the reducing CO2 emissions with 80,66% by 2030, compared to the reference year chosen (2021).

According to the Climate Action Plan Suceava Municipality's general objective is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to improve existing energy performance or to develop buildings, utilities, equipment and technologies with high energy efficiency, including renewable sources. Suceava Municipality has as strategic objective the approach of social and economic performances achieved by other municipalities within the European Union, by implementing policies that contribute to raising the standard of living and the level of civilization of the local community. This is also the main purpose of the European Union's non-reimbursable financial support for improving energy efficiency.

Based on measured included, the targets assumed and the integrated approach the specific objectives/goals of the Climate City Contract for Suceava Municipality are the following:

Increasing the energy performance of public and residential buildings in order to improve thermal comfort, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption;
Increasing the energy efficiency of the public district heating system in order to comply with environmental standards on atmospheric emissions;
Sustainable energy development of Suceava City in order to increase energy efficiency, efficient use of resources, increase the share of renewable resources, increase the production of energy from alternative sources and environment protection specific issues.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Increasing the energy efficiency of the public lighting system in order to reduce GHG emissions, increase traffic safety, reduce costs and increase the quality of the system;
Improving public transport and smart mobility in order to ensure a safer and more efficient urban transport and reduce traffic GHG emissions;
Sustainable urban development of Suceava City (with specific and integrated approach on green areas, waste recycling and management, circular economy) in order to increase the quality of life at local level;
Increase, develop and extend the partnership between local administration, academic and private sectors and increase the engagement of local stakeholder for local climate neutral actions, encourage changing behaviour and increase the acceptance for public administration investment projects;

According to the Integrated Urban Development Strategy of Suceava Functional Urban Area 2021-2030 (who’s objected were included in the City Climate Contract and aligned with Mission goals), a wide range of objectives and associated measures were identified, which were adapted to the local context and development priorities of Suceava and its functional urban area.

Strategic objectives related to the specific objectives are as follows:

A. Green and resilient city: Sustainable Urban Mobility/ Energy Neutrality /Reducing Air Pollution and Climate Risk
B. Competitive and productive city: Quality public infrastructure, Capitalization of land and buildings for strategic investments, Encouraging innovation, start-ups and skilled labour
C. Well-governed city: Digitization of Public Administration. Reducing bureaucracy and adapting services to the needs of the citizen
D. A fair and inclusive city: Easy access for all to public services, Involvement of civil society and citizens in urban development

Another important aspect regarding the city’s overall vision that should be mentioned is that our municipality takes into account combating energy poverty and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions upon different neighbourhoods and social groups.

These targets, included into the Climate City Contract, were approved with Local Council Decision no. 309/31.08.2023.

Targets assumed by Suceava Municipality, in accordance and aligned with the Mission goals are:

The general targets proposed for achieving climate neutrality by 2030 for the Municipality of Suceava are:
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

0

Strategic Objective (SO) 1 – By 2030, Suceava will have an urban mobility based predominantly on alternative, clean urban mobility.

Strategic Objective (SO) 2 – The economic environment in all sectors (energy, transport, agriculture, industry, etc.) in Suceava will implement innovative measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that will contribute to reducing CO2 emissions.

Strategic Objective (SO) 3 – The Suceava community will adopt practices to reduce energy consumption, increase energy efficiency and increase individual carbon footprints that will contribute to reduction in electricity and heat consumption

Strategic Objective (SO) 4 – Suceava public administration will be a national model and a local leader in promoting sustainable urban development

Strategic Objective (SO) 5 – Circular economy will be a basic practice for both the development of the city through projects implemented by the municipality, the private sector and for each inhabitant of Suceava that will lead to a decrease of greenhouse gas emissions

Strategic Objective (SO) 6 – Suceava academic environment will be a source of inspiration for the community in terms of innovation and technology in addressing measures and projects to reduce CO2 emissions.

The goals included in the Climate City Contract are covering (in an integrated vision and overall approach) the entire goals and ideas included in the already local approved strategic documents (local development strategy, sustainable urban mobility plan, sustainable energy action plan) as the Action Plan is acting like an "umbrella strategic document", for the entire city territory with a strategic, sustainable approach aimed at achieving objectives that determine the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions mainly (and as a tangible result from implementation of the actions) but more important with a direct effect on local economic development, improving the quality of life, creating strategic partnerships between local stakeholders and local administration and direct benefits for each single citizen (with connections to public transport, smart mobility, energy efficiency, heating, alternative energy and waste recycling), for public administration in relationship with common initiatives with academic and private sector for research, innovation and sustainable projects/actions and for any other local stakeholder included in the local Net Zero Coalition.

Local stakeholders (especially citizens) have been approach and included into the development phase of projects concerning for example residential buildings rehabilitation, green areas that are included in the Action Plan. These working groups (based on local city decision) will also work together with the municipality's transition team in the implementation and evaluation phases of each specific project.

Within its efforts to engage stakeholders and citizens to local actions related to climate neutrality another initiative (linked with city hall website) was launched in the second half of 2023, called Centre for Innovation and Civic Imagination (CIIC) with the main objective as increasing the degree of citizen involvement in the process of adopting and applying decisions of public interest, but also increasing citizens' trust in local administration. Thus, the framework is created for defining the active role of the citizen, respectively the transmission of ideas, proposals and suggestions in the development and implementation of public projects especially the ones included in the Action Plan. Each single action/project progress, direct results and achievements will be transmitted, analysed and evaluate together with local stakeholders (especially citizens) in order to ensure a better, real and accurate understanding and finally acceptance for proposed measures and for the impact against economic, social and ecological co-benefits both for the quality of life into the city and for each individual benefit. Public debates will be held on various topics of interest, in which representatives from various fields of activity will participate, such as: education, health, social assistance, infrastructure, environmental protection, public administration, culture, local councillors of Suceava City Council, employees from Suceava City Hall, representatives of civil society and the business environment and other interested factors.

At the same time, CIIC plays an essential role in reinvigorating the civic and initiative spirit of citizens, increase transparency and long-term strategic local planning with results on improving the performance of local public administration. The Centre is a permanent laboratory in which various forms of collaboration between relevant
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

local actors in the municipality are developed. It will also test new ideas and innovative projects, aiming to use the creative potential of the Suceava community to develop urban innovation policies and implement the measure that conduct to climate neutrality.

The internal Municipality’s transition team includes public servants with experience in management, finance, technical, evaluation, publicity and dissemination. There are regular meetings with all involved persons: once per week in the presence of leading staff, at least twice per month with representatives from construction companies and private operators (if necessarily) and also anytime when it is required for the smooth implementation of the projects.

All these ambitions mentioned above are expected to generate real, significant, measurable changes /improvement of the life quality in Suceava city and radically reduce GHG emissions. On the roadmap for transformation of these priorities from strategy to reality, all the local stakeholders will be involved actively and responsible for achieving the climate neutrality efforts. Thus, depending on their individual expertise, all the signatory stakeholders will contribute to fulfilling the strategic interventions mentioned above. They will provide expertise to the municipality and will be co-involved in various local projects (together with specific stakeholders and Municipality) that will lead to achieving the assumed climate neutrality.

## 4 Principles and process

The municipality has an important role to play in leading the local climate transition towards the goal set by joining the 100 Smart and Climate Neutral Cities Mission by 2030.

The role that Suceava will play in the coming period is to become the initiator of the decarbonisation process at local level by providing a concrete example of best practice, thus being the first city to commit to involving most of the local stakeholders in the climate transition process.

The actual organization and management of this ambitious process will follow an open approach towards the general public and all stakeholders, so the focus is on dialogue and collaboration between stakeholders, both through public consultation and information gathering from all sectors of interest, providing opportunities for involvement in an equitable and participatory governance.

As part of the implementation process, at least the following aspects need to be considered:

Integrated Communication Strategy
Create the appropriate local conditions for implementation of the Action Plan
Early start for projects implementation and permanent innovation
Increase the National level of cooperation
Working together at European level
Monitoring the implementation of the Action Plan

Suceava Municipality and the other two municipalities that are part of the mission in Romania will benefit from the implementation of the project „NetZeRoCities – National Centre for Competencue and solutions for developing climatic neutral smart cities” that started in 2023. The consortium coordinating NetZero Cities is composed of universities, public institutions, independent experts, private companies with the main objective: providing a sustainable, predictable and streamlined environment for the development of research, development and innovation activities with a focus on contributing to climate change and the digital transition.

The aim is to support access to funding, increase the innovation capacity of the RDI system to create synergies between research and business, and create the critical mass of interdisciplinary skills needed to address the societal challenges associated with the EU Climate Change Mission and it is a networking tool of excellence to increase the chances of success in the EU Climate Change Mission and the Carbon Neutrality objective.

The process of developing and monitoring a portfolio of climate neutrality projects (included into the Action Plan) can be divided into several steps:

Identify the current situation: The first step is to identify the current situation of the city's carbon footprint and energy consumption. This may involve analysing existing data or conducting research studies. This step can provide an overview of the city's environmental impact and help identify areas for improvement/intervention.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Setting targets: Once the current situation is known, the next step is to set targets for reducing carbon emissions. These targets should be ambitious but realistic and aligned with global or national climate change commitments.

Determine the key actions that need to be taken: Once targets are set, it is important to determine the key actions that need to be taken to achieve the targets. These actions can be soft (e.g. awareness and education campaigns), medium (e.g. energy efficiency projects) or hard (e.g. investment in renewable energy or electric transport projects). This stage should include an analysis of the costs and benefits of each action and an assessment of the impact on the objectives set.

Prioritize projects: Once key actions have been identified, it is important to prioritize them according to their impact, feasibility and cost. This can help to identify the actions with the greatest potential to contribute to the achievement of the objectives without exceeding the allocated budget.

Measuring and monitoring progress: Once projects are implemented, it is important to monitor and measure progress. This can be done through relevant performance indicators such as carbon emissions or energy consumption. It is also important to monitor the budget and time allocated to each project.

How to involve stakeholders: During the process of developing and monitoring a portfolio of climate neutrality projects, it is important to involve stakeholders such as the local community, the private sector, local government and non-governmental organizations. This helps to create a framework for collaboration and to increase the involvement of all stakeholders in making decisions that lead to the achievement of the agreed objectives.

The main purpose of participating in this project is to benefit from the knowhow of the team members, to transfer the best practice example (already implemented by some of the project members), to identify, adapt and implement pilot projects in Suceava, replicate the existing ones from other Romanian cities. Suceava city will to benefit from academic and technic knowledge of the project team members and more than this the issue of transferring the best practical solution for increasing the citizen’s/stakeholders involvement into the implementation of Action Plan will be approach.

In the framework of the consultancy services contract for the implementation of the "100 Climate Neutral Cities by 2030" mission of the Horizon Europe program, the consultant moderated and prepared the working meetings with the members of the Local Group, together with the project team of the Municipality of Suceava.

The main reason for involvement of the stakeholders is to facilitate in a more efficient way the transfer of knowledge and experience in the field of implementation of the favourable actions. Both Suceava Municipality’s team and consultant team have extensive experience in strategic planning documents and consultations on different themes, so the involvement and cooperation from the implementation phase will add value.

Following discussions between the project team from Suceava Municipality and the consultants, a clear schedule for the working groups was established.

These meetings were held over two days and each meeting lasted approximately one hour and thirty minutes. Each working group was based on the themes agreed between the contracting authority and the consultants, and the order of the working groups was set so that each day touched on all the pillars being considered to bring the Municipality of Suceava closer to fulfilling its mission.

The working groups have been named according to the theme as follows: Energy efficiency in public and residential buildings; Alternative energy; Public lighting; Public transport and traffic; Waste management; Water management; Public spaces; Cultural / social / financial / institutional systems.

Public consultation: The online questionnaire is a practical and effective method of obtaining feedback from a large number of respondents in a structured way that can be easily interpreted in analysis. The present questionnaire was completed by 534 inhabitants of Suceava Municipality and aimed to understand the existing situation in the field of climate impact as seen by citizens. The instrument applied determines an overview of the perception and behaviour of citizens regarding climate impact, which contributes to the decision maker regarding future actions to protect the environment.

Apart of the public consultation process from the design phase for the climate contract more public surveys are planned to be done in implementation phase for most relevant and with major impact actions (like the already organised ones concerning energy efficiency in public and residential buildings, smart &amp; sustainable mobility,
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

electric public transport for metropolitan area) and more important during evaluation phase of the projects. This is meant to continue the process of local stakeholders (citizens also) involvement in the mission process having as a direct result the feedback regarding the results, the achievements and also regarding the suggestion for improvements/upgrade of the proposed actions.

Local stakeholders (especially citizens) have been approach and included into the design phase of projects concerning for example residential buildings rehabilitation, green areas that are included in the Action Plan. Designated work groups have been established (with representatives from civil society, public institutions, university, architects, local experts), public surveys and public consultation (including meetings with residents from the buildings that are subject of future interventions) with a specific objective of increase the acceptance of citizens in the actions that the city is taking for its pathway to climate neutrality. These working groups (based on local city mayor decision) will also work together with the municipality's transition team in the implementation and evaluation phases of each specific project.

Within its efforts to engage stakeholders and citizens to local actions related to climate neutrality another initiative (linked with city hall website) was launched in the second half of 2023, called Centre for Innovation and Civic Imagination with the main objective as increasing the degree of citizen involvement in the process of adopting and applying decisions of public interest, but also increasing citizens' trust in local administration. Thus, the framework is created for defining the active role of the citizen, respectively the transmission of ideas, proposals and suggestions in the development and implementation of public projects especially the ones included in the Action Plan.

The internal management teams (for each project) includes public servants with experience in management, finance, technical, evaluation, publicity and dissemination. There are regular meetings with all involved persons once per week in the presence of leading staff, at least twice per month with representatives from construction companies and private operators (if necessarily) and also anytime when it is required for the smooth implementation of the projects. Apart of this for the final evaluation for each project a service contract is required with an external expert that has to evaluate and certify the project impact. Additional to these aspects in order to ensure a good control in the implementation and to ensure the monitoring and reporting of activities assumed by the Action Plan, specialized structure composed of members with experience in energy efficiency, key people from various departments of the local authority, interested local actors, stakeholders are organized and will be active in the implementation phase for projects included in Action Plan.

Suceava Municipality has a special designated transition team that is responsible for managing the entire process of Climate City Contract implementation, monitoring, evaluation and review. The team is composed of experts from different complementary departments within Suceava City Hall: Financial Department, Investment Department, European Projects Department, Legal Department, Urban Strategies Service, Public Procurement Service, Green Areas Directorate, Energy and local utilities Office, Owner Association and Residential Buildings Service, IT Department, Waste Management Department (Urban Energy Manager is it expected to join the team from 2024). The team is open for new members that will be able to join anytime in the next 7 years and it is coordinated by is under the coordination of the European Projects, Investment, Strategy and Local Development Department.

However, since the transition towards climate neutrality is not an individual responsibility, but rather a collective effort, Suceava Municipality, related to the experience in ongoing projects implementation, will launched an invitation to the entire local ecosystem to engage all the key local actors, stakeholders, private and public sector as a local Net Zero City Coalition, with the scope of serving the local climate-neutrality pursuits, it is expected to be created in the first half of 2024. The first step was the agreement signed in 2023 between Suceava Municipality and Suceava "Stefan cel Mare" University from which at least one application for European funding was sent already (pilot project for implementation of LI FI principle).

Net Zero City Coalition's work will focus on using already-existing local strategic documents (eg., SUMP, SECAP, IUDS), out of the willingness to ensure the continuity and sustainability of priorities that were established through previously-approved framework papers but especially on the Action Plan implementation, monitoring, reiteration and evaluation in direct correlation with the Mission's requirements and local objectives &amp; commitments. Maximizing the resulting effects and the impact of actions will be achieved through
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

efficient communication, local commitment of the all involved stakeholders, common actions seen as a complementary component to the implementation and monitoring processes.

The Climate City Contract will go through an annual review and update process, based on iteration sessions organized by the Net Zero City Coalition. Thus, based on the learning gained through the daily implementation of the Action Plan, the Municipality and its transition team will intervene with improvements in the content of the CCC related documents. As we stated, we will use a model of reflexive governance, in which participation and deliberation across the Net Zero City Coalition will help us implement an intervention system based on common commitment, by taking into account the perspectives of all the actors involved. During the annual iteration sessions for CCC review, all the knowledge systems provided by the Net Zero City Coalition members will be activated, and the results of the consultations with them will be recorded in the updated version of the documentation. Citizens' involvement will play an important role in this regard. Thus, both the elaboration of the Action Plan and its implementation, respectively its update, will allow us to implement an innovative governance model, which will be reflected in the future iterations for the CCC review.

The Climate City Contract’s implementation will be monitored by Suceava Municipality, through its transition team, but will also require the involvement of the Net Zero City Coalition’s members.

The key principles that will guide the Municipality of Suceava in the process of its Climate City Contract implementation in order to reach the objectives assumed until 2030 are: Accountability, Transparency, Open attitude to new approaches, Common initiatives for general benefits, Smart and sustainable Innovation, Multi-sector and citizen engagement.

As a conclusion, the roadmap from a project idea to a successful implementation for all the actions included in the Action Plan and not only these ones need to include a specific approach that need to include at least the following milestones:

SMART objectives and goals;
A continue activity for monitoring, evaluation and, if necessarily, adjustment of technical solution and investment plan;
Real and permanent communication with all local stakeholders, collaboration with the other Romanian cities engaged in NZC programme, with experts from European Commission and other European city partners;
Sustained support and engagement from local decision makers;
Adaptation of the investment approach for each single action/policy;
Dissemination, communication and best practice transfer;
Adaptable, flexible and "cost effeteness" financing scheme.

Each of the signatories were part of local working groups in the CCC preparation process, they are partners with municipality in common investment projects from some of these are included in the Action Plan. In some specific actions we have already started the cooperation in the preparation phase for specific projects from different sector (for example for the electric busses with local public transport operator, for rehabilitation of heating transport and distribution network with local private operator) and we will continue working for implementation and evaluation phase, as these projects are into the implementation phase already with the grant contracts signed in 2023 or 2024. Suceava Municipality sees the Climate City Contract as a living document, that will be updated and upgraded, as for implementation monitoring sessions will be organized, along with annual re-iteration sessions, in order to fix the necessary updates, depending on the evolution of the local / regional / national / European context and the new European and national directives to be set with regards to climate neutrality and also to get engagement from a local / regional mix of private and public actors.
