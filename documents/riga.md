# Summary

In 2022, Riga was selected as one of the participants of the 'EU mission for 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030' ('net-zero cities'). Given the fact that Riga State City Municipality (RSCM) already had a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan 2030 (SECAP 2030) developed and approved, its boundaries and emission calculation methodology were expanded to include waste and wastewater management and forestry, updating the targets defined in SECAP 2030.

The new target for the achievement of the 2030 climate goals of the RSCM Action Plan ('action plan') is a 53% CO₂ emissions reduction compared to 2019, which at the same time means a CO₂ emissions reduction of 80% compared to 1990, reaching climate-neutrality in municipal infrastructure. Forest areas are additionally planned to be used to provide a constant sequestration of CO₂ of around 300 ktCO₂ per year by 2030, which represents 16% of the total GHG emissions recorded in 2019.

In order to enable the RSCM climate goals, the following fields of action have been defined for each sector:

(P) Municipal infrastructure and facilities (measures included will contribute 7% of the total CO₂ reduction):

P1: Continuous improvements in the energy management system.
P2: 100% renewable heat energy share in municipal buildings.
P3: 100% renewable electricity share in municipal buildings.
P4: Development of a plan for the renovation of municipal buildings until 2030 and consistent renovation of buildings.
P5: Upgrading of street lighting.
P6: Achieve a 100% renewable electricity share for streetlights, traffic lights, and clocks in 2030.
P7: Creation of a data records system for the municipal vehicle fleet and improvements in the efficiency of vehicle use.
P8: Promotion of the use of public transport for work among employees of the Riga municipal government.
P9: Transition to zero-emission vehicles in companies, municipal institutions.
P10: Energy efficiency and RES use in wastewater treatment plants.

(E) Energy production (measures included will contribute 37% of the total CO₂ reduction):

E1: Promotion of zero-emission technologies and RES in district heating.
E2: Ensure the connection of new clients to DHS of Riga.

ZM8: Greening of Riga’s urban environment (rest of Riga’s administrative territory).

In order to achieve climate-neutrality, the following horizontal aspects will be taken into account and integrated into the planning and implementation process:

**Stakeholder participation**: In order to involve as many or as diverse stakeholders as possible in the implementation of the identified measures and in the planning of new measures, representatives of the institutions in charge of each sector will identify and approach the main stakeholders, including representatives of neighbourhood centres and communities that combine and represent the interests of various social groups, as well as business and service provider associations representing business interests, and NGOs and other organisations, such as universities, which can disseminate information to an even broader share of the public (see Section C-1.2 for a more detailed description).
**Social innovations**: The opportunities that will be assessed and developed will include support for the creation of innovation centres/incubators; opening up of data to foster innovation; strengthening of cooperation with research institutions; setting up of climate innovation funds; development of education programmes; organisation of regular networking events (see Section C-2.1 for a more detailed description).

In order to enable the effective and transparent implementation of the field of action included in the plan, a detailed organisational diagram was prepared for each sector (see Section A-3.3 for a more detailed description), taking into account the main stakeholders involved and their interactions (see Section A-3.1 for a more detailed description).

The funding needed to implement the field of action included in the action plan can be obtained from a variety of sources: short- and mid-term municipal budget measures; private funding for long-term building renovation projects; EU structural funds for RES transition and other long-term energy efficiency measures; sustainable transport solutions; co-financing by the state; as well as other financial instruments. The expected amount of funding necessary for achieving the climate-neutrality targets is set at EUR 3.0 billion.

RSCM’s immediate plans are:

# 1 Introduction

The drafting of municipal sustainable energy and climate action plans is not required in Latvia, but according to the Energy Efficiency Law, municipalities may prepare and adopt an energy plan as a separate document or as part of a national or regional development programme that includes specific energy efficiency targets and measures. The draft Climate Law also envisages the gradual integration of climate policy objectives into municipal development planning.

Riga State City Municipality (RSCM) was the first Latvian municipality to join the Covenant of Mayors initiative, which happened in 2008. It was the first political undertaking by a municipal government to implement and pursue climate and energy policies at the local level. It was a key driver for the initial development of the Riga Smart City Sustainable Energy Action Plan for 2014–2020 and SECAP 2030 in 2021.

When Riga joined the initiative, it undertook to achieve at least a 20% reduction in CO₂ emissions by 2020, compared to 1990. By 2020, the CO₂ emissions reduction compared to 1990 was 60%. During the preparation of SECAP 2030 in 2021, a new target was set, to reduce CO₂ emissions compared to 1990 by 70%, and by 30%, compared to 2019.

In 2022, Riga was selected as one of the participants of the 'EU mission for 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030' ('net-zero cities'). During the development of SECAP 2030, its scope and emissions calculation methodology were expanded to include waste and wastewater management as well as forestry, updating the targets.

Riga's new target is to achieve a 53% CO₂ emissions reduction compared to 2019, which at the same time means a CO₂ emissions reduction by 80% compared to 1990 and the achievement of climate-neutrality in municipal infrastructure. Forest areas are additionally planned to ensure a constant sequestration of CO₂ of around 300 ktCO₂ per year by 2030, which equals 16% of the total GHG emissions recorded in 2019.

# 1.1 Work process

In 2008, the European Commission launched the Covenant of Mayors initiative to encourage and support local governments in their efforts to implement sustainable energy policies. The Covenant of Mayors is currently the only movement bringing local and regional governments together in achieving the EU's targets.

Riga took an important step towards tackling climate and energy affairs by joining the Covenant of Mayors initiative in 2008. This commitment served as a catalyst for the municipality to develop a sustainable energy action plan for 2010–2020 in 2010. In the plan, the city undertook to reduce its CO₂ emissions 20% by 2020, compared to 1990 levels. The 2011 and 2012 progress reports showed that the target had already been exceeded in 2011, with a 51% reduction. This led to an updated 2020 Action Plan in 2014, with new, more ambitious targets. The goal was to bring the city closer to smart city status and achieve a 55–60% CO₂ emissions reduction by 2020.

The Riga SECAP for 2022–2030 was approved in 2022. It set a target of reducing CO₂ emissions 70% compared to 1990, and 30% compared to 2019. In addition to 1990 as the original baseline year, 2019 was chosen as the second baseline year. It was chosen to mitigate the significant impact of COVID-19 on 2020 consumption data.

In 2021, Riga state city introduced an EMS covering 355 municipal institutions. The implemented EMS was certified according to ISO 50001:2018 in 2023. The system was developed to consistently reduce energy consumption in municipal infrastructure (buildings). The implementation of this system is bringing significant results, with energy savings of up to 5% in its initial years.

In 2022, Riga was selected as one of the participants of the 'EU Mission for 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030' ('net-zero cities').

Climate-Neutrality Action

Plan

#

The energy crisis after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine clearly showed that reducing energy consumption in municipal infrastructure, through EMS and other climate programmes, could reduce costs, while the resulting savings could be utilised to fund climate-neutrality measures.

One of the key fields of action in municipal infrastructure energy savings in winter 2022 was public lighting. Replacing the lights with LEDs, dimming the lighting, and reducing the illumination of building facades, the city reduced the energy consumption of public lighting by  $16\%$  in the winter of 2022. RSCM also focused on saving energy by reducing indoor temperatures in public buildings on off-days. In that way, RSCM saved between 15 and  $18\%$  of the heating energy consumed by the municipality's buildings. The energy savings from these measures resulted in cost savings of around EUR 4 million compared to 2021. This EUR 4 million was made available to REA for the implementation of the measures defined in the Riga SECAP 2030. $^{1}$

In 2024, a long-term climate programme is being developed to measure and monitor the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions and energy cost reductions of the measures implemented. To ensure the suitability and added economic value of the measures, regulations were created in Riga that gave a value of 1 euro for every tonne of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  saved or reduced across the lifecycle of the project. This approach represents Riga's commitment to assessing and planning environmental investments in real economic terms.

Figure 1 illustrates the GHG emissions reduction actions taken by RSCM so far.

Figure 2: Sectors encompassed by the Action Plan

During the development of the action plan, five co-creation workshops were organised to develop the Riga Climate action planning and the CCC. The topics of the workshops included:

Energy efficiency in municipal buildings, street lighting, and municipal transport
Waste management sector, circular economy
Energy efficiency and energy production in multi-apartment residential buildings
Transport
Forestry and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  sequestration

Stakeholders were involved in the workshops, representing the government, RSCM, higher education institutions, healthcare institutions, various NGOs working in nature protection and climate, companies working in energy production, transport, waste, and water management, manufacturing, and local residents. The workshops aimed at identifying specific climate actions and measures to be taken to implement them, defining a scenario to be included in the city climate contract. More than 160 people took part.

Figure 3 summarises the RSCM vision for achieving climate-neutrality.

Figure 3: Riga's climate-neutrality roadmap

With medium-term objectives at the heart of the plan, it is important to revise the plan at regular intervals, every 2-3 years. Such revision serves several purposes. First, it enables assessments of what has been achieved and done so far. Secondly, it supports a thorough assessment of measures, reviewing their effectiveness in achieving the goals. Finally, it makes it possible to plan additional actions that may be needed to ensure that the goals of the plan are met. This approach ensures that the plan remains flexible and complies with Riga's growing needs and challenges in achieving its status as a climate-neutral city.

RSCM's immediate plans are:

To approve the Action Plan and the Investment Plan.
To sign the Climate City Contract.
To provide an active and capable organisational structure for implementing and supervising the plan.
To prepare visually attractive simplified and abbreviated versions of this plan for different target groups (municipality departments and companies, local residents, businesses, etc.), which each target group can review to understand how they can contribute to Riga's climate-neutrality goals.
Start the implementation of the actions identified in the field of action, involving all the social stakeholders identified in conducting priority actions, including monitoring of the activities.

# A-1.2: Emissions factors applied

The methodology developed by the Covenant of Mayors based on the 'How to develop a sustainable energy action plan' guidelines has been used to determine GHG emissions.  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions are divided into two categories: (1) energy-related emissions resulting from the amount of energy consumption, and (2) non-energy-related emissions coming from the wastewater and waste management, as well as forestry sectors. For heat energy, emissions are determined using data on the amount of fuel consumed for the production of heat energy. The unit of measurement for emissions related to energy and the combustion of fossil fuels is tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  (the calculations did not include data on emissions of methane  $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$  and nitrous oxides  $\mathrm{N}_{2}\mathrm{O}$  by the energy sector). The unit of measurement for emissions from waste management and land use is tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ .

The calculation uses emission factors approved by the IPCC. These are emission factors for fuel combustion based on the carbon content of each fuel. DHS emission factor was calculated according to the guidelines of the Covenant of Mayors. The Latvian national standard electricity emission factor was used as the electricity emission factor, in accordance with the guidelines of the Covenant of Mayors.

The baseline year was already set in 2008, when Riga joined the Covenant of Mayors. In accordance with the Covenant of Mayors' guidelines for the development of the action plan, 1990 was chosen as the baseline year. That baseline year has remained in place in all action plans developed to date, including SECAP 2030 developed in 2021.

As part of the Riga SECAP 2030, waste and wastewater management emissions are calculated in accordance with IPCC guidelines, while forestry emissions were obtained from the monitoring report

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

Figure A-1.5.1 shows the changes in Riga state city energy consumption in 2015–2020. Energy consumption in Riga fell  $3\%$  since 2015, reaching 10,392 GWh in 2020. The 2020 decrease can be explained by the impact of COVID-19, and by the use of a more detailed source of input data, and the assumptions used in the calculations compared to 2015–2019. In 2020, heat energy consumption from energy production by the district heating was  $27\%$ , transport took up  $28\%$ , fuel consumption for decentralised heat supply systems was  $26\%$ , and electricity consumption was  $19\%$ .

Figure A-1.5.2 shows a more detailed breakdown of energy consumption by key sectors in 2020. The residential sector accounted for the largest share of Riga's total energy consumption in 2020 (30%), while the services and industry sector accounted for 29%, and the private vehicle sector, 26%. The municipal sector (water supply, street lighting, municipal buildings, and municipal fleet) accounted for 3%, public transport for 2%, and other consumers, for 10%.

Figure A-1.5.3 shows the changes in Riga state city GHG emissions in 1990, 2005, and 2015–2020. Given the fact that energy consumption fell  $6\%$  since 2015, the amount of GHG emissions decreased accordingly, reaching 1837 ktCO $_2$ e in 2020. In 2020,  $39\%$  of emissions were generated by the transport sector,  $22\%$  by DHS,  $16\%$  by fuel consumption in the decentralised heat supply system,  $12\%$  by electricity consumption,  $9\%$  by waste management, and  $2\%$  by forest management.

Figure A-1.5.4 shows a more detailed breakdown of GHG emissions generated in 2020 by main groups of consumers. In 2020,  $37\%$  of the emissions were caused by private transport fuel consumption,  $23\%$  by the electricity and heating energy consumption in the housing sector, and  $18\%$  by the electricity and heating energy consumption in the manufacturing and service sector. The municipal sector (electricity and heating energy consumption of municipal institutions, electricity consumption by water management and lighting, and fuel consumption by municipal transport) accounted for  $2\%$ , waste management for  $9\%$ , forest management for  $2\%$ , and other energy consumers, for  $8\%$ .

Figure A-1.5.5 shows the total RSCM infrastructure consumption and its breakdown into main groups in 2020. The heat energy consumption by municipal buildings takes up the biggest proportion in the overall energy consumption structure (59%). On the other hand, electricity consumption in water management accounts for 13%, in municipal buildings for 12%, and in street lighting, for 11%. At the

moment, no information is available about the consumption of heat energy and electricity in all municipal buildings, so the share of these sectors in the total consumption could be even higher.

Figure A-1.5.6 shows the municipal infrastructure energy consumption GHG emissions in 2020. The breakdown of the major emission sources is similar to Figure A-1.5.5 for the energy consumption of municipal infrastructure.

# A-2.2.: Description and assessment of policies

Latvia's National Energy and Climate Plan 2030 (NECP2030) is the comprehensive policy planning document that encompasses Latvia's goals, current policies, and measures in limiting GHG emissions, restructuring the energy sector, and reviewing key actions for climate change adaptation. NECP2030 was developed in line with the Fitfor55 EU climate and energy framework package aimed at achieving climate-neutrality; it sets out Latvia's national contribution to achieving the overall EU RES share target, to reducing GHG and achieving energy efficiency.

An updated version of NECP2030 was submitted to the European Commission in summer 2024; it was updated based on results of modelling, a socio-economic assessment, ministry proposals, and discussions with stakeholders. NECP2030 was developed in accordance with Latvia's Sustainable Development Strategy 2030 and Latvia's National Development Plan 2021–2027, as well as other sectoral policy planning documents and legislation.

Riga is Latvia's economic and population centre, and in 2020, Riga accounted for some 24% of Latvia's total GHG emissions⁶. So there is a strong link between NECP2030 and the fields of action and sources of funding set in the RSCM 2030 action plan. The target values may be updated in 2024, following European Commission recommendations and discussions with industry and stakeholders. The priorities highlighted in NECP2030 are also broadly in line with the fields of action of this plan.

Latvia's 2030 GHG target is a reduction of 65% compared to 1990. A non-ETS GHG reduction target of 17% compared to 2005 is also binding; in particular, it encompasses measures in transport and housing. Latvia must achieve a 15% reduction in GHG intensity in transport by 2030.

The updated NECP2030 for 2024 sets a target of 60% renewable energy in end energy consumption (50% in the previous NECP2030). Accordingly, it is also planned to achieve &gt;70% RES in end electricity consumption and 100% RES in the electricity produced in Latvia. Renewable energy targets for 2030 are also set for heating and cooling (66.4%), district heating systems (73.9%), transport (29%), buildings (65%), and industry (73.1%). In the field of energy efficiency, there are targets for energy savings and reducing energy consumption, and a separate target for renovated floor area in public sector buildings (a total of 2.5 million m² renovated).

Key NECP2030 measures in the field of transport include strengthening the role of rail infrastructure, greening heavy and light cargo vehicles, promoting electrification and the transition towards low-emissions mobility, including implementing a low-emissions zone and holding a car-free day in Riga.

In the field of electricity and heat generation and consumption, the plan is to achieve a balanced development of solar and wind farms and to start using energy storage solutions. In district heating, the emphasis is put on the role of electrification, use of residual heat and plans to modernise infrastructure. Biomethane production will be promoted, and natural gas traders will be required to achieve an annual RES share of at least 3%. Restrictions will be placed on the installation of new fossil fuel systems. It is worth highlighting the plan to achieve biogas/biomethane extraction in the water management companies of the state city, which is particularly relevant to the measures envisaged by LLC 'Rīgas ūdens'. This measure is also linked to the future requirement for certain service providers (DHS operators, waste management companies, water management companies, etc.) to adopt RES technologies and to provide in-house sources of energy.

Equally important will be the involvement of energy consumers, supporting active users, developing the net system and launching the first energy community initiatives.

Many actions are intended to improve energy efficiency, including the introduction of energy management systems, improved data systems and calculation methodologies, and measures to manage energy consumption and demand. Monitoring and management measures, support for energy efficiency measures implemented by local authorities and improved energy efficiency of public sector buildings will be expanded in the area of buildings. Renovation and energy efficiency efforts will be stepped up in multi-apartment residential buildings, detached houses, and neighbourhoods and connecting them to DHS will be encouraged.

# A-2.2.: Description and assessment of policies

In the area of waste and wastewater management, NECP2030 aims to increase the recycling of biodegradable waste and improve sorting rates. GHG emissions monitoring will begin at major wastewater treatment plants, with improvements in the operation of the systems and the comprehensive implementation of the Sewage Sludge Management Plan for 2024–2027.

Energy and climate policies are governed by different laws and regulations. Specifically, Latvia's preliminary energy savings target and other requirements set by directives are included in the Energy Efficiency Law, which took effect on 29 March 2016. The current mandatory energy end-use savings target for 2030 is at 20,472 GWh (1.76 Mtoe, 73.7 PJ) in 2020. The Energy Efficiency Law will be revised in the light of Directive 2023/1791 of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy efficiency and the updated NECP2030. Section 5 of the Energy Efficiency Law establishes the following rights and obligations for the government and municipal sectors:

(1) Government bodies and municipalities are entitled to:

) develop and adopt an energy efficiency plan as a separate document or as a part of the municipal land development programme, which includes certain energy efficiency goals and measures;

) implement an EMS separately or as part of the implementation of their energy efficiency plan;

) use energy efficiency services and conclude energy efficiency service contracts to implement energy efficiency improvement measures.

(2) The municipal governments of the national cities introduce a certified EMS. [...]

The provisions of the Law on the Energy Performance of Buildings derive from Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the energy performance of buildings. The purpose of this law is to promote the efficient use of energy resources by improving the energy efficiency of buildings, and informing the community about the energy consumption of buildings. The law sets the minimum energy efficiency requirements for buildings that can be operated, designed, rebuilt, or renovated, and the requirements for the energy certification of buildings, heating systems, and air conditioning systems. Meanwhile, the conditions for local governments in terms of heating supply and energy poverty, are determined in the Energy Law.

A problem of current importance in Latvia, especially in Riga, is improving air quality and reducing pollution. The Air Pollution Reduction Action Plan 2020–2030 was approved on 16 April 2020. The plan was designed to reduce the negative effects of air pollution on the environment and human health, and to reduce costs and worktime lost due to health problems and doctor's visits caused by air pollution.

In the transport sector, the draft Transport Energy Law was undergoing inter-ministerial approvals during the preparation of the plan. The purpose of the law is to promote the circulation of transport energy that is safe for the health of humans and their environment, and to achieve the development of alternative fuel infrastructure and public awareness of available and usable forms of transport energy. The planned law will also affect municipal governments. According to the draft law, Riga will be required to:

determine such conditions for the use of vehicles in the municipality that promote the reduction of emissions caused by the use of vehicles;

ensure that at least 50% of the transport energy used in the city's public transport is renewable in 2030;

ensure that, starting from 1 January 2030, at least 50% of the vehicles purchased as part of municipal public procurement must be vehicles that use renewable energy.

The Riga 2022–2030 Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP 2030) is the main policy planning document for the energy and climate sector. It was drafted in accordance with other development planning documents of RCC. The link between the documents and SECAP 2030 is shown in Figure A-2.2.1.

# Riga Sustainable Energy Action Plans before 2020

The Riga City Sustainable Energy Action Plan for a Smart City 2014-2020 was a continuation of the first Riga City Sustainable Energy Action Plan (2010-2020), which aimed to: 'Bring the city closer to the status of a smart city by integrating innovative information and communication technologies in energy and transport.' The action plan included an initial review of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions for the 1990-2012 period, and scenarios for up to 2020. The plan's official  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emission reduction goal was to reduce  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions by  $20\%$  (vs 1990) by 2020. The results of the plan's forecasts predicted that by 2020, the potential reduction in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions could be  $55 - 60\%$ .

According to the final monitoring report of the action plan, the total amount of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions in Riga decreased about  $60\%$  in 2020, compared to 1990, or  $27\%$  compared to 2010. The fastest reduction in emissions  $(44\%)$  compared to 2010 was achieved in the energy production sector.

# Riga Sustainable Development Strategy 2030

Riga Sustainable Development Strategy 2030 is a long-term land development planning document of the Riga City Municipality. The plan offers a vision of Riga, which envisages that in 2030, Riga will be:

'An internationally recognised metropolis for Northern Europe. Riga's rightful membership among major Northern European cities will be supported by the quality of life in the city, innovative economy, smart, resource-saving, and modern governance, with the active participation of local residents.'

Riga City Municipality has set four long-term development goals, including 'Comfortable and safe urban environment that is pleasant for local residents'. The strategy puts a special focus on the transport sector.

# A-2.2.: Description and assessment of policies

Although the movement of pedestrians and cyclists is currently subordinated to car traffic, in the long term, the transport infrastructure must be built according to the following generally accepted hierarchy, especially in the city core and neighbourhood centres:

pedestrian –&gt; cyclist –&gt; public transport –&gt; private car transport.

The goal is to develop Riga as a sustainable metropolis by restricting the entry of private vehicles into its centre, encouraging local residents to use public transport and cycling. Multi-apartment residential buildings also play an important role in Riga. The renewal of housing stock is one of the main factors for the development of this sector.

# Riga Development Programme 2022–2027

The Riga Development Programme 2022–2027 sets 9 priorities/scope of development, of which three are closely related to energy and climate:

Good environment quality and sustainable urban ecosystem for mitigating climate change to: 'Create such quality of the environment that has a beneficial effect on the health and well-being of local residents, and their desire to be physically, socially, and economically active. Create and maintain a pleasant, diverse, and climate change-adapted environment, in which nature-based solutions contribute to the quality of the environment, to the adaptation to and mitigation of climate change.'

As part of this field of development, it is planned to implement comprehensive energy management, energy efficiency, and emissions reduction measures, increasing the share of renewable energy in the overall energy balance, supporting energy, climate, and environmental innovations, improving the energy literacy of the city's residents, and encouraging changes in their lifestyle.

Availability of diverse and high-quality housing with the goal of: 'No less than 1400 multi-apartment residential buildings getting a comprehensive and high-quality renovation as part of the housing programme by 2027.'

In order to achieve this goal, the development programme envisages creating a competence centre in the municipality for housing, to develop and pursue a well-designed housing policy, to create an action programme, to set clear goals, and to determine the institutions in charge. The criteria for affordable and environmentally friendly housing will be taken into account in developing and implementing the housing policy, including energy efficiency, sustainable materials used in construction, principles of circular economy, and air quality. In renovating the outdated housing stock, it is planned to ensure adaptation to climate change, improve environmental health indicators, introduce extensive accessibility solutions, and significantly improve the quality of the living environment.

Comfortable and environmentally friendly travel in the city: 'Promote climate-friendly and human-friendly mobility by making diverse modes of transportation available and creating the necessary infrastructure.'

The development programme aims to set the conditions for the part of society that does not need to travel by private car on a daily basis, so that it can use comfortable, safe, and environmentally friendly vehicles, while improving the quality of air in the city, reducing the negative impact on the climate, and the load on the street infrastructure. In addition to infrastructure improvements, one must implement mobility management measures, promoting changes in travel habits.

RSCM currently lacks city-wide policy planning documents on sustainable mobility and climate change adaptation.

RSCM owns shares in 12 companies, including 'Rīgas satiksme', RNP, LLC 'Rīgas ūdens', LLC 'Rīgas meži' and 'Rīgas nami', where it owns 100% of shares, as well as LLC Getlini EKO (97.7% of shares) and AS 'Rīgas siltums' (49% of shares). The companies have an approved or have in development a mid-term operating strategy (at least 3 years), and a few companies have a sustainable development strategy (at least 10 years) undergoing development/approval, which will take the city's climate-neutrality objective into account.

|  1. Residual emissions include emissions that cannot be reduced through climate action and that need to be compensated for. Residual emissions may account for no more than 20%, in accordance with the information guidelines of the Mission.
Baseline reduction target = Baseline emissions – residual emissions.
The planned emission reductions in existing action planning and strategies must be calculated for every sector.
Emissions difference = Baseline emissions reduction target – emissions reduction with existing strategies.

The action plan aims to achieve an 80% reduction in GHG emissions compared to 1990 by 2030. The most significant GHG emissions reductions (87%) are planned in the energy sector, through the substitution of fossil fuels in the production of energy. Transport GHG emissions are also to be reduced by 60%, in particular, by promoting the electrification of transport, use of public transport and low-emission mobility in the Riga Metropolitan Area. It is also planned to reduce emissions in the waste sector by 31% by limiting the amount of waste disposed in landfills. In addition to GHG emission reductions, the forest areas of LLC ‘Rīgas meži’ will provide the permanent sequestration of CO_{2} in the amount of some 300 ktCO_{2} per year.

Existing strategies are based on Riga’s SECAP 2030, which proposes a 70% reduction of GHG emissions compared to 1990. This plan does not have a specific target for the waste sector. While the ambition of GHG reduction is already high in SECAP 2030, the new action plan puts a bigger emphasis on transportation.  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

## 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate-Neutrality

### A-3.1: Mapping of systems and stakeholders

The stakeholders involved in each sector are described below and graphically shown according to their interests and influence. Table A-3.1 below lists the stakeholders in each sector, with an assessment of their:

cooperation — between the municipality and the stakeholder, i.e., the existing cooperation model and its effectiveness;
impact — the impact of the stakeholder on reducing emissions within the sector;
interest — the interest of the stakeholder in reducing emissions within the sector.

#### Municipal infrastructure

In achieving Riga’s climate-neutrality goals, various levels of engagement by all municipal institutions, departments, committees, and companies are needed. In assessing the influence, substantial engagement is needed from PD, whose activities include the management of buildings, planning and

conducting the renovation of buildings, and delegating tasks to building managers. It is also important to provide feedback to municipal committees for political decision-making. The involvement of the Executive Director Office is essential to delegate the implementation of the measures included in the Riga climate contract at the level of institutions and companies and to monitor the implementation process. The main responsibility of the companies is to implement the tasks assigned to them. The main tasks of REA are to provide the necessary data analysis and information for making decisions on the implementation of measures and the raising of finance, the maintenance and expansion of the EMS, and for raising awareness of and the commitment to climate goals in all the departments of the municipality.

## Energy production:

Endeavouring to achieve climate-neutrality in Riga, stakeholders in the energy production sector have and will play a key role in implementing the measures specified. Given the fact that the Riga Metropolitan Area is the largest energy consumer in the country, achieving Riga's climate targets is also crucial for achieving the climate targets of Latvia as a whole. Thus, the political and regulatory decisions pursued by MoCE and further adopted by the national Parliament and/or the Cabinet of Ministers that are related to promoting the production of renewable energy, also play an important role in the development of Riga's energy sector. Investments by energy companies in innovative solutions also play an important role in decarbonising the energy sector. Citizens' initiatives and the development of energy communities can also boost the demand for the production of renewable energy. Effective engagement and cooperation of these various stakeholders is essential in building a sustainable and climate-neutral energy sector in Riga.

## Apartment buildings:

A number of institutions are involved in the management and development of multi-apartment residential buildings in Riga. In conjunction with other municipal departments, REA has set up an energy efficiency centre and provides advice on the renovation procedure to local residents and participates in organising various campaigns and international projects. HED pursues a consistent housing policy for the city, helping to solve housing issues; it supervises the management of housing controlled by the municipality and manages non-privatised residential premises in the municipality. PD pursues the efficient use of the property and land plots owned and controlled the municipality, and arranges the co-financing for the renovation of buildings in Riga (atjauno.riga.lv). The ALTUM financial institution offers a number of assistance mechanisms for local residents to renovate their buildings. However, the involvement, competence, and capacity of other stakeholders, such as RNP and other building management companies, must be significantly increased to support local residents and provide advice to them in terms of options for the renovation of buildings, given the fact that the rate of renovation will increase in the future. There is also a need to promote action agreed and coordinated by all stakeholders. For the implementation of all fields of action in the multi-apartment residential buildings sector, the institutions responsible for the measure must involve other stakeholders in both the planning and implementation phases (HED, PD, REA, DD, etc.).

## Transport and mobility:

The transport and mobility sector in Riga involves many stakeholders, from national and local policymakers to local residents and city's guests. According to their interest and influence, all major stakeholders must be provided with sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation (according to the Riga Mobility Vision: https://www.rdpad.lv/rigas-mobilitates-vizija/), as summarised in Table A-3.1

## Waste management and circular economy:

Stakeholders in the waste management sector are divided into 4 groups:

Policymakers — Executive Director Office, HED, REA.
Waste producers — local residents, institutions, businesses.
RIGA

Climate-Neutrality Action

Plan

O

Waste management companies — companies authorised to collect, sort, and transport municipal waste in the city⁷; LLC Getlini EKO is responsible for waste reception and ecological management; LLC 'Rigas udens' is responsible for wastewater management.
Other stakeholders involved in the implementation of the measures — building managers, NGOs, RNRC, and companies whose business results in reduced amounts of waste produced.

## Forestry and CO₂ emissions sequestration:

Responsibility for Riga's green spaces is divided between four RD departments:

CDD — responsible for grounds development and planning, and for the collection and supervision of geospatial data;
HED — responsible for supervising environmental protection and the efficient use of natural resources, as well as for preparing environmental plans, programmes, and projects;
PD — responsible for the management of green spaces, including small gardens, owned by the state city of Riga;
PSMD — maintains rainwater drainage systems.

In practice, green spaces are managed by:

LLC 'Rigas meži' manages 5625.2 ha of forest land in the Riga state city territory, 57,166.9 ha of forest land outside Riga, as well as 399 ha of Riga's gardens and parks;
Grounds Improvements Administration — cleans the municipality's grounds, repairs courtyards, maintains playgrounds and recreation areas.

One of the main challenges is the lack of understanding of climate-neutrality and sustainable management at the political and RSCM management level, which in turn hinders the elimination of other barriers. RSCM lacks capacity to raise financing and to implement projects, and the link between the RSCM budget and the investment plan is insufficient. The current governance system is not transparent enough and does not make it possible to fully track energy consumption and costs across the entire RSCM infrastructure, which prevents data availability and the making of informed decisions on the management of RSCM infrastructure. There is also a lack of coordination between all stakeholders, such as PD and WD. Challenges are also created by national-level political decisions, hampering the drafting of the necessary laws and regulations.

Systemic barriers in the municipal infrastructure sector:

Social:
There is no awareness of the skills required to manage an RSCM holding at all levels.
Climate scepticism among politicians, civil servants, and department heads.

Organisational:
Insufficient capacity.
Poor coordination between departments in charge.
Fragmented governance in rainwater management.

Financial:
There is a lack of long-term political support and funding for activities.
There is no 3-year budget plan and the link between the RSCM budget and the RSCM investment plan is weak.
Low capacity to raise financing.

Technical:
Lack of data on the entire scope of RSCM property, including the technical condition of buildings.

Legal:
Non-compliance with the Law on the Energy Performance of Buildings requirements on energy performance certificates.
Failure to implement the innovative procurement principles.

The implementation of the field of action must aim towards reducing these barriers. Technical and legal barriers related to the lack of data and the drafting of building energy certificates will be addressed in field of action P1, planning activities within EMS, taking into account the fact that the activities foreseen in the EMS manual are binding for all municipal institutions. Awareness-raising events will be organised to reduce social barriers. Organisational barriers need to be reduced by promoting greater interdepartmental cooperation and the involvement of other stakeholders in the implementation of the field of action.

## Energy production:

The biggest challenge in the energy production sector is to achieve coordinated decision-making among all stakeholders and to ensure awareness of the need to meet climate targets. Achieving climate-neutrality targets in the energy production sector will be strongly linked to national energy policy, and RSCM needs to play an active role in shaping this policy.

Systemic barriers in the energy production sector:

Social:
High levels of energy poverty (low energy efficiency in homes makes it difficult to pay for heating and limits the ability to save).

Organisational:
Lack of a strong political stance and direction on the sustainable supply of energy, including a lack of close cooperation among all stakeholders.
Weak cooperation with the private sector.
The capacity of local residents to cooperate and form energy communities is low.

Financial:
The capacity to raise investment to decarbonise the sector needs to be developed.
Falling future demand for heating supply services.

Technical:
Limited coverage of district heating systems.
Some of the district heating service is covered by CHP 2 and CHP 1, which use fossil fuels.

Legal:
Commitment to ensure the stability of the energy system through the operation of CHP.
Lack of regulation for energy communities.
There is a lack of regulations to allow local residents to purchase energy certificates for electricity.
There is a lack of regulations for heating energy certificates.

## Multi-apartment residential buildings:

One of the barriers in renovating buildings is the low purchasing power of local residents. It limits people's ability to afford building renovation and, in the long run, leads to a significant deterioration of the technical condition of multi-apartment residential buildings as a result of poor management. At the same time, local residents lack the knowledge and experience to manage their buildings and make collective decisions. Building managers lack the competence and capacity to support local residents in the renovation process. In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic and the military action in Ukraine, as well as other global events, have also led to higher prices of construction materials and other related goods and services, including Euribor interest rates for loans, which makes renovation projects more expensive and people more cautious when deciding on long-term financial commitments. As a result, the return-on-investment period for building renovation is very long. There is also a lack of local residents willing to take the lead to drive these processes in these buildings. Furthermore, there is a low level of activity among local residents in terms of forming associations, which is a major obstacle to the renovation process unless an energy service provider (ESCO) is involved.

One of the major barriers in the field of the renovation of buildings is the bureaucratic burden that obstructs the renovation process. One of the barriers is the need to borrow the full amount of the assistance before receiving assistance for the renovation of the building, as well as the requirement to undergo a second assessment of the loan with ALTUM if the commercial bank rejects the loan, which significantly slows the process down. Changes in the conditions for co-financing create additional confusion for those submitting their projects. Significant obstacles were also encountered at the technical documentation and procurement stages, where design developers faced the burden of making corrections and changes in designs that had already been approved and confirmed by the construction authority, thus significantly increasing the design development time.

In order to address the barriers related to the lack of involvement of local residents, various activities will be carried out as part of field of action Dz3 to raise awareness among local residents, improve the skills and capacities of house managers, and encourage cooperation between municipal institutions to ensure coordinated and consistent communication with local residents. Barriers related to data access and the provision of data to local residents will be addressed as part of field of action Dz1. Field of action Dz2 will mainly involve addressing problems associated with bureaucratic hurdles in an effort to shorten the duration and financial burden of the process for initiating renovation. The financial barriers will be addressed as part of fields of action Dz4 and Dz5, through the creation of the Riga Energy Efficiency Fund (REEF) and the development of standard solutions and examples to facilitate decision-making and enable the implementation of larger, block-scale projects.

Systemic barriers in the multi-apartment residential building sector:

Social:
Low awareness among apartment owners of their responsibility to maintain their property.
Lack of awareness of sustainable management of buildings.
Low local resident participation and desire to cooperate.

Organisational:
Insufficient awareness of the options to receive free technical assistance and support among local residents.
Bureaucratic burden in the approval and implementation of building renovation projects.
Lack of competent project managers.
Lack of data on heat energy consumption.
No clearly defined responsibilities for moving the renovation process forward in the municipal government.
Lack of information about active apartment owner associations.

Financial:
High construction costs.
Low local resident purchasing power, insufficient savings made by building associations.
Long renovation return-on-investment period.

Technical:
Lack of standardised technical solutions (e.g., insulated panels) that could increase the rate of renovation.
Fluctuating demand for the renovation of buildings, resulting in inconsistent demand for construction services that the construction industry cannot adapt to quickly.

Legal:
Division of shared properties, acquisition of ownership in historic buildings.
Handover of control over buildings (absence of associations).

Transport and mobility:

A number of challenges related to demographic change, urban dispersion and sprawl, congestion, bicycle infrastructure bottlenecks, less competitive public transport, and others have been identified in the transport and mobility sector in Riga. Nine fields of action have been identified, aimed at eliminating these barriers and achieving climate-neutrality.

Systemic barriers in the transport and mobility sector:

Social:
Need to change behaviour and habits.
Inadequate education on healthy lifestyle.
Effects of air pollution in Riga City Centre.
RIGA

Organisational:
Lack of strong political stance and political continuity.
Public transport routes not suited for the needs of local residents.
Lack of a single ticket for using Riga’s public transport and rail services.
Inconsistent access to services close to home.
Lack of mobility data.

Financial:
Lack of funding for pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.
Major investments in providing public transport services.

Technical:
No cohesive, uninterrupted cycling infrastructure.
Insufficient cycle options parking in the city’s centre and neighbourhoods.
Lack of comfortable public transport stops that meet accessibility standards.
No effective mobility points.
Low number of electric vehicle charging stations, especially in residential areas.
High share of outdated vehicles in the city.

# Systemic barriers in the waste management and circular economy sector:

The main challenge for the waste management sector is to achieve a significant reduction in the amount of waste going to landfill. Improvements in the separate waste collection infrastructure are not happening fast enough or face resistance from stakeholders in practice. The principles of the circular economy in resource use are not integrated into financial mechanisms on a sufficiently large scale, although they work well at the level of individual initiatives.

Social:
Poor public awareness of the principles of waste separation.
Sorting is not convenient (infrastructure, habits, economic incentives).
Poorly developed infrastructure for sorting and composting organic waste.⁸
Problems with separate collection of textiles and household hazardous waste.

Organisational:
Engagement of building managers in waste management is low.
Lack of information and control systems for specific types of waste, higher costs.
There is no control mechanism.
Circular economy infrastructure not developed.

Financial:
Low municipal waste collection fee.
No assistance and punishment systems to motivate sorting waste.

Technical:
Lack of public infrastructure for separate waste collection in the city.
Separate collection of organic waste is not organised.
Low share of waste sorted.

Legal:
Sorting is not compulsory or available to everyone in practice.

# Forestry and CO₂ sequestration:

At the time of the preparation of this action plan, one of the main barriers in this sector is the lack of a single city-level data records system and the lack of a single emissions calculation methodology at the national level for GHG emissions produced and sequestration by green spaces. As a result, the city has no information about the current situation (with the exception of the areas of LLC ‘Rīgas meži’), which prevents data-driven development planning. The development of the sector is also hampered by the lack of a clear goal at the city level. At the time of the preparation of this action plan, the aspect of reducing GHG emissions and increasing CO₂ sequestration by green spaces in the city is not taken into account in spatial and development planning.

Systemic barriers in the forestry and CO₂ sequestration sector:

⁸ Since 1 March 2024, operators of multi-apartment residential buildings must provide for the separation of organic waste at multi-apartment residential buildings with more than ten apartments.

Social:

The public is not educated and informed of the measures to reduce GHG emissions and sequestration of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  through green spaces in the city.

Organisational:

Lack of cooperation and sharing of information between stakeholders in the sector.
There is no clear goal defined for the development of the sector.

Financial:

Raising of funds for the planned activities.

Technical:

Limited availability and poor quality of data on GHG emissions produced by the areas of LLC 'Rigas mezi'.
There is no single methodology for calculating emissions at the municipal level.
The emissions and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  sequestration values of the green spaces within the territory of Riga that are not owned by LLC 'Rigas mezi' are not identified.

Legal:

The  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  sequestration aspects of the areas are not taken into account in spatial planning documents and regulatory requirements.

# A-3.3: Description or visualisation of the participatory city climate-neutrality model

In order to enable the effective and transparent implementation of the fields of action included in the plan, an overall organisational diagram was prepared for each sector, taking into account the main stakeholders involved and their interactions.

# Municipal infrastructure

The municipal sector is largely made up of various municipal departments and companies that provide a number of services to the city's residents, including water, building management, heating, public transport, lighting, and other services.

Figure A-3.3.1: Municipal infrastructure sector organisational diagram

# Energy production:

Given the fact that the energy sector involves private businesses and other stakeholders that are not directly under the authority of Riga City Council, pursuing an effective climate policy is essential for achieving the sector's climate-neutrality goals. Thus, one of the leading stakeholders is HEC, tasked with shaping the climate policy and engaging in dialogue with national-level and private-sector stakeholders.

Within the municipality, the Executive Director Office plays an important role, delegating tasks to municipal institutions and, as a shareholder, defining the financial and non-financial targets for municipal companies. The main tasks of REA and CDD are to conduct the supervision, provision of information, and analysis of climate targets, and to develop planning documents.

![img-11.jpeg](img-11.jpeg)
Figure A-3.3.2: Energy production sector organisational diagram

# Multi-apartment residential buildings:

In the apartment sector, the coordinated cooperation of the Executive Director Office with the departments, agencies, and companies of RSCM plays the main role. The implementation of programmes supervised by Altum is essential in financing the renovation of buildings. REA analyses data on the energy performance of buildings, develops support tools and provides advice with the goal of speeding up the building renovation process.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

By 2030, RSCM aims to achieve a 53% reduction in GHG emissions compared to 2019, and 80%, compared to 1990, including reaching climate-neutrality in municipal infrastructure. The share of sectors in total GHG emission reductions and the measures to achieve the 2030 targets are summarised in Figure B-1.1.1. The fields of action in the municipal infrastructure, energy production, housing, transport and mobility sectors and their priorities are shown in Figure B-1.1.2.

Riga is Latvia's largest city and the centre of economic activity – these aspects add extra complexity to planning comprehensive climate change mitigation actions. The list of actions in each sector was selected to cover as many aspects as possible, given the high ambition of GHG emissions reduction. In total, there are 31 action lines for reducing emissions in four sectors (excluding waste management and green infrastructure). Each of them has several implementation steps, coordinated by a group of different stakeholders. Although all actions must evolve in parallel, there is a need for prioritizing in terms of resource allocation and expected results.

In Municipal infrastructure (38 ktCO₂ or 2% of Riga's total emissions), the Action plan aims to achieve full climate-neutrality, implying that the amount of GHG emissions will drop to zero by 2030. The largest source of emissions is due to heating of public buildings (24 ktCO₂), thus replacement of gas boilers, acquisition of 100% renewable district heating certificates and building renovation will be the priority (actions P2 &amp; P4). The provision of 100% electricity will take place by arranging green electricity procurements and gradually installing solar PV on public buildings. Replacement of fossil fuel vehicles will happen by 2030 by changing the rules of procurement and lease as well as implementing new data management systems. The climate-neutrality target for municipal infrastructure was already approved as part of the SECAP 2030 in 2022, thus it is well integrated in the present investment plans and agendas for municipal departments. Riga's energy management system is operational since 2022.

With 876 ktCO₂ in 2020, Energy production was the sector that produced most GHG emissions. The aim of this action plan is to reduce the emissions till 513 ktCO₂ by 2030. To achieve it, there are three priorities – reduce the share of fossil fuels in district heating (actions E1-E5); replace the gas boilers in decentralized heating systems (electrification, connection to DHS) (action E6); increase of renewable electricity (action E7). Since Riga's energy system is connected to thermoelectric plants of national significance, decarbonisation plans are made together with sector ministries and energy companies. Phase out of fossil fuels will be further promoted in Riga's strategy of sustainable heat supply, involving the municipal company "Rigas Siltums". To minimize the emissions form decentralized heat, a lot of investment will be necessary in the private sector (commercial and residential buildings) – Riga will continue its work on normative and financial support measures. To reduce the carbon footprint of Riga's electricity consumption, there are plans for scaling up the use solar PV. Riga will also benefit from the system wide decarbonisation of Latvia's power sector, thus different options for purchasing renewable electricity will be available.

The Housing sector (multi-apartment buildings) will have a rather small reduction of emissions – from 367 ktCO₂ in 2020 till 346 ktCO₂ in 2030. The main goal of this field of action is to speed up the renovation rate of multiapartment buildings, reaching 2000 by 2030 (there are about 6000 multi-apartment buildings to renovate in Riga). The actions describe the steps that the municipality takes to ensure the enabling conditions (information, regulation, co-funding, standardized solutions, outreach) as well as the renovation projects that the owners should implement with partial public co-funding or bank loans.

Finally, the Transport sector must achieve a major transformation reducing its GHG emissions from 714 ktCO₂ in 2020 to 160 ktCO₂ in 2030. In this sector, all actions are aimed at reducing the use of private cars by developing infrastructure for public transport, cycling and walking (T1-T6). The municipality has already scaled up investments in cycling roads, mobility hubs and public traffic as a part of its development and air quality programmes. The GHG reduction target for transport is very high and part of it may be redistributed to other sectors (Housing, Energy production) to ensure that the ambition is realistic.

In the Waste management sector and the green infrastructure sector the list of actions includes priorities identified in expert discussions and ongoing planning processes. The quantification of their contribution and costs will be completed by 2026 when the respective policy planning documents are finalized. Meanwhile, several measures are already being implemented.

In the Module B2, each action is assigned a label “priority I – III”, where “priority I” stands for the most urgent actions in terms need for engagement and expected contribution to climate change mitigation. “Priority II” marks either those actions whose contribution to emissions reduction is smaller or actions where some progress is already achieved. “Priority III” marks actions which would be beneficial, but their contribution is complementary. Regardless of the priority marking, all actions should be implemented.

|  Action outline | Action name | P1: Continuous improvements in the energy management system  |
|   |  Action type | Continuous and long-term  |
|   |  Action description | The establishment of an energy management system in RSCM is not only a requirement of laws and regulations but also an essential need for optimising the work of the municipal government in order to systematically monitor and ensure the reduction of energy consumption in municipal buildings. As part of this measure, the municipality is required to continuously improve the created EMS and expand its scope every year, in order to include all (more than 4000) municipal buildings by 2030.  |
|  Reference to impact pathway | Field of action | Municipal infrastructure  |
|   |  Systemic lever | Governance and policy/Capacity and capacity building/Technology and infrastructure  |
|  Implementation | Responsible bodies/person for implementation | • REA — responsible for maintaining EMS, including planning annual goals and measures, energy consumption records and their analysis, provision of recommendations, organisation of cooperation with PD, expansion of EMS boundaries, etc.
• PD — responsible for the management of municipal buildings in accordance with the EMS manual and other guidelines  |
|   |  Action scale & addressed entities | Municipal infrastructure: all municipal buildings  |
|   |  Involved stakeholders | • Municipal building owners and/or heads of institutions — management of buildings according to EMS, provision of energy consumption data (if necessary), consistent measures to reduce and/or streamline energy consumption
• Legal Administration — preparation of binding regulations
• FD — earmarking of funding for low-budget measures
• ECSD — implementation of the measures in line with the EMS manual  |
|   |  Comments on implementation – consider mentioning resources, timelines, milestones | • P1.1. Creation of a single online energy consumption records and analysis tool accessible to all municipal managers and building owners. The chosen solution must include at least the following functions: overview reports and comparison with other sites. The set of indicators will include data on building heating energy and electricity consumption, primary energy consumption, water consumption, GHG emissions, and other indicators to be defined during the development. There will have to be data input features, with processing and visual presentation, also for transport energy data (2024; RDA in conjunction with REA)
• P1.2. Inspection of all renovated buildings, including the supervision of energy consumption and its comparison with energy consumption as specified in energy performance certificates, as well as recommendations on further measures that will save an average of 10–15% of the  |

|   | energy consumption of every building (2024; REA in conjunction with PD)
• P1.3. Incorporation of the energy performance guarantee in the construction and renovation of all municipal sites, which will lead to the energy savings planned in the project (2024; REA in conjunction with the Legal Administration)
• P1.4. Creation of incentives for behaviour change in the municipality. For example, setting targets for the specific consumption of heating energy and/or electricity in buildings that would be binding for the institution. The target value must be set according to the building type, e.g., for schools and education institutions in renovated buildings, the target could potentially be as high as 60 kWh/m² (or as specified in the renovation design of the building). The target must be linked to the budget of the building or institution to motivate the institution to work towards the target
• P1.5. Implementation of the ‘energy efficiency first’ principle at the level of all departments and companies: for example, in draft decisions, their impact on the climate and the environment should also be considered in the explanatory statements; preparation of general brief guidelines and discussions regarding them with the heads of RSCM and all departments; the measure as such will not create savings, but taking the principles of energy efficiency into account, will prevent the consumption of energy from increasing (2024; REA)
• P1.6. More than 300 building energy certificates are planned to be prepared during 2024, providing information about the energy efficiency of buildings, lighting and other energy-related topics. After the preparation of the energy certificates, extensive data analysis must be carried out and higher priority must be given to the implementation of measures in buildings where urgent action is needed. The next step is to carry out an assessment of the technical condition of the buildings so that the energy efficiency measures are planned in combination with measures to improve the overall technical condition of the building (2024–2030; REA in conjunction with PD)
• P1.7. Incorporation of energy consumption targets in building management contracts, potentially saving an average of 5% in heating energy consumption (2024; REA in conjunction with PD and the company managing heating units)
• P1.8. Based on the data collected as part of action P.1.6, a priority list of buildings in need of replacing the lighting to energy-efficient lighting must be compiled: this will save 15–20% in electricity consumption in these buildings. By 2030, all municipal buildings must have their lighting replaced with LED or equivalent energy-efficient lighting. The existing lighting must be replaced in at least 50 municipal buildings every year, which will save 15–20% in electricity consumption in these buildings (2024–2030; REA in conjunction with PD)
• P1.9. Expansion of the planning document Riga Municipal Property Management Strategy with energy efficiency guidelines for buildings; the measure will not provide savings as such, but will ensure compliance with the  |

|   |  | principles of energy efficiency and will limit increases in the consumption of energy (2024, PD)
• P1.10. Development and implementation of regulations for the allocation of a part of the energy savings for measures to achieve further improvements in municipal institutions. The inclusion of these provisions in the annex to the municipal budget, or in the EMS manual, which is binding to all municipal institutions, must potentially be considered. Such an approach has the potential to motivate the management and users of the institution to take behaviour change measures (2024; REA in conjunction with all stakeholders)
• P1.11. Inventory of 100 municipal buildings every year and their potential inclusion within the boundary of EMS; this will result in information on potential new facilities for which the municipality pays energy bills (2024–2030; REA in conjunction with PD)
• P1.12. Maintenance, continuous improvement, and annual recertification of the EMS, including training municipal employees in saving energy, changing habits. To promote the engagement of employees, informal events such as energy saving competitions and annual awards for energy efficiency achievements at the institution/building level must also be organised.

At the moment, most of the municipal buildings and sites are connected to the district heating system, and the municipal government has to work with the main heat energy supplier - AS ‘Rīgas Siltums’ - to agree on a gradual transition to heat energy from renewable energy sources with proof of supply. This way, a 100% RES share can be achieved in 2030 for all municipal buildings connected to DHS. The municipality must also assess and implement other solutions in buildings with local fossil-fuel heating systems (reducing the energy consumption of the building first).  |

|   |  Action type | Short-term  |
|   |  Action description | The use of electricity in municipal buildings is the second largest source of CO2 emissions that the municipal government can reduce by having its own electricity production, for example by installing solar panels on municipal buildings or in municipal territories, and/or by implementing CO2 compensation mechanisms, such as purchasing renewable electricity whose CO2 emissions are 0. Given the fact that the price of renewable electricity could be higher than electricity from the grid, the municipal government can also introduce this measure gradually, reaching 100% in 2030 when all the electric power consumed in municipal buildings will come from RES.  |

The energy monitoring system developed as part of EMS will enable the collection of data on municipal buildings and their energy consumption, which will further make it possible for the municipal government to develop a building renovation plan for 2030. Action priorities must be clearly defined during the development of the plan, i.e., the buildings of what type, technical condition, and occupancy must be renovated first in order to achieve the greatest energy savings while improving the working conditions in them.
The implementation of the measure will not result in direct savings, but will enable the basic conditions to be met for achieving a systemic reduction in heat energy consumption through the planned measures, and improving indoor air quality in municipal buildings, especially in educational institutions.  |

Although the municipality is gradually implementing various projects for replacing the lights, their replacement will take several years at the current pace. In a few European capitals, street lighting is being modernised by signing an energy efficiency service contract, which provides both financing and energy savings.  |
RIGA

Climate-Neutrality Action

Plan

|   |  | Although the installation of street lighting in the city's streets that are still unlit will increase the total electricity consumption, the municipal government must set a goal to install energy-efficient lights on these streets. The implementation of the measure will ensure that the specific electricity consumption per light will not increase, and the municipal government will continue to meet the conditions of the EMS. This measure can also be implemented as part of the street lighting modernisation project.
The installation of streetlights in the unlit areas will lead to an increase in electricity consumption, but the main goal of this measure is to make sure that the increase is minimal by installing efficient lights and an efficient lighting system.
The installation of new street lighting and the upgrading of existing lights also requires the procurement of electricity with a certificate of origin, in order to ensure that renewable electricity is used in street lighting.  |

|  Action type | Action description | Medium-term  |
|   |  Action description | The creation of a fleet monitoring system is an important first step in making it possible for the municipal government to identify the current situation and follow its progress. Currently, there are significant deficiencies in data recording: no centralised records are kept for all vehicles; the analysis of existing information is complicated by different data storage solutions; gathering the information is manual work; no information on vehicle mileage is collected, which makes it impossible to compare transport energy consumption between institutions/vehicles using specific energy consumption indicators. Data on vehicle fleet and vehicle mileage collected during the preparation of Riga SECAP 2030 show that the utilisation of vehicles in municipal institutions and companies is often relatively low. In order to increase the efficiency of vehicle use, the tasks include not only a study of their existing utilisation but also a study of the corresponding needs, while deciding on the optimisation of the number of vehicles and other measures.  |

|  Action outline | Action name | E4: Gradual transition to the 4^{th} generation heating supply system  |
|   |  Action type | Long-term  |
|   |  Action description | DHS of Riga mostly uses a 3^{rd} generation heating line, where the temperature of the heating medium (water) is 118/70 °C. In 4^{th} generation heating lines, the heat medium has lower water temperatures (flow temperature 60–40 °C, return temperature 30–25 °C), which leads to a reduction of heat energy losses in the lines, with the possibility to introduce a heat energy surplus from other renewables sources, such as solar collectors and heat pumps. Such a concept is intended for the climatic conditions of Northern European countries, where heat energy is provided for both heating and hot water production. In general, one must promote the use of 4^{th} generation heating line solutions in DHS of Riga. The implementation of the measure by 2030 should be considered mandatory for new connections to DHS of Riga, and the installation of such a system should be considered if rebuilding heat lines or changing the heating supply system for the consumer. Cooperation with real estate developers and construction contractors must be pursued to ensure that the systems are compatible with the heating solutions of the buildings. The implementation of the measure will create a direct impact on the achievement of DHS goal: a relative reduction of losses in heating lines.  |

|   |  Action type | Medium-term  |
|   |  Action description | Taking the increase in construction costs into account, which cannot be fully covered by savings from the implementation of energy efficiency measures, one must find new solutions to reduce costs for building renovation projects. As part of this event, and in cooperation with universities and scientific institutions in Latvia and Europe, one must:
• develop pilot projects using new and innovative solutions in the heating and power supply of buildings;
• achieve the development of standard building renovation designs (standard designs for the same type or series of buildings);
• provide information on the typical solutions available for different building types, their expected advantages, shortcomings, and costs. Standardised solutions will encourage owners to work together, renovating together and organising larger-scale procurement to reduce costs;
• implement pilot projects for the standardised renovation of a block, of several buildings.
The implementation of this measure will not have a direct and immediate effect on the reduction of heat energy consumption, but this measure has a long-term effect on the achievement of climate-neutrality goals in Riga.  |

| Action type | Long-term |
| Action description | As the number of electric vehicles registered in Riga increases, the number of charging stations must increase proportionally. The availability of charging infrastructure is a prerequisite for citizens to increasingly opt for electric vehicles. The forecasts for the increase in the number of electric vehicles in Latvia are between 18 and 60,000 electric vehicles by 2030. Assuming 1 charging station per 10 electric vehicles, the number of charging stations needed is in the range of 1800–6000, a large part of which should be located in Riga. This includes both public charging stations near public buildings, car parks, etc., and municipal electric vehicles for the municipal electric vehicle fleet, and stations near residential buildings. In order to achieve the goal of climate-neutrality, it is important that the electricity used in the city is produced from renewables. |

## 3.2.5 B-2.2: Individual action outlines — Waste management and circular economy

### B-2.2.5: Individual action outlines — Waste management and circular economy

The waste and circular economy sector is covered in the Riga State City Development Programme 2022–2027, Priority 3 ‘Good environment quality and sustainable urban ecosystem to mitigate climate change’, Task 3.5 ‘Develop an environmentally-friendly waste management system’. Following the development programme, at the moment of the preparation of this action plan, a local Circular Economy Work Group was set up as part of the LET’S GO CIRCULAR! (‘Pāreja uz aprites ekonomiku’) project; the RSCM Circular Economy Action Plan 2026–2030 is also in the works, intended to define specific measures with a detailed description, which will be included in the updated climate contract in two years.

Below are the main field of action in the waste management and circular economy sector. The field of action covering the development of the regulatory framework are implemented at the national level, i.e., RCC HEC in conjunction with HED Waste Management Supervision Unit participate and facilitate the implementation of the field of action at the national level. LLC Getliņi EKO and other waste recycling companies are responsible for fields of action #A5 and #A6. The remaining fields of action are to be implemented at the municipal government level and the main entity responsible for them is RSCM HED.

### Field of action #A1: Development of a data records system and mapping of infrastructure

Data must be used as the basis for decision-making and determination of measures. The municipality has developed a municipal information system for MWGMIS, maintained by HED. The existing system needs to be significantly improved, starting with a functional audit.

In addition, it is necessary to consider the possibility of recording data on infrastructure that contribute to the reduction of waste, such as zero-packaging retail outlets, artisanal producer markets, swap and donation points for personal items and food, etc.

The main benefits of the field of action are the ability of the municipality to make data-driven decisions and the ability to use more accurate emissions calculation methodologies.

HED is in charge of developing and maintaining the data records system, working with NGOs on infrastructure that contributes to waste reduction. Other stakeholders include waste managers, local residents, businesses, food service venues, neighbourhood centres, and parties that provide data.

### Field of action #A2: Waste prevention

Waste prevention is the highest priority in the hierarchy of waste management activities. This field of action covers measures taken before a substance, material, or product becomes waste. The main benefit of the field of action is the reduction of the amount of waste produced. This is achieved by encouraging the reuse of products and extending their lifecycle.

### Field of action #A3: Improvement of the amount and quality of household waste sorting

The field of action covers the consistent provision of information and motivating of local residents, including the involvement of children and young people in waste sorting. The main benefit is the increase in the amount of well-sorted waste, thus reducing the amount of waste disposed in landfills. Particular emphasis is placed on improving the quality of biodegradable waste sorting and reducing the share of waste disposed in landfills.

### Field of action #A4: Development of sorted waste collection infrastructure

The field of action covers the promotion of waste sorting through improvements in infrastructure, making it accessible, convenient, and safe. The existing infrastructure and its efficiency will be assessed first; then, measures to expand and improve the infrastructure will be determined.

### Field of action #A5: Promotion of waste recycling
RIGA

Climate-Neutrality Action Plan

1

Cooperation with companies that form value chains for the recovery and reuse of materials. Special measures are planned for the recycling of biodegradable waste.

## Field of action #A6: Development of a Riga circular economy action plan for 2026–2030

Development and implementation of the plan (see introduction to this section).

## Field of action #A7: Integrated municipal wastewater management plan

The plan must include measures to prevent unpolluted rainwater from entering the sewer systems, including measures to promote natural water retention or accumulation, and measures to increase green and blue spaces in urban areas to reduce the overflow of rainwater or to limit impermeable surfaces in the agglomeration. Measures to better manage and to optimise the use of existing infrastructure (including sewer systems, storage capacity, urban wastewater treatment plants) must also be included to ensure that the discharge of untreated household wastewater or polluted urban wastewater into receiving bodies of water is kept to a minimum. Finally, if this is necessary to achieve the goals specified, additional mitigation measures are to be taken, including the adaptation of infrastructure for household wastewater collection, storage, and treatment, such as the connection of newly built urban areas to separation systems, or the creation of new infrastructure, prioritising green and blue infrastructure, creating ditches covered in vegetation, treatment wetlands, and accumulation ponds, designed to support biodiversity. The development of the plan will be coordinated by LLC ‘Rīgas ūdens’; this measure is linked to the improvement of energy efficiency of wastewater treatment facilities described in the municipal infrastructure field of action (P10).

## Field of action #A8 (horizontal): Provision of information and education, awareness-raising for waste generators

This field of action covers horizontal measures to be implemented in parallel with the field of action listed above. The field of action is based on building cooperation with all stakeholders, sharing experience with Latvian and foreign municipalities, and pursuing effective measures for every target group.

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

The sector covers GHG emissions and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  sequestration from green areas within the territory of RSCM and green areas outside Riga that belong to RSCM. Figure B-2.3.1 shows the green areas within the territory of Riga, and Figure B-2.3.2 shows the green areas managed by LLC 'Rīgas meži' in other municipalities.

LLC 'Rīgas meži' is a company that belongs to RSCM, which manages 5625.2 ha of forest land in the Riga state city territory, 57,166.9 ha of forest land outside Riga, as well as 399 ha of Riga's gardens and parks. At the time of preparation of the action plan, the emissions generated, and sequestration d have only been determined for these sites.

In addition to the areas managed by LLC 'Rīgas meži', there are other green (forests, meadows, orchards, scrub) and blue (water) zones within the territory of Riga, as well as approximately 5000 hectares of land under buildings and courtyards and 3000 hectares of land under roads. All this land has  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  sequestration potential and a methodology to calculate it will be developed in the coming years.

Figure B-2.3.3 shows the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions sequestration d by LLC 'Rigas meži' areas in 2017-2020. In 2019, LLC 'Rigas meži' areas sequestration d  $324\mathrm{ktCO}_{2}$  of emissions, which offset  $16\%$  of Riga's GHG emissions that year. According to LLC 'Rigas meži' estimates, the sequestration of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions will remain unchanged until 2030.

Figure B-2.3.3: sequestration of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions from areas owned by LLC 'Rigas meži'10

In 1990, all Latvian forests were owned by the state, so the sequestration of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions only came from the city of Riga. The amount of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions sequestration d by these forest areas in 1990 has not yet been precisely calculated. Assuming this as the average amount for the 2017-2020 period, the sequestration in 1990 accounted for only  $0.6\%$  of the emissions that year.

Listed below are the field of action for the green infrastructure areas managed by LLC 'Rigas meži' that will result in direct GHG emissions reductions or in the sequestration of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . The field of action are detailed in the mid-term strategy and sustainability report of LLC 'Rigas meži'.

Field of action #ZM1-#ZM3 will ensure a constant  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  sequestration until 2030, at around  $300\mathrm{ktCO}_{2}$  per year. Field of action #ZM6 focuses on climate change risk assessments and research, assessing the risks of wind, forest fire, disease, and pest damage, as well as water impact, and making appropriate (risk-based) adjustments to the planning of new forest stands and the management of existing stands. All this can significantly improve their sustainability, by increasing their life cycle and ensuring that they provide consistent  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  sequestration in the long run. Field of action #ZM7 will reduce GHG emissions from peat bog areas by up to  $40\%$ , which would amount to some  $16\mathrm{ktCO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$  per year.

$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  sequestration field of action:

Field of action #ZM1: Targeted creation of uninterrupted forest coverage, selection of sustainable planting material for forestry activity zones (LLC 'Rigas meži'; 2024–2030):

ZM1.1: Based on forest management and landscape environmental planning approaches, develop landscape design plans for operations in recreation areas.
ZM1.2: Develop the Norupe tree nursery to enable the sustainable production of seedlings adapted to climate change, and their use for the regeneration of existing forest stands and the creation of new forest stands.

Field of action #ZM2: Development of research and innovation to improve  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  sequestration in the urban environment (LLC 'Rigas meži'; 2024–2030):

ZM2.1: Study for the development of a toolbox of garden, park, green space, and waterfront management projects that contribute to the vitality of areas, and the sequestration of emissions.

|  General information  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Sector | Forestry and CO2 sequestration  |
|  Field of action name | Investigation and implementation of measures to reclaim peat bogs and manage these areas otherwise  |
|  Summary | Peat bogs account for around 85% of the sector's GHG emissions. LLC 'Rīgas meži' has carried out an assessment of ten bogs and developed bog areas, preparing an extensive description of the data and research materials for each area. Further research will be carried out to identify the best-suited reclamation options, such as renaturalisation, the creation of water reservoirs, creation of cultivated perennial grasslands, afforestation, introduction of paludiculture, growing of berries. Solutions will be selected and implemented that will contribute to the restoration of the hydrological conditions and enable long-term reductions in GHG emissions and CO2 sequestration.  |
|  Main benefits | The GHG emission reduction potential from peat bog areas is up to 40% (some 16 ktCO2e per year). The expected GHG emission reductions from peat bog restoration measures by 2035 are about 6 tCO2e/ha per year.  |

# B-3.2: Indicator metadata

REA is responsible for conducting the overall monitoring. The necessary monitoring data are prepared and submitted by the corresponding municipal specialists/departments/organisations on request.

The indicators fall into two categories:

Direct impact indicators (listed in B-3.1: Impact paths are shown bold in the table, more details in B-3.2: Impact metadata in the table).
Indirect impact indicators (listed in B-3.1: Impact paths in the table, more details in B-3.2: Indicator metadata in the table).

The data monitoring and analysis must be carried out at least once a year.

The monitoring result will inform the decisions about the budget priorities for the following year. The CCC indicators will complement the list of indicators connected the SECAP 2030 and Riga's Development programme.

# 4 Part C — Enabling Climate-Neutrality by 2030

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

### C-1.1: Enabling organisational and governance interventions

The main political responsibility for the implementation of the plan lies with the RCC chairman. The Executive Director Office, in conjunction with REA (which sets up a Climate Group), acts as the main monitoring and coordinating body, overseeing the implementation of all activities included in the plan, delegating responsibilities and tasks, coordinating any other future cooperation opportunities, and organising additional discussions on measures not accepted by all stakeholders at the sectoral level.

In order to ensure the effective and transparent implementation of the measures included in the plan, organisational charts have been prepared for each sector (see section A.3.3).

# C-1.2: Description of organisational and governance interventions

The groups involved in each sector and their interest and influence in achieving Riga's climate-neutrality targets are shown in Section A.3.1.

In order to involve as many or as diverse stakeholders as possible in the implementation of the defined measures and in the planning of new measures, representatives of the institutions in charge of each sector will identify and approach representatives of neighbourhood centres and communities, business, and service provider associations, NGOs and other organisations, such as universities and the media, which can disseminate information to an even broader share of the public.

![img-20.jpeg](img-20.jpeg)
Figure C-1.2.1: Key stakeholder groups

The following five principles for stakeholder involvement will be taken into account in the implementation of every measure by the responsible departments:

) clear and continuous communication about the purpose of the measure/action and the role of each party involved;
) planning of a joint event and deciding on further steps;
) if necessary, capacity and knowledge building, so that all stakeholders have a common understanding of the measure to be implemented;
) regular feedback on further steps and on the results achieved;
) identification and recognition of achievements, thus giving all stakeholders the motivation to continue, also highlighting the positive impact of their participation and their contribution to developing the community.

Workshops with various stakeholders were organised during the development of the action plan. Their positive assessment shows that people from different municipal departments and organisations are ready to participate in the development of their city. REA will continue to conduct similar activities in conjunction with other departments.

Simplified versions of this action plan need to be prepared for each of the main target groups (municipal and private company employees, local residents, businesses, etc.) with the purpose of explaining how each target group can participate in, contribute to, and benefit from Riga's climate-neutrality targets. REA will be responsible for preparing the communication materials.

Riga intends strengthening its cooperation with governmental and non-governmental stakeholders as part of the implementation process of this Action plan. First, the inter-institutional cooperation among different municipal entities will be activated in 2025, coordinated by the Executive Directors. This plan

has a complex governance structure and focused decision-making is required to achieve rapid progress. Second, Riga will use its established platforms to communicate and engage sectoral stakeholders – some examples are working groups established as part of development or innovation projects or advisory bodies supporting the work of the City Council. Third, Riga will use digital tools to publish and communicate its progress towards climate-neutrality. In the last few years, Riga has implemented various projects on participatory climate governance and stakeholder cooperation – these channels of communication and decision-making will be activated once this Action plan is adopted.

# 4.2 Module C-2 Social Innovation Interventions

# C.2.1: Enabling social innovation interventions

Social innovation initiatives in the scope of energy and climate are relatively underdeveloped in Riga and anywhere else in Latvia and their development requires additional attention in the future.

Table C2.1 summarises the most important social innovation initiatives at the municipal and national level. Several of these can already make a significant contribution to Riga's climate-neutrality targets, but their impacts and benefits have not been determined and analysed. There has also been no assessment of the improvements needed in this scope.

Ways to further promote social innovation for climate development in Riga:

Support the creation of innovation centres and incubators: places (physical or virtual) where people and organisations can collaborate on projects related to sustainable energy and climate. These centres serve as a platform for networking, generating ideas, and sharing resources among innovators working on climate solutions. Collaborations can be set up with existing incubators, universities, science centres, NGO, other education institutions, businesses, etc.
Strengthen cooperation with research institutions: building partnerships with universities and research institutions to use their expertise not only in climate science and technology but also in communication and public engagement. Collaboration with research institutions can improve the municipality's knowledge base and support the development of evidence-based climate solutions. Improve the availability and re-use of open data.
Create a Climate Innovation Fund: in partnership with businesses, create a special fund for investing in and supporting promising climate innovation solutions in the municipality. This would enable scaling up and further integrating consistent climate innovation in any of the sectors covered by the action plan.
Education programmes: in conjunction with NGOs, inform communities, including children and young people, about current issues in Riga. Regularly hold competitions to solve various challenges.
Regularly hold networking events: achieving Riga's ambitious climate-neutrality goals requires continuous public engagement. Networking events, co-creation workshops, forums are just some of the ways to engage with different groups and sectors of society.

Riga State City Commitment to Climate-Neutrality by 2030

# 1 Introduction

Riga has undertaken the commitment of becoming climate-neutral by 2030, as evidenced by Riga's participation in the EU Mission for 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 ('Mission') and the ambitions integrated into the city's development planning documents.

Sustainability has been important in Riga since 2008, when it was the first European capital to join the Covenant of Mayors. In 2021, Riga signed the Paris Declaration on Climate Change and renewed its commitment to the Covenant of Mayors as part of its continued implementation of climate mitigation and adaptation measures and as a sign of its ambition to continue with them.

Participation in the Mission enables Riga to learn extensively from other cities with similar ambitions, helps it mobilise the necessary experts in the field, and makes it possible to update the city's plans towards sustainable development, raising additional funding, which is one of the main obstacles to consistent emission reductions.

Since 1990, Riga State City Municipality (RSCM) has taken significant steps to reduce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, mainly by replacing fossil fuels that have a high emission factor. It is estimated that carbon emissions have decreased by $60\%$ compared to 1990.

In 2022, the RSCM 2022-2030 Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP2030) was approved in order to implement the measures in a coordinated way, setting a target of $30\%$ carbon emissions reduction compared to 2019 by 2030, which is equivalent to $70\%$ compared to 1990.

The target of the RSCM Climate City Contract (CCC) is increased to $80\%$ relative to 1990. RSCM CCC will replace SECAP2030. CCC builds upon the priority areas and emissions reduction measures already identified in the SECAP2030, adding a plan for the land use and waste sectors, adjusting the city's target upwards, to $80\%$ compared to 1990, and prescribing measures for the sequestration of $16\%$ of carbon emissions.

Riga's motivation for participating in the Mission encompasses practical benefits for the city and its residents, which will help the city mitigate various energy and climate change risks and contribute to the economic development of the city and to the health of its residents. The measures of the CCC Action Plan will lead to significant improvements in areas such as:

energy efficiency, ensuring the efficient consumption of energy, helping finance the rehabilitation and renovation of buildings;
renewable energy sources that renew quickly or are available for free, are inexhaustible, and are locally available;
circular economy, which envisages sharing, exchanging, reusing, refurbishing, renewing, and recycling existing materials and products over the longest possible period of time, extending the product life-cycle;
energy security, reducing consumption and producing energy using renewable sources significantly reduces the risks caused by various external factors (Latvia does not have its own sources of natural gas, diesel fuel, etc.);
economic development through less energy import, which will create jobs locally and boost the economy;
air quality improvements, prioritising district heating and emission-free heating sources and replacing ageing combustion plants, especially in the decentralised heating sector;
adaptation to climate change, strengthening infrastructure to mitigate the impacts of climate change and anticipate potential risks.
RIGA

Riga State City Commitment to Climate-Neutrality by 2030

Riga City Council is committed to achieving the objectives set in CCC and to implementing the measures indicated in it within the limits of the city's budget, while proactively raising external funding for the implementation of measures beyond the capacity of the budget.

As part of the Mission, Riga, together with other participants of the Mission and its international partners, has actively participated in the preparation of project applications for external funding from the European Union's support programmes.

Riga has developed good practices for the citizen participation and consultations with the active part of the civil society are an essential part of urban planning. The city understands the important role of different stakeholders in the development of its urban environment. A broad range of measures have been taken to strengthen the development and growth of neighbourhood associations involved in development planning, representing the vision of the residents of each of the neighbourhoods.

Local residents, national and regional institutions, education institutions, industry associations, NGOs, and other parties were extensively involved in the development of SECAP2030, which is the basis for CCC, with a total of 14 thematic descriptions prepared for each section of SECAP2030. 11 working group meetings were held within RSCM departments and companies, and there were 7 thematic discussions with the participation of stakeholders. 163 comments were received during the public consultations.

During the development of the CCC, the city publicly encourages everyone to participate in co-creation workshops to achieve the broadest possible participation. More than 130 stakeholders responded to the call, representing academic, research, national and regional government institutions, industry associations and NGOs, RSCM departments, businesses and start-ups, as well as active individual residents of Riga expressed their interest in participating. 6 co-creation workshops were held, for which 6 thematic descriptions for each of the sector were prepared. 347 comments were received from the participants of the co-creation workshops and these were incorporated into the final version of the CCC. The measures initiated as part of the co-creation process have been validated in the modelling tool developed by the European City Calculator project. A public consultation on the CCC will be carried out.

Since the approval of SECAP2030, RSCM has implemented an energy management system certified according to ISO 50001, and the energy cost savings have been allocated to the climate programme to help finance the measures planned for municipal buildings as part of SECAP2030. A one-stop-shop agency has been established to promote the energy retrofits of multi-apartment residential buildings, and binding regulations have been approved for prioritising district heating and zero-emission heat pumps. Urban meadows have been created and many other pilot projects have been implemented.

# 2 Target: climate-neutrality by 2030

Riga's target is to achieve a 53% CO₂ emissions reduction compared to 2019, which at the same time means a CO₂ emissions reduction by 80% compared to 1990 and the achievement of climate-neutrality in municipal infrastructure. Forest areas are additionally planned to be used to provide a constant sequestration of CO₂ of around 300 ktCO₂ per year by 2030. This provides a 16% reduction in CO₂ emissions compared to the total emissions in 2019.

The city's target encompasses its entire administrative territory, including CHP-2, which is physically located outside the administrative territory of Riga, but supplies heating energy to the city. The emissions records cover all CO₂ emissions resulting from the energy consumed within the administrative territory of Riga, as well as emissions resulting from waste management and carbon sequestration in forests outside the administrative territory of the RSCM that are owned by the municipal company LLC 'Rīgas meži'. The plan also covers companies in the ETS sector. CCC considers the following sectors in detail:

Heating energy generation and consumption
Electricity consumption
Transport energy consumption
Land use
Waste management

The climate targets are coordinated with municipal companies that integrate them into their own sustainable development strategies. Some of the targets can be achieved within the existing capacities and resources, while others can be implemented with external funding, so their achievement depends to a large extent on the availability of funding at the national and EU level.

Implementation of the actions identified in CCC will not only reduce CO₂ emissions, but also diminish energy costs. Increasing the share of renewable energy sources will help move towards energy independence and reduce dependence on fossil fuels, which are not available to the country and have to be imported. Reducing imports is expected to have a positive impact on the economy and increase prosperity for every member of the public.

According to the World Health Organisation¹, air pollution has a negative impact on people's health. The implementation of the planned climate activities will reduce air pollution and improve the long-term health of the population, thus reducing the cost of healthcare.

The city has implemented the Kausal climate platform to coordinate the activities. It is used internally to coordinates the implementation of the activities set out in the CCC, and it informs local residents about the measures planned and their status, making it possible to track the overall indicators on the path towards climate neutrality.

# 3 Strategic priorities

The strategic priorities for the State City of Riga to achieve the targets set in the CCC are as follows:

energy efficiency: renovation and improved energy efficiency of buildings;
sustainable mobility: provision of electric car infrastructure and decarbonisation of public transport;
renewable energy sources: switching to renewable energy sources such as zero-emission heat sources in heat supply, solar and wind power for the generation of electricity.

Each priority sets specific fields of action, measures and targets to reduce emissions. The following measures are expected to be implemented in the next 2–3 years:

In the housing sector, which is the largest energy consumer in the city, promotion of energy efficiency and renovation of housing are some of the municipality's priorities. Riga has set up a one-stop-shop agency to provide critical support to local residents to facilitate the renovation of buildings. The European Investment Bank’s ELENA project is planned to be implemented, expanding support and the scope of service provided to renovate more buildings, and pilot neighbourhood renewal projects will take place.
By 2027, in the field of sustainable mobility, it is planned to create a low-emissions zone, develop park-and-ride car park and mobility points, as well as cycle path connections with the suburbs, expand the electric charging network, and replace the existing public transport vehicle fleet.
In the field of energy production, it is planned to develop zero-emission technologies and continue increasing the share of renewable energy in district heating in the coming years. Pilot projects will be carried out to introduce new technologies and modernise the heating supply system, gradually transitioning to a 4th generation heating system.
In waste management, priority will be given to measures aimed at improving the quantity and quality of household waste sorting through the development of separate waste collection infrastructure. At the same time, extensive waste prevention measures will be implemented in households, as well as the public and private sectors.
A comprehensive action plan for 2026–2030 is currently being developed for the field of circular economy, intended to foster a systemic shift towards a circular economy by integrating its principles across sectors and fields, raising public awareness and support, and working towards a shift in consumer culture.
In the field of greening the urban environment, an action plan is being developed, and the rehabilitation of green spaces outside the city centre will continue.

The municipality's companies, including AS 'Rīgas siltums', which is only partly owned by the municipality, are important stakeholders. The majority of emissions generated in the city are the responsibility of these companies, so they can have a direct impact on reducing these emissions.
RIGA
Riga State City Commitment to Climate-Neutrality by 2030

# 4 Process and principles

In order to ensure the effective and transparent implementation of the fields of action and measures included in the CCC Action Plan, a detailed organisational chart is prepared for each sector as part of the development of the CCC Action Plan, taking into account the main stakeholders involved in the fields of action and measures, and their interactions.

The unifying element for coordinating the implementation of all sector measures is the executive director of Riga, who directly manages all department heads, agencies, and other executive bodies, and is the shareholder in the municipality's companies. The Riga Energy Agency, which is responsible for the implementation of the CCC, will inform the executive director of the priority measures, and the executive director will assign them to the institutions to take charge of their implementation.

In order for Riga to achieve its climate goals, the following horizontal aspects will be taken into account and integrated into the measure planning and implementation process:

Stakeholder participation: In order to involve as many or as diverse stakeholders as possible in the implementation of the measures identified in the CCC Action Plan and in the planning of new measures, representatives of the institutions in charge of each sector will identify and approach the main stakeholders, including representatives of neighbourhood centres and communities that combine and represent the interest of various social groups, as well as business and service provider associations representing business interests, and NGOs and other organisations, such as universities, which can disseminate information to an even broader share of the public.
Social innovations: The opportunities that will be assessed and developed will include support for the creation of innovation centres and incubators; opening up of data to foster innovation; strengthening of cooperation with research institutions; setting up of climate innovation funds; development of education programmes; organisation of regular networking events.

Following the signing of the CCC, the next steps for RSCM are as follows:

Provide an active and capable organisational structure for implementing and supervising the CCC Action Plan.
Prepare visually attractive, simplified, and abbreviated versions of this plan for different target groups (municipality departments and companies, local residents, businesses, etc.), which each target group can review to understand how they can contribute to Riga's climate neutrality goals.
Start the implementation of the actions identified in the fields of action, involving all the social stakeholders identified in conducting priority actions, including the monitoring of the measures.

The CCC Action Plan will be updated every 2–3 years based on GHG emissions data and the results of the monitoring of measures taken, with more actions added if necessary.
