# C1 Introductory note

## The City's Commitments and Targets

Lisbon has the vision and ambition of becoming a sustainable, resilient, inclusive, climate-neutral city by 2030, reinforcing its leadership position in climate matters both at European level and globally.

After joining the Covenant of Mayors in 2009, Lisbon has been following a path that has included signing several commitments and targets on Climate and Energy matters, including the Paris Climate Agreement goals, joining the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Network, and approving the Action Plan for Sustainable Energy and Climate (PAESC), which later evolved into the 2030 Climate Action Plan (PAC2030), and now into the Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030.

In 2020 Lisbon was awarded with the European Green Capital Award, distinguishing the city's transformation to improve its urban environment and climate resilience. In the wake of this distinction, Lisbon created the "Lisbon Green Commitment," namely by challenging civil society, Businesses, organizations, associations and institutions, both public and private, to join the city's climate agenda for this decade.

The 2030 Climate Action Plan (PAC2030), approved in 2022, was a strategic planning instrument for local climate action, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 70% by 2030, compared to the reference year of 2002, plus the goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050.

Lisbon's accession in 2022 to the "EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change" highlights the importance of climate resilience in the Municipality's strategy and its interdependence vis-a-vis other levels of governance and sectors of activity.

Presently, Lisbon remains committed to energy transition, climate adaptation, and enhancing the value of the environment, making its local contribution to the convergence of the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal targets.

## The 'Cities Mission' Challenge

The European Commission has officially launched five "European Missions," i.e., innovative initiatives to face global challenges in health, climate and environment, which include the "EU Mission for climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030," also known as the "Cities Mission." In November 2021, it invited all European cities to join this Mission, thus recognizing that cities are the territorial and administrative entities best positioned to implement policies for achieving climate neutrality.

Lisbon accepted the challenge and was selected as one of the "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030." To this end, it must implement policies and measures that anticipate climate neutrality, in conjunction with other public environmental policies at a regional, national and international level, and establish itself as a centre for experimentation and innovation in the field of climate action.

This enormous challenge commits Lisbon itself, the City Council, citizens and their representatives, Businesses and institutions, research centres, the Media, and the community as a whole, to go much further in the development, implementation and monitoring the Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030 (LISBON CCC2030), which defines the path to be followed to bring the climate neutrality goal forward in the city by 2030.

To achieve climate neutrality Lisbon must equalize the total GHG emissions generated by its activities with its carbon sequestration capacity (net emissions equal to zero), which will require

Version n.3 – March 2024

CITIES

substantial reductions in emissions by at least 80%, while increasing its carbon sink areas and carbon sequestration capacity, and investing in offsetting schemes (for residual emissions).

The Vision for Lisbon's climate transition is based on the following targets and objectives:

Reduce GHG emissions by 80%, compared to 2002 (baseline), bringing the climate neutrality goal forward by 2030;
Adapt the city to extreme climate events, by increasing its resilience to climate risks (both current and future), and its response capacity;
Ensure a fair, inclusive transition, combating inequalities and mitigating energy poverty;
Value participation in the "Mission 100 cities with a neutral impact on climate by 2030," as a strategy to attract new investments and talents.

To achieve this goal, Lisbon shall foster partnerships that facilitate commitments and shared responsibility for climate transition, actively involving public and private entities, research centres, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), citizens, and the entire community. And it is in this context that the Sustainable Lisbon Platform (Lisbon Green Deal) plays a fundamental role.

## Lisbon needs everyone

The impact of each citizen, of each organization per se, on the city's total emissions may be limited, but as a whole it can have consequences and limit or accelerate Lisbon's climate transformation.

Therefore, to achieve the Mission's goals, everyone must commit to a joint, comprehensive climate action, involving partners, public and private entities, universities, research centres, non-governmental organizations, and citizens.

Lisbon's climate action will therefore be based on the active, informed participation of the local community, Businesses, institutions, associations and civil society, in the debate, co-creation and implementation of measures and projects that can accelerate the energy transition, the sustainable expansion of energy renewable sources, first of all by investing in Lisbon's enormous solar potential, climate adaptation, environmental protection, safeguarding natural capital and ecosystem services, as well as circularity of materials.

Lisbon's climate action must also be asserted at global level, so that the city may play a relevant role in the development of public policies and business commitments, and, above all, to enhance the value of Lisbon and, along with it, that of all the organizations that are part of it, making its voice heard, and encouraging and inspiring other cities in their climate transition.

To this end, Lisbon keeps counting on all the organizations that subscribed the Lisbon Sustainable Businesses Platform, to work together within the scope of the Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030 and of its main objective, which is to bring the climate neutrality goal forward by 2030.

# C2 Target: Climate Neutrality by 2030

Lisbon's approach to the 2030 climate neutrality target essentially aims to explain how the city will deal with the gap between the current GHG inventory, existing and planned measures, and the 2030 climate neutrality target.

Lisbon's climate neutrality target for 2030 assumes a 80% reduction in GHG emissions compared to the reference year 2002 (Baseline), with the corresponding level of residual emissions equivalent to 20% of emissions compared to 2002. This option takes the following into account:

GHG emission inventories (GPC methodology) and emission scenarios for 2030, prepared within the scope of current and planned climate policy instruments;
The reduction targets already established within the scope of instruments already developed and in force (PAC2030);
The need to define a set of additional measures (considering a joint strategy of mitigation, adaptation, and some transversal measures) in order to — together with the measures already implemented, under implementation, and planned — bring forward the neutrality target by 2030.

The 2030 climate neutrality target includes the entire Municipal territory, and covers the 'GPC BASIC' reporting level, including Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (waste).

Figure 1 illustrates Lisbon's approach to the climate neutrality scenario for 2030. All three 2030 Lisbon PAC scenarios (defined in a top-down approach) point to an emissions reduction (compared to the 2002 baseline) between 58% (Cen.B - BAU) and 71% (Cen.NL). Bringing forward the neutrality target implies an additional reduction (Cen.N30).

To meet the neutrality target, Lisbon must achieve at least an 80% reduction; which corresponds to an emission level, in 2030, of 747 ktCO2e (80% reduction compared to 2002; or 61% compared to 2019). Therefore, additional reductions in the amount of 352 ktCO2e ('GAP' compared to existing and planned policies) will be required.

Foster the development of an integrated, connected, accessible multimodal ecosystem, integrating active, public and shared transport modes, in order to make life easier for Lisbon residents, promoting efficient and comfortable mobility, focused on their needs, while being sustainable at the same time.

Reduce commuting traffic entering Lisbon, by building dissuasive parking lots on the outskirts of the city, evolving towards a more attractive and multimodal typology, in conjunction with neighbouring Municipalities.

Optimize school, university and business traffic flows:
Adopt new work policies in CML institutions, with an impact on mobility standards;
Promote new workplace mobility policies with major employers to reduce commuting and peaks during rush hours.

Promote electric mobility by increasing charging stations and dedicated locations for innovative projects.

Improve accessibility to public transport, continuing with the tariff changes already introduced, such as the creation of a single, low-cost metropolitan transport ticket, with free access for children up to 12 years of age and for citizens over 65.

Adopt best practices in urban smart strategies, where data, technology and connectivity can allow more accurate planning, reaching a larger number of users.

Continue with the development of the Sustainable Lisbon Platform, the City's mobilization forum, Citizen's Council, with a view to co-deciding the city's shared sustainability goals, mobilizing citizens, Businesses, confederations from all sectors with relevant activity in the city, NGOs, neighbourhood associations, universities and school representatives at all levels of education.

Keep implementing measures that promote energy transition through:
Improved energy performance of buildings and other facilities;
Increase the number of electric vehicles;
Installation of LED lamps in all street lighting poles;
Improve the thermal insulation of buildings, particularly residential buildings, reducing expenditure on electricity consumption and increasing the thermal well-being and environmental health of its inhabitants;
Democratize access to the production of electrical energy from renewable sources, by encouraging the creation of producer cooperatives and supporting existing ones.

Continue with the Solar City programme, taking advantage of the city's natural potential for this resource, namely by:
Increasing the installed capacity of photovoltaic solar energy;
Promoting photovoltaic systems for self-consumption in social housing buildings, schools, and hospitals;
Producing photovoltaic energy on municipal pilots and buildings/facilities to supply collective public transports.

neutral and smart cities” and of the “Adaptation to Climate Change Mission,” with emphasis on:

Using the best available knowledge for carrying out analyses of current climate risks and those predicted to be amplified by climate change in the city of Lisbon, and promote public access to the results;
Using such knowledge to support the community, citizens, entrepreneurs, researchers and political decision-makers in designing and implementing adaptation measures;
Supporting the demonstration and application of innovative adaptation solutions;
Participating in exchanges of experiences and collaborative activities with other cities and regions.

# C3 Principles, Priorities, and the Participatory Process

Fulfilling the commitments undertaken by Lisbon for climate neutrality by 2030, with a direct impact at national and international level, constitutes a quite ambitious strategy not only for the City, but also for the organization itself and its employees, all its inhabitants, workers, students, and also the visitors who seek it. By taking on these commitments, Lisbon is taking co-responsibility in meeting the decarbonization and climate change adaptation goals, which impose:

Bringing forward to 2030 actions and measures defined by the PAC2030 for 2050;
Implementing additional actions and measures to reinforce mitigation, adaptation and transversal interventions in response to current and future challenges;
Rethinking the municipal budget, prioritizing planned actions and monitoring the respective implementation stages;
Continuing with the integration of financing from public (own revenues, subsidies and contributions), EU, and private (including loans) sources into the multi-annual investment plan for the coming years;
Prioritizing structuring projects, based on integrated, scalable and replicable actions, with scrupulously monitored schedules to allow for their timely completion;
Pursuing the Lisbon Participates strategy, with specific, inclusive, innovative, diversified actions, allowing the involvement of citizens, Businesses, universities and other key actors in the construction of the Lisbon ecosystem;
Continuing with the commitment aimed at Businesses and organizations, a strategy of joint mobilization in decision-making regarding the prioritization of investments and interventions to be followed;
Continuing with the strategy of individual and social accountability;
Making the Lisbon City Council more sustainable, resilient, a driver of change, and an accelerator of leadership.

The joint commitment already includes the involvement of the Municipality of Lisbon, society and of citizens themselves, fundamental pieces for the implementation of the respective Climate City Contract based on the key principles of accountability, transparency, justice, inclusion, innovation, and co-creation.

CITIES

The key actors already involved and to keep involving include political decision-makers, technical officers, researchers, experts, the Media, representatives of citizens, minorities, men and women, young people, and families, both national and foreign.

To this end, there are several ongoing citizenship initiatives that call for everyone's participation in Lisbon's commitment to carbon neutrality by 2030.

# Lisbon, a sustainable, resilient, inclusive, fair city that is accelerating climate neutrality until 2030

The challenge is launched through programmes, services, community initiatives and protocols with the involvement of multiple players and citizen representatives, which call for participation and training in the fields of environment, sustainability, climate resilience, energy, circular economy, citizenship, and participation. It is worth highlighting the Citizens' Council, the Participatory Budget, municipal meetings, municipal councils, collaborative networks, the Lisbon Commitment Agenda – Climate Action 2030, systematizing the work carried out or in progress by all of the municipality's Units, and the Sustainable Lisbon commitment. It is also worth noting the regular adherence to European and national initiatives in the field of sustainability awareness, such as the European Car-Free Day or the National Sustainability Day.

Based on exhaustive monitoring, it has been possible to overcome barriers, promote the city, and reinforce joint learning.

# C4 Signatories and Stakeholder Commitments

The joint commitment to bring forward climate neutrality to 2030 includes the involvement of the Municipality of Lisbon, society, and of citizens themselves, all of which are critical pieces for implementing the respective Climate City Contract 2030 based on the key principles of accountability, transparency, justice, inclusion, innovation, and co-creation.

The key actors already involved and to keep involving include political decision-makers, technical officers, researchers, experts, the Media, representatives of citizens, minorities, men and women, young people, and families, both national and foreign, all of which have an active, facilitating role.

Based on the assumption that "more active citizens strengthen local power"; Lisbon bases the development of its Climate City Contract 2030 on participatory processes with involvement at all levels, namely, neighbourhoods, parishes, the city itself, the metropolitan area, the country and the EU. The challenge is launched through programmes, services, community initiatives and protocols with the involvement of multiple players and citizen representatives, calling for participation and training in the fields of environment, sustainability, climate resilience, energy, circular economy, citizenship and participation. Several ongoing initiatives are worth being highlighted, such as the Citizens' Council, the Participatory Budget, the municipal meetings, the municipal councils, and collaborative networks.

Internally, the Lisbon Commitment Agenda — Climate Action 2030 systematizes the work carried out or ongoing by all the municipality's Units and the Sustainable Lisbon commitment, with 237 commitments already made.

instruments to achieve the city's objectives, fostering partnerships that facilitate commitments and shared responsibility for climate transition, and actively involve public and private entities, research centres, NGOs, citizens and others.

The Commitment undertaken by Lisbon under this Climate City Contract is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) described in the Local SDG Platform.

Table 2 summarizes data on the Commitments under the Sustainable Lisbon Platform and frames them in the context of the Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030.

Citizen involvement, through 2 Citizen Councils, demonstrates a clear position regarding the importance of their participation in designing and implementing climate policies. This is an innovative, differentiated initiative for citizen participation, inviting the co-construction of proposals for the city of Lisbon. It was launched in 2022 by the executive of the City Council of Lisbon, as the first assembly of citizens organized locally, with the 1st edition focused on "Climate Change," and the 2nd edition on the "15-Minute City," which, considering its success, will continue in future editions.

The Volunteering Bank project for the City of Lisbon emerged in 2003 and works by publicizing the link between supply and demand for volunteering opportunities, supporting the recruitment of volunteers and their placement in projects. It also promotes, in collaboration with other local, national and international entities, initiatives aimed at reflecting on, sharing and disseminating best practices in the field of volunteering.

An initiative of the Lisbon City Council, its guidelines include an active policy for social inclusion, boosting coordination with public and social partners, creating a support network and providing an opportunity for civic participation.

Volunteering focuses on several areas, with emphasis on the environment, with specific actions, scheduled at the request of interested parties that, in an articulated way, allow participants to collaborate in environmental conservation tasks, cleaning, and maintenance of green areas, among other volunteer services.

The action in Lisbon is part of other inclusive initiatives involving the participation of different organic units directed towards various vulnerable groups and their representatives in support of the definition of inclusive municipal policy. This policy is inseparable from climate resilience and carbon neutrality, with co-benefits at the social, economic, environmental, health, biodiversity, and ecosystem levels, among others. In this context, in addition to the previously mentioned initiatives, the following stand out:

BIP/ZIP Program: Targeted at the population of neighborhoods and Priority Intervention Areas of Lisbon, created in 2011 by the municipality as a tool for municipal public policy. Its aim is to stimulate partnerships and small local interventions to improve the habitats covered. This is done by supporting projects carried out by parish councils, local associations, collectives, and non-governmental organizations, contributing to the strengthening of socio-territorial cohesion in the municipality (Energia BIP/ZIP: BIP/ZIP Program (lisboa.pt)).

One Square in Each Neighborhood: Directed at local interventions in public spaces, the program proposes to organize a meeting point for the local community based on a square, street, commercial area, neighborhood garden, or an existing or planned collective facility (Câmara Municipal de Lisboa, Urbanism, Public Space, One Square in Each Neighborhood - MUNICÍPIO de LISBOA).

Municipal Housing Council (CMH): Established as an advisory space for participation and dialogue that allows the Municipality of Lisbon to permanently and structurally listen to all social partners in the housing sector. It responds to the right to housing enshrined in Article 65 of the Portuguese Constitution. The council includes relevant partners such as residents' associations, cooperatives, property and tenant associations, municipal deputies from various political forces, various civic organizations, among others.

Municipal Council for Interculturality and Citizenship: Instrument for reinforcing immigrant integration policies, respecting different identities, integrating various associations, and promoting their active participation in the civic life of the city (Participation - Citizenship (lisboa.pt)).

Municipal Council for the Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities: Aiming to promote and value the citizenship and participation of people with disabilities and their nonprofit organizations representing the Municipality of Lisbon. This is in the construction of city policies and the implementation of policies and measures facilitating their social inclusion (Participation - Citizenship (lisboa.pt)).

Municipal Plan for Gender Equality (PMIG): An action plan for the promotion of gender equality supported by a Local Gender Equality Diagnosis in the Municipality of Lisbon. It is the result of the demands of partner entities of the Equality Working Group of the Municipal Council for Equality (PMIG_13agosto2020 (lisboa.pt)).

Social Network of Lisbon: A program with the purpose of combating poverty and promoting social inclusion from a local social development perspective. It is based on broad, effective, and dynamic partnership work and aims at the strategic planning of social intervention coordinated among different agents for local social development (Participation - Citizenship (lisboa.pt)).

At international level, twinning and connecting Lisbon to other cities cements relationships of exchange, cooperation and solidarity, contributing to fostering mutual trust, friendship and understanding at both personal and civic level. It also helps celebrate and strengthen the strong historical and cultural ties that unite cities, and to recognize mutual interests in trade, industry and education, among many other areas.

Taking up joint responsibility for meeting the decarbonization and climate change adaptation targets, agreed by the Municipality of Lisbon at local, regional, national and international levels, constitutes an ambitious strategy launched by the city, for the city. Only with continued, quality, innovative, inclusive, efficient involvement has the Municipality and its employees, the various levels of government, the private sector, citizens, other cities and regions, academic and research institutions, the Media and others, taken definitive steps on the path to climate neutrality, without losing identity.

The key actors, already committed with the Municipality of Lisbon, united to share responsibilities and overcome targets are described in Annex 1B_LXcommitments.

This responsibility is joined by the various departments and respective employees of the Lisbon City Council, as well as by municipal Businesses, public and private entities, and research centres that have already signed the commitment to implement initiatives leading to lower emissions and climate resilience.

As a complement to this challenge, many other institutional relationships, partnerships, signed agreements and shared responsibility movements have also joined, which have contributed to the 2020-30 commitment.

With this joint effort, it is estimated that Lisbon will keep bringing down its emissions, as a result of the implementation of strategic measures, regional, local and neighbourhood initiatives, and the adoption of more environmentally friendly behaviours. At the same time, it will keep improving the quality of life of its population, maintaining the city's identity, reinforcing biodiversity and less artificialized ecosystems, ensuring the continuity of existing resources.

Given their great diversity, commitments were classified by governance level as local, national, and international, thus demonstrating the relevant interdependencies that exist to deconstruct sectoral and territorial "silos".

The next steps include:

Strengthening the project team, with greater proximity in daily work;
Investing in inclusive, fair participation;
Reinforcing the commitments signed with and for the Municipality, both internal and external to the Municipality, based on what is proposed in this Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030;
Increase monitoring based on KPIs to evaluate performance and innovation;
The continued implementation of a communication plan aimed at different audiences, based on different channels.

## Serving People

Lisbon, by continuing to engage in politics with the people, will reinforce the strategy of participation, involvement and mobilization of its citizens around common objectives and commitments, in designing solutions to respond assertively to the city's main problems, which are seen as priorities, such as climate challenges.

This ongoing municipal strategy, aimed at climate change, will continue to value the active citizenship component and the involvement of different actors, with strong investment in participatory processes at different levels of governance, in which discussion and co-decision making will play a central role in the future of the city, parishes, and neighbourhoods of Lisbon.

# AP1 Introductory Note

Cities currently have an increased responsibility in creating solutions for change and must establish themselves as innovative, scalable, replicable centres in responding to current and future climate challenges.

Lisbon, as a city and experimentation centre, has the responsibility, capacity, and ambition to strengthen its leadership in this climate process, side by side with the cities that have joined the "EU Mission for climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030," which have jointly committed to carbon neutrality by 2030. These cities are joined by other cities, at both European and global level, which are also leaders.

Ensure that Lisbon becomes a sustainable, resilient, inclusive, fair city:

requires continued, joint involvement, action and investment to exceed the agreed targets,
ensures reinforcing the city's position,
obliges us to do so with and for citizens.

With this vision, Lisbon took up the commitment — along with its citizens, employees, residents, students, tourists and visitors — of reviewing the PAC2030, currently in force, and to implement a new Climate Contract. More ambitious, in terms of Action, Investment, Commitment and Involvement, in order to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. To this end, a strategy to reduce climate emissions by 80% by 2030, and a target of neutrality by 2050 is required.

With this framework, Lisbon intends to comply with what is set forth in the Climate Base Law, regarding the mandatory approval of its Municipal Climate Action Plan.

Making change and serving people requires a commitment to keep making Lisbon into a more participatory city, a more sustainable city, a supportive city that invests in health and education, a city of culture, economy and innovation, a safe, resilient city that responds to the challenge of being one of the 100 European cities that have committed to being carbon neutral by 2030. This is the strategy for Lisbon 2030, based on 6 interconnected strategic pillars responding to climate challenges.

# AP2 A shared, enriched Mission with over 20 years of initiatives valuing the Environment and Climate Action

The commitments undertaken by Lisbon, within the scope of Climate Change, and the results of their implementation are as follows:

In 2009, Lisbon signed the Covenant of Mayors, an initiative focused on mitigating emissions (Resolution No. 994/CM/2008, published in Municipal Bulletin No. 772);
In 2014, Lisbon signed the Mayor's Adapt declaration an initiative aimed at adapting to climate change in urban areas (Resolution No. 468/CM/2014, published in Municipal Bulletin No. 1067);
In 2015, Lisbon signed the Compact of Mayors initiative, the largest global platform of cities aimed at promoting the reduction of emissions, monitoring the progress achieved, and preparing for adaptation to climate change (Resolution No. 571/CM/2015, published in Municipal Bulletin No. 1128);

In 2016, Lisbon signed the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, thus committing to reducing CO₂ emissions (and possibly other greenhouse gases) in its territory by at least 40% by 2030 (Resolution No. 331/CM/2016, published in Municipal Bulletin No. 1168);
Also in 2016, it developed and approved the Local Action Plan for Biodiversity (PALB, 2016);
In 2017, Lisbon approved the Municipal Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (EMAAC), in the context of the “ClimAdaPT.local” project, intending to integrate the strategy into municipal planning tools, as well as to empower municipal services and to integrate local actors (Resolution No. 232/AML/2017, published in the 4th Supplement to Municipal Bulletin No. 1224);
In 2018, Lisbon approved the Action Plan for Sustainable Energy and Climate (PAESC), a mandatory instrument under the Global Covenant of Mayors for Energy and Climate. The PAESC brings together, frames and proposes, with regard to climate mitigation, a set of strategic objectives and targets in the areas of reducing emissions and primary energy consumption, and reviews the commitment to reduce CO₂ emissions by 60% by 2030 (Resolution No. 241/AML/2018, published in the 5th Supplement to Municipal Bulletin No. 1271);
In 2019, Lisbon signed the “Deadline 2020 — Commitment to the Climate Action Plan” established by the C40 network to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement that establishes 2020 as a target for defining and starting to implement climate action plans to limit the increase in global average temperatures to 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels, and to make all efforts to limit the temperature increase to just 1.5°C (Resolution No. 007/AML/2019, published in the 2nd Supplement to Municipal Bulletin No. 1304);
Also in 2019, Lisbon joined the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Network, following the approval of its application by the C40 Steering Committee, within which it committed to developing the PAC2030, an instrument focused on 4 major pillars — Mitigation; Adaptation; Benefits, Inclusion, Equity and Fair Transition; Governance, Resources and Mobilization (Resolution No. 183/AML/2019, published in the 2nd Supplement to Municipal Bulletin No. 1316);
Also in 2019, on a regional scale, and within the specific scope of adaptation, the city of Lisbon — among the 18 municipalities in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area — signed the commitment to adapt the Metropolitan Area of Lisbon (AML) to climate change, according to the action principles of the Metropolitan Adaptation Plan to Climate Change. Recognizing the global climate emergency, the signatories consider that it is urgent to adapt the metropolitan territory to climate change and to reduce its vulnerabilities, as well as the exposure of communities to risks, acting in a continuous, articulated manner at intermunicipal level;
For the purpose of submission to public consultation and subsequent submission to the Municipal Assembly, Lisbon has approved the PAC2030 in 2021, which reflects the “one-decade commitment” to making the Portuguese capital a “neutral, resilient, inclusive” city. This Plan reinforces the GHG reduction target for 2030, accelerating the initial path to neutrality by 2050. Lisbon thus establishes a more ambitious target of a 70% reduction of its emissions by 2030 compared to the base year of 2002 (Resolution No. 443/2021, published in the 1st Supplement to Municipal Bulletin No. 1429);
In 2022, the PAC2030 was unanimously approved, a strategic instrument for the Municipality's climate policy and strategy in force;

That same year, Lisbon was selected to join the “EU Mission for climate-neutral and smart cities”, thus joining a group of 100 cities committed to finding joint solutions, and to positioning themselves at the forefront of innovation and of transition to climate neutrality by 2030.

Also in 2022, Lisbon joined the "Mission Adaptation to Climate Change: challenges and opportunities for regions and communities," thus joining the first 118 regions and local authorities eligible to sign the Mission Charter.

In 2023, Lisbon is appointed as mentor city for the "Intelligent Cities Challenge community," a European Commission initiative that supports European cities in the green and digital transition of their local economies, through local green deals.

Within the scope of the 'Cities Mission,' Lisbon is preparing the approval of the Climate City Contract, which represents a set of commitments aimed at fulfilling the climate neutrality goals by 2030, co-created with various stakeholders and interested parties, and supported by the 2030 Action Plan for Climate Neutrality, by the 2030 Investment Plan for Climate Neutrality, and by the 2030 Investment Plan for Climate Neutrality. The Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030 is an updated, strategic, flexible document, aligned with the PAC2030 and with other key instruments of the Municipality, such as the current 'Major Planning Options' (GOP), and with other strategic guidelines for the region and the country, centred on climate action.

Like other intersectoral action strategies adopted by the city of Lisbon, identified in the 'Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission Call for Expression of Interest,' considered relevant to the area of climate action and for the reduction of GHG emissions, it is important to mention the Sustainable Urban Mobility Action Plan (PAMUS) and the strategy for Mobility 2030 (MOVE Lisbon). "The option for smarter mobility that ensures maximum accessibility with minimum impacts has become a critical commitment for Lisbon. The city has already implemented many measures promoting more sustainable mobility."

It is also worth highlighting the alignment of the climate strategy with the 'Plan for the Improvement of Air Quality in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley Region,' a mandatory legal document for the city of Lisbon, as a urban conglomeration whose levels of one or more pollutants are found to be higher than the limit values, requiring the preparation of the respective execution programme, defining the actions to be carried out, their respective schedule, as well as the identification of the entities responsible for their execution, as well as the indicators for assessing their effectiveness.

# Lisbon's commitment to climate action is also visible at international level

As previously described, and in addition to what has been mentioned above, it is important to mention that the continued work with international networks, projects, partnerships and protocols prove the climate policy adopted by the Municipality, whose dissemination and sharing, carried out through different communication channels and media, reinforces the ongoing policy and helps it to secure a leadership position.

It is important to highlight that Lisbon is an active member of the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, under which the city approved and submitted its Action Plan for Energy and Climate. It also participates in various networks, such as ICLEI — Local Governments for Sustainability —, EUROCITIES — a network of European cities for the development of common projects —, the Urban Water Agenda 2030, and C40 Cities, which are critical points for sharing and learning best practices and for agreeing on articulated climate policies, with a focus on resilience and sustainability.

By joining the C40 city network in 2019, Lisbon committed itself to global mobilization and climate emergency, by signing the following documents:

"Deadline 2020" — Commitment to the Climate Action Plan [Jan 2019];
"Global Green New Deal" [Oct 2019];
"C40 Clean Air Cities" Declaration [Oct 2019];
"C40 Clean Air Accelerator" Declaration (2021);
"C40 Renewable Energy Accelerator" Declaration (2022)
"C40 Water Safe Cities Accelerator" Declaration (intended to be signed in Oct 2023).

The European Commission, by officially launching five European Missions, and Lisbon, by embracing two of them, places in the hands of the city and of its citizens, some of the most ambitious challenges defined to date, namely the construction of "Smart Cities with a neutral impact on climate" and the local response to "Adaptation to Climate Change".

Within the scope of Missions:

On January 27, 2022, Lisbon signed the Commitment with the "EU Mission on Climate-Neutral Smart Cities";
On December 15, 2022, Lisbon signed the City of Lisbon Charter for "Adaptation to Climate Change Mission";
On April 13, 2023, Lisbon submitted the Letter of "Support to the Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities' to be addressed to the Project Group of Commissioners on Research and Innovation".

With extensive experience and strong involvement with the UN SDGs and with the seven clear goals and four action priorities to prevent new disaster risks and reduce existing ones defined in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-30, Lisbon believes that the success of European Missions requires a joint effort, which simultaneously feeds back into common public policies, to prioritize the intervention of new global solutions, in response to the call of the Paris Agreement.

On May 9, 2023, Lisbon reiterated its commitment to climate neutrality on Europe Day, at the international meeting organized by the Municipality on the role of cities in the European Challenge for Climate Neutrality in 2030.

Other highlights:

In 2018, Lisbon won the European Mobility Week, for larger municipalities, with the program presented at the European Mobility Week, with emphasis on promoting the use of bicycles in the city in several initiatives, with the opening of new bike sharing stations, of new, expanded bike lanes, and 800 new bike parking spaces, accompanied by an effective communications campaign.
In 2020, Lisbon won the World Smart City Award with the investment made in the smart cities component, in terms of sharing data from smart technologies, including the Internet of Things (IOT) and Information Technologies (IT) to improve service efficiency, minimize the emission of polluting gases, and improve its citizens' quality of life.
In 2020, Lisbon was awarded the 2020 European Green Capital award, as the result of an assessment conducted by a group of international experts on sustainability in the city. This

award acknowledges the work that Lisbon has been developing over the last few decades towards a greener, people-friendly city, namely by monitoring the following indicators: Climate Change Mitigation, Climate Change Adaptation, Sustainable Urban Mobility, Sustainable Land Use, Nature and Biodiversity, Air Quality, Noise, Waste, Water, Green Growth and Eco-Innovation, Energy Performance, and Governance. It was the first time that a Southern European capital received this distinction.

In 2022, Lisbon was internationally distinguished for its commitment to climate neutrality through the Covenant City in the Spotlight Awards (4th edition), in the Large Municipalities category. This award was established by the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy — Europe, and it was awarded to Lisbon in recognition of the city's commitment, motivation and progress towards climate neutrality.

# A city desired and idealized in the field of climate action

Lisbon takes a clear position in what regards responding to Climate Change:

it is actively engaged and committed to the future;
it has the ambition of being a European reference city by 2030;
it intends to benefit from the visibility and prestige that comes from participating in "Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030," which leverages the attraction of new investments and talents;
it accepts the challenge of the Cities Mission, anticipating the ambition of achieving climate neutrality by 2030.

Thus, the Municipality of Lisbon has been asserting itself as a greener and bluer city, of and for the people, which prioritizes climate action by accelerating the energy transition and the climate resilience of both natural and built systems.

"Constructing a sustainable city requires the determined intervention of the municipal executive body through a leading approach across the areas of Environment, Green Structure, Urban Planning, Mobility, and Public Space, among others. The political response to sustainability issues requires urgent, articulated action across the board, translated into the construction of a platform that mobilizes citizens, Businesses, schools, NGOs, and other agents around common commitments. Our urban planning policy aims at proximity urbanism, which reinforces the sense of belonging and community, seeing neighbourhoods as secular units of multiple relationships between Lisbon residents and their city. In turn, harmonizing the community with the surrounding space will involve multiple partners in the area of mobility at different scales, namely those taken up within the scope of the Municipal Assembly and the Lisbon Metropolitan Transports. Giving Lisbon back to its residents will involve redefining the parking offer, improving the conditions for soft mobility with enhanced information, safety, comfort, and functionality. A sustainable Lisbon must involve a renewed public space, by reinforcing the enjoyment of green spaces, shaping neighbourhood centralities, and promoting universal accessibility." In GOP 2023-2027

Based on the proposal of the current government program, included in the Major Planning Options (GOP 2023-2027), it appears that in terms of actions, measures, projects and activities, Pillar B "A sustainable city" encompasses the greatest in responding to the challenge of climate neutrality included in this Climate City Contract.

How is this climate neutrality ambition addressed in the 2030 Lisbon CCC2030?

The Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030 is an update of the current PAC2030, for the time horizon of 2030. It is a municipal instrument based on policies and strategies focused on ongoing climate action, which defines a schedule of priority actions and measures, involvement and joint investment. They correspond to measures and projects that accelerate the energy transition, carbon neutrality, the sustainable expansion of renewable energy, climate adaptation, environmental protection, safeguarding natural capital and ecosystem services, and the circularity of materials. All these areas of activity are considered as transversal to the entire Municipality and keep counting on the active, informed participation of the local community, of Businesses, institutions, associations, and civil society.

To this end, the Contract focuses on an integrated policy of mitigation (interventions that seek to reduce GHG emissions) and adaptation (interventions aimed at minimizing negative impacts in terms of climate change and at increasing co-benefits at different levels on the territory, goods, services and people), given that most of the actions and measures from these two aspects end up competing for common purposes, articulating each other, and generating synergies between them. Their description is presented in item B.2 and complemented in Annex 2A_LXactionplan.

In terms of framework, it is important to have a global view of which sectors and subsectors are included, the type of actions that need to be pursued, the associated cost, and the required involvement, not forgetting time and the territorial components. The Table below provides a joint presentation, highlighting the sectoral, territorial, and transversal components, of the various actions,

In addition to the sectoral and territorial impact, additional action measures were also considered that work across the board as support and leverage instruments, common to all sectors identified above. The transversal measures of the Capacity Building and Information Systems and Governance and Citizenship sectors, act in the field of studies, strategies and plans, collaborative knowledge, smart management and information, commitments, empowering departments, financing, civic participation, and environmental education.

# AP3 Part A — Current Status of Climate Action

The ongoing Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030 strategy is based on assessing various expected climate change scenarios for 2030, 2050 and 2100 and on emissions inventories with the definition of GHG scenarios and trajectories, in order to thus define actions and measures to be implemented with estimated GHG reduction potential and/or sequestration capacity, that is, off-setting, and general balance of emissions, with carbon capture and storage. The goal is to prevent proposed projects and actions from leading to unintended emissions or to increased vulnerability to climate risks.

In Lisbon, the proposal presented includes an assessment of co-benefits in order to avoid unforeseen and undesirable consequences.

Decarbonization has the direct, most tangible benefit of reducing GHG emissions. From 2002 to the present, the city has decreased its emissions by 40%, which is equivalent to 1.6 million tons of CO2e. Over the next decade we want to decrease 1.1 million tons of CO2e to reach the target of 80% reduction by 2030.

Adaptation acts directly to reduce exposure and vulnerabilities to the risks of climate change (excessive heat, water scarcity, rising average sea levels, intense precipitation, and extreme weather phenomena), offering benefits in terms of increased resilience and robustness of infrastructures and buildings, as well as of the city's other anthropogenic and natural systems. The city's adaptive process makes it stronger and better prepared in its ability to respond to external impacts and in warning, alert, and emergency situations.

Mitigation and adaptation measures, in addition to their direct repercussions on the response to climate change, translated into lower GHG emissions, offer broad benefits to the city, making it stronger, sustainable, balanced and attractive in different areas, namely:

Environmentally and in terms of public health, namely, in terms of air quality, noise, road safety, temperature extremes and adverse meteorological events, physical and mental well-being, public space and quality of life, fair access to housing;
In resource efficiency, namely with regard to waste and wastewater, the circular economy, efficient water management, sustainable food, management of land use practices;
In biodiversity and ecosystems, namely with regard to urban forests, plantations and health plan improvement, local species and pollinators, ecological warnings, connection between habitats, restoration of nature;
In biodiversity, air, water and soil pollution, noise control, circularity of resources;
Socially, namely with regard to the population's physical and mental health, quality of life, security, justice and social cohesion, empowerment, good governance, democracy and transparency, access to information, and social innovation;
Economically, namely with regard to employment, innovation, research and competitiveness, productivity, reduction of losses, appreciation of assets, and business continuity.

These benefits and externalities contribute globally to the city's objectives, defining priorities in the implementation of measures and actions that have already begun.

The 15 programs or plans listed, regardless of their strategic or operational nature, are presented here as they allow defining the main guidelines for the actions of the municipality of Lisbon. In this way, they highlight the importance that the LISBON CCC2030 will play in accelerating interventions, reinforcing investment, and thus achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. By combining strategies designed at different scales—local, regional, national, and international—with an impact on local policy, following a top-down and bottom-up approach, it was possible to develop the presented Climate Covenant City until 2030. This covenant is based on an alignment between actions, investment, and global commitment.

Given recent climate projections and the unpredictability associated with extreme weather events, investment in adaptive capacity associated with mitigation strategy is today the main challenge for coordinated prevention, planning, and response to reduce direct and indirect impacts.

Thus, climate scenarios combined with socio-economic projections at the local level constitute the main difficulty to be addressed at this stage. Together, the programs, plans, and strategies presented above constitute a fundamental framework for climate action, enabling the acceleration of the energy transition, strengthening the climate resilience of natural and built systems, and implementing coordinated, innovative, inclusive, and fair action.

At the same time, it is necessary to advance the measures resulting from the energy and climate obligations already assumed at the European and national levels.

## A-2.2: Description &amp; Assessment of Policies

All main policies, strategies, regulations, standards and other supporting documents have been previously referenced and will therefore not be listed at this point.

However, it is important to emphasize that the policy pursued by the municipality in response to climate change, energy transition, and fair social inclusion aligns with the international and European call presented in the Cities Mission. Simultaneously, it represents an opportunity to assert Lisbon's leadership in the process of accelerating climate resilience and responding to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), combining economic, social, and environmental engagement with political modernization and innovation.

As a cross-cutting challenge, it reinforces synergies between mitigation and adaptation strategies, leading to multi-sectoral engagement and investment. This enables a coordinated, accountable, and shared action involving everyone without exception, including the most vulnerable groups.

# AP3 A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities for Climate Neutrality by 2030

The complexity of the challenge of climate neutrality associated with the city's dynamic ecosystem imposes upon Lisbon the urgent need for involving the maximum number of facilitators in this process. Innovating, executing, monitoring, educating, informing, raising awareness and holding people accountable personally, professionally, and socially are critical shared responsibilities to achieving the goals taken up in this Cities Mission. Therefore, it is worth highlighting the involvement directed to the entire population, as well as to vulnerable groups, a class not forgotten in this challenge.

Next, we present the mapping of the stakeholder ecosystem, highlighting the degree of influence, interest, involvement, responsibility and commitment undertaken regarding the challenges launched by the Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030.

# A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers

The barriers that the city of Lisbon will face in achieving climate neutrality by 2030 are expected to be related to the following:

Needs in terms of Human Resources;
Lack of experience in combining funding sources (including public and private);
Difficulties in involving the private financial sector;
Difficulties in developing projects, due to procedural and financing difficulties;
Collaboration issues between Departments, due to the existence of "silos" that must be overcome and each Department's priorities;
Alignment between local needs (city), and funding for European and National programmes;
Unpredictability of climate challenges and direct benefits in the short term (medium and long term vision);
Prioritization of investment and actions;
Regulatory and legal constraints;
Lack of financing instruments dedicated to climate neutrality aimed at different recipients, without additional investment;
Lack of financing policies to accelerate climate neutrality;
Legal impositions;
Fragmented responsibilities;
Public procurement constraints;
Lack of compatible information, and of centralized smart management systems;
Lack of compatible platforms;
Inconsistency between various types of projections, namely of GHG emissions, demographic, macroeconomic, and local climate scenario projections.

As an opportunity, it is worth highlighting the status achieved by all cities participating in this Cities Mission, which requires that each city makes a joint effort to overcome barriers and obstacles, while enabling the opportunity for pursuing the ambition of global climate neutrality.

# A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality — textual and visual elements

As described in Section C3 - Principles, Priorities, and Participatory Process and Section C4 - Signatories and Commitments of Stakeholders of the Commitment 2030 section.

The participation model embraced by Lisbon involves the Municipality of Lisbon, society, and the citizens themselves, crucial components for the implementation of the respective City Climate Covenant based on key principles - responsibility, transparency, justice, inclusion, innovation, and co-creation, aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Key actors already involved and to continue involving include policymakers, technicians, researchers, experts, the media, representatives of citizens and minorities, men and women, youth, families, nationals, and foreigners.

Building on the assumption that "more active citizenship strengthens local power," Lisbon bases the construction of its City Climate Covenant on participatory processes with involvement at the neighborhood, parish, city, metropolitan area, country, and EU levels.

As mentioned earlier, the participation model integrates different levels—local, national, and international—thus demonstrating the relevant interdependencies existing to deconstruct sectoral and territorial "silos."

## Local Level:

238 Commitments from Municipal Organic Units
5 Municipal Businesses: Joint responsibility and commitments for shared management
12 Organizations with municipal participation: Joint responsibility and commitments
24 Parish Councils
Citizens' Council
Volunteer Bank for the City of Lisbon
Other initiatives (Municipal Councils for Housing, Interculturality and Citizenship, Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities, Municipal Plan for Gender Equality, and Social Network of Lisbon)

## National Level:

260 Businesses and organizations
Climate Action Protocols

## International Level:

## AP4 Part B — Pathways to Climate Neutrality by 2030

To meet the neutrality target, Lisbon must achieve at least an 80% reduction; which corresponds to an emission level, by 2030, of 747 ktCO2e (80% reduction compared to 2002; or 61% compared to 2019). Therefore, additional reductions in the amount of 352 ktCO2e (the gap, compared to planned policies) will be required.

The emission scenarios for 2030 (Figure 12) whose origin is a previous version of the Climate Action Plan (CEN.NL) show that the capacity for additional reductions is mostly concentrated in the transport sector. In 2030, it is estimated that transports will emit 55% of the total emissions (589 ktCO2e), while it is the sector that reduces emissions the least compared to 2019 (30%).

Therefore, in order to accelerate the energy transition and advance the roadmap to climate neutrality, in line with the "Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" targets, it is inevitable to define and evaluate complementary mitigation measures, particularly in the transports sector. Notwithstanding the need for a detailed assessment — to be prepared at a later stage of the Climate City Contract — the most relevant complementary measures to be assessed have already been identified.:

Discourage individual motorized transports (reduction);
Modal shift (to public transports/soft modes);
Shared mobility;

Electrification of vehicles;
Optimize freight transport logistics.

The measures listed above made it possible to achieve additional reductions of about $352\mathrm{ktCO}_2\mathrm{e}$ (see Figure 13 – N30 Scenario) and, in this way, enable a level of emissions reduction of $80\%$ (baseline 2002) / $61\%$ (baseline 2019) by 2030.

It should be noted that the initiatives in the field of urban mobility compete (in)directly with other critical challenges to the city's sustainability goals, with very clear co-benefits, namely in public space (e.g., adaptation, and the 15-Minute City), in the quality of air and noise (public health and quality of life).

In addition to the transports and mobility sector, the Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030 Action Plan also includes other measures associated with the building/housing, industry, services, agriculture, waste and waste water sectors, as well as adaptation and transversal measures, which complement this portfolio.

# B-1.2: Description of Impact Pathways

The Climate City Contract Action Plan proposed for Lisbon, defined on the bases of the Lisbon Urban Strategy and the current PAC2030, foresees the need for implementing actions, measures and projects to accelerate carbon neutrality by 2030. Based on a strategic vision, it individualizes the sectors and subsectors with an impact on climate neutrality, which resonate with the municipality, and with which it has worked.

The actions presented below, classified in the fields of mitigation, adaptation and transversality, despite being broken down into sectors and subsectors, highlight their relevance for meeting emission reduction targets and the importance of strengthening synergies between sectors. This approach will see further developments in future iterations of this Climate City Contract Action Plan.

It is important to highlight that since the Cities Mission is also an Innovation Mission, this component was valued throughout the process for selecting the measures, actions and projects to be carried out in this Action Plan.

# AP4 B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Project

The portfolio of actions, measures and projects are presented in Annex 2A_LXactionplan, section B-2, in response to what is proposed in the templates presented by NZC. In total, 130 actions are described distributed across 37 subsectors and 10 sectors representing the mitigation, adaptation and transversality components, summarized in the following tables.

## B-2.3: Summary Strategy for Residual Emissions

Climate neutrality implies net emissions equal to zero by 2030, which will require — in addition a substantial drop in emissions — the development of strategies for managing residual emissions, estimated at $747\mathrm{ktCO}_2\mathrm{e}$ in 2030. The city of Lisbon identifies three possible strategies for residual emissions management:

## Emission Removals

Implementing sequestration, storage, and use projects (CCS/CCU) makes it possible to account for negative emissions (removals). Since these technologies are still under development, with little technological maturity and very high costs, we feel that this type of projects are difficult to implement in the city's territory — even when considering pilots.

## Carbon sinks

The Municipality of Lisbon, within the scope of the Lisbon Local Biodiversity Action Plan (PALBL), developed an integrated multidisciplinary work, which helped identify a set of indicators for Lisbon, according to the City Biodiversity Index (CBI). Within the scope of ecosystem service indicators, Lisbon is developing — in partnership with universities and research centres — different developments to quantify carbon sinks in the city (Trees / Grasslands / The Monsanto Forest Park / Green Areas / The Tagus Estuary).

## On the city's green structure

The city's current green area covers 2,900 ha (see Figure 14). Between 2019 and 2023, about 242 ha of green areas were densified, corresponding to the planting of 68 thousand trees and shrubs. By 2030, the city's goal is to plant 250,000 trees and shrubs, densifying its green areas and planting alignment trees.

## Carbon off-setting

Carbon off-setting is not a risk-free strategy, and if the city moves towards an off-setting policy it must necessarily ensure guiding principles in terms of Effectiveness, Measurability, Additionality, Permanence and Absence of double counting. Taking into account the importance of forests in Portugal, and the planned creation of the Portuguese Voluntary Carbon Market, carbon off-setting will be a strategy to be considered. One must assess whether the city will be a buyer of credits, an investor, or whether it will develop its own projects (depending on factors such as time horizon, geographic origin of projects, associated costs).

In future updates of the Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030, a more detailed strategy will be presented, based on: i) assessing the city's carbon sinks and, ii) studying the off-setting scenarios in the national/European context.

Lisbon also advocates, within the context of the "Mission 100 cities," the need for developing additional guidance on climate neutrality and emissions management from the perspective of cities.

# AP4 B-3 Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning Indicators

The periodic monitoring system under development in the Municipality of Lisbon will help to evaluate the execution of its Climate City Contract, both in physical and financial terms, disclosing the percentage of execution compared to the proposed programming, and allowing new policies to be aligned with the current strategy, thus avoiding deviations from the drafted plan.

Each time the Climate City Contract is reviewed, a status assessment will be carried out, accompanied by the preparation and dissemination of midterm progress reports. Thus, these monitoring moments are important occasions for highlighting possible constraints or new opportunities in the field of climate action, as well as occasions to review the proposed schedule, if necessary.

When reviewing and monitoring the plan, it is expected that follow-up and adjustment will be carried out on:

the implementation of measures and respective actions;

mitigation (GHG reduction), climate adaptation and sectoral targets (directly applicable), including reviewing the respective monitoring indicators and their deviations from what was defined;
the costs of co-benefits associated with the various measures, namely in terms of reducing emissions, direct impact on climate adaptation, in terms of environment and public health (of humans and animals), of social, cultural, and economic inclusion, of resource efficiency, biodiversity and ecosystems;
the involvement and commitments made;
investment execution.

In terms of monitoring climate action, Lisbon periodically reports data related to climate mitigation and adaptation through the Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SECAP) reports, within the scope of the Covenant of Mayors and of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP Cities) platform, with special emphasis on the latter. Through this common reporting system, involving more than 850 cities, recorded information is shared between different international networks: Carbon Disclosure Project, ICLEI — Local Governments for Sustainability, C40 Cities, Global Covenant of Mayors and, more recently, the NetZeroCities.

By joining the Municipal Platform for Sustainable Development Goals (local SDG Platform), Lisbon monitors best innovative, sustainable practices implemented by municipalities, and assesses their evolution compared to the various targets under the 17 goals of the 2030 Agenda.

As far as adaptation is concerned, monitoring variables in climate change scenarios, with special emphasis on extreme meteorological events with impacts on the city, will continue to be ensured by the current system, which must be articulated, systematized and automated, as well as integrated with warnings /alerts associated with these phenomena.

The following climate monitoring tools are worth highlighting:

The Lisbon Smart Management Platform (PGIL), developed under the Sharing Cities project, to monitor environmental parameters in real time, in the city of Lisbon, relating to meteorology, air quality, noise and traffic counts, based on a network of 80 environmental stations and more than 650 sensors, mostly installed on public lighting posts. This monitoring began in 2020;
Cataloguing flood data caused by precipitation and by direct tidal effects, a real-time monitoring platform for the city of Lisbon, with meteorological and tidal parameters, with the potential to model the city by using the capabilities offered by Geographic Information Systems (GISs);
AML Climate, a meteorological monitoring and warning network developed across the Lisbon Metropolitan Area;
Lisbon Observatories | Know to Reduce.

Monitoring the city's climate action also includes the involvement and monitoring of effective mobilization by the main agents and key actors in society. Within the scope of the Lisbon 2030 Commitment, a follow-up and monitoring programme is being developed for initiatives

subscribed by various entities, namely Businesses, institutions, public bodies, schools, in different sectors, as previously described.

Although the monitoring system for the Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030 is still under development in order to then be integrated into the Municipality's existing tools, some of the execution and impact indicators by sector are presented in the following table, broken-down by subsector and type of action, including the definition of goals to be achieved in each year. In the next iteration, a general table will be presented listing the selected indicators by outcome and impact, including goals and assessment points (B-3.1); and a table of metadata for each selected indicator, as specified in the Comprehensive Indicator Sets (B-3.2).

The actions will be monitored and evaluated with the use and support of geographic information systems, analytics, and modelling of georeferenced data, with special emphasis on the areas of the Environment, Green Spaces, Climate and Energy, Information Systems, Urban Planning, Sanitation, Economy and Innovation, Relationship with Citizens and Participation, the Lisbon Urban Management and Smart Centre, the Lisbon General Drainage Plan.

The monitoring process in Lisbon is developed and followed-up with the support of ICT Businesses, of the scientific community, and of public departments with competence in the area, namely the Portuguese Sea and Atmosphere Institute, the Hydrographic Institute, the Portuguese Environmental Agency, the Regional Development and Coordination Committee of Lisbon and the Tagus Valley, and the Lisbon Metropolitan Area.

# C-1.2: Description of organization and governance interventions — textual and visual elements

As described in previous items, the main interventions proposed in this Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030 are associated with the city's programme, as described in the current GOP, broken down into programmes by pillar. The interventions described align political guidelines with ongoing strategies, making planning and physical and financial execution compatible.

The effective implementation of the action plan implies a commitment from the executive and the entire municipal universe, as well as a concerted and articulated coordination effort.

To respond to this challenge, an adaptation of the general governance structure defined in PAC2030 is being evaluated, which considered three levels of management — the Decision-Making Council (DC), the Coordination Committee (CC), and the Working Groups (WGs) —, which work in coordination with a Consultants and Stakeholders base (including Ambassadors of the Citizens' Council), in a logic of participatory, collaborative action.

Figure 15 — Governance Structure (adapted from PAC2030)

At this stage, the DC is composed of the executive body, which performs decision-making functions and formally approves the initiatives to be implemented, the means to be allocated, while also defining and reviewing the lines of strategic action, and continuously assessing the priority actions, coordinating its resolutions directly with the CC.

As for the WGs, they jointly integrate the mitigation, adaptation, and transversal scope. Each WG establishes a Project Team for each priority action (or set of related actions), led by the most appropriate organic unit plus other units, namely the most relevant in terms of skills in the field of intervention at stake, as well as other entities that depend on the Lisbon City Council, involved, or with influence, in the implementation of the priority actions.

The coordinator of each project team reports to the WG coordinator, and must periodically report the implementation status of the action lead by him/her, as well as identify barriers and constraints to its execution. This Project Team coordinator must continue to act a first-line leader.

Fulfilment of the duties and responsibilities of first-line participants in such WGs is formalized through the Assessment and Accountability Table, which reflects the appropriate criteria in the Integrated Performance Assessment System for Public Administration (SIADAP), thus involving all public servants involved in the implementation of the plan.

# Spheres of Action and Power

In pursuing what has been defined in the PAC2030, the capability of the Municipality of Lisbon to implement this Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030 requires an assessment of its spheres of power, in order to facilitate the implementation of additional measures required to meet the goals of reducing emissions, which require investment, involvement, and shared responsibilities. Three levels have

thus been identified as described in the following figure: Total Power, Partial Power, and Limited Power.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 16 — Spheres of Powers Associated With the Implementation of Measures

According to the governance model, all City Councillors with assigned responsibilities in the executive are part of the DC, which is led by the Mayor.

For each measure, the leaders of the Project Teams will be identified, as well as the remaining participants in the Municipal Directorates (DMs), Municipal Businesses (EMs), and in other municipal entities. The participation of DMs, EMs and of other entities in Project Teams will include second and third line managers, as well as other public servants considered relevant to the successful implementation of the measure at stake, and of its sub-measures, actions and projects.

The new proposal for the governance model of the Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030 is being reviewed, and the team has been reinforced with external consultants. This point will be reviewed in future iterations of the contract.

# AP5 C-2 Social Interventions and Other Innovations

The city's involvement, in the field of sustainability, climate resilience, economy and innovation, energy and environment, in various projects and programmes, has made it possible to make the research component compatible with various local interventions in the city of Lisbon.

There are several examples of case studies, living laboratories, pilots and lessons learned that have contributed to pursuing the strategy underway in the city of Lisbon, defined herein in this Climate Contract.

In addition to the participation of the Municipality of Lisbon, as institutional partner in local, regional, national and international projects, there are other benefits that follow from the city and its experts joining networks, technical exchanges and advice bodies. Thinking globally and acting locally. Such participation involves knowledge, ideas, innovation, data, information, communication, and prominence.

As previously described, Lisbon has received a number of awards that distinguish it for its active work in the field of climate adaptation and mitigation, interconnecting areas as diverse as health, the

environment, education, the economy, civil protection and emergency action, meteorology and metrology, culture, politics and finance.

The Environment Forum is also worth being highlighted. It is an initiative in project stage aimed at involving the areas of innovation and technology in the challenges imposed upon and chosen by the city of Lisbon.

The presentation of this structured information, as requested in table C.2.1, will be developed at a later stage.

## C-2.2: Description of Social Innovation Interventions

This item is framed under several areas of this Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030.

## AP5 C-3 Financing the Portfolio of Actions

Based on what has been described in the Investment Plan, the estimated budget for this Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030 amounts to about €5,055M (minimum amount). This amount corresponds to the investment required to carry out the execution of projects, initiatives and measures directly related to this challenge, leaving out other programmes that are equally relevant to the Municipality but that respond to other priorities and needs, and also the inflation rate to be considered until 2030.

The absence of desegregated information, as per the proposal presented by NZC, will be duly reviewed and integrated at a later stage, thus showing the importance of this instrument's flexibility within the context of the Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030.

## AP6 Perspectives and Next Steps

## Plans for next LISBON CCC2030 and Action Plan iteration

After a careful and consistent reflection on the Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030 Action Plan now being presented, it is important to conclude by stating that the challenge launched by the European Commission through the "EU Mission for climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" ("Cities Mission") helped strengthen the cooperation between Lisbon and other cities, the Region, the Country and general citizens, and ensured the position of climate leadership taken up at international level.

This Plan foresees the execution of a set of additional measures, actions and projects, defined for new temporal goals, duly considered in time and space, which will contribute to bringing forward the city's climate neutrality by 2030.

The basic criteria defined to select the measures to be implemented were the level of effectiveness in reducing GHG emissions and in responding to the reduction of climate risks, their urgency and importance on the political agenda, their degree of maturity, the associated benefits, and the opportunities for improvement demonstrated in light of the current situation.

The strategy presented herein will help position Lisbon among the main experimentation and innovation centres for climate action at international level.

The importance given to the close articulation between the commitments taken up by the Municipality of Lisbon and other public environmental, climate and energy policies at a local, regional, national and international level is also considered and prioritized.

Promoting participation, shared responsibility, commitment to joint action, information sharing and awareness raising for the adoption of new global and individual behaviours and for the involvement of key partners (local, regional, national and private public entities, research centres, NGOs, the

Media, citizens and others) in the response to this challenge of climate neutrality, is also highlighted in this Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030.

Finally, it is also worth highlighting the importance of defining investment estimates until 2030, financing possibilities, execution deadlines, measures to be implemented, priorities to be established, and partners and services to be involved.

It is by pursuing this joint effort that Lisbon aims to exceed its emissions reduction targets by 2030 and keep responding to Climate Change — a current challenge with worsening scenarios in the future, if nothing is done.

Regarding future developments, it is important to highlight that by assuming that the Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030 constitutes a continuous, dynamic, flexible, scalable, replicable, adaptive process, it is required that the monitoring be reinforced and ensures alignment with the other existing strategies, to allow for its full timely execution. As this is an interactive, dynamic process, periodic reviews and updates are expected over the next few years, leading to alignment between climate adaptation instruments, policies and strategies.

Updating the Action Plan also involves adjusting the Economic Model, in terms of additional actions, measures and projects (mitigation, adaptation, and transversal); reviewing the 2024-2030 emissions reduction estimates (based on the updated Emissions Inventory); estimating the cost of capital investment, the sources of financing involved, the commitments made, and the costs in terms of benefits.

The definition of a periodic or extraordinary review strategy, if there are significant deviations from the main indicators and expected targets or if there is a need for structural changes to the plan, will be defined in due course. The need for extraordinary reformulation may be caused by force majeure, such as fundamental changes to the city's political and governance guidelines, substantial legal or regulatory changes, either in the national or international context, or other situations classified as disasters and emergency.

The need for compatibility between information sources, platforms and indicators is also a point to be defined in the next stage.

The next steps also envisage:

Reinforcing the project team, representative of the Lisbon City Council universe, with the participation of key players from the city's different areas of intervention;
reinforcing the commitments signed with and for the city, both internal and external to the municipality, based on what has been proposed in this Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030. Such reinforcement requires reviewing goals, measures, investment, as well as the partners involved;
promoting participation with the development of a robust communication plan focused on the Climate Contract;
monitoring the Lisbon Climate City Contract 2030 with evaluation and performance indicators.

As an experimentation and innovation centre for global climate action, Lisbon will continue the integrated, coordinated and timely implementation of various structural measures and actions throughout the city, and will reinforce investment (both own and external) in the city's adaptation to

# Contrato Climático da Cidade
## Lisboa 2030
### Uma cidade sustentável, resiliente e inclusiva, que antecipa a neutralidade climática até 2030

## Os Compromissos e Metas da Cidade

Lisboa tem a visão e ambição de se transformar numa cidade sustentável, resiliente, inclusiva e climaticamente neutra até 2030, reforçando a sua posição de liderança climática a nível europeu e mundial.

Depois da adesão ao Pacto dos Autarcas em 2009, Lisboa trilhou um caminho em que subscreveu vários compromissos e metas para o Clima e Energia, incluindo os objetivos do Acordo Climático de Paris, a adesão à Rede de Liderança Climática C40 Cities e a aprovação do Plano de Ação para as Energias Sustentáveis e o Clima (PAESC), o qual evoluiu posteriormente para o Plano de Ação Climática 2030 (PAC 2030) e agora para o Contracto Climático da Cidade (CCC Lisboa).

Em 2020, Lisboa foi Capital Verde Europeia, galardão que reconheceu a transformação da cidade para melhorar o seu ambiente urbano e a sua resiliência climática. No seguimento da atribuição desta distinção, Lisboa criou o “Compromisso Verde Lisboa”, lançando o desafio à sociedade, empresas, organizações, associações e instituições, públicas e privadas, para se associarem à agenda climática da cidade para a década.

O Plano de Ação Climática Lisboa 2030 (PAC 2030), aprovado em 2022, constituiu um instrumento estratégico de planeamento da ação climática local, que tinha como meta a redução em 70% das emissões de Gases com Efeito Estufa (GEE) até 2030, face ao ano de referência 2002, e o objetivo de atingir a neutralidade climática em 2050.

Hoje, Lisboa continua empenhada na transição energética, na adaptação climática e na sua valorização ambiental, dando o seu contributo local para a convergência das metas do Acordo Climático de Paris e do Pacto Ecológico Europeu.

## O Desafio da Missão Cidades

A Comissão Europeia lançou oficialmente cinco “Missões Europeias”, iniciativas inovadoras para enfrentar os desafios globais nas áreas da saúde, clima e ambiente, onde se inclui a Missão

"Cidades inteligentes e com impacto neutro no clima", reconhecendo assim que as cidades constituem as entidades territoriais e administrativas mais bem posicionadas para concretizar políticas que permitem alcançar a neutralidade climática.

Nesse contexto, em novembro de 2021 convidou todas as cidades europeias para aderirem à "Missão Europeia para as Cidades Inteligentes e Climaticamente Neutras em 2030" ("Missão Cidades").

Lisboa aceitou o desafio e foi selecionada como uma das "100 cidades climaticamente neutras e inteligentes até 2030" (100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities). Para tal, deverá concretizar políticas e medidas que antecipem a neutralidade climática, em articulação com as demais políticas públicas ambientais de âmbito regional, nacional e internacional, e constituir-se como um centro de experimentação e inovação no domínio da ação climática.

Este enorme desafio compromete Lisboa, a Câmara Municipal, os cidadãos e seus representantes, as empresas e instituições, os centros de investigação, a comunicação social e comunidade como um todo, a ir mais além no desenvolvimento, concretização e monitorização de um Contrato Climático da Cidade (Climate City Contract), que define o caminho a trilhar para antecipar a neutralidade climática da cidade até 2030.

Para alcançar a neutralidade climática é necessário igualar o total de emissões de GEE geradas nas atividades da cidade, com a sua capacidade de sequestro de carbono (emissões líquidas iguais a zero), o que exigirá reduções substanciais nas emissões em, pelo menos, 80%, o aumento das áreas de sumidouro e da capacidade de sequestro de carbono, e na aposta em programas de compensação (das emissões residuais).

A visão para transição climática de Lisboa, assenta nas seguintes metas e objetivos:

Reduzir as emissões de GEE em 80%, face a 2002, antecipando a neutralidade climática até 2030;
Adaptar a cidade a eventos climáticos extremos, aumentando a sua resiliência aos riscos climáticos (atuais e futuros) e a sua capacidade de resposta;
Garantir uma transição justa e inclusiva, combatendo as desigualdades e atenuando a pobreza energética;
Valorizar a participação na "Missão 100 cidades com impacto neutro no clima até 2030", como estratégia potenciadora de atração de novos investimentos e talentos.

Para alcançar este desígnio, Lisboa deverá fomentar parcerias facilitadoras de compromissos e da responsabilidade partilhada para a transição climática, envolvendo ativamente entidades públicas e privadas, centros de investigação, ONG's, os cidadãos e toda a comunidade. E é neste contexto que a Plataforma Lisboa Sustentável (Compromisso Verde Lisboa) tem um papel fundamental.

# Lisboa precisa de todos

O impacto de cada cidadão, de cada organização *per si*, no total das emissões da cidade pode ser limitado, mas no seu todo pode ter consequências e limitar ou acelerar a transformação climática de Lisboa.

Por isso, para alcançar os objetivos da Missão, é necessário comprometer todos numa ação climática conjunta e abrangente, envolvendo parceiros, entidades públicas e privadas, universidades, centros de investigação, organizações não governamentais e os cidadãos.

A ação climática de Lisboa assentará assim na participação ativa e informada da comunidade local, das empresas, das instituições, das associações e da sociedade civil, no debate, cocriação e concretização de medidas e projetos que acelerem a transição energética, a expansão sustentável das energias renováveis, desde logo apostando no enorme potencial solar de Lisboa, a adaptação climática, a proteção ambiental, a salvaguarda do capital natural e dos serviços dos ecossistemas, e a circularidade dos materiais.

É também necessário afirmar ação climática de Lisboa a nível global, para que a cidade tenha um papel relevante no desenvolvimento de políticas públicas e compromissos empresariais, e, principalmente, para valorizar Lisboa e com ela todas as organizações que dela fazem parte, fazendo ouvir a sua voz, encorajando e inspirando outras cidades na sua transição climática.

Para tal, Lisboa continua a contar com as organizações subscritoras da Plataforma Lisboa Sustentável Empresas, para um trabalho conjunto no âmbito do Contrato Climático Lisboa 2030, e do seu principal objetivo, antecipar a neutralidade climática até 2030.

# City Climate Contract
## Lisbon 2030
### A sustainable, resilient and inclusive city that anticipates climate neutrality by 2030

## The City's Commitments and Goals

Lisbon has the vision and ambition to transform itself into a sustainable, resilient, inclusive and climate-neutral city by 2030, reinforcing its climate leadership position at European and global level.

After joining the Covenant of Mayors in 2009, Lisbon followed a path in which it signed several commitments and goals for Climate and Energy, including the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement, membership of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Network and the approval of the Plan of Action for Sustainable Energy and Climate (PAESC), which later evolved into the 2030 Climate Action Plan (PAC 2030) and now into the City Climate Contract (CCC Lisbon).

In 2020, Lisbon was European Green Capital, an award that recognized the city's transformation to improve its urban environment and climate resilience. Following the award of this distinction, Lisbon created the "Lisbon Green Commitment", launching the challenge to society, companies, organizations, associations and institutions, public and private, to join the city's climate agenda for the decade.

The Lisbon 2030 Climate Action Plan (PAC 2030), approved in 2022, constituted a strategic instrument for planning local climate action, which had as its target a 70% reduction in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 2030, given reference year 2002, and the objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050.

Today, Lisbon remains committed to the energy transition, climate adaptation and environmental enhancement, making its local contribution to the convergence of the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and the European Ecological Pact.

## The Cities Mission Challenge

The European Commission has officially launched five "European Missions", innovative initiatives to face global challenges in the areas of health, climate and environment, including the Mission "Smart and climate-neutral cities", thus recognizing that cities constitute the territorial and administrative entities best positioned to implement policies that allow climate neutrality to be achieved.

In this context, in November 2021 it invited all European cities to join the “European Mission Climate Neutral and Smart Cities in 2030” (“Mission Cities”).

Lisbon accepted the challenge and was selected as one of the “100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030” (100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities). To this end, it must implement policies and measures that anticipate climate neutrality, in conjunction with other public environmental policies at a regional, national and international level, and establish itself as a center for experimentation and innovation in the field of climate action.

This enormous challenge commits Lisbon, the City Council, citizens and their representatives, companies and institutions, research centers, the media and the community as a whole, to go further in the development, implementation and monitoring of a Climate City Contract, which defines the pathways towards climate neutrality by 2030.

To achieve neutrality climate change it is necessary to equalize the total GHG emissions generated by the city's activities, with its carbon sequestration capacity (net emissions equal to zero), which will require substantial reductions in emissions by at least 80%, an increase in sink areas and carbon sequestration capacity, and investment in compensation programs (for residual emissions).

Lisbon's climate transition vision is based on the following goals and objectives:

Reduce GHG emissions by 80%, compared to 2002, bringing forward climate neutrality by 2030;
Adapt the city to extreme climate events, increasing its resilience to climate risks (current and future) and its capacity to respond;
Ensure a fair and inclusive transition, combating inequalities and alleviating energy poverty;
Value participation in the “Mission 100 cities with a neutral impact on the climate by 2030”, as a strategy to attract new investments and talents.

To achieve this goal, Lisbon must foster partnerships that facilitate commitments and shared responsibility for the climate transition, actively involving public and private entities, research centers, NGOs, citizens and the entire community. And it is in this context that the Sustainable Lisbon Platform (Lisbon Green Commitment) plays a fundamental role.

# Lisbon needs everyone

The impact of each citizen, of each organization per se, on the city's total emissions may be limited, but as a whole it can have consequences and limit or accelerate Lisbon's climate transformation.

Therefore, to achieve the Mission's objectives, it is necessary to commit everyone to joint and comprehensive climate action, involving partners, public and private entities, universities, research centers, non-governmental organizations and citizens.

Lisbon's climate action will therefore be based on the active and informed participation of the local community, companies, institutions, associations and civil society, in the debate, co-creation and implementation of measures and projects that accelerate the energy transition, the sustainable expansion of energy renewable sources, starting from the outset by investing in Lisbon's enormous solar potential, climate adaptation, environmental protection, safeguarding natural capital and ecosystem services, and the circularity of materials.

It is also necessary to affirm Lisbon's climate action at a global level, so that the city has a relevant role in the development of public policies and business commitments, and, mainly, to value Lisbon and with it all the organizations that are part of it, making the voice heard your voice, encouraging and inspiring other cities in their climate transition.

To this end, Lisbon continues to count on the subscribing organizations of the Lisbon Sustainable Companies Platform, to work together within the scope of the Lisbon 2030 Climate Contract, and its main objective, to bring forward climate neutrality by 2030.
