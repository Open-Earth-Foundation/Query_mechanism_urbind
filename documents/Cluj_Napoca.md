# Summary

On December 12, 2015, during the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21), 195 States, Romania included, adopted the Paris Agreement, which strives to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below +2°C. The European Union has committed under the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030, and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. To achieve these ambitious targets, the European Green Deal was developed, which makes reaching climate neutrality by 2050 legally binding in the EU, and around 1 trillion Euro of public and private funds have been mobilized through the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, to help achieve the target.

Cluj-Napoca Municipality apprehends the significant potential of cities and their metropolitan areas to contribute substantially to the successful implementation of the European Green Deal. As cities, we have a considerable chance to accelerate the transition towards zero-emission urban environments, by implementing a systemic mechanism, that works from governance structures to resource absorption. We, as cities, can be both cecenters' social innovation and pilot sites for pioneering technologies related to climate neutrality. Thus, we are responsible to for acting as the main climate neutrality catalyst, albeit this cannot be achieved without well-orchestrated, cross-sectoral, and multi-level collaboration with our local ecosystem, and most notably with the community we represent.

In support of the European Green Deal, the European Commission has also set the "100 Carbon Neutral Cities by 2030" Mission. The scope of the Mission is to: Support, promote and showcase 100 European cities in their systemic transformation towards climate neutrality by 2030 and make these cities into experimentation and innovation hubs for all cities, thus leading on the European Green Deal and on Europe's efforts to become climate neutral by 2050. Cluj-Napoca has been selected as one of the 100 Mission cities. As such, it is committing to accelerate efforts to achieve climate neutrality and serve as an example for other urban areas to follow.

Already in the Integrated Urban Development Strategy 2021-2030-2050, adopted in early 2022, Cluj-Napoca has committed to becoming a Net Zero City by 2030 and has already sset up several ambitious areas of intervention, milestones, and timeline. Moreover, following the Covid-19 crisis, the City of Cluj-Napoca has also prepared a Resilience Plan, which tackles issues ranging from demographic decline and aging, to sound urban planning, urban food logistics, health issues, climate change, economic competitiveness, and social inclusion. Other relevant strategic documents include the 2022-2030 Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) (currently available for public consultation), the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan 2021-2030, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Program (updated each year), and the 2020-2024 Air Quality Improvement Plan.

The scope of this document is to pull together the key relevant interventions and show how

these can help achieve the target of climate neutrality by 2030. The document, while it includes concrete impact pathways, is not meant to be seen as a rigid document. Rather, this Action Plan is meant to be dynamic, in the spirit of the "mission approach" promoted by Mariana Mazzucato, which proposes that once a target is set, various pathways could be pursued to achieve that target, and some of these pathways will not be known at the start of the journey. Mazzucato herself frequently uses the example of the mission set by US President John F. Kennedy in 1961 to achieve the goal of "landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth". As we all know, Kennedy's Mission was achieved, and in the process, several breakthrough innovations have been developed, which impact our lives in myriad ways – from solar panels to fire-protecting suits, microwaves, or heart monitors. Similarly, it is hoped that Cluj-Napoca's Mission to become a Net Zero City will give birth to several innovations that may benefit other cities with similar ambitions.

The portfolio of interlinked interventions that are proposed in this Action Plan closely follows the recommendations of the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, being designed in a cross-sectoral and actor-inclusive manner, in our ultimate goal of reducing the local GHG emissions by at least 80%, until 2030. In this sense, the Action Plan includes multiple levers of change as enabling factors for the devised portfolio of clustered actions and, at the same time, roots in a multi-level, evidence-based perspective.

Finally, the Action Plan combines both of the Mission-proposed logical approaches: we have pursued a measurable, reportable and verifiable climate action planning process, by applying a comprehensive theory of change, in the joint ambition to generate systemic changes for our local decarbonization, that needs to be not only rapid but also optimized in terms of efficiency and equity.

# Introduction

Cluj-Napoca is the largest secondary city in Romania, but also the most dynamic in terms of both demographic and economic growth (5,000 new jobs and inhabitants only in 2021, at metropolitan level, meaning +2,7%, respectively +1% in just one year). According to a World Bank survey, the city is the most attractive destination for internal migration, surpassing even Bucharest, and it is perceived by the Romanians as the one with the highest quality of life in the country. This growth also comes at the cost of a high level of GHG emissions, especially associated with the rapidly growing housing sector and motorization rate. The ambition of the local ecosystem, stated in the IUDS adopted in January 2022, is to place Cluj-Napoca among the cities with the highest quality of life in the EEC area and to promote it aaan European Lab City for testing the most innovative solutions, technologies and processes related to sustainable urban development.

Following this ambitious vision set by the 2021-2027 Metropolitan IUDS - as the coordinating planning document, the city was the first growth pole in Romania to elaborate and adopt all relevant sectoral development strategies and plans in 2022, starting with the SUMP, the District Heating System development strategy, the Digital Transformation one and the SECAP. The Air Quality Improvement Plan has been previously adopted (June 2020) and the revision of the General Urban Plan has already been initiated after the elaboration of the strategic documents mentioned above. The leitmotif stated in all these documents is the target to reduce GHG emissions by at least 80% in the following 8 years. Another strategic option that arises from the set of metropolitan/city planning documents is the focus on the two sectors with the highest level of GHG emissions, buildings (especially residential ones) and transport, respectively on the integrated interventions carried out in dense multi-apartment residential neigneighborhoodsere ¾ of the total residents live.

It is also important to mention here that the Municipality has initiated a series of climate neutrality initiatives long before the adoption of the planning documents for 2021-2027 and the selection of the city to become part of the EU Mission for 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030. Among the local flagship programmes already drafted between 2015 and 2020, "Green Cluj" (almost 200 hectares of new / rehabilitated parks and 100,000 trees planted by 2030), "Walkable City" (a plan to implement the 15 minute-city concept in every major neighborhood of the city), the Zonal Urban Plan for the largest smart and green neighbourhood (Sopor) to be built in Romania on 250 hectares, based on a participative approach, or the policy to organise international architecture & design competitions for over 10 major urban renewal projects funded by ERDF are the most important ones.

In this broader local context, the selection of the city to become part of the EU Mission, as well as the elaboration of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan, Investment Plan, and Commitments was a perfect opportunity to deepen the planning efforts already initiated during the preparation of the relevant metropolitan/municipal strategies already approved and to frame existing and envisaged climate neutrality initiatives and measures into a single and sound roadmap for 2030. But the main outcome of the Climate City components preparation phase was the unique chance to consolidate the local and metropolitan climate neutrality ecosystem (local public authorities and metropolitan intercommunity development association, clusters in the field of energy or digital transformation, the DIH, universities, professional associations of architects and engineers, NGOs and civic society

organisations etc.), in the pursuit of our next milestone, respectively the establishment of a Net Zero City Local Coalition, a model for other cities in Romania and in the EU with the same ambitions. The first test for this ecosystem was the successful preparation and submission of a project proposal under the Horizon 2020 call for NetZero Cities.

# 2 Work Process

The Action Plan's preparation was based on adapting EU trends, strategic directions and policies to the specific local context, the whole process being a co-participatory one: although the Municipality coordinated the implementation of the Action Plan, the document was developed by constantly consulting the local stakeholders, because they are the NZC Coalition's pillars. Thus, several virtual consultative sessions and workshops were organized, where stakeholders debated how this Action Plan can put into practice the local and international strategic documents aimed at climate neutrality, so that its implementation to generate a tangible impact and to fit Cluj-Napoca's profile. All the NZC Coalition's stakeholders were invited to the work sessions. Although their participation was not mandatory, the Municipality enjoyed their constant presence at the meetings. During the meetings, we have started with a brainstorming session, which we have ultimately managed to materialise into a cohesive set of concrete intervention and action proposals, generated by the participants. Finally, the Municipality took on the role of integrating, in the present document, all the ideas that were co-created during our ideation and iteration sessions. This document thus illustrates the clear and directed alignment of existing local climate action planning and strategy processes in a unitary, sound intervention framework.

As part of our local NZC Coalition, the main stakeholders that were constantly consulted during the development of the Action Plan, covering all relevant dimensions: RDI and university education (mainly with the participation of TUCN and BBU), business sector (with the participation of the TREC and TITC clusters), NGOs (especially Urbannect) and citizens (through the discussions with the federation of owners' associations), all under the coordination of the public administration (the Municipality, with the support of its entire cohort of departments specialized in the field, of public service companies, of the City Council and with the help of the Energy Manager). A special support in this process was given by the Ministry of Investments and European Projects, through the participation in the discussions of Mr. Ovidiu Cimpean, State Secretary and former Development Director for 10 years at Cluj-Napoca Municipality.

The intensive stakeholder collaboration used in the action portfolio's co-design respected the Framework for effective climate action planning presented in the Info Kit for Cities. Thus, by undertaking a co-creation working method, the Municipality has managed to validate the entire course of action with the local ecosystem and community:

Setting the vision: the Action Plan's vision was built on IUDS and SECAP, which were submitted to extensive public consultations at the moment of their elaboration.
Establishing the governance structure: Cluj NZC Local Coalition is the structure that governs the co-design, co-implementation and co-monitoring of the Action Plan under the big umbrella of CIIC – Civic Imagination and Innovation The Coalition's composition came naturally, given the numerous initiatives already carried out jointly within the local ecosystem.
Baseline assessment &amp; climate neutrality target: the portfolio of indicators was concluded by taking into account the calculations already prepared in SECAP.
Identifying actions: The portfolio of actions is the result of local stakeholder collaboration, starting from the local context and from the steps already pursued by Cluj-Napoca, respectively considering the portfolios of projects prepared within IUDS and SECAP for the 2030 time horizon.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Together with the Investment Plan, the Action Plan resulted in an integrated proposal to jointly reach the local climate-neutrality goal and its related targets. The effort invested by Municipality and by the local stakeholders in the elaboration of the 2 documents will be officially recognized by signing the 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments.

# A-1.6: DESCRIPTION AND ASSESSMENT OF GHG BASELINE INVENTORY

# Where data from the baseline inventory was sourced from and why:

When determining where to capture data for the baseline inventory, several data sources as well as official strategic documents developed by experts were consulted. The main challenge was that GHG emissions for Cluj-Napoca were calculated using different methodologies, for different years or for different sectors in each source that was consulted. For example: The Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan for Cluj-Napoca offered CO2 reduction values for the implemented projects, but did not offer information on how the emissions were calculated. The Integrated Urban Development Strategy factors in CO2 emissions calculated in the Sustainable Energy Action Plan 2011-2020. The Thermofication Strategy of Cluj-Napoca 2021-2030 offers CO2 emission values, energy requirements associated with public transportation and buildings as well as information related to the emissions factors applied using the IPCC 2006 methodology. Google Environmental Insights offers GHG emissions for the buildings and transportation sector calculated using the CURB tool and the GPC methodology. After consulting all available official documents, different online tools, as well as the requirements for this document, the decision was made to use data from the SECAP 2021 document as the official data for baseline emissions. The reasons why SECAP 2021 was used were the following:

It is the most recent official strategic document approved by the Cluj-Napoca City Council
It provides detailed information on how energy demand was calculated for different sectors in the city and takes into account estimations from the other approved strategic documents
It provides detailed information on how CO2 emissions were calculated and what methodology and emission factors were used
It provides detailed Energy and CO2 emissions information on different sectors in the city

It provided energy and CO2 estimations for 2030

There were, however, a few challenges that need to be overcome by using the SECAP document as the official source of data:

Data was not available for all sectors required for the NZC Action Plan. For example, the SECAP did not include data about the Waste, IPPU and AFOLU sectors. This challenge was addressed by using percentual estimations for the missing sectors (explained in the paragraphs below)
Not all gases required in the NZC Action Plan were accounted for. CO2 was the only greenhouse gas estimated in the SECAP document. This challenge will be addressed by Coalition members (explained below)
In SECAP, the grid supplied energy conversion factor for 2030 was calculated to 0.1 according to progress made by Romania in generating energy from renewable sources. Information taken from the Electrical Energy Grid of Romania shows that power produced from renewables has increased by 76% between 2012 and 2021, currently accounting for 42% of the total energy generated and on trend to achieving the NetZero target. Furthermore, large public and private companies in the Cluj Metropolitan Area have set ambitions to increase the energy production from renewables and achieve climate neutrality by 2030. Such an example is the Somes Water Company, which manages water supply and wastewater treatment facilities in the metropolitan area, and that plans to become climate neutral by 2035.

What will be done in the future to improve data collection:

The Local Net Zero Coalition includes TUCN (also worked for SECAP) and BBU, plus other partners will be mobilised to ensure more accurate, timely and regular collection of energy and GHG emission data. The coalition will also take full advantage of available data sources, such as the World Bank Curb Tool, Google Environmental Insights, NASA Earth Data Platform, HeatMaps, THERMOS and other open source information to ensure easier and more accurate data capture. A series of online tools were already used by Coalition partners to determine the photovoltaic potential for all the buildings in Cluj-Napoca.

Moreover, Coalition Partners will also collect data from the regional Water Company, the Directorate of Administration of the Public Domain, the County Council and other local stakeholders and will analyse in detail the impact of each proposed intervention while mapping CO2 interconnections between emitters, in order to ensure that reductions in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions do not lead to a sharp increase in Scope 3 emissions. Future iterations of the current Action Plan will take into consideration local interdependencies and properly address them for even better strategic design choices.

- A CITY THAT RUNS ON NATURAL GAS

The 2021 baseline for the total energy required and ultimately the total CO2 emissions associated with that energy consumption for each sector was calculated in accordance with the SECAP document, Scenario 1 - calculations based on the IPCC 2006 methodology. For information that was not available, estimates were used in order to calculate the full spectrum of the CO2 emission

and energy consumption.

With this in mind, the baseline information for 2021 is the following:

Total CO2 emissions for 2021: 1,167,223 tons CO2/year

Total energy consumption for 2021: 4,081,133 MWh/year

## Buildings sector - estimates sourced from SECAP 2021

Information related to the energy requirements of public buildings, residential buildings and tertiary buildings is available in the SECAP document. CO2 emissions in tons/year were calculated by multiplying the conversion factor with the energy type expressed in MWh/year. The electrical energy needed to power the buildings comes directly from the energy grid, and the natural gas requirements include both the natural gas used for heating and the natural gas used for generating electricity.

2,604,017 MWh/year energy required
Electrical energy: 231,941 MWh/year
Natural gas: 2,372,076 MWh/year
641,750 tons total CO2 emissions (55% of total CO2 emissions)

## Transport sector - estimates sourced from SECAP 2021

The transport energy requirements and CO2 emissions aggregate data about the Municipality's transport, public transport as well as private and commercial transport. Data related to this sector was taken from the SECAP document - Scenario 1.

601,167 MWh/year energy required
Electrical energy: 16,030 MWh/year
GPL: 5,771 MWh/year
Diesel: 302,387 MWh/year
Gasoline: 235,481 MWh/year
Biofuel (carbon neutral): 41,498 MWh/year
151,962 (SECAP 2021) - 146,517 total tons CO2 emissions (13% of total CO2 emissions)

## Waste sector - estimated at 5% from total CO2 emissions (Science Direct)

Emissions connected to the waste sector were estimated at 5% of the total city's emissions. This percentage was set by analysing a series of scientific papers from Science Direct and it is assumed that in 2030 waste will still account for 5% of the total city's emissions. In regards to the energy needs, it was determined that 5,400 MWh/year (the equivalent of 1.5 tons per work day) of diesel

fuel is required to run the waste sector, and the rest of the waste systems (robotic belts, treatment facilities, etc.) would need 81,200 MWh/year electrical energy to function at capacity and account for the 5% emissions.

86,598 MWh/year energy required
Electrical energy: 81,198 MWh/year
Diesel: 5,400 MWh/year
58,361 total tons CO2 emissions (5% of total CO2 emissions)

# Industrial Process and Product Use - estimated at 26% of total CO2 emissions (Metroverse)

By analysing the city's economic profile from Metroverse, it was determined that IPPU accounts for 26% of the total city's emissions. Electrical energy was set at 70% and natural gas at 30% as needed to power this sector, and so the overall fuel requirements were determined by taking these percentages out of the total emissions and converting them into MWh/year using the IPPC emissions conversion factors. Regarding the types of industry working in the city, the most relevant information comes from the structure of economically active local establishments in the Cluj-Napoca Metropolitan Area, by main economic activities (2019 data). The city and its metropolitan area are dominated by economic actors whose main activities comprise: trade (20,4%), professional, scientific and technical activities (15,37%), construction (10,86%), transport and storage (10,33%), manufacturing (8,48%), IT&amp;C (8,47%), administrative and support services (4,40%), plus real estate transactions (4,33%) and hotels and restaurants (4,24%). To these are added, in smaller proportions, economic operators responsible for: healthcare (3,50%), other service activities (3,10%), cultural, entertainment and leisure activities (2,25%), education (1,40%), financial intermediation (1,31%), utilities (0,50%), agriculture, forestry and fishing (0,91%) plus mining and quarrying (0,16%).

753,755 MWh/year energy required
Electrical energy: 303,045 MWh/year
Natural gas: 450,710 MWh/year
303,478 total tons CO2 emissions/year (26% of total CO2 emissions)

# Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use - estimated at 1% of total CO2 emissions (Metroverse)

AFOLU was estimated at 1% of the total city's emissions. This percentage is also supported by data obtained from the Statistical Office of Romania. Diesel fuel accounts for 70% and electrical energy for 30% out of the sector's energy requirements. Cluj-Napoca has an insignificant agricultural sector, that is why operation and maintenance of public parks was included in this estimate:

35,596 MWh/year energy required
Electrical energy: 4,995 MWh/year
Diesel: 30,601 MWh/year
11,672 total tons CO2 emissions (1% of total CO2 emissions)

All in all, it can be noticed that 69.2% of the energy requirement for the city comes from natural gas, while electricity accounts for only 15.6 %. The building sector has the highest energy need, requiring an average of 2,372,076 MWh/year of natural gas and 231,941 MWh/year of electrical energy.

# 2030 - CHANGING THE CITY'S ENERGY PROFILE TO A CITY THAT RUNS MAINLY ON ELECTRIC ENERGY

SECAP offers an energy paradigm shift for 2030, that is why the estimates taken from SECAP correlated with the actions proposed in the following chapters will change the city's energy profile from a gas intensive one into an electrical energy one. Electrical energy will be the main source of energy, accounting for 57.2%, followed by natural gas 25.5% and green electric energy at 11%. In recent years, Romania has made insignificant progress in supplying green energy to the national grid and large national projects are currently under development, that is why SECAP recommends using a conversion factor of 0.1 (MWh/year electrical energy to tons CO2/year) when calculating emissions for 2030.

The target energy requirements and CO2 emission for 2030 are as follows:

Total target CO2 emissions for 2030: 221,929 tons CO2/year (80% decrease compared to 2021)

Total energy consumption estimates for 2030: 4,348,317 MWh/year (7% increase compared to 2021)

# 2030 Buildings sector - estimates sourced from SECAP 2021

Information related to the estimated 2030 energy requirements of public buildings, residential buildings and tertiary buildings is available in the SECAP 2021 document. CO2 emissions in tons/year were calculated by multiplying the 2030 conversion factors with the energy type expressed in MWh/year. According to SECAP 2021, the conversion factor for electrical energy from the grid was set at 0.1 while the conversion factor for green electrical energy was set at 0. Electric energy is general grid energy, while green electric energy is electric energy produced from renewables on site, within the city boundaries. The target CO2 emission for this sector is 101,592 tons CO2/year.

2,240,755 MWh/year energy required
Electrical energy: 871,172 MWh/year
Natural gas: 892,496 MWh/year
Green electric energy: 477,087 MWh/year
267,401 tons total CO2 emissions after energy conversion and before implementation of proposed actions
15,158 tons total CO2 emissions after implementation of actions. (actions account for a 252,243 tons CO2 reduction)

# 2030 Transport sector - estimates sourced from SECAP 2021

The transport energy requirements and CO2 emissions for 2030 were taken from the SECAP 2021 document and aggregate data about the Municipality's own transport, public transport as well as private and commercial transport. Compared to 2021, a large percentage of transport in Cluj-Napoca will be powered by electrical energy, thus decreasing the need for fossil fuels.

586,593 MWh/year energy required
Electrical energy: 329,453 MWh/year
GPL: 3,959 MWh/year
Diesel: 116,363 MWh/year
Gasoline: 111,232 MWh/year
Biofuel (carbon neutral): 25,586 MWh/year
92,635 tons total CO2 emissions after energy conversion and before implementation of proposed actions
44,183 tons total CO2 emissions after implementation of actions. (actions account for a 48,452 CO2 reduction)

# 2030 Waste sector - estimated at 5% from total CO2 emissions (Science Direct)

CO2 emissions for the waste sector in 2030 were estimated at 5% of the total target emissions in 2030. The amount of diesel fuel required to power this sector will not change compared to 2021, and so, the electrical energy needed to power the sector and account for those emissions was estimated. It can be noticed that this sector will require 3 times more electrical energy in 2030 compared to 2021.

259,662 MWh/year energy required
Electrical energy: 254,262 MWh/year

# 2030 Industrial Process and Product Use

For 2030, the IPPU sector was estimated to require half the quantity from natural gas, but 3 times more electrical energy compared to 2021. Although no hard actions were planned for 2030 for this sector, city wide soft interventions will lead to the adoption of a climate-neutral behaviour from the citizens, and ultimately force industrial entities to shift towards more environmentally friendly production processes which will ultimately increase their electrical energy needs.

# Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan 2022-2030 (SECAP) - Cluj-Napoca

The Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan is a public policy document defining the policy of the local public administration in the fields related to energy and the environment, with the general objective of reducing CO2 emissions generated by final energy consumption in the administrative territory. The SECAP is the main strategic document targeting the reduction of GHG emissions, with an ambitious target of 80%. The plan was elaborated according to the methodology of the Covenant of Mayors on Climate and Energy, whose signatories have pledged to reduce emissions by at least 40% by 2030. To this purpose, signatory cities develop Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans (SECAP) and commit to report and monitor their implementation.

The Net Zero Action Plan is aligned with the SECAP and builds on the interventions proposed. The Sustainable Energy &amp; Climate Action Plan (SECAP) covers the following sectors:

Public Lightning;
Public buildings, tertiary buildings, residential buildings;
Public transport and private / commercial transport;
Production of thermal energy at local level;
Producing energy from renewable sources at the local level;
Sanitation system and waste management;
Green public procurement;
Energy poverty and vulnerable consumers;
Citizen awareness and mobilization for increasing energy efficiency.

The SECAP is informed by local strategic documents (Local District Heating Strategy 2031, SUMP 2027, 2020-2024 Air Quality Plan Improvement Plan), policies and programs (eg Walkable City, Green City, Green Transport, Cluj-Napoca Urban Agglom. Energy Efficiency Improv. Program), public regulations (e.g. restructuring contracts with private operators for brownfield redevelopment, fiscal incentives), including private measures (e.g. CSR campaigns financed by business actors, encouraging green mobility or waste recycling).

# Integrated Urban Development Strategy for Cluj-Napoca Metropolitan Area 2021-2030

The key programmatic document for Cluj-Napoca &amp; its Metropolitan Area (CMA) is the Integrated Urban Development Strategy (IUDS), outlining the investments planned for 2021-30-50. Recognizing the growing interdependencies &amp; opportunities for cooperation between the core city and its surrounding localities, the IUDS was elaborated at the metropolitan level, in line with the recommendations of the New Leipzig Charter (transposed in Romania's first Urban Policy) and the PO5.A Europe closer to citizens.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The IUDS for 2021-2030 includes an extensive list of interventions at the metropolitan level, which account for a CO2 emission reduction of up to 80%. By joining the 100 Cities Mission, Cluj-Napoca will have the necessary momentum and resources to accelerate the achievement of the target assumed in the SECAP and has identified a comprehensive list of interventions included in the current Action Plan.

The Net Zero Action Plan 2030 is connected with primarily 3 of the 6 Specific Objectives identified in the IUDS &amp; their corresponding investment priorities:

SO3. Carbon Neutral, Green &amp; Resilient City and MA.

: Increasing energy performance in collective housing complexes
: Increasing energy performance in public buildings and public lighting system
: Investments in the central heating system, electricity supply infrastructure and natural gas
: Supporting the implementation at local and metropolitan level of the integrated waste management system and the circular economy
: Conservation of natural heritage, and development of green-blue infrastructure
: Reduction of air pollution and noise pollution

SO4. No one left behind.

: Carrying out integrated socio-economic interventions at the level of marginalized communities and developing a diverse range of social and employment services for all people at risk of poverty and exclusion
: Implementing an integrated housing policy at the level of the Municipality and the metropolitan area

As highlighted in the IUDS, over 50% of the population of Cluj-Napoca and its MA lives in 30-60 years old flats built during the communist period, with the technologies and materials available at the time. This situation directly impacts residents in terms of living costs (particularly energy bills, as a result of low energy efficiency of the building) and comfort. Moreover, awareness and empowering residents with knowledge on carbon neutrality and sustainability further support the objective of leaving no one behind and involving citizens across the CMA.

SO2. Made and Invented in Cluj.

Research-development-Innovation (RDI) is a cornerstone dimension for achieving climate neutrality by 2030. Therefore, the existing assets in terms of innovative potential will be valorised as much as possible, considering the city's vision to become a "European Lab City", where the solutions to challenges of the future are being tested. This vision is reflected in SO2 and its investment priorities, particularly:

: Developing the research-development-innovation and technology transfer capacity, both in the public and private sectors, in order to strengthen the metropolitan innovation ecosystem.

The portfolio of priority projects outlined in the IUDS amounts to approx. €800 mill., corresponding to the financial capacity of the Municipality for capital investments between 2021-2030. Flagship projects linked to the net-zero objectives include:

Thermal renovation - (projects for 100 blocks submitted under NRRP / prepared under ROP)
Projects nested under the Walkable City Initiative (pedestrian corridors in each neighborhood, putting the 15-Minute City concept into practice)
Projects nested under the Green Cluj Initiative (a network of carbon sinks with over 200 ha of new public green areas +100000 new trees planted in public areas, green-blue corridors for pedestrians and bicycles)
New metro line and metropolitan train (fully operational by 2030 - option for green commutes)
Metropolitan belt (to reduce CO2 emissions from transit, esp. in central area &amp; main neighborhoods)

# Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan for Cluj Napoca Metropolitan Area 2021-2030

The SUMP assumes a target of 100% of the public transport to be green by 2030 (from a current level of 50%). The Municipality is continually renewing its fleet (almost the entire fleet has been replaced with new, efficient and attractive vehicles). In terms of impact, the purchase of 41 new electric buses led to a reduction in CO2 emission by over 2,000 tons/year, lowered the level of outdoor air and noise pollution.

The 2035 vision for urban mobility in Cluj-Napoca and the metropolitan area is formulated on four levels: territorial, metropolitan, local and neighborhood level. The Strategy aims to ensure accessibility within 120 minutes to the main urban centers of region or, air transport, to the main European destinations, a maximum 30 minutes to reach Cluj-Napoca from each of the metropolitan localities by, public transport, e-bike, or private car, a 15-minute city, and 1 minute-neighborhoods.

The SUMP also addresses the need to reduce emissions from the freight traffic, including "last mile" sustainable delivery. An important project planned to reduce emissions from freight transport is creating a network of electro / micromobility hubs. Through this project, storage spaces for parcels will be placed within these hubs, in order to reduce the environmental impact of transporting small goods to the end destination. Based on international best practices, the hubs located in the historic center will be able to include facilities to enable the transfer of goods from cars to cargo bikes, aiming to reduce the impact of freight transport on the central area.

Moreover, the SUMP includes a proposal for a regulation on optimising the transport of goods within the city, which includes limiting or discouraging the timeframe for supplying commercial units within the day through increased taxing, encouraging deliveries with electric vehicles, cargo bikes and bikes and supporting the development of the network of small parcel deposits.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

By implementing all projects proposed in the SUMP (maximum scenario), the environmental impact in terms of GHG emissions reduction is estimated at 240,488 tonnes CO2 equivalent, i.e. a reduction of up to 20% relative to the reference scenario (1,184,056 tonnes CO2 equivalent for 2027).

## District Heating Strategy Cluj-Napoca for 2021-2031 and a perspective for 2050

According to the Strategy, the objectives are to attain a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and a share of energy from renewable sources of at least 32%. Moreover, the measures proposed are directed to meeting the criteria for an efficient centralized heating system, as defined by EC Directive 27/2012 (using at least 50% energy from renewable sources, using at least 50% energy from renewable heat, using at least 75% thermal energy through cogeneration, using at least 50% of a combination of energy and heat of the previously mentioned types).

## Air Quality Improvement Plan for the Cluj-Napoca Agglomeration 2020-2024

The Air Quality Improvement Plan identifies the urban expansion trend as a main contributor to atmospheric pollution as well as noise pollution, leading to an increase in motorised traffic, green space reduction and lower density developments which result in a higher rate of personal car use. The main measures proposed focus on reducing emissions from motorized traffic (through improved public transport, intermodal terminals, major infrastructure projects, restricting access of vehicles over 3,5 tons during peak hours), reducing emissions resulted from heating in the residential sector through energy efficiency measures and increasing the surface of green areas.

## Digital Transformation Strategy of Cluj-Napoca (2021)

The Strategy outlines interventions across six objectives: data-based decision-making, developing digital infrastructure, improving public services, protecting citizen data and ensuring cybersecurity, participation and transparency, and the transversal strategic objective of sustainability and resilience.

## LOCAL REGULATIONS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS

## Energy Performance Standards for New Buildings and Fiscal Incentives for Certified Green Buildings

The Local Council has approved several regulations and fiscal improvement initiatives related to climate neutrality. Firstly, to receive a construction permit, all new private buildings in Cluj-Napoca with more than six apartments need to either connect to the district heating system or to install a low-carbon heating unit for the entire building (rather than individual units, by apartment). The decision to ban installing individual gas-based boilers in new-built apartment blocks has been implemented starting from 2022. Moreover, all public buildings built recently by the Municipality are in line with the nZEB standard. The Municipality also introduced a 50% reduction in property taxes for buildings (commercial or residential) earning a green certification (by LEED, BREEAM and DGNB) and achieving the top score on the energy efficiency rating.

Considering that Cluj-Napoca and its metropolitan area have undergone the most dynamic growth in new housing units in Romania over the past decades (with a 15% increase in housing surface compared to 2011 levels in Cluj-Napoca only), introducing regulations to support the transition towards green building practices is highly needed.

A major success factor for passing transformative regulations such as the cited ones above is the strong political leadership and support for the climate neutrality mission. However, the key barriers identified in using regulations as a lever for accelerating the transition are mostly identified at the level of fiscal regulations impacting citizens directly (particularly around the use of private cars). Overcoming this will require extensive participatory processes to drive proactive behaviour change. Moreover, limits in power were identified in terms of passing regulations to limit the disconnection from the district heating system (resulting in higher operation costs and lower efficiency). To address this, incentivizing options will be explored in the context of extensive investments in creating a green district heating system (Action 1.1.)

# Energy Efficiency Improvement Program for Cluj-Napoca Urban Agglomeration - 2017

The EEIP is established priority projects, the financial means to implement the program and the performance indicators and monitoring the results of the implementation of measures to increase energy efficiency.

# Walkable City and Urban Renewal, Green City, Green Transport

The modal shift to walking and cycling and ensuring a good air quality through urban greening are key policies at the level of the Cluj-Napoca Metropolitan Area, with concrete interventions already implemented in this direction. These include extended pedestrianisation, massive tree planting programs and dedicated public transport lanes.

The most recent one is a bolt and pioneer decision to ban installing individual gas-based boilers in new-built apartment blocks starting 2022. Also, Cluj-Napoca implemented in 2021 the "Green Fridays" initiative. The campaign is called "Stop! Leave your car at home!" and it ensures free access to public transport each Friday. This is a continuation of the "health ticket" with its 20-squats-to-ride system which the city unveiled back in 2020.

# REGIONAL PLANS

# North-West Regional Development Plan 2021-2027

In the period 2021-2027, interventions aimed at improving the energy performance in multi-family residential buildings are considered. The measures aim at at least a moderate rehabilitation (minimum 40% reduction in primary energy consumption) as well as a decrease in annual energy consumption for heating by at least 50%, minimum conditions imposed on all projects.

The NW Region's strategic goal is to become one of Europe's most dynamic areas in terms of smart, sustainable economic growth. To achieve this goal, the region will use local variety and foster innovation while also reducing inequalities and raising living standards. The strategy activities are defined by sustainable development and resilience, fully in line with the environmental and climate objectives at the European level.

A selection of the strategic priorities for the NW Region and specific objectives relevant for the transition towards climate-neutrality of Cluj-Napoca and the metropolitan area is presented below:

Strategic Priority 3: A region with environmentally friendly localities
Supporting energy efficiency in buildings (both housing sector &amp; public buildings) and reducing GHG emissions
Promotion of energy from renewable sources in accordance with the Directive on energy from renewable sources
Intensification of actions to protect and preserve nature, biodiversity and green infrastructure, including in urban areas, as well as reducing all forms of pollution

Strategic Priority 4: A region with sustainable multimodal urban mobility
Promoting sustainable multimodal urban mobility, as part of the transition to a zero-carbon economy

Strategic Priority 5: An accessible region
Development and improvement of national and regional and local sustainable mobility, climate resilient, smart and intermodal, including improving access to TEN-T and cross-border mobility

# NATIONAL PLANS AND POLICIES

The National Integrated Plan in the field of Energy and Climate Change (NIPECC) 2021 – 2030

To achieve the objectives regarding the achievement of targets regarding energy from renewable sources (RES), the Plan details policies and measures aimed at reducing energy consumption, but also to encourage the use of RES in the relevant sectors – heating and cooling, electricity and transport, thus maximizing the synergies between the various actions envisaged.

The NIPECC assumes a 43.9% reduction of emissions related to ETS sectors compared to the level of 2005, respectively by 2% of emissions related to non-ETS sectors compared to the same year. A share of energy of 30.7% in the gross final energy consumption will be accounted by renewable

sources. The Plan addresses the following areas: energy efficiency, reduction of GHG emissions, renewable energy sources, internal market, energy security, research, innovation and competitiveness and further informs the National Energy Strategy for the same period.

# Romania Urban Policy (RUP) 2030

The Urban Policy represents Romania's sustainable, inclusive and resilient urban development vision. The adoption of the first such policy in 2021 has set the common agenda of central and local public authorities to improve the urban development framework, by providing a coherent set of measures and inter-sectoral coordination. Under its second priority objective (Creating liveable and climate-smart cities, by developing green-blue infrastructure to mitigate and adapt to urban risks), the RUP includes a variety of measures related to the climate adaption and mitigation, reducing air pollution and improving sustainable urban mobility.

Assessing the existing local strategies and policies adopted, a major positive advancement lies in the fact that all strategic documents have been recently updated and are aligned in terms of ambition with the Net Zero Action Plan, with solid local policies contributing to the set objectives. Therefore, they do not require an update to support the 2030 climate neutrality ambition, but will act as key instruments to support this transition and provide the opportunity to focus on developing interventions to improve organisational and governance innovation. The two regional and national level policies outlined were selected as the most relevant to the Action Plan and are also fully aligned with the EU strategic directions and policies.

|  1 Residual emissions consist of those emissions which can't be reduced through climate action and are being offset. Residual emission may amount to a maximum of 20 % as stated by the Mission Info Kit.
Baseline reduction target = Baseline emissions – residual emissions.
Emission reductions planned for in existing action planning and strategies should be quantified per sector.
Emissions gap = Baseline emission reduction target – Emissions reduction in existing strategies.
* Although the above-mentioned strategies account for CO2 reductions, for the purpose of this estimate, those values could not be used to calculate the emissions gap. The reason for this is that the emissions were calculated using a different methodology, and the strategies do not take the year 2021 as a reference (used for calculating Action Plan baseline emissions).
** For the residual emissions / offsetting section, the values inputted in this section are those emissions that are not accounted for through the interventions proposed in the Action Plan. The reasoning behind this decision was that the Municipality cannot assume direct responsibility for interventions beyond those included. As explained in section B2-3, these emissions are expected to be tackled by the private sector and by other measures proposed in other local strategies. The interventions proposed in the Action Plan and subsequent target of 81,37% already include offsetting measures (carbon sinks).  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

from EGO-SYSTEM to ECO-SYSTEM in all areas related to Cluj Metropolitan Area's development) and builds on:

Local strategic documents (Local Heating Strategy 2031, SUMP 2027, 2020-2024 Air Quality Plan Improvement Plan)
Projects (pursued both by the Municipality and the local ecosystem), programs (e.g. Walkable City, Cluj-Napoca Urban Agglomeration's Energy Efficiency Improvement Program)
Public measures (e.g., Restructuring contracts with private operators for brownfield redevelopment, fiscal incentives for residents that make their homes energy efficient)
Private measures (e.g., CSR campaigns financed by business actors, encouraging, among others, green mobility/waste recycling).

The Integrated Urban Development Strategy (IUDS) is the key programmatic document for Cluj-Napoca &amp; its Metropolitan Area (CMA) and outlines the investments planned for the 2021-2030-2050 period. Recognizing the growing interdependencies and opportunities for cooperation between the core city and its surrounding localities, the IUDS was elaborated at the metropolitan level, in line with the recommendations of the New Leipzig Charter (transposed in Romania's first Urban Policy) and the PO5. A Europe closer to citizens.

In this context, the city has taken significant steps towards climate-neutrality, which is already an assumed goal in the IUDS 2021-2030-2050 (approved by the City Council in January 2022), which includes a comprehensive package of priority projects to achieve this goal.

ENERGY PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR NEW BUILDINGS AND CONSOLIDATED NZEB SKILLS. With respect to public buildings, significant steps have already been taken in improving energy performance (e.g., thermal rehabilitations, solar panels installed on 15 units) but efforts will be expanded to ensure that most public buildings will achieve nZEB standards by 2030. To receive a construction permit, all new private buildings in Cluj-Napoca with more than 6 apartments need to either connect to the district heating system or to install a low-carbon heating unit for the entire building (rather than individual units).
RENOVATION OF EXISTING BUILDINGS. 78% of GHG emissions in Cluj-Napoca are generated by the built environment, with the residential sector accounting for over half of these emissions. In this regard, Cluj-Napoca has already taken important steps, with over 55% of the estimated 101.000 apartments thermally refurbished, mostly by household associations, from private funds. Also, the City of Cluj-Napoca co-finances thermal rehabilitation works undertaken with EU Funds (ROP and RRF). However, the plan is to move beyond thermal rehabilitation interventions and focus on integrated urban regeneration interventions that also include energy generation (e.g. solar roof panels, green facades and roofs), encouragement of sustainable transport use (e.g. dedicated public transport lanes, extended network of bike paths, larger and better quality pedestrian spaces, natural shade for pedestrians and cyclists), discouragement of private car use, and improving the quality of life in neighborhoods to reduce flight to suburbs and peri-urban areas. The IUDS 2021-2030-2050 includes urban regeneration proposals for apartment block neighborhoods in Cluj-Napoca, as well as the MA.
INTEGRATING RES GENERATION FACILITIES INTO BUILDINGS. The Municipality has already installed solar panels on approx. 15 public buildings, including schools, sports facilities,

CLEAN BUSES AND NEW AND EFFICIENT TRAMS. Transport is the sector with the highest increase in GHG emissions in recent years in Cluj-Napoca, mainly commuter traffic - a target of 80% of commutes by public &amp; non-motorized transport by 2030 was set in the IUDS &amp; SUMP. Several major investments are planned / in progress (metro system, metropolitan train, Someș Blue-Green Corridor, Southern belt, Metropolitan green belt). Moreover, to encourage a rapid uptake of electric cars in Cluj-Napoca, the existing network of electric charging stations has been continuously expanded, together with dedicated parking. Around 20% of the bus fleet in the Cluj MA is electric (around 50% of the total public transport fleet, including trams and trolleybuses, is currently electric), including charging stations, and the current SUMP proposes 100% of public transport to be green by 2030. In addition, almost the entire fleet has been replaced with new, efficient and attractive vehicles. The purchase of 41 buses led to a reduction in CO2 emission by over 2,000 tons/year, lowered the level of outdoor air and noise pollution and generated cost savings of more than €60,000/year.

MODAL SHIFT TO WALKING &amp; CYCLING. The on-going Walkable City Program has transformed many areas of the city into pedestrian-only / shared spaces. This program will be expanded, with a stronger focus on residential neighborhoods, to make it more attractive for people to walk, bike, or use public transport. Energy use in private buildings can be significantly reduced if people are encouraged to spend more time outdoors and less time indoors. A particular focus will be on transforming Cluj-Napoca into a city for kids, as a city that is safe and exciting for kids to explore, is also a city that will be friendlier to people with disabilities, seniors, tourists, immigrants, and parents. Thus, Cluj-Napoca's "Walkable City" Program is the most comprehensive initiative of this kind in Romania (including dedicated public transport, bike lanes, planting of new trees, charging stations, green taxi stands, smart lighting and traffic management). The Program resulted, so far, in new low emission zones within the city center (car access only for residents, employees, and suppliers), dedicated lanes for public transport and bicycles, electric charging stations, stands for electric taxis, extended pedestrian and planted areas.

The actions foreseen within this Action Plan are connected with primarily 3 of the 6 Specific Objectives identified in the IUDS &amp; their corresponding investment priorities:

SO3. Carbon Neutral, Green &amp; Resilient City and Metropolitan Area. The actions are directly aligned with the following investment priorities under this objective:

: Increasing energy performance in collective housing complexes
: Increasing energy performance in public buildings and public lighting system
: Investments in the central heating system, electricity supply infrastructure and natural gas
: Supporting the implementation at local and metropolitan level of the integrated waste management system and the circular economy
: Conservation of natural heritage, and development of green-blue infrastructure
: Reduction of air pollution and noise pollution

SO4. No one left behind. The actions complement &amp; can further inform the implementation of the following investment priorities:

: Carrying out integrated socio-economic interventions at the level of marginalized communities and developing a diverse range of social and employment services for all people at risk of poverty and exclusion

: Implementing an integrated housing policy at the level of the Municipality and the metropolitan area

The transition to climate-neutrality directly impacts each of us, both in terms of its urgency &amp; the actions required to achieve it. The proposed actions address the need to ensure an inclusive carbon transition and have a citizen / "user-first" focus – starting with a behavior analysis on individual adaptation and focusing on high-density neighbourhoods, which are increasingly exposed to energy poverty. As highlighted in the IUDS, over 50% of the population of Cluj-Napoca and its MA lives in 30-60 years old flats built during the communist period, with the technologies and materials available at the time. This situation directly impacts residents in terms of living costs (particularly energy bills, as a result of low energy efficiency of the building) and comfort. Moreover, awareness and empowering residents with knowledge on carbon neutrality and sustainability further support the objective of leaving no one behind and involving citizens across the CMA.

SO2. Made and Invented in Cluj. The city's vision to become a "European Lab City", where the solutions to challenges of the future are being tested is reflected in SO2 and its investment priorities, particularly:

: Developing the research-development-innovation and technology transfer capacity, both in the public and private sectors, in order to strengthen the metropolitan innovation ecosystem.

Involving a broad spectrum of partners in the local Net Zero Coalition, bringing together the public sector, academia and RDI, energy and IT clusters, a digital innovation hub (DIH) &amp; professional organizations of architects and urban planners, etc, the Action Plan is consistent with the investment priority to develop RDI and technology transfer capacity, which lies at the core of the city's development vision for 2030.

Thus, the portfolio of priority projects outlined in the IUDS amount to approx. €800 mill., corresponding to the financial capacity of the Municipality for capital investments between 2021-2030. Among these, flagship projects linked to the net-zero objectives and actions envisaged in this Plan can be summarized as follows:

Thermal renovation (projects for 100 residential apartment blocks submitted under NRRP / prepared under ROP)
Projects nested under the Walkable City Initiative (pedestrian corridors in each neighborhood, putting the 15-Minute City concept into practice)
Projects nested under the Green Cluj Initiative (a network of carbon sinks with over 200 ha of new public green areas +100.000 new trees planted in public areas, green-blue corridors for pedestrians and bicycles)
New metro line and metropolitan train (fully operational by 2030 - option for green commutes)

Metropolitan belt (to reduce CO2 emissions from transit, especially in central area and main neighborhoods).

Strategies, policies and plans which are relevant for achieving climate-neutrality (particularly the IUDS, PACED and SUMP - summarized under Module A-2) have a series of strengths. Firstly, they provide an up-to-date analysis of needs and challenges regarding reducing carbon emissions, as they all have been recently updated. Secondly, they are well-aligned in terms of objectives and priorities, and act as practical instruments for guiding the transition, by identifying a clear list of priority projects, possible financing sources and timelines.

All key strategic documents have benefit from effective stakeholder engagement, including citizens, experts, private sector and academia. For example, the IUDS (approved in January 2022) has benefitted from intensive participatory processes even in the pandemic context, through online live consultations which have allowed for a wide outreach and engagement of the community and have been led by the Mayor of Cluj-Napoca. In addition, several sociological research initiatives have informed the planning. The participatory process piloted through the Center for Civic Innovation and Imagination has become a landmark for the city's approach to strategic planning and decision-making, which will be scaled up for the implementation of the Net Zero City Action Plan. Moreover, all strategic documents are geared towards ensuring sustainable development at the metropolitan scale, recognizing the strong interdependencies which also impact achieving the city's ambitious climate goals and potential positive spill-overs. The strategies have a common outlook (2030, with an outlook to 2050 - in the case of the IUDS) and clear impact indicators defined.

The updated IUDS builds strongly on the previous strategic document, assessing its implementation progress and maintaining the key directions around which the strategic vision of becoming a "European Lab City" is formulated: Innovation, University and Participation. The vision for 2050 is strongly focused on quality of life, enhanced by the development and testing of new technologies, processes and policies to meet the challenges of the future.

The barriers to implementation of the strategic documents are mainly derived from securing funding for the major infrastructure projects planned (referenced below under "Funds"), accelerating the energy efficiency renovation of the buildings stock (a solution in this regard is identifying a more performing homeowners' association model to leverage private funding) and resistance to behaviour changes required for the transition to a climate-neutral city (particularly to policies affecting diesel car owners). While there is a strong political will and decision-makers are committed this goal, capacity constraints may affect implementation of planned projects.

Although, at the moment, there are certain barriers that the Municipality faces on its way to achieving climate-neutrality strategic ambition, to which certain types of risks that can hinder this transition are added, nevertheless, at the same time, the Municipality has already created a solid foundation (as described above), on which it can build all the transition actions towards carbon neutrality, together with the local Net Zero Coalition.

In this context, we must mention that certain sectors and activities are outside of the Municipality's regulatory control. We are talking about certain areas where Cluj-Napoca Municipality needs to work with other governmental layers, namely the county-level and national-level governments, given on the one hand their significance and, on the other hand, their belonging to other governmental layers. More precisely, at the moment, Cluj County is implementing the 2020-2025 County Waste Management Plan, which covers municipal waste, special waste streams and waste resulting from the activities of health units and veterinary activities. This planning tool is used for ensuring efficient waste management at county (and implicitly local) level, with low impact on the environment and human health and with minimal consumption of resources and energy. Thus, in the Solid Waste Management sector, waste collection including (selective collection) falls under the responsibility of the local administration, while the disposal of waste (in the case of Cluj-Napoca we refer to the ecological landfill) is managed by the Cluj County Council. The water and wastewater sector are managed by the Someș Regional Water Company, where Cluj County Council is the majority shareholder. Moreover, several of Cluj-Napoca's major transport projects (that will have a big impact on reducing GHG emissions), such as the Southern Beltway, the Connection to the Transylvania Highway (A3 Highway) and the Metro will be financed by the National Government.

In terms of barriers, critical gaps and challenges that might hinder the transition to climate-neutrality, some major obstacles at local and even metropolitan level can be observed. The fast-growing car ownership rate, fueled by the import of cheap and polluting second-hand cars from other EU Member States, a relaxed policy of residential parking or the deep-routed culture of possessing and using the personal even for short distances, is currently the biggest vulnerability of the city. Another one is related to the energy efficiency of residential buildings, correlated with the increasing price for natural gas. Only 55% of the multi-apartment building units have been thermally rehabilitated, while most of them are using autonomous (apartment) heating systems based exclusively on natural gas. The price for this fuel has reached a historical level in 2022, exposing many households to potential energy poverty.

However, it is important to note that the city can benefit from the fact it is the second educational center in Romania, with over 120,000 pupils and students (one third of the total population) and hosts the biggest and the most prestigious university in Romania (BBU), together with other major public universities active in most areas of expertise, from agriculture and IT&amp;C to health and energy. Additionally, it is estimated that almost 50% of the residents have graduated from university, most of them working in IT&amp;C (15%), BPO, education, health services etc. The city is also the most entrepreneurial in Romania, with almost 70 active firms per 1,000 inhabitants.

## MAIN GAPS, BARRIERS AND ASSISTANCE NEEDS

INFRASTRUCTURE: While the energy consumption of municipal and tertiary buildings dropped in recent years, after massive private investment and EU funding for improving energy efficiency, the share of residential buildings in the total GHG emissions continued to grow from 49% to 53%. The GHG emission in the residential sector dropped by less than 15% in the last decade, despite the large share of blocks that went through private rehabilitation (50-55%). Here, it is worth mentioning the gap between the number of apartments blocks that have been thermally retrofitted and the reductions achieved in energy consumption: this difference is justified by the fact that Cluj-Napoca is the most dynamic real

estate market in Romania. The city, together with its metropolitan area, experienced, at the national level, the fastest growth in the delivery of new housing units - this situation applies both within the core city and the peri-urban areas. Within Cluj-Napoca, the housing surface grew from 7 mil. sqm to 8.1 mil. sqm (reaching a tremendous 15 % increase) from 2011 to 2021. In Floresti, the main suburb of Cluj-Napoca, the housing surface grew from 0.8 mil. sqm to 1.5 mil sqm between 2011 and 2021, registering an 83% increase. Moreover, despite the availability of EU/State Budget funding for thermal rehabilitation, many owners refuse / do not have the money to cover the co-financing for such interventions. Almost 80% have unplugged from the centralised heating system and installed individual heating systems using natural gas, one of the main sources of CO2 emissions at local level. Also, at the moment, there is room for improvement in the transport and waste sectors, due to current barriers such as insufficient charging facilities for electric vehicles, under-sized cycling infrastructure (both in terms of velo lanes kilometres and support facilities) and insufficient ecological islands for the selective collection of waste.

CAPACITIES: One of the main challenges concerns the reduced capacity for action among individuals (both as persons and also as entities), due to the lack of a unified understanding and a common vision on climate-neutrality. For instance, various individual behaviours damage the local climate-neutrality pathway (e.g., a deep-rooted behaviour of possessing cars - even +1 / household, using personal cars for short distances). We aim to improve the Municipality's overall ability to channel local efforts towards climate-neutrality, in order to catalyse this transformation in a bottom-up and place-based manner, centred on the individual (person / legal entity). Moreover, although the climate-neutrality concept is known (at least heard of) by most residents and local organisations and there are many local climate-friendly initiatives, the concept is not deeply understood and even less assumed at a personal or collective level. At the moment, the Municipality does not have data on the average level of knowledge / competence of citizens &amp; local ecosystem, in order to identify the know-how entry point to use in stimulating pro-climate-neutrality behaviours.

PROCESSES: Although the Municipality has up-to-date urban planning documents, many of them do not place climate-neutrality as a central pillar of urban development (thus not including predominantly carbon-neutral interventions), which imposes the need for shifting the way urban planning is approached at local level. Other regulatory barriers include bureaucracy associated with expropriation measures for public infrastructure, poor regulation/standardisation at central level (e.g. unclear micro-mobility legislation), inefficient legislation on public procurement. The continuous and poorly regulated urban sprawl especially in the suburban LAUs also jeopardises this ambition. As in the case of planning instruments, local policies have not yet succeeded to become main instruments for encouraging climate-neutrality. Moreover, the policy tools are not sufficiently based on the scientific evidence developed within the academic/RDI institutions or regional clusters. Lastly, the community is weak at neighbourhood level (a collective mentality is lacking, joint efforts are not stimulated and promoted, therefore not assumed and understood), which hinders local common approaches.

RESOURCE FLOWS: Urban renewal initiatives (e.g., Green Cluj / Walkable City) are most successful at local level, but still face implementation limitations: funding (high cost of major projects vs. limited EU funding, high inflation, reduced local budget), lack of public property for all envisaged interventions, public opposition to the renewal projects that involve limiting car transit in favour of green mobility. Resource flows are also disturbed by the availability and capacity of different private contractors to deliver in time and at the agreed quality level, in the context of high inflation, poor availability of labour force, unethical practices of some companies.

ALLIANCES: Although the public administration in Cluj-Napoca is one of the most innovative, proactive and performing in Romania, it is not backed-up by a well-organised and structured community. To reduce this deficit, we need bodies, structures &amp; processes that work at the community level, reducing the gap between the public administration and citizens and between the urban and peri-urban environment, so that dialogue between these actors and territorial levels can be improved. This barrier will be countered through the local Net Zero Coalition, whose role will be to bring together local champions from various sectors (public sector, academia and RDI, business, civil society, non-governmental sector), who can fuel the city's climate transition.

FUNDS: The funding barriers associated with the climate-neutrality envisaged by the Municipality are very high. Firstly, the implementation costs for only a few of the major projects (subway, metropolitan train, metropolitan beltway etc.) is above 3 million Euro, an amount comparable with the total budget of an 2014-2020 Operational Programme for Romania. Secondly, the high inflation reported recently brings the need to update these investment costs periodically to make them attractive for contractors. The local budget can cover only a small percentage of these expenses; thus, the focus of this Municipality will continue to be on external sources. These barriers affect all the emission domains, because financing is the one that inevitably dictates their implementation. However, the main emission sectors that can be impacted by funding obstacles include transportation (given the large sums involved and the long implementation periods, especially in the case of the metro) and energy (since the rehabilitation of the district heating system involves both massive energy efficiency investment and stimulus for the reconnection of households that withdrew from the system in the last 2 decades). To be more precise, there are several specific funding barriers that we have previously faced against achieving climate neutrality. We will continue to encounter some of these during the implementation of this Action Plan. Some of the most significant barriers are described below. Overall, addressing these funding barriers will be critical for us to achieve climate neutrality and progress towards a 0-emission future. However, we acknowledge the fact that we still have plenty of work to do in this regard.

Lack of dedicated funding: We have to admit that the process of securing dedicated funding for climate action can be a challenge, particularly for long-term projects. Our local budget is limited, and sometimes, resources may need to be allocated to other priorities, making it difficult for us to invest in low-carbon projects.

High upfront costs: The climate neutrality interventions, such as building retrofits or public transportation infrastructure, require significant upfront investments that involve massive financial resources.

Uncertainty around revenue streams: Many of the proposed climate actions can be subject to market fluctuations and other uncertainties that will increase the difficulty to project future revenue streams, especially in the current geopolitical context.

Competing priorities: Climate action is not seen as a top priority in the eyes of all our citizens, particularly when we refer to the communities that are prone to poverty and have a reduced ability of understanding such matters. Thus, we expect that some residents will oppose to the massive financial investments needed in order to achieve the proposed climate neutrality interventions.

We must also mention the difficulty of motivating private investors to implement climate neutrality projects in the local industry. We have observed some barriers that cause a certain reluctance of private investors, in relation to the private projects that could contribute to the local economy's climate neutrality:

#

Lack of profitability: Many climate neutrality projects may not generate significant profits or returns on investment, which reduce their attractiveness for private investors, especially is such uncertain financial times.
Uncertainty: Climate neutrality projects often involve new and innovative technologies or approaches, which can be untested or uncertain. This uncertainty makes the local private investors hesitant to invest, as they may perceive these projects as too risky.
Regulatory barriers: The national regulatory environment is not always a favourable one, because national regulations can often be unclear, inconsistent or not provide sufficient incentives for private investment.
Lack of knowledge and awareness: Private investors do not have a full understanding of climate neutrality, the benefits that such projects can provide, and neither the opportunities for investment. This lack of knowledge and awareness can lead to a lack of interest in investing in such projects.

For us, another challenge is also the use of PPPs in the implementation of climate neutrality projects. Some of the reasons that constitute barriers in this respect include:

Lack of control: In PPP projects, private partners typically have a significant degree of control over the project, which can make it difficult for us to ensure that the project meets all the established needs and goals.
Financial risk: PPP projects could involve significant a financial risk, as we may be required to provide significant upfront funding or be held liable for cost overruns or other financial issues.
Public opposition: PPP projects sometimes face opposition from the citizens, who may be concerned about the way in which private companies manage the public infrastructure.
Regulatory hurdles: PPP projects are subject to central regulatory hurdles, which could delay their implementation.

ASSISTANCE NEEDS: Resulting from the previously mentioned barriers and the Municipality's goal to decrease their extent and impact, Cluj-Napoca's main assistance needs consist, on the one hand, in support for establishing the knowledge and practices/behaviors necessary to accelerate the transition to climate-neutrality and, on the other hand, in assistance for the optimization of the processes encompassed in the ambition to reach the local climate-neutrality objectives.

During the workshop organized by the Net Zero City Advisors, our local Net Zero Coalition adopted a systems-thinking approach to scrutinize the draft NZC Action Plan with key stakeholders. Through this exercise, the Coalition identified specific barriers and opportunities in various emission domains, including energy systems, mobility and transport, waste &amp; circular economy and green infrastructure &amp; nature-based solutions. Although the workshop did not focus on the built environment, the Coalition subsequently held a working session to examine barriers and opportunities in this emission domain.

# BUILT ENVIRONMENT

The majority of the built environment consists of buildings that were constructed before energy efficiency regulations came into force. These buildings are energy-inefficient and are difficult to retrofit to meet current energy efficiency standards, resulting in high energy consumption and carbon emissions.
The upfront cost of implementing energy-efficient technologies and building systems can be prohibitive for building owners and developers. This cost can deter investment in energy-efficient technologies, despite the long-term cost savings.
Many people are not aware of the benefits of energy-efficient buildings, and the potential cost savings that can be achieved through energy-efficient practices. This lack of awareness can limit demand for energy-efficient buildings and products.
There are no uniform mechanisms for monitoring the energy efficiency of buildings, making it difficult for policymakers, investors, and consumers to evaluate the energy performance of buildings accurately.
The local regulations and incentives are not stringent enough to encourage energy-efficient practices.
The behaviour of building occupants is also a barrier to achieving climate neutrality. For example, many citizens do not bother to turn off lights and appliances when not in use and use heating and cooling systems inefficiently.
The current Associations of Residential Buildings' Owners have scarce resources (e.g., competencies, knowledge, funds) to initiate and support climate neutrality interventions.

The huge amounts of non-reimbursable funds available for building retrofitting through the 2021-2027 ROP.
The plethora of options in terms of innovative energy-efficient building materials, efficient heating systems, cooling and lighting systems.
The potential of implementing energy-efficient practices.
Incorporating green building design principles, such as passive solar design, natural ventilation, and green roofs, could reduce the energy consumption of buildings and improve their indoor environmental quality.
Conducting, with the help of local universities, ROAT and the energy manager, life cycle assessments (LCAs) of buildings could help in identifying opportunities to reduce their carbon footprint.
The policies and regulations that could incentivize energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable building practices.
The improved collaboration between stakeholders, including building owners, developers, architects, engineers, policymakers, and financiers, which could be mediated by the representatives of the Net Zero City Coalition.
The recent approval of the Guide for Energy Performance Interventions applicable to new buildings, in line with the nZEB requirements.

Another identified barrier was the lack of data and scenario planning capacity, which is a transversal issue across existing climate-relevant strategies, policies and plans. Cluj-Napoca Municipality faces the lack of data that would allow a fully-evidence-based modus operandi. Thus, a comprehensive process for improving emissions baseline is required in order for the Net Zero City Local Coalition to be able to properly assess the impact of the interventions applied through this Action Plan. The Municipality aims to address this barrier in the coming years by strengthening its evidence-based governance and implementation capacity, both within the Municipality and the Coalition, to achieve the goal of climate neutrality. Net Zero City Advisors' support during the Action Plan's actual implementation period is anticipated in overcoming these challenges. Moreover, we will consider platforms such as ClimateView, Futureproofed and ClimateWatch, to be able to provide adequate data for our decision-making processes, but also for educating and implicitly supporting, our citizens.

In order to be able to encourage the systemic transformation of local neighbourhoods, it is necessary to address these barriers simultaneously and in a coordinated manner, through levers dedicated to each focal point. Overcoming these barriers will make Cluj-Napoca's pathway to climate-neutrality a textbook example for other similar cities, this Action Plan aiming to push urban climate-neutrality even higher on the local agenda.

# MAIN RISKS THAT COULD IMPACT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE CITY'S CLIMATE-NEUTRALITY TARGET BY 2030

LEADERSHIP, STRATEGIC PLANNING, AND POLITICAL RISK SOURCES. The frequent changes of leadership, budget allocation for the local level and investment priorities at governmental level (3 different Prime Ministers in 2 years). This instability is challenging, the speed of the central authorities in implementing major transport infrastructure is very low and the focus on metropolitan /urban functional areas is almost non-existent. In this unpredictable context, the Municipality is taking responsibility for the preparation of major projects (subway, metropolitan train, beltway) - normally the attribute of the central administration - and for reducing the level of emissions, by using local regulations and innovative tools.

REGULATORY RISK SOURCES. These risks include the resources and bureaucracy associated with different expropriations measures for public use, poor regulation / standardization at central level, inefficient legislation on public procurement that can delay the implementation calendar of many projects (a high risk especially for those that are financed from the Recovery and Resilience Plan and must be concluded by the end of 2026). To prevent these risks, the Municipality started the preparation of these projects a few years ago, leaving enough space for the entire bureaucratic process of securing the assets, getting all the legal approvals and permits to obtain interoperability and shared standards.

ORGANIZATIONAL RISK SOURCES. The main organizational risk is related to the capacity of the limited number of public staff to deliver many interventions, some

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

unprecedented in size and complexity. Although the impact of this risk is considered moderate, due to the fact that the city proved the capacity to absorb the most EU funds among all growth poles in Romania, the Municipality is considering to fill the gap of personnel and competences with external expertise, volunteers, but also by reallocating and training its own staff in the context of strong digitalization of most tasks – hundreds of public services and procedures are already in place, as well as a virtual public servant, the first in Romania).

PARTNERSHIPS / STAKEHOLDER (WORKING TOGETHER) RISK SOURCES. In terms of partnerships and stakeholder engagement, no major risks are foreseen. The Municipality intends to intensify its previous efforts to efficiently engage more stakeholders and citizens in the decision making and co-delivery processes, through the Net Zero Coalition. The Center for Civic Imagination and Innovation (one of the most innovative tools of decision making, considered to be a good practice in Romania), participatory budgeting and international design competition will remain the main tools to ensure that the Municipality manages to capture as many ideas as possible, proposals, opinions, and support from the community. All these initiatives will be coordinated under the umbrella of the Net Zero Coalition, which will manage, through the involvement of all relevant stakeholder categories, the proposed local climate-neutrality actions.

SOCIAL RISK SOURCES. Energy and transport poverty are the main social risks at the local level. The vision of the Municipality is that no one should be left behind in the process of smart, green, and digital transformation of the city. In this context, the Municipality has implemented financial support initiatives for the residents with low income that can't afford to pay the thermal energy bill, subsidizing more than half of the prices for those still using the centralized heating system. For public transport, the city has adopted the Green Friday Initiative when everybody can use public transport for free. Another measure is that the Municipality provides free school transport for children, both pupils and students.

ENVIRONMENTAL RISK SOURCES. Air pollution is the main risk at local level, already acknowledged as having a large impact and tackled by the Air Quality Improvement Plan for 2020-2024. The emissions of NO2/NOx and PM10, that are most problematic in the city, can affect the health and wellbeing of many citizens, especially children and elderly. From this perspective, the priorities of the Municipality will remain to implement the "Green Cluj" and "Walkable City" that will create new carbon sinks and reduce the appetite for personal car use for short distances (15 minutes walking to general use facilities).

SAFETY AND SECURITY RISK SOURCES. Cluj-Napoca is acknowledged to be one of the safest cities in Romania, a fact that was confirmed by the 2020 edition of the Report on the quality of life in European cities. For cybersecurity measures the city works closely with a Consultative Committee for Entrepreneurship and Innovation in IT, that reunites the 2 local IT clusters with hundreds of members and has recently elaborated a Digital Transformation Strategy that tackles this topic. The Municipality/County Council has invested in fixing some vulnerable perimeters (landslides) with tree planting, in the framework of the "Green Cluj" Initiative.

INFRASTRUCTURE: All the infrastructure projects carried out so far at the local and metropolitan level represent the basis for developing and implementing this Action Plan. In this sense, the previous initiatives and efforts will be capitalised through scaling and upgrading, especially in the context of the non-refundable funds available for interventions in the transport, energy and housing infrastructure.
CAPACITIES: Shortly after Cluj-Napoca was selected among the 100 cities in the EU to become climate neutral and smart by 2030, the Municipality has organized the InnoWave Summit. The other two cities selected from Romania (Suceava and Bucharest) had the chance to meet for the first time and discuss the future of climate neutrality in Romania with the coordinator of the Horizon European Mission Cities, the President of European Committee of the Regions, the European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, members of the European Parliament, the representatives of the Romanian Ministry for Research, Innovation and Digitalisation etc. Thus, the local ecosystem and the Municipality have assumed a clear responsibility at national and EU-level that Cluj-Napoca is highly politically committed to act as an European Lab City for climate neutrality, in line with its strategic development vision for 2030.
PROCESSES: Up until now, the Local Council has approved, generally unanimously, any local strategy, plan, regulation or initiative related to climate neutrality. The most recent one is a bold pioneer decision to ban installing individual gas-based boilers in new-built apartment blocks starting 2022. Also, Cluj-Napoca implemented in 2021 the "Green Fridays" initiative. The campaign is called "Stop! Leave your car at home!" and it ensures free access to public transport each Friday. This is a continuation of the "health ticket" with its 20-squats-to-ride system which the city unveiled back in 2020. At the moment, Cluj-Napoca is the only city in Romania to have all its general and sectoral planning documents recently updated (IUDS, SUMP, SACEP, Air Quality Improvement Plan, District Energy Strategy, Digital Transformation Strategy etc.) and the only major one with a General Urban Plan approved in the last 10 years. All these documents have a strong focus on climate change, environmental protection, GHG emissions, sustainable mobility, energy efficiency.
RESOURCE FLOWS: Since the supplier market has started to recover after the impact of the global pandemic and manages to remain constant even in the current fragile geopolitical context, the Municipality considers that the resource flows necessary for the proposed actions will be able to be optimally managed, without affecting the steps taken within this local climate-neutrality ambition.
ALLIANCES: Mayor Emil Boc, who is also the president of the Romanian Association of Municipalities, president of the European Committee of the Regions' commission for Territorial Cohesion Policy and EU Budget (COTER), the designated Country Ambassador at the European Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy and former Prime Minister of Romania, is one the strongest supporters of climate neutrality at national and EU level. At his initiative, Cluj-Napoca was the first Municipality in Romania to sign the Green City Accord and also the first city nationwide to lead the sustainable urban mobility group within the City Science Initiative Network.
FUNDS: Cluj-Napoca can be considered a magnet for attracting European funds allocated through the National and Regional Operational Programs, respectively through the NRRP. The Municipality has a department dedicated for the preparation and implementation of projects with non-reimbursable financing, which prepares financing applications for accessing these types of funds. Moreover, the Municipality has identified a series of international funding opportunities, for which the dedicated project department will prepare applications in the coming years, as new open funding calls will be launched. Thus, of priority interest for Cluj-Napoca are the

projects that can be prepared within the European Urban Initiative and URBACT (especially for urban regeneration), New European Bauhaus (due to the public aim of creating a more sustainable, inclusive and beautiful future for Cluj-Napoca's citizens), LIFE programme (especially for clean energy and circular economy) and Horizon Europe (for strengthening the local RDI potential in climate, energy and mobility matters, respectively smart city solutions), Connecting Europe Facility (especially in terms of sustainable urban mobility and renewable energy), Interreg Europe (because the city's aim to become smarter, greener, more connected and social, closer to citizens and better governed), DUT and DEAR.

# OPPORTUNITIES FOR COORDINATED ACTION AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER AT NATIONAL LEVEL

As previously-stated, the dialogue with the other two Romanian cities (Bucharest and Suceava) that are part of The Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities (Cities Mission) has already been initiated through the InnoWave Summit. Furtherly, we are willing to strengthen the collaboration with the local administrations of these two cities, but also with their local ecosystems (universities, RDI organizations and private actors that can generate impact). We aim to transform our paths towards climate neutrality into practical best practice models for the cities throughout the country, by organizing not only events similar to InnoWave, but also hands-on activities, such as joint discussions and one-to-one work meetings.

The Executive Unit for Financing Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation (EUFHERDI - a public institution that is subordinated to the Ministry of National Education) has formally assumed the role of National Coordinator of the climate transition of Romanian cities, in accordance with the principles Cities Mission. Hence, EUFHERDI will work closely both with Cluj-Napoca, Bucharest and Suceava and with other Romanian follower cities, in order to ensure the scale-up of climate-neutrality efforts at national level and also to gather national support for measures with impact at local level. Besides the fact that we are totally dedicated to this ambition and will be actively involved in the partnership with EUFHERDI and the other Mission Cities, we also aim to obtain dedicated support from the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of the Environment, in order to accelerate the climate neutrality journeys of Romanian cities.

A number of Romanian follower cities are already preparing their own Action Plans for transitioning to climate neutrality (Timisoara, Iași, Arad, Reșița, Lugoj) and several others have expressed their intention to do the same (Brașov, Piatra Neamț, Sibiu). In this regard, Cluj-Napoca's Net Zero City Coalition will work closely not only with the 2 Mission Cities, but also with the other above-mentioned local administrations, in order to provide assistance, share knowledge and transfer best practices related to climate neutrality matters.

Furthermore, representatives of relevant national ministries will also be invited to the events organized by the Net Zero Coalition, in the Coalition's attempt to strengthen dialogue with national public authorities and bring them closer to local climate-neutrality efforts, given that the country's climate-neutrality starts with local steps. Moreover, any relevant material developed within the proposed actions (e.g., if various guides, analyses, studies or relevant reports will be prepared) will be disseminated to the public staff in the ministries, in the spirit of bottom-up transfer of site-specific

knowledge.

In order to overcome the identified systemic barriers and to exploit related opportunities, several measures will be undertaken at local and metropolitan scale, based on the following levers:

GOVERNANCE LEVERS:
Enhancing the capacity of the ecosystem to implement and monitor climate neutral policies, through the Net Zero local Coalition and the dedicated NZC Champs Campaign;
Skills upgrading package for the community, the ecosystem representatives and building administrators; study visits &amp; exchange of good practices;
Digital platform (interactive website managed by the local climate neutrality ecosystem);
Climate Neutrality Digital Twin (virtual tool for collecting, visualising, monitoring and forecasting social and natural behaviours and environments relevant for the climate transition of the city).

POLICY &amp; REGULATION LEVERS:
Comprehensive climate-neutrality masterplan for dense multi-apartment neighbourhoods;
Detailed proposals for transforming different areas in neighbourhoods/suburbs into climate neutral demo districts;
Update the General Spatial Planning of Cluj-Napoca, to incorporate strategies for reducing CO2 emissions in all targeted areas;
Zonal Urban Plans for climate-neutral neighborhoods;
International contests for solutions for the major urban renewal interventions outlined in the Action Plan;
Terms of reference for the renovation of private and public buildings in line with the nZEB principles, but also with other local priorities (e.g. extending the average living area of the apartments or the capacity of schools);
Defining a set of urban planning principles for climate neutral interventions in high density multi-apartment neighbourhoods;
New governance models for condominiums and their integration into the local climate neutrality ecosystem.

SOCIAL INNOVATION &amp; ECOSYSTEM INTEGRATION:
Knowledge &amp; competence audit of the local climate neutrality ecosystem;
Civic imagination &amp; innovation modelling for climate neutrality at neighbourhood level;

DEMOCRACY/PARTICIPATION:
Behavioural, perception and modelling analysis on the individual adaptation of residents and businesses to climate neutrality enhancing the contribution an adaptation of residents to climate neutrality;
NetZero Caravan in neighbourhoods and suburbs.

Overall, Cluj-Napoca Municipality will implement, within the Coalition, a flexible model of adaptive management: through the proposed iteration sessions, the current situation for each action will be assessed annually. Depending on the assessment results/outcomes, the way in which the barriers were overcome and the opportunities were capitalized will be monitored. Furtherly, the alternatives

for reaching the proposed targets will be established by consulting the Net Zero City Coalition's members. Moreover, the Precautionary Principle will guide all targeted actions, so that no harm is caused to the people, the organizations and the environment.

# UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT

Cluj-Napoca's journey towards climate neutrality until 2030 is an ambitious one, given the number and size of the projects required to reach our target. In order to be able to reduce the risks caused by the complexity of the actions included in this Plan, the progress of its implementation will be monitored annually, by the internal team of the Cluj-Napoca Municipality. Monitoring will take into account an uncertainty framework, through which course will be adjusted if key barriers are not addressed in time, or if opportunities and expectations are not met.

In order to implement the uncertainty framework, we followed the model proposed for the Strategic Environmental Assessment, which was developed by M. Bodde, K. Van der Wel, P. Driessen and A. Wardekker in the article Strategies for Dealing with Uncertainties in Strategic Environmental Assessment: An Analytical Framework Illustrated with Case Studies from The Netherlands¹. According to this article, the typology of uncertainties relevant for strategic environmental assessments (SEAs) comprises inherent, scientific, social and legal uncertainties, which influence the decision-making process and dictate the future courses of action. We applied this model intended for environmental assessment to the specifics of our document and adapted it to our climate neutrality case, which resulted in the following:

INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES: These are given by the inherent unpredictability of the systems. For example, the cause-effect relationship in climate change is complex and difficult to establish, especially when we take into account its cumulative effects and their scale. Such uncertainties will be managed along the way by the experts from the internal team of the Municipality, who will also consult the experts from the Coalition, because we are talking about uncertainties that can manifest themselves regardless of the measures adopted by the Municipality.
SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTIES: These refer to issues in terms of relevant data, based on the difficulty of collecting it due to limited access to the necessary information. Moreover, the existing data may not be fully accurate and may become invalid over time, even due to incorrect measurement and prediction. These uncertainties will be addressed through knowledge generation, and the main responsibles will be the universities involved - TUCN and BBU. Through the technologies and know-how they possess, the universities will generate various knowledge that will help us to better substantiate our actions, especially since the faculties that the 2 universities include cover complex fields (energy, transport, architecture, environmental protection, sociology, etc.) and allow the combination of several disciplines in the pursued research. Thus, new quantitative and qualitative data will be generated, which will complete and substantiate the amount of available evidence.
SOCIAL UNCERTAINTIES: These are connected to the actors involved in the pathways towards climate neutrality, being caused by the different values, interpretations, needs, interests and expectations of the people involved, also based on the category of stakeholders they represent. To all this is added the political climate, which can influence

the way climate issues are addressed. In this case, the role of the Coalition, the Champions and the Caravan is to strengthen stakeholder engagement and to increase their support for the implementation of the Action Plan. The approaches and levels of stakeholder participation will be adapted to the category of stakeholders through the proposed consultative activities.

LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES: These refer to the ambiguity and variability of the legal framework, including the emergence of new laws or various specific regulatory procedures. In this case, support will be requested, if necessary, from the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of the Environment and the Executive Unit for Financing Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation (the national coordinator of the Cities Mission).

By comparing the barriers, risks and opportunities with the Municipality's strategic goals in terms of climate-neutrality, the current Action Plan and its related interventions come as a strategic, directly targeted and tangible response to the main objectives established in 2030 SECAP and IUDS. The narrative starts from the intervention areas for which SECAP and IUDS propose concrete actions to reduce emissions until 2030: Buildings, Private and institutional environment, Transport, Mobility, Lighting, Local production of renewable energy, Public procurement, Urban planning and Collaboration with citizens.

Our approach starts by understanding and changing individual behaviors and subsequently, consolidating functional local systems (supplemented by establishing climate neutrality engines where they are absent) with the ultimate objective of fostering a collective mentality that fights for the common goal of reaching climate neutrality within the city. Cultivating this institutional and residential collective mentality will be reinforced through policy and planning mechanisms that will provide the necessary development framework, in addition to integrated, multi-sector infrastructure interventions, facilitated by the Net Zero City Coalition and local climate-neutrality champions. Our pathway will advance under the guidance of existing strategic documents, within our unified ambition to reach climate-neutrality, whereby the efforts of all stakeholders contribute to decreasing the urban CO2 footprint on the climate and to enhancing citizen's safety, health, and quality of life.

# A-3.3: DESCRIPTION OR VISUALISATION OF PARTICIPATORY MODEL FOR THE CITY CLIMATE NEUTRALITY - TEXTUAL AND VISUAL ELEMENTS

# LOCAL CONTEXT AND EXPERIENCE WITH COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES

In the last 10 years, especially since the emergence of clusters in the city's development landscape, the local ecosystem has strongly consolidated its collaboration, through various joint projects. Thus, this Action Plan is based on the hundreds of initiatives previously carried out at local level, both in terms of infrastructure projects and also as soft interventions. The background on which this document was created lies on the strategic documents already developed and implemented at the Municipality's level and its metropolitan area. Moreover, the Action Plan's foundation consists of the previous and current projects developed within the local ecosystem by the Municipality, local universities, clusters, private companies, NGOs and even citizens (through the previously organized participatory budgeting processes). At the moment, there are dozens of projects that are or have been implemented in partnership between local actors, which were carried out mainly by attracting non-reimbursable funds, including within the framework of numerous international

C

initiatives that were pursued under the umbrella of a large number of European funding programs, from Horizon Programme to COSME and from Interreg to Urban Innovative Action, etc. The principles that dictated the partnership projects during these 10 years included, in the first phase, the consolidation of collaboration between local factors, in the second phase, the sustainable development of the created partnerships and, currently, as the third phase, the acceleration of sustainable innovation within the local ecosystem. These principles represent, in fact, the interests on which the ambitions of local actors have focused during this decade. Starting with the accession of Cluj-Napoca to the mission of the 100 climate-neutral and smart cities in 2022, the Municipality managed to direct the local cooperative efforts towards the climate neutrality transition, not only in terms of the city's journey, but of all the pillars that, in fact, support the city: clusters, companies, universities and local NGOs.

## SUMMARY OF INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL MEASURES

Individual adaptation will be fostered through levers dedicated to behavioural changes. The aforementioned elements constitute a cohesive and sequential procedure: firstly, comprehending the existing collective perception regarding climate-neutral behaviors (via behavioral and perception analysis, modeling, and correlation with other pertinent research), followed by a transition towards a unified climate-neutral mentality based on scientific evidence. This process will be facilitated by the coordinated implementation of digital technology (Climate Neutrality Digital Twin), social innovation (civic imagination and innovation events), democratic participation (NZC participatory budgeting), urban-metropolitan transfer of good practices (caravan for metropolitan residents), local incentives, and education. To further reinforce interactions among citizens and between citizens and the public, NZC Champs will foster community engagement and steer it towards the common pathway to climate neutrality.

The adaptation of the local public administration will focus on those levers that will improve its ability to act and react in line with climate neutrality, hand in hand with the local community and ecosystem and at the same pace as its EU counterparts. In this regard, the initial step involves an analysis - an audit of climate neutrality expertise and capabilities (which will also be extended to other public and private entities within the ecosystem). The outcomes of this lever will form the foundation for the subsequent ones, including alternative governance (NZC Champs and new governance models for condominiums, supplementing and supporting public governance from a residential standpoint), the NZC local coalition for change (which will rely on collaboration within a well-coordinated framework with the local ecosystem), engagement with the local financial market (to provide financial backing for climate-neutral local plans and initiatives), knowledge transfer (a collaborative endeavor to adopt best practices from other European cities), and RD capitalization (integration of research findings into urban policy and planning principles/tools).

## NET ZERO COALITION PARTICIPATORY MODEL

The entire Action Plan will be implemented through a local Net Zero Coalition, having as members representatives from the climate stakeholder ecosystem, namely representatives of each identified stakeholder. The Net Zero Coalition will act as a strategic local task force, comprising key ecosystems actors and will function as an action group dedicated to co-designing,
PRINÁRIA D'EDUCACIÓN LOCAL CLUJ NAPOCA
CLU JUNIOR UNIVERSITY OF VETERINARY ENGINEERING
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
C

co-producing and co-monitoring local climate-neutrality solutions. It will use a collaborative-leadership governance model, where all the partners within the Net Zero Coalition will participate in the decision-making and implementation of the actions and all named/yet unnamed stakeholders will be consulted, according to their particular value-added and expertise.

The Net Zero Coalition will be coordinated under the umbrella of CIIC – Civic Imagination and Innovation Center, the main participatory governance tool of Cluj Municipality.

The Net Zero Coalition will act within the framework of an official declaration/pact between the local and metropolitan public institutions, private sector, NGOs, professional association representatives and NZC Champs, with the goal of cooperating in order to accelerate and facilitate the deployment of the proposed climate-neutrality actions. Thus, the Net Zero Coalition's diversity of participants will be ensured through a quadruple helix framework, which activates 4 sub-systems to enhance knowledge production and innovation: governments, higher education, civil society, economy. Given that the climate transition will cut across various sectors (residential built sector, transport, health, education, urban planning, energy, economy, green spaces, etc) the Net Zero Coalition includes partners with extensive experience in social sciences, climate action, architecture, renewable energy, transport, citizen engagement, business, metropolitan development, capacity building, digital innovation. Engaging the efforts of all these categories of stakeholders in a common vision (and, in particular, in a common commitment to implementation and monitoring) is crucial for ensuring the cross-sectoral approach, which is a priority for the Net Zero Coalition. The pact will include the governing methodology and the monitoring framework needed in order to evaluate the Coalition's activities.

The Net Zero Coalition's governance model will build on multi-system horizontal collaboration, as well as vertical coordination with regional and national governance structures (e.g., RDA, Ministry of Investments and European Projects), through efficient and multi-sectoral cooperation, under the coordination of the public administration. The cross-organizational coalition's internal functioning will be directed by the principles of accountability (each person involved will be responsible for their own actions by directly acquiring their role), transparency (all the necessary information and tools will be available to all partners on a common platform), and diversity of participants (as seen from the stakeholder list).

# TARGETED INTERVENTIONS TO ENHANCE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN THE TRANSITION TO CLIMATE NEUTRALITY

The shift towards climate neutrality directly involves citizens, both in terms of its impact and individual actions. Citizen engagement in our measures is crucial, especially when considering that individual behaviors were identified as one of the principal obstacles in our climate neutrality pathway. As a result, residents are the city's starting point for systemic change and the focal point of our Action Plan. The proposed measures will start with understanding their behaviors and perceptions through research on individual adaptation. Based on the outcomes, civic imagination and innovation modeling will be established (where citizens, particularly homeowners' associations, will express their viewpoint), tools for enhancing individual adaptation capacity will be developed (e.g., free-of-charge resident training), and the profile of NZC Champs will be created to serve as trusted partners for citizens. The principal targeted interventions for boosting citizen participation in

C

behavior change and decision-making are enumerated below.

Civic imagination and Innovation Center - CIIC modelling for climate-neutrality will be organized at neighbourhood level, in the aim of bringing the NZC local coalition as close as possible to citizens and their real needs, through a user-centric and place-based approach. Civic imagination and Innovation modelling events will build on the successful experience of Cluj-Napoca to become the first Municipality in Romania to implement the participatory budgeting and to establish a Civic Imagination and Innovation Center (CIIC), both managed directly by the staff of the Municipality, which is currently very limited. Specifically, the CIIC concept will be upgraded by taking into account the Net Zero Coalition model, with the support of external expertise contracted by the Municipality, such as to focus more on climate-neutrality. The events will be designed to bring together international and local experts that have the opportunity to interact directly with citizens, businesses an NGOs from a certain neighborhood on given climate neutral-related topics. Also, specific civic imagination and innovation event concepts will be prepared and tested for new target groups, such as children, students and elderly.

Regarding participatory budgeting, which is currently only applied at the city level on a few specific subjects, a new concept for participatory budgeting at the neighborhood level on climate neutrality related topics will be created and piloted, with external expertise subcontracted by the Municipality, in an attempt to achieve more place-based interventions. Since we plan to develop and test participatory budgeting at the neighborhood level on climate neutrality related topics, we are interested in gaining knowledge from more experienced European cities on how to enhance ownership and democracy in this regard. We would appreciate the NZC expert team's assistance in connecting Cluj-Napoca with such cities, for instance Vienna, to learn from them. Therefore, the Cluj-Napoca Municipality specifically expresses its intention to adopt western models of best practices for creating the participatory budgeting process and is receptive to any form of assistance in this matter.

A central element in connecting all the systems is represented by the Climate Neutrality Digital Twin: besides technological functions, this virtual tool will also have social modules: it will facilitate the integration of social aspects/data in the developed solutions, it will allow citizens to see simulations of the proposed infrastructure/policy actions (in order to ensure residents' understanding of repercussions and benefits before facing them), it will facilitate awareness and education and will allow monitoring of solutions (so that citizens can see the real and accurate impact of the pursued actions).

The Model for improving condominium governance will streamline the way in which residential blocks are managed (currently a deficient, problematic management) and the new local public policy tools will accelerate the individual adoption of climate neutral practices. Within the improved condominium governance model, homeowners associations will play a stronger role and proactive citizens investing in thermal rehabilitation will benefit from reduced costs and faster implementation of energy renovation works. This measure will build on the existing investments of individual owners into energy efficiency of their building, identifying bottlenecks, engaging citizens in the reform process and promoting improved quality in the delivery.

Citizens, particularly those residing in high-density multi-apartment neighbourhoods, will also benefit from the urban planning toolkit and local public policy tools, which will provide numerous advantages in terms of energy costs and quality of life, including improvements in physical health and mental well-being.

Moreover, in order to enhance the contribution and adaptation of residents to climate-neutrality, the Municipality will focus on creating communities that are willing to get involved and assume their participation in the construction, implementation and monitoring of participatory public policies related to climate neutrality. In order to achieve this, the community must find a comfortable and friendly environment that generates confidence in the fact that its voice is listened to and the debate is the vehicle through which it can convey the needs to the local administration. In this broader context, this action will be pursued by organizing meetings in informal neighbourhood spaces with a temporary character located on the public domain (parks, markets etc.), with a minimal setup and equipping, under the concept of Net Zero City Caravan.

The NZC Caravans will ensure that every citizen is included in the journey towards climate neutrality, while participatory budgeting will strengthen democracy, decision-making, and active citizen participation in shaping the city's future. To act as citizens' trusted partners, the NZC Champs will be selected through an online neutrality champion competition, using competitive tools to identify entities such as private companies, NGOs, and institutions that will implement climate-neutrality actions at the neighbourhood level, producing measurable and potentially replicable outcomes. As a result, citizen involvement will be widespread, transparent, and accessible, with a focus on social inclusion and equal opportunities.

Once residents are involved in the NZC Caravan, they will have the opportunity to volunteer for teaching and educational workshops on various topics related to climate neutrality, such as energy savings, food waste prevention, waste recycling, and becoming a prosumer. The Caravans will use temporary Ground Level Actions as tools to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and engagement through Placemaking. The Caravan will serve as a vehicle to connect all neighbourhood centres into a single network, translate good practices, and unify messages. It will also serve as a place for community formation and spending free time. Through social facilitation actions, the community will be invited to form debate centres around the climate neutrality theme. Educational activities consisting of two levels, educational workshops and community debates, will be held at these community contact points for all ages. The Caravan will eventually become a Memory Place. The goal is to empower citizens and the supporting ecosystem to become active facilitators of the city's climate neutrality.

In addition, the community building process will directly inform and accelerate the process of establishing energy communities (currently, there is only one energy cooperative active in Romania and the EY Solar Energy Strategy has the target of setting up at least one renewables-based energy community in every Municipality with a population over 10,000 by 2025). Considering that awareness on the process and benefits of establishing energy communities, as well as the technical and regulatory context are one of the main reasons for the small number of such arrangements in the EU, the community events organised as part of the NZC Caravan will provide

the opportunity to directly engage citizens in establishing community-owned energy generation facilities and identify the required course of action.

# PARTNERSHIPS AS A LEVER FOR MOBILISING PRIVATE FUNDING AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER

The partnerships within the local climate-neutrality ecosystem will be also consolidated by involving potential entities that could finance part of the actions (North-West Regional Development Agency - manages the NW ROP, the Ministry of Investments and European Projects, private companies that can finance pilot actions through CSR/PPPs, citizens that can organise crowd-funding, commercial banks that can offer loans for green projects, even representatives from EBRD, EIB &amp; VC/BA funds), capacity building actions for financial sustainability. Key measures for meeting the funding gap and mobilizing private resources include:

Encourage and promote access to ROP funding. The involvement of the private sector is essential for achieving climate neutrality, and leveraging the close relationship between Cluj-Napoca Municipality and the NW Regional Development Agency is key to encouraging private companies to access as many funds as possible from the Regional Operational Program. The Regional Operational Program managed by the Regional Development Agency provides a significant opportunity for private companies to invest in energy efficiency, circular economy, renewable energy, and other sustainability initiatives. By encouraging dialogue with private companies and promoting the availability of these funds, we can create new opportunities for private companies to invest in sustainability and help us achieve our climate neutrality goals.
Promote sustainability measures via clusters. Another way we can engage the private sector is by leveraging our close relationship with clusters in the Municipality, particularly the IT and Energy Clusters. These clusters represent some of the most innovative and forward-thinking companies in our region, and we believe they can play a key role in promoting energy efficiency measures and innovative practices in sustainability to their members. By working with these clusters, we can help ensure that private companies have access to the latest information and best practices related to sustainability.
Empower homeowners' associations. The increased role that homeowners' associations will play in the new condominium governance structure will encourage the mobilization of private funding from individual owners. Energy renovation projects will also be implemented more quickly and at lower cost, while promoting greater quality and CO2 reductions.
Scale-up CSR program of adopting green spaces. Another important area where private companies can be more involved is in the extension and maintenance of green spaces, by adopting certain areas as part of their corporate social responsibility actions. We would like to promote the green space adoption program at a larger scale, based on the successful experience so far (with smaller surfaces such as squares and roundabouts). By supporting the development of green spaces, private companies can help reduce carbon emissions and also contribute financially to the pathway to climate neutrality.
Promote incentive schemes and application of nZEB concept. We are committed to developing existing initiatives in the real estate construction sector (such as the regulation on heating facilities) and promote building owners to apply for incentive schemes, such as the 50% tax reduction for buildings with green certificates. Real estate development companies can play a crucial role in this effort by adopting sustainable practices and technologies in their buildings,

in line with the nZEB principles.

Extend partnerships and build capacity. Build on existing partnership with the Transylvania Commercial Bank (an existing loan was already contracted) and explore further possibilities for financing the green transition, as well as the development of public-private partnerships by addressing current barriers identified above.

The partnerships that Cluj-Napoca already has in place, at the national, EU, and global level, along with additional connections that will be established in the coming years, will ensure a wider impact of the undertaken actions, through scalability and replicability efforts. The core tool envisaged for mass transferability will be a dedicated digital platform – an interactive website managed by the local climate neutrality ecosystem, which will encompass all the actions' progress together with lessons learned, and knowledge exchange activities with other similar urban areas. Overall, the transferability and/or replication of the proposed actions across other EU cities and functional urban areas will be based on: (1) existing partnerships, such as those with the Romanian Ministry of Research, Development and Digitalization, DG Regio, and the World Bank, (2) EU-funded exchanges (through TAIEX, Net Zero City's City Learning Programme, Interreg, etc), (3) the development of a strong knowledge transfer mechanism within the coalition's members and (4) the coalition partners' dissemination channels and transfer mechanisms (Social Media, networks, events, etc.). All these opportunities will be fully used to disseminate the results and help entities that are interested with all the tools and ideas emerged from implementing the Action Plan.

# INNOVATION, LEARNING AND CAPACITY BUILDING

Cluj-Napoca uses collaborative local development as an innovation driver, based on all the local flagship projects resulting from co-participatory processes and pursued by the local innovation ecosystem. Our stakeholders will not be spare parts of change, but the engine of change and this is why the NZC local coalition is structured to embrace the cooperative efforts within the quadruple helix, as a key enabler for systemic, innovative transformation. During the Action Plan's implementation period, local stakeholders (mainly those identified in the stakeholder list, plus other proactive and interested local actors and new local actors who are not yet constituted at the moment - their engagement will be promoted publicly, intensively and transparently) will be directly involved in the civic imagination &amp; innovation sessions through the NZC local coalition, because they are the ones who catalyse the proposed change, bringing real, place-based inputs to the climate neutrality table. Moreover, through co-participatory approaches, the stakeholders will be involved in sense-making and cross-fertilization sessions during each stage of development of the proposed actions: co-design, co-implementation and co-monitoring.

The enhancement of the local ecosystem's capacity to implement and monitor climate neutral actions will be achieved through specific actions focused on the Net Zero Coalition (ecosystem representatives and building administrators) as follows:

Selecting local and/or nearby ecosystem good practice examples and promoting them as successful climate neutrality stories;
Know-how and skills upgrading package for ecosystem representatives, Municipality and private sector stakeholders and staff to facilitate day by day and medium to long term climate

neutrality measures implementation;

Interactive interface / framework to enhance building administrators' knowledge about the measures / actions that could facilitate achieving climate neutrality;
Training, knowledge dissemination and good practice promoting events held for targeted groups of ecosystem representative and building administrators;
Identifying local NZC Champs, as trusted partners that could act as liaison between Municipality, ecosystem representatives and residents. Persons willing to encourage, promote and monitor carbon neutrality achievement within the neighbourhood;
Study Visits and Experience exchange sessions for NZC Coalition and Champs;
Guidance for the NZC Coalition members and NZC Champs, in monitoring the impact of applied and implemented actions;

The core element of implementing the proposed actions involves the application of a "learning by doing" approach. Firstly, the proposed actions are based on the experiences gained through previous efforts to reduce the city's carbon footprint, including research conducted by local universities, international projects involving clusters and NGOs, and interventions by the Municipality, such as infrastructural investments and integrated programs like Walkable City. Learning by doing will also be used in implementing the proposed actions in this plan by considering two perspectives. Firstly, the proposed solutions will be co-designed, co-tested, and co-redesigned in conjunction with the local ecosystem to ensure the results obtained are most suitable for the local context. Secondly, the entire system will undergo a designing, testing, and redesigning process over the next eight years to adapt Cluj-Napoca's climate-neutrality journey to the constant changes that any city faces, including both internal dynamics and external factors. As a result, the course of the proposed actions will occur experimentally and iteratively, with all stakeholders and potential catalysts participating. Through interactive and participatory approaches, citizens and the ecosystem will understand the actions' benefits on their overall welfare and well-being.

Moreover, the coalition's governance model is designed to enhance feedback and iterative learning learning processes, by using a bi-dimensional approach:

INTERNAL DIMENSION – within the Net Zero Coalition. The implementation of the Action Plan will advance by collecting, organizing and sharing information, to achieve a common understanding and ensure ongoing cross-fertilization across the coalition. This pursuit will be performed as part of the sensemaking process, following an iterative model. The development and implementation of the proposed actions will undergo the three phases of iterative learning processes (plan, test, iterate) to generate the most suitable approaches.
EXTERNAL DIMENSION – among the stakeholders. The Net Zero Coalition will pursue a permanent learning process by auditing the local ecosystem's behaviour, perceptions, capacities and capabilities and will further build appropriate learning tools), starting from real, place-and-research-based evidence, by tackling 4 main phases: analysing &amp; modelling citizen's and ecosystem actors' behavior, perceptions, knowledge -&gt; starting the learning process -&gt; implementing the learning process -&gt; learning capitalization know-how transfer.

Overall, the learning mechanism will consider the following aspects:

Working in an experimental, interactive way: plan, test, iterate;
Accelerating learning by extracting rapid learnings to inform the actions;
Engagement of all actors within the proposed actions, and by creating the suitable frameworks for the Net Zero Coalition and the NZC Champs;
Capitalizing on previous experience in developing feedback and iterative learning processes (the previous initiatives of the Municipality - e.g., the Center for Innovation and Civic Imagination and the previous projects of the partners - e.g., REFLOW).

The Net Zero coalition aims to deepen and systematize the understanding of the factors affecting the emergence and effectiveness of climate neutral practices in the local ecosystem and aspires to provide a more concrete conception of what a collective climate-neutral mentality should look like, as well as how this can be effectively achieved. The coalition's work will build upon a KNOW - DO - UNDERSTAND model and will seek to create competencies (Attitudes, Skills, Knowledge) among involved stakeholders. Thus, we will include awareness-raising and data-driven trainings and workshops, applied tasks to model the reduction of emissions through implementing the proposed actions, and finally we will assess the attitude and value change towards a climate-neutral future. This "applied research approach" will provide a clear, measurable definition of a climate-neutral urban ecosystem, as well as the levers required to achieve it. Lessons learned and good practices from each intervention will be shared with all stakeholders via the Net Zero Coalition's channels.

# REFLEXIVE GOVERNANCE AND SYSTEMS THINKING AT THE LEVEL OF THE NET ZERO COALITION

To accelerate the shift towards climate neutrality in Cluj-Napoca and its metropolitan area, a reflexive governance approach will be implemented. This approach acknowledges that climate neutrality challenges are multifaceted and long-term, and as such, the Net Zero Coalition will consider the interconnectedness, complexity, and scale of a variety of climate-related concerns to determine the best course of action. The adoption of this approach recognizes that reducing greenhouse gas emissions requires a collaborative effort from all sectors of society, and that it is no longer sufficient for city administrations to analyze, plan, and implement a ready-made solution to achieve Net Zero Coalition targets. In this Action Plan, the primary goal of adopting reflexive governance is to coordinate collective efforts to identify integrated solutions that can be implemented through the Net Zero Coalition.

To monitor the system, the City Energy Manager will adhere to the methodologies outlined in the Action Plan Guide and utilize its own evaluation and calculation technologies, including air quality sensors. Additional equipment will be utilized to closely monitor emissions in the area alongside a complex data acquisition process to better understand the impact of proposed actions. The Energy Manager will receive ongoing support from the environmental departments of Babes-Bolyai University and Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, which possess various digital monitoring tools and solutions, as well as a vast array of relevant studies in the field, which will be continued and

updated throughout the Action Plan's implementation. Furthermore, once the Climate Neutrality Digital Twin is established, more complex data analyses will be conducted in accordance with methodologies proposed by international entities managing the Covenant of Mayors, ICLEI, and NZC.

The entire approach of the Action Plan focuses on the systems thinking theory, such as to ensure the holistic interrelation of all the systems and of all their constituent parts, in the ultimate goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2030 through a systemic change that is based on the proper integration of the impact pathways, and not on unrelated independent interventions. Thus, the Plan's development started from the identification of the city systems that will be intervened upon. Then, the emissions generated by them were evaluated and the reduction targets were proposed, the barriers and opportunities were structured, and, finally, the necessary solutions and innovations were identified, together with the stakeholders who can contribute to their deployment. Therefore, Cluj-Napoca Municipality did not plan single-lever interventions, but combined them across systems and chose key ecosystem actors that can become delivery partners.

The Cluj-Napoca Municipality has aimed to tackle all urban systems that can contribute to climate-neutrality, which can be seen in both the proposed actions and the involved stakeholders. Our goal requires a concerted effort to implement the interventions across multiple city systems. The implementation and monitoring of the Action Plan will be guided by systems thinking, which served as the underlying philosophy behind our impact pathways. The actions proposed will operate within the systems and the relationships established between them, leading to the accomplishment of the set target through an ongoing and continuous process.

An essential component in this process will be the feedback, which will help us, on the one hand, to reinforce certain measures if we need to accelerate / expand them to reach our target and, on the other hand, to balance the implementation of certain interventions depending on external and internal conditions. The feedback will allow us to drive several aspects of improvement simultaneously, in order to tackle the gaps that we might discover that hinder the implementation of the Action Plan, during the annual CCC iteration phases.

The Climate City Contract will go through an annual review and update process, based on iteration sessions organized by the Net Zero City Coalition. Thus, based on the learning gained through the daily implementation of the Action Plan, the Municipality and its ecosystem will intervene with improvements in the content of the CCC-related documents. As we stated, we will use a model of reflexive governance, in which participation and deliberation across the Net Zero City Coalition will help us implement an intervention system based on common commitment, by taking into account the perspectives of all the actors involved. During the annual iteration sessions for CCC review, all the knowledge systems provided by the Net Zero City Coalition members will be activated, and the results of the consultations with them will be recorded in the updated version of the documentation. Citizens' involvement will play an important role in this regard. In this sense, through the CII events, the Caravan and the Champions, the residents' observations regarding Cluj-Napoca's Climate Neutrality journey will be collected (through interactive activities, supplemented by survey-type instruments), and the gathered information will be clustered and included in the updated version of the CCC. The whole process described above represents an innovative way of governance for the Municipality and its ecosystem, because, although until now various joint projects have been

implemented in partnership, previously we did not manage to implement the reflexive governance model as a full-time process, but rather as an intervention-based one. Thus, both the elaboration of the Action Plan and its implementation, respectively its update, will allow us to implement an innovative governance model, which will be reflected in the future iterations for the CCC review CCC.

# In more detail, the steps we will follow in terms of reflexive governance are the following:

Set ambitious but achievable goals: Through this Action Plan, we have set a clear and ambitious goal for achieving climate neutrality, but we tried to make sure that our target is achievable, given the local ecosystem's current knowledge, resources, and political will. Our aim is aligned with the broader local policy objectives and and, during the implementation phase, we will focus on transferring it also to the local community's aspiration.
Foster collaboration and engagement: Through our Coalition, we aim to foster collaboration and engagement among stakeholders, including the community. We have pursued the Coalition approach in order to ensure that diverse perspectives and knowledge are incorporated into the decision-making process.
Use evidence-based decision-making: During the implementation phase, we will strive to improve the use of evidence-based decision-making to guide our policy and practice. For this, we need to improve our process of collecting and analysing data on greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, and other key emission domains, in order to be able to properly evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented actions.
Monitor and evaluate progress: As already stated, we will regularly monitor and evaluate our progress towards achieving climate neutrality. In this regard, we will work better with our universities and with the Energy Manager, in order to be able to use indicators that are scientifically rigorous and aligned with our goals. The monitoring and evaluation results will be used to adapt our course of action as needed and to ensure accountability across the entire Coalition.
Adopt a flexible and adaptive approach: Since starting the elaboration of the current Action Plan, we have adopted a flexible and adaptive approach to decision-making and and we will maintain this approach during the implementation phase as well, recognizing that our climate journey is a complex and evolving challenge. We are open to learning from our own experiences and to making adjustments to our interventions, as new learning will emerge.
Build capacity and knowledge: We need to strengthen the capacity and knowledge among stakeholders, in order to be able to support this reflexive governance processes. This is why we want to invest in training and education actions for all the stakeholder categories. At the same time, being one of the largest university centres in Romania, we are permanently supporting research and innovation in climate-neutral technologies and practices.
Use innovative financing mechanisms: We will study innovative financing mechanisms, such as green bonds, carbon pricing, and public-private partnerships, because we understand the need to mobilize additional resources for climate neutrality. However, regardless of the funding mechanisms that we will unlock in order to achieve climate neutrality, we will ensure that the used financing mechanisms are not only aligned with our objectives, but that they are also transparent and accountable.

As mentioned above, the reflexive governance sessions will take place annually, in the first half of each calendar year, as re-iteration stages of the CCC. Overall, implementing this reflexive governance approach in our climate neutrality journey requires the Coalition's commitment to collaboration, evidence-based decision-making, and adaptive management – we are aware of the fact that we still have to work on all these aspects to improve them, but we are open to making substantial efforts in this regard, both as the Municipality and as the coordinator of the Net Zero City Coalition.

The quantified effects of the impact pathways emerge from the indicators proposed for their measurement and evaluation, which allow a clearer understanding of the generated systemic changes. Thus, the target values proposed in Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning, together with their related metadata sheets, will allow us to properly evaluate the progress of the implemented actions and to study the status of our journey towards climate neutrality. In this way, we will be able to keep track of the created impact and to succeed in holding the entire Net

Zero City Coalition accountable for co-implementing and co-monitoring the sets of interventions related to each urban system. This approach does not limit to the local level but spans over the entire metropolitan area, as it can be seen from the sections of this Action Plan.

We cannot provide numerical estimates for all the co-benefits included in Impact Pathways due to their typology, but below we present the quantification of the main co-benefits included in several Impact Pathways. Until 2030, the following quantitative indicators of the co-benefits generated by the implementation of this Action Plan are estimated:

Improved air quality: General Air Quality Index 20 (AQI)
Improved quality of life: 75% of the population
Lower energy costs for households: 75 euro per household per year saved, over 2022 baseline
Increased safety of public spaces: 22% decrease in the crime rate
Reduced local budget energy costs: 48 mil. euro
Reduced congestion: 50 h time reduction in rush hour per year (TomTom)
Reduced monthly transportation costs for households: 50 euro per household
Reduced flight to suburbs: 18% per year
Strengthen community cohesion and collaboration: 50 members in the Net Zero City Coalition
Better informed citizens: 40% of the population aware of climate neutrality

The Module B-3 table, Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning, provides a comprehensive breakdown of all the relevant actions for this plan. It describes the indicators and desired targets for each individual project.

This plan's actions are derived from the inventory of projects associated with the 2022-2030 Integrated Urban Development Strategy of the Cluj Metropolitan Area (IUDS CMA). These actions comprise both concrete and soft interventions specific to this plan. Also, the C-3.1 section, Summary of interventions with cost implication from this document and the investment plan, provides budgetary details for implementing these actions, while a summary of project timelines is available below:

# B-2.3: SUMMARY STRATEGY FOR RESIDUAL EMISSIONS

Total emissions that are not accounted for in this Action Plan: 217,466 tons CO2/year (18.63%)

The proposed interventions included in the Action Plan reflect the city's priority actions to achieving climate neutrality. In drafting the Action Plan, we decided to take a pragmatic approach in evaluating the implementation capacity of the Municipality, particularly for the interventions for which it is directly accountable. At the same time, we will strive to go beyond the proposed interventions in order to reduce the emissions that are not accounted for in this Action Plan by encouraging the involvement of the private sector and exploring the possibility to implement additional interventions included in other local plans or strategies.

The Net-Zero City Action Plan brings together all major interventions planned by the Municipality to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The activities and proposals described in this plan include priority projects from local strategies and were estimated to reduce CO2 emissions to a target of 81,37%. Offsetting measures are already included in the current Action Plan, as the proposed interventions include major carbon sink projects (rehabilitation and/or expansion of the existing parks, planting of 100,000 trees, metropolitan green belt), with an offsetting effect that was accounted for in the 81,37% target.

Considering that achieving climate-neutrality is a whole-society effort, private companies will be a close partner on the path to climate neutrality, both as sources of technological innovations, but also as agents of change - through implementing ESG and carbon neutrality strategies and encouraging the transition to a sustainable lifestyle for their clients and employees. The mobilisation of private resources is required for financing the interventions included in the Action Plan towards the 81,37% target, and the Net Zero Coalition will use this momentum to engage the private sector in completely neutralising GHG emissions, with a contribution of up to 15% of the emissions that are not accounted for in this Action Plan.

In this sense, it is worth noting that the Municipality has a close partnership with clusters in the city and is also a member of the Transylvania Energy Cluster (TREC), together with over 20 companies from the energy sector. For example, the cluster is implementing an innovative project to test the energy efficiency of photovoltaic panels and modern wind energy installations and is involved in preparing the development of the first research hub for hydrogen-based mobility in Romania,

together with a major local private company.

At the same time, other activities and proposals that are not included in this plan, but are proposed in the different strategies analysed may further contribute to the reduction in CO2 emissions. The total estimated CO2 reduction of these projects exceeds the 217,466 tons CO2/year residual emission value. Therefore, actions described in this Plan will be prioritised, and further proposals included in existing plans and strategies are expected to contribute towards the reduction of emissions that are not accounted for in this Action Plan estimated at 18,63%, by up to 5%. These possible additional measures are detailed below.

## Buildings - remaining emissions after implementation of proposed actions: 15,158 tons CO2/year

The Integrated Plan for Air Quality 2020-2024 recommends measures to improve energy efficiency of existing and upcoming public and private buildings, with regards to technology, construction materials, and municipal regulations, all with the intention of reducing emissions from the Buildings sector. The District Heating Strategy 2021-2030 takes further steps to decrease CO2 emissions from this sector. The solutions proposed in this strategy are geared towards increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, modernising existing heating infrastructure, and promoting the adoption of the nZEB principle in all new buildings. Other ideas put forth in the strategy centre around a greater utilisation of renewable energy sources, biomass, heat storage technology, heat pumps, cogeneration infrastructures, carbon capture and storage technologies, and energy islands. Moreover, the plan pays special attention to the soft interventions necessary for achieving behaviour change among citizens. Additional similar interventions are detailed in the Integrated Urban Development Strategy. The activities described in section A-1.3 for this sector are integrated into the plans mentioned above. Meanwhile, the other interventions that are not a part of this plan will reduce the emissions related to this sector that are not accounted for in this plan.

## Transport - remaining emissions after implementation of proposed actions: 44,183 tons CO2/year

The projects proposed for the "Do Minimum" Scenario of the Urban Mobility Plan for Cluj-Napoca 2021-2030 aim to promote velo mobility by developing new urban mobility corridors, modernise and decarbonize public transport, and promote the use of electric vehicles of varying sizes for private and commercial transportation. Moreover, initiatives in the same scenario attempt to reduce traffic inside the city limits by constructing new transportation infrastructure and by implementing new local public policies that encourage inhabitants to embrace a more climate-neutral lifestyle. Even though many of the actions outlined in this plan are already included in the Urban Mobility Plan, the remaining suggested projects for the "Do Minimum" scenario are more than sufficient to reduce the remaining emissions.

In addition to this, the Integrated Plan for Air Quality 2020-2024 and the Integrated Urban Development Strategy propose additional measures to improve the quality of public transport and encourage the use of public transport, to better manage private and commercial traffic, to develop large infrastructure projects, to impose traffic restrictions in certain areas, and to develop new velo infrastructure, which will ultimately contribute to an even greater reduction of CO2 emissions associated with transportation.

Waste - remaining emissions after implementation of proposed actions: 10,868 tons CO2/year

The Integrated Urban Development Strategy for Cluj-Napoca proposes targeted measures to decrease CO2 emissions from the waste sector that will directly impact the local community. Projects such as the completion of the region's integrated waste management system, increased selective waste collection capability, and improved understanding of the waste hierarchy among citizens are all essential components of this plan. Furthermore, the Digital Transformation Strategy sets out strategies to grant citizens easier access to real-time information about public services, including waste management, and technologies that will enhance waste collection, personal accountability, and overall waste management efficiency. These measures are likely to further reduce emissions stemming from this sector.

IPPU - remaining emissions after estimated 2030 energy requirements conversion: 145,089 tons CO2/year

Interventions regarding the IPPU sector were not included in this plan. However, measures to promote a climate neutral behaviour and early access to education and technology, will boost the local innovation capacity, which, in turn, will have a positive influence on the culture, heritage, creative, and manufacturing industries. This will lead to decreased CO2 emissions associated with the industrial processes and product use sector. The Integrated Urban Development Strategy of Cluj-Napoca proposes concrete solutions and interventions for sustainable economic growth that are expected to contribute to CO2 reduction in this sector.

The Integrated Urban Development Strategy sets forth measures to promote economic efficiency of local markets and sustainable production of local goods, enhance land use, and emphasise sustainable development and conservation of green spaces. Similar measures can be found in the Integrated Plan for Air Quality 2020-2024 and the Urban Mobility Plan for Cluj-Napoca 2021-2030, which if implemented will likely decrease remaining emissions even more.

C-1.2: DESCRIPTION OF ORGANISATION AND GOVERNANCE INTERVENTIONS – TEXTUAL AND VISUAL ELEMENTS

The proposed interventions focus on exploring opportunities and solutions that build innovative organisational and governance methods for the local ecosystem and capitalise on local opportunities. They were constructed based on the assessment of local systemic barriers, current policies, and strategic documents, and aimed at supporting the listed pathways towards climate neutrality by 2030. Overall, this part of the plan helps create favourable systemic conditions and provides a layer of understanding of the necessary financing.

Regarding the local specificities of climate policy development and implementation, Cluj-Napoca has taken significant steps towards climate-neutrality, naming (1) the Sustainable Energy &amp; Climate Action Plan (SECAP) by 2030 was elaborated, (2) the Integrated Urban Development Strategy 2021-2027 has multiple objectives correlated with the climate agenda, (3) the Local Heating Strategy 2031, SUMP 2027, and 2020-2024 Air Quality Plan Improvement Plan are documents designed to answer to multiple challenges, and also (4) implementing projects (pursued both by the Municipality and the local ecosystem), programs (eg Walkable City, Cluj-Napoca Urban Agglomerations Energy Efficiency Improvement Program), and public measures (e.g., restructuring contracts with private operators for brownfield redevelopment, fiscal incentives for residents that make their homes energy efficient) and private ones (e.g. CSR campaigns financed by business actors, encouraging, among others, green mobility/waste recycling) in line with climate neutrality objectives.

Organisational and Governance Innovation Interventions comprise interventions that are part of the following list of actions designed to enable the climate action portfolios and to achieve co-

benefits outlined in the impact pathway: Cluj NetZero Coalition (the mechanism enabling co-creation to improve framework conditions), Improved local urban regulations and policies for achieving climate neutrality (the interventions aimed at continuing and expanding policies that promote NZEB standards), and Communication, dissemination, and scalability (designed to make people take ownership of the overall objectives and change behaviours to tackle climate change). More specifically, for the organisational and governance part, the following interventions were established and validated with the local ecosystem:

Knowledge &amp; Competence audit of the local climate neutrality ecosystem. The intervention maps the local climate neutrality ecosystem and audits its competences (technical and social) relevant for the climate neutrality ambitions of the city.
Enhancing the capacity of the ecosystem to implement and monitor climate neutral policies at neighbourhood level. Specific actions focused on the ecosystem representatives and building administrators will be developed to increase their capacity, naming, promoting good practice, delivering know-how and skills upgrading packages, training, organising study visits and experience exchange sessions, and offering guidance in monitoring the impact of applied and implemented actions.
Defining a set of urban planning principles and documents for climate neutral interventions, plus incentives for their implementation. These include various interventions such as developing urban planning principles, updating the General Spatial Planning of Cluj-Napoca according to the climate-neutrality vision, creating Zonal Urban Plans for climate-neutral neighborhoods, organizing international contests of solutions for urban renewal interventions, and offering incentives to encourage climate-friendly individual behaviors. The interventions aim to integrate energy-saving and energy-generating methods, nature-based solutions, sustainable mobility, smart city initiatives, and UHI mitigation to improve citizens' quality of life and prevent urban migration to suburban and peri-urban areas.
New governance models for condominiums and their integration into the local climate neutrality ecosystem - enabling environment. The model for improving condominium governance will streamline the way in which residential blocks are managed (currently a deficient, problematic management) and the new local public policy tools will accelerate the individual adoption of climate neutral practices. Another important part is identifying alternative governance models for condominiums existing in dense apartment-block neighbourhoods.
Digital platform - an interactive website managed by the local climate neutrality ecosystem. The involvement of citizens will be public, massive, transparent &amp; accessible &amp; will take into account social inclusion &amp; equal opportunities. The main communication platform will be an interactive website where all the relevant information will be published. (e.g., general information regarding the project, events, pilot activities etc.). Due to its content, the website can be used during different activities to present relevant information or tools. It also helps build inclusiveness, trust, and legitimacy to the necessary actions.

All of them aim at improving the horizontal governance of climate neutrality, the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-level governance for climate neutrality, and create ownership and strong commitment inside the community.

# INVOLVED STAKEHOLDERS

Multi-level governance is one of the main pillars of our Action Plan, which focuses on a co-participative approach within a quadruple helix framework. Consequently, the stakeholders were identified and engaged in the process of formulating all the interventions. Although all stakeholders are accountable for implementing these interventions, external professionals may be contracted for particular services if deemed necessary. The current list of stakeholders has been established based on the assessment conducted in the section dedicated to systemic barriers and opportunities:

Public sector: Cluj Metropolitan IDA, Romanian Green Building Council, Termoficare Napoca S.A. (Cluj-Napoca's Public Heating Company), CTP Cluj-Napoca S.A. (Cluj-Napoca's Public Transport Company), Compania de Apa Somes S.A. (Cluj-Napoca's Water Provider), Supercom S.A. (Cluj-Napoca's Waste Operator), North-West Regional Development Agency
Academia and research: Technical University of Cluj-Napoca (Faculties of Architecture, Transport, Energy), "Babes-Bolyai University (Faculties of Geography – the Research Center of Sustainable Development, Environment, Sociology), University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca, University of Art and Design, National Research and Development Institute for Isotopic and Molecular Technologies INCDTIM Cluj-Napoca, "Ernest Lupan" Institute for Circular Economy and Environmental Research
Non-governmental sector: Urbannect, Cluj Youth Federation (ro : Federatia Tinerilor din Cluj-Napoca), CCC- Cluj Cultural Center Botnar Foundation, Transilvania IT Cluster - DIH, Transylvania Energy Cluster.
Private sector (business): Servelect S.R.LAgroTransilvania Cluster, Romanian New Materials Cluster, Transylvania Commercial Bank (ro : Banca Transilvania).

# IMPROVED ORGANISATIONAL SETTINGS AND GOVERNANCE MODELS

The local public administration, together with the local community and ecosystem, focuses on acting and reacting in line with climate neutrality principles. In order to achieve this, the project focuses on the broader governance framework, encompassing multi-level governance through the Net Zero local Coalition. The coalition comprises various representatives from the climate stakeholder ecosystem, including those from the quadruple helix framework such as representatives from numerous NGOs, universities, and clusters representing hundreds of local and regional companies. An essential role will be played by the Ministry of Investments and European Projects (MIEP) with which efforts will be made to consolidate an active and permanent dialogue to secure the necessary funds to implement the actions proposed in the plan. In this sense, representatives of MIEP will be constantly invited to coalition meetings. In addition, the local climate-neutrality ecosystem will establish partnerships with potential entities that can provide funding for our actions, such as the North-West Regional Development Agency, private companies interested in financing pilot actions through CSR/PPPs, citizens who can organize crowdfunding, commercial banks that can offer loans for green projects, and even representatives from EBRD, EIB, and VC/BA funds if they accept the invitations to events. Capacity building actions will also be undertaken to ensure financial sustainability. The NZ Coalition will also prioritize (1) enhancing dialogue with national public authorities and engaging them in local climate-neutrality efforts, and (2) disseminating materials such as guides, analyses, studies, and relevant reports to public staff in

ministries to replicate successful practices and outcomes at the national level.

The NZ Coalition acts as a strategic local task force to implement the action plan, with all actors participating in co-designing, co-producing, and co-monitoring local climate-neutrality solutions. To ensure effective collaboration, partners will be involved in decision-making and implementation, and stakeholders consulted based on their expertise. The proposed measures to empower governance include forming the NZ Coalition, assessing and improving local capacity, adding alternative structures, approaching the financial market, transferring knowledge, capitalizing on research, and providing learning tools for funding.

Thus, the entity with primary responsibilities for climate mitigation policies and cross-sectoral coordination of the climate agenda and the working modality is the NZC Coalition, which is coordinated by the local authority. The main person responsible from the local administration is Dalila Ciuclan as coordinator together with the internal team from various departments (Strategy, Local, Development and Project Management Department, Public Procurement Service, Urban Strategies Office, Investment Department, Urban Energy Manager, and Energy Efficiency Office). The most important department within the Municipality, with a central role in the implementation and monitoring of the action plan, is the Office for Energy Efficiency and Public Lighting. Its role is to monitor the energy consumption for public buildings, to formulate strategies for energy savings and the promotion of RES generation, to improve the energy efficiency, quality and coverage of the public lighting system, to ensure its maintenance, to ensure the local framework for the implementation of the nZEB standard, to integrate the sustainable development targets in public procurement. Moreover, an important role is played by the Energy Manager who is outsourced to Servelect SRL, a company with over 16 years of experience, that offers integrated services and solutions to optimize energy consumption and reduce operational costs. The Energy Manager is responsible for coordinating all aspects of energy management, from reducing carbon dioxide emissions to waste management and sustainable development. Among its main attributions are:

Development, coordination and implementation of strategies and policies to reduce local energy consumption
Encouraging the use of sustainable energy resources within organisations and the community, along with improving the local energy conservation profile
Developing solutions for carbon management
Providing technical assistance and organising training sessions on energy efficiency
Energy auditing and energy monitoring, including on-site inspections and energy studies

# SUMMARY OF EXISTING CLIMATE ACTION GOVERNANCE AND THE GAPS THAT NEED TO BE FULFILLED

Cluj-Napoca adopts co-participatory processes for local development to drive innovation and systemic transformation, recognizing that stakeholders play a crucial role in initiating change. However, despite our reputation as one of the best-performing public administrations in Romania, there remains a gap between the public administration and citizens, as well as between the urban and peri-urban environment, resulting in a lack of effective communication among these actors and territorial levels. To address these challenges, we need to collect data on the average level of knowledge and competence of citizens and the local ecosystem regarding the concept of climate neutrality. Regulatory barriers, such as poor regulation and standardization at the central level and unclear micro-mobility legislation, also impede our efforts to encourage climate neutrality through planning instruments and local policies.

# C-2.2: DESCRIPTION OF SOCIAL INNOVATION INTERVENTIONS - TEXTUAL AND VISUAL ELEMENTS

Cluj-Napoca enjoys a culture of collaborative partnership, where the public administration consults its citizens regarding the major local interventions and gives them the opportunity to choose which projects to be implemented locally (both through the participatory budgeting processes and through voting, surveys and meetings), such as to give them the power to be the enablers of the city's sustainable development. Given the positive background that these practices created, the Municipality's collaboration with its community has developed harmoniously in recent years, being defined by participation and inclusiveness, so that citizens put their trust in the public authority, which, in turn, is in permanent and close contact to the residents whose interests it represents. All these principles will be taken into account while implementing the Action Plan for climate neutrality, both by consulting the citizens regarding the major investments and proposed programs, and especially by strengthening the role they play as facilitators / proactive actors who contribute positively in the city's net zero journey.

In Cluj-Napoca, various initiatives focused on social and ecological innovation have already been successfully carried out. With the introduction of climate neutrality targets and components in the current Action Plan, we expect the local efforts to become even more ambitious. While there has been no explicit political endorsement of climate neutrality in recent years, the local ecosystem has recognized that sustainable development needs inclusive and fair partnerships, as well as considering the impact on the community, environment, and climate.

# PAST PROJECTS

ENTREPRENEURIAL: The projects implemented by the local clusters through National Operational Programs, such as OP Competitiveness, OP Administrative Capacity and OP Human Capital (e.g., Learn2Do, Smart Romania)
SOCIAL ECONOMY: The ASIST project - Social Entrepreneurship and Social Enterprises in Transylvania. As a result of the project, 21 social enterprises were established by granting subsidies in the amount of up to 55,000 EUR.
SOCIAL AWARENESS AND MOBILIZATION: Annually, local NGOs run dozens of community campaigns on various topics, with a focus on the awareness-education-mobilization cycle, such as the extensive Somes Delivery metropolitan campaign, dedicated to the valorisation of the Somes river green-blue corridor.
SOCIAL COHESION AND SOLIDARITY: Most such projects were implemented under the umbrella of the Intercommunity Development Association of the Cluj Metropolitan Area, their focus being on information, education, integration and social inclusion of disadvantaged communities.

eXperiment Fund and Transilvania Digital Innovation Hub stand out.

SOCIAL ECONOMY: BBU, the best performing national university, has a master's program for Social Work and Social Economy, where students are trained in all aspects related to social enterprises.
SOCIAL AWARENESS AND MOBILIZATION: The Cluj Cultural Center, as well as the Innovation and Civic Imagination Center and the Cluj Youth Federation (together with dozens of other local NGOs) are active supporters of the community's involvement in urban development, which is why they run numerous social awareness and mobilization initiatives.
SOCIAL COHESION AND SOLIDARITY: The Intercommunity Development Association of the Cluj Metropolitan Area currently has 4 such projects under implementation: Pata 2.0, Cluj Future of Work, Eudigit, Stardust, to which are added other such initiatives of the other NGO sector actors.

The future projects will be more clearly and more specifically directed towards climate-neutrality, because, on the one hand, they will have as a clear strategic development framework the IUDS, SECAP and this Action Plan, and, on the other hand, numerous non-reimbursable funds will be allocated for this priority. Thus, future social and ecosystemic projects will furtherly build on the foundation already consolidated in the previously implemented projects, also through scaling and upgrading the results obtained within past and present actions.

The Plan foresees a series of actions in which all stakeholders are both catalysts of the proposed change and direct beneficiaries of it, not only mere receptacles of top-down actions. To them is added the entire urban and metropolitan community, where the entire population will be at least an indirect beneficiary (although the positive climate impact generated by all the proposed actions brings direct effects and co-benefits for all residents, we consider as indirect beneficiaries those residents who will enjoy the overall obtained benefits, but who will not take active part in the actions detailed below). The following areas will be considered when collaborating with citizens, in order not to isolate the climate-neutrality pathways from their well-being and welfare, and to meaningfully engage them in the climate-neutrality journey.

EMPOWERMENT AND INCLUSION: The Action Plan is designed around citizens as major influencing factors on the city's journey to climate neutrality, not just as beneficiaries of the positive effects obtained through the completion of this journey. Since the ambitions must be appropriated and owned by all the stakeholders involved and the citizens are a major part of these stakeholders, the Plan includes Actions that directly aim their active involvement in the entire proposed course of action, not only at the level of awareness and engagement, but especially centred around enhancing their sense of belonging to these common efforts.

REGULATION AND SUPPORT: In order to further involve citizens through community-led projects, we, as public administration, aim to leverage our leading position and implement a series of policy and regulation actions to support the achievement of climate-neutrality objectives. The proposed actions seek to foster additional climate neutrality projects that may

arise within the community and ecosystem through social innovation, in addition to those already outlined in our Action Plan.

Defining a set of urban planning principles and documents for climate neutral interventions, plus incentives for their implementation
New governance models for condominiums and their integration into the local climate neutrality ecosystem

BOTTOM-UP INITIATIVES/PROJECTS: In order to better support bottom-up initiatives (in addition to the top-down ones already included in the Action Plan) that will release the locals' creativity in solving climate-neutrality issues, the identification and assignation of NZC Champs will be tested. Champs will be responsible to create the local conditions for stimulating community initiatives, including the ones arising at neighborhood level. Moreover, the digital platform will have functionalities and modules through which citizens can actively involve in achieving the desired climate neutrality goals.

SKILLS AND CAPACITY BUILDING: The Action Plan bases its success especially on the direct involvement of citizens and ecosystem actors in its implementation. However, given that stakeholders need solid knowledge bases in order to be able to intervene correctly and pragmatically, there is a need to strengthen their capacity. After assessing their skills and knowledge, numerous skills and capacity building interventions will be organized, on multiple levels, through formal and informal training sessions for both the citizens and the other local actors, which will allow them to better co-design and co-implement, respectively co-monitor the Plan's actions, respectively to co-create and co-deliver new solutions (in addition to the ones already proposed).

CHANGE IN SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR: Individual and collective behaviors have been identified as one of the main barriers to achieving the local objective of climate neutrality, which is why many efforts will be allocated to solving this obstacle. Thus, all the actions proposed for citizens and the ecosystem will start from behavioral and capacity analyses (in order to propose measures based on how individuals actually behave in their daily life), and the actions will be outlined according to the results of these analyses/audits. A useful tool in this sense, as technological support, will be the Climate Neutrality Digital Twin. The proposed measures will allow the Net Zero Coalition to better define the individual problems, to diagnose the actionable bottlenecks

*** Although some of the above-mentioned interventions (Knowledge &amp; Competence audit of the local climate neutrality ecosystem, NZC Champs Campaign, Skills upgrading package for ecosystem representatives, building administrators, New governance models for condominiums and their integration into the local climate neutrality ecosystem, Digital platform ) are considered Governance interventions, they deserved to be mentioned in this section as well, because, although they create an optimum governance framework that enables climate-neutrality, at the same time they also contribute to catalysing social innovation, by creating the appropriate environment for community-based projects / initiatives.

The core idea of the action plan centers around a co-participatory approach that fosters collective change by directing individual behaviors towards the shared goal of achieving climate-neutrality for the city. In order to achieve this goal, a wide range of events and collaborative activities will be organized within the local ecosystem and community, utilizing a multi-actor approach that leverages an integrated place-based methodology to achieve more efficient results. Through this approach, well-informed solutions will emerge, based on deliberative and engaging processes such as the caravans, civic innovation and modeling events. Urban planning will also take into account the opinions of citizens, involving them in the design of proposed regulations through public consultations, surveys, and other means of engagement. The public administration will be responsive to citizen proposals, and provide follow-up through both online and offline channels, including easy-to-understand summary reports that inform citizens of the outcomes of their feedback.

In order to successfully complete the actions, the resources that will be used include:

The necessary funds (covered through a mix of funds from the local budget, supplemented by non-reimbursable funds from the National Operational Programs, NRRP, European funds and contributions from the partners involved in the project)
The personnel involved (the complementarity of the expertise provided for the implementation of the actions by the stakeholders' representatives)
Individual time for collective efforts (this includes the hours allocated for the actions' preparation and implementation, especially under the umbrella of the Net Zero Coalition)
Civic ambition, motivation and interest (considered as resources because they are an essential regarding the citizens who will be involved in social and ecosystem innovation interventions)
Workspaces and material resources (all the spaces where various interventions will be organized, such as the Net Zero Caravan, along with the equipment, materials and consumables needed in the activities such as Civic imagination &amp; Innovation modelling events).

The implementation of all the proposed social and other innovation interventions will contribute to the aim of creating a collective mindset focused on climate neutrality. This mindset will positively influence the individual behaviors of citizens and economic/public agents, leading, through

individual practices, to the overall reduction of Cluj-Napoca's carbon footprint on the climate and, implicitly, to the improvement of health standards and quality of life in the city. Also, the public administration wants to use these forms of civic participation, in order to improve the individuals' adaptive capacity over the systemic changes that will inevitably occur during the climate-neutrality journey, along with increasing their acceptance of the transition initiatives.

This category of innovation interventions will generate learning not only through the proposed training sessions, but especially through the actual work carried out for co-designing, co-implementing and co-monitoring the foreseen actions. In addition to substantiating and subsequently understanding the notions of climate neutrality, teamwork skills will be strengthened, newer, more efficient and more inclusive community and ecosystem engagement techniques will be discovered, a local collective ability of combining the social dimension with the economic and technical ones will be achieved and most importantly, all the stakeholders will develop feelings of belonging and trust, within this powerful coalition, which joins individual efforts for achieving a collective intelligence and creates value through collaboration.

In the city of Cluj-Napoca and its metropolitan area, marginalized communities receive special attention, so that they are properly included in the society. The most remarkable efforts are undertaken by the Cluj Metropolitan Area Intercommunity Development Association, which over time developed more projects aimed at improving the life quality of communities living in marginalized areas. Moreover, at the level of the Cluj-Napoca's Metropolitan Area, there is a detailed mapping of marginalized communities, which includes information about how they are affected by urban heat islands. Special measures have been developed to increase their resilience (for example, the resilience of marginalized communities living in flood zones and of those living in areas affected by UHIs) in the face of climate change and to address the needs they face in these regards. There is also a detailed proposal for the transition to climate neutrality of the main social housing district in Cluj-Napoca. The climate neutrality digital twin tool will also embed a component dedicated to virtually transposing the locations of marginalized communities and the solutions developed for them.

In order for climate neutrality actions to reach the population of marginalized communities, measures will be taken to actively engage them in the activities and events organized for the community through the Center for Civic Imagination and Innovation. The discussions will be prepared to be easily understood by the participants, regardless of their education or professional status and will be accessible both from the point of view of participation and content, such as to allow their involvement in the climate neutrality talks. An important role in this regard will be held by the Net Zero City Champions, who will be responsible for attracting and engaging disadvantaged people in community interventions. The Champions will also have the duty to explain to people the concepts and information that have a high degree of technicality/specificity, so that they can understand such content. Since a significant share of the marginalized communities come from the metropolitan area's LAUs, the Caravan will include dedicated sessions for them: if we will see that people from the marginalized communities do not want / are unable to participate in the Caravan's sessions, dedicated events will be organized especially for them, so as to ensure their inclusion in the climate neutrality efforts. The same principle, of preparing dedicated sessions for talks and work, will also apply to the events under the umbrella of the Center for Civic Imagination and Innovation.

Cluj-Napoca Municipality will be primarily responsible for engaging marginalized communities in local climate neutrality efforts and the Cluj Metropolitan Area Intercommunity Development Association will deal with the disadvantaged population in the metropolitan area. Thus, the 2 entities will ensure that the voice of these communities' representatives will be heard when climate neutrality is discussed. In this sense, we will capitalize both on the human component - through the Champions - but also on the technical one - with the help of the digital twinning tool.

In order for all interventions having a social component to be equitable, inclusive and accessible to marginalized communities, we will apply a series of strategies to attract and engage them in the proposed community actions:

Outreach and advertising: Cluj-Napoca Municipality's communication department, together with the ZMC IDA's experts will apply targeted advertising and outreach strategies to reach marginalized communities (both from the urban and the peri-urban areas) and properly inform them about the events. We will apply advertising in local strategic places, we will partner with the communities' leaders and use social media to spread the word.
Location: We will choose event locations that are accessible and convenient for marginalized communities, especially public spaces that are easily accessible by public transportation.
Accommodations: We will ensure that the events will accommodate people with disabilities, including providing wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions where necessary.
Inclusivity: Our teams have the permanent duty to ensure that everyone feels welcome, regardless of their background or identity. Every material will be accessible and easy to understand and we will avoid using technical concepts and specialized information.
Engage with the community: When possible, we will discuss with members of marginalized communities in order to involve them in the planning and execution phases of community interventions. This will not only help us increase their participation, but will also ensure that our actions are tailored to their needs and interests.

The Net Zero Coalition, together with the NZC Champs will be responsible for sustaining this framework of power-sharing-and-allocation within which the community initiatives will operate, by providing, with massive support from the public administration, the needed assistance instruments to fit the community's needs. To ensure that the Net Zero Caravan and NZC Champs are effective in engaging all members of the community, it will be important to consider and address the specific needs of marginalised groups and communities. Energy poverty is an important issue that must be addressed, but it is also important to consider other barriers to engagement, such as language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of access to information or resources. To address these challenges, the Caravan and Champs will need to be adapted to the needs of different communities. This may involve different outreach strategies, communication methods, and approaches to community engagement. For example, in some communities, it may be more effective to partner with community organisations or leaders who have existing trust and relationships with marginalised groups. Additionally, educational activities and workshops will be designed to be accessible and inclusive to all ages and abilities. This may involve adapting activities and materials to different learning styles. Overall, the success of the Net Zero Caravan and NZC Champs will depend on their ability to engage and include all members of the community. By taking into account the unique needs and perspectives of marginalised groups, we can create a more equitable and sustainable future for all.

To ensure success in engaging the target audience and promoting climate neutrality, a strategic and data-driven approach will be taken towards the digital engagement strategy. We will develop specific campaigns and initiatives, as well as identify of key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure success. The digital engagement strategy will be continuously monitored and evaluated to ensure that it is meeting the goals and making optimal use of the allocated resources. Feedback will be gathered from the target audience through regular surveys or focus groups, and adjustments will be made as necessary based on the tracked KPIs.

The resources allocated to the digital engagement strategy include financial resources for personnel cost and other incurred costs, staff from the Municipality and the Coalition's members who will each name a responsible, and approximately 10 hours per month for the entire project duration until 2030. The necessary technology such as laptops, internet, smartphones, and cameras for photos will also be provided. The sufficiency of the resources will be assessed, and additional resources will be identified if necessary. Furthermore, complementary to the dedicated channels (especially the digital platform), all partners will use their communication channels to promote the climate neutrality actions. By collaborating and utilising the resources effectively, the digital engagement goals can be achieved, and climate neutrality can be promoted.

The table below delineates interventions for Organizational and Governance Innovation, as well as Social and Other Innovation, which are founded on the Blueprint for Net-Zero Apartment-block Neighborhoods project. This project has recently received funding through the NetZeroCities Pilot Cities Programme. The interventions will be implemented during a pilot phase, which spans over 2 years, and will subsequently be extended through scaling and replication. A re-iterative cycle will govern the development and expansion of these interventions based on prior achievements.

The implementation of interventions listed in the table necessitates a range of resources, including time, human, material, and financial resources. The Municipality's internal teams of experts will provide human resources, while members of the Coalition will contribute with their expertise/experience, as required. Material resources, such as IT equipment, consumables, event spaces, and logistic equipment, have been taken into account in the estimated budget, reflected in the second column of the table. The Coalition will review and update the costs during the reiteration phases of the CCC, based on co-working sessions. The allocated time for each intervention differs based on its complexity.

|  Behavioral, perception and modelling analysis on the individual adaptation of residents & businesses to climate neutrality | 160.000 eur | The proposed budget outlines the development of a consumer survey to assess residents' comprehension of climate neutrality concepts, individual behaviors linked to climate neutrality (with a particular emphasis on energy demand), willingness to acquire knowledge about climate neutrality and participate in a climate-neutral community, and potential barriers to adopting climate-neutral behaviors. Furthermore, the survey seeks to identify groups of individuals who can test local policies promoting climate neutrality at the neighborhood level and serve as a monitoring team. The budget also includes a series of focused interviews with representatives from the local ecosystem to evaluate their understanding of climate neutrality concepts, organizational behaviors associated with climate neutrality (with a focus on energy demand), willingness to learn more about climate neutrality, experiment with innovative solutions to become more environmentally friendly, and any perceived obstacles to adopting climate-neutral practices.

| --- | --- | --- |
|  Knowledge & Competence audit of the local climate neutrality ecosystem | 122.500 eur | The Coalition has allocated funds for the purpose of mapping and auditing the local climate neutrality ecosystem. The audit will assess the technical and social competences relevant to the city's climate neutrality goals in order to gain a better understanding of the local ecosystem's ability to plan, implement, and monitor climate neutrality policies at the neighborhood level. Additionally, the audit aims to identify potential stakeholders and facilitate a more efficient learning process for ecosystem actors. To accomplish this, individual knowledge and competence audits will be conducted for various local stakeholders, including public institutions, public companies, universities, research institutions, NGOs, and professional associations. These audits will evaluate important aspects necessary for the transition to climate neutrality, such as mission, vision, objectives, background, areas of expertise, available resources, processes, technologies, knowledge dissemination, learning needs, cooperation with other members of the ecosystem, and more.  |
|  Civic Imagination & Innovation Center - CIIC modelling for climate neutrality at neighborhood level | 235.500 eur | This initiative aims to update and refine the ideas and approaches within Civic Imagination & Innovation Center - CIIC, which has been successfully implemented in Cluj-Napoca, by focusing more intensively on climate neutrality. The CIIC will be managed by Municipality, and external experts will be contracted to provide support. The initiative will host CIIC events that bring together international and local experts to interact with citizens, businesses, and NGOs on climate-neutral related topics. Additionally, new concepts for civic imagination and innovation events will be developed and tested for target groups such as children, students, and the elderly. The initiative will also test new participatory budgeting concepts at the neighborhood level for climate neutrality-related topics, in addition to organizing various forms of participatory budgeting processes and civic imagination and innovation events.  |
|  Net Zero Caravan in urban neighbourhoods | 88.000 eur | The estimated budget will be allocated towards establishing communities at the neighborhood level that are willing to actively engage in the development, implementation, and supervision of participatory public policies pertaining to climate neutrality. This effort will involve conducting meetings in informal neighborhood spaces through the Net Zero Caravan initiative. After residents become involved with the NZ Caravans, they will be able to participate in specialized training and educational workshops focused on different aspects of climate neutrality and community-led initiatives. These workshops may include topics such as saving energy in their own homes, preventing food waste, recycling waste, and becoming a prosumer.  |
|  Net Zero Caravan in the metropolitan area of Cluj-Napoca | 94.000 eur | The focus of the intervention is on the suburban areas in Cluj-Napoca's metropolitan area, with the goal of transferring the knowledge gained in the city center to the peri-urban communities. The Metropolitan Carbon Neutrality Caravan aims to promote the zero-carbon mindset of Cluj-Napoca to its suburbs, disseminate educational materials to various stakeholders in the Cluj Metropolitan Area, and encourage behavioral changes among the peri-urban residents, businesses, and public administrations to adopt the urban climate-neutral mentality that is specific to the metropolitan demographics. To accomplish these objectives, the caravan will organize workshops, training events, and community-building initiatives that target local administrations, residents, and other stakeholders in each neighborhood. In-depth training sessions will be conducted, to increase awareness of climate-neutrality-related topics, assist with the adoption of the proposed tools, and identify potential NZ Champions who can exchange best practices and experiences with those from urban neighborhoods. The training sessions will be available to public servants, residents, NGOs, business owners, and other interested parties.  |

|  Enhancing the capacity of the ecosystem to implement and monitor climate neutral policies at neighborhood level | 300.000 eur | The budget allocated for this intervention comprises several elements. Firstly, the NZChamp Campaign will be conducted to select climate neutrality managers/champions in neighborhoods. The competition will aim to identify private companies, NGOs, and institutions that are implementing measurable and replicable climate neutrality measures at the neighborhood level. Secondly, packages of training materials and good practice examples will be provided for various categories of stakeholders such as pupils, students, home owners, business owners, teachers, and researchers, etc. The materials will offer guidance on actions that can be taken in day-to-day activities and medium to long-term projects to accelerate neighborhood climate neutrality achievement. Thirdly, an interactive framework will be developed to enhance building administrators' knowledge of climate neutrality. The framework aims to assist building administrators in implementing measures and actions that can facilitate achieving climate neutrality at the condominium level. The budget will cover training and dissemination events organized for condominium administrators on topics such as energy saving, on-site renewable energy generation, and smart buildings. Finally, experience exchanges, networking, and learning activities will be organized for representatives of the local ecosystem on climate neutrality themes.  |

|  Defining a set of urban planning principles and documents for climate neutral interventions, plus incentives for their implementation | 9.700.000 eur | The proposed budget encompasses the following sub-interventions: developing urban planning principles that integrate energy-saving and energy-generating methods, nature-based solutions, sustainable mobility, smart city initiatives, and UHI mitigation to improve citizens' quality of life and prevent urban migration to suburban and peri-urban areas. These principles will be based not only on technical expertise from Coalition partners but also on input from citizens and stakeholders. Additionally, the General Spatial Planning of Cluj-Napoca will be updated to incorporate strategies for reducing CO2 emissions in all targeted areas. Furthermore, at least 2 Zonal Urban Plans will be created for climate-neutral neighborhoods and around 8 international contests will be held for solutions to the major urban renewal interventions outlined in the Action Plan. The budget also includes costs associated with several incentives designed to encourage climate-friendly individual behaviors, such as tax reductions for green commercial buildings and the local implementation of the national RABLA program, which will offer financial support (in the form of discounts from the total price of the new purchased e-vehicle) to residents who purchase electric cars in exchange for giving up their old, polluting vehicles.  |
|  Developing a comprehensive masterplan model for transforming 1 high density apartment block neighborhood into a climate neutral district | 95.000 eur | The allocated budget will cover the development of a masterplan for comprehensive urban renewal, which will focus on a single neighborhood. The plan will prioritize various initiatives such as sustainable mobility, the expansion of green spaces and blue-green corridors, reducing energy consumption in public spaces like street lighting and sprinkler systems, ensuring pedestrian-friendly access to amenities, decreasing the urban heat island (UHI) effect, implementing Smart City solutions, increasing accessibility for vulnerable groups, and enhancing the overall quality of life in the area to discourage urban migration to suburban and peri-urban regions. The existing local policies will be taken into account, but the plan will propose new policies if new discoveries demonstrate their necessity.  |
|  Elaborating a detailed proposal for transforming one pilot area of the 1 neighbourhood into a climate neutral demo district | 117.000 eur | The budget estimate encompasses a particular region of the neighborhood selected by the Cluj-Napoca Municipality that will be subject to the detailed proposal for transforming it into a climate neutral space, with input from citizens and stakeholders. A financially viable and detailed proposal will be devised for the chosen area, using a comprehensive plan for the creation of a climate-neutral neighborhood. This plan will integrate all the emission domains in the final solution.  |
|  Developing a ToR model for the renovation of block of flats situated in high density multi-apartment neighborhoods in order to | 58.000 eur | The proposed Terms of Reference (ToR) will be structured in a modular manner, facilitating the integration of relevant components into building renovation proposals tailored to meet the specific requirements of densely populated apartment-block neighborhoods. The ToR will also include an option to expand living space by constructing an outer shell,  |

The proposal has several objectives. Firstly, improving the quality of life, both inside and outside the building, including its appearance, can significantly reduce the number of people who move to suburban or peri-urban areas in search of better living conditions. Secondly, the possibility of constructing additional commercial spaces or housing units can attract private developers who can recover their costs through renting or selling these new spaces. Moreover, having more commercial areas in proximity to residents can decrease the need for travel by car to fulfill personal needs. Lastly, the ToR model will be applied to a building that can function as a pilot project.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Elaborating a model for improving the governance of condominiums and their integration in the local climate neutrality ecosystem | 30.000 eur | The Model for improving condominium governance will streamline the way in which residential blocks are managed (currently a deficient, problematic management) and the new local public policy tools will accelerate the individual adoption of climate neutral practices. Within the improved condominium governance model, homeowners associations will play a stronger role and proactive citizens investing in thermal rehabilitation will benefit from reduced costs and faster implementation of energy renovation works. This measure will build on the existing investments of individual owners into energy efficiency of their building, identifying bottlenecks, engaging citizens in the reform process and promoting improved quality in the delivery.  |
|  Public promotion, communication and awareness | 920.000 eur | The estimated budget encompasses the communication and promotional activities that the Municipality will carry out over the next 8 years to raise awareness and educate citizens, stakeholders, and partners about climate neutrality. This initiative aims to target both online platforms such as social media pages, virtual platforms, interactive community activities, gamification sessions, etc. and offline methods such as organizing the annual International Carbon Neutrality Summit, local events in neighborhoods and metropolitan areas, physical communication and promotional campaigns about measures that can be taken by citizens and the ecosystem to mitigate the negative impact on the climate, thematic conferences, etc.  |
|  Collaborative, innovative, integrative and tech-intensive development of the Climate Neutrality Digital Twin | 1.000.000 eur | This intervention represents a ground-breaking effort in the European green and digital transition movement: the development of Digital Twin technology that can collect, monitor, and forecast social and environmental behaviors. The goal is to integrate the findings and models from previous interventions, and with the input of stakeholders, co-design and develop a full-scale solution to capture the various pathways towards climate.  |
|  Reflexive governance and CCC annual iterations | 80.000 eur | The budget includes funding for running the reflexive governance process within the Net Zero City Coalition. This will involve coordinating and working within the Coalition to implement, monitor, and update the Action Plan as well as all deliverables and related documents. Additionally, it includes iterations of the CCC, within broader sessions of sensemaking and strategic learning.  |

Outlook and next steps

PLANS FOR NEXT CCC AND ACTION PLAN ITERATION

During the preparation phase of the Climate Contract documents, some methodological (and not only) issues occurred, that also have a potential impact on the implementation of the Action Plan. First and the most important one is the GHG emissions monitoring and reporting procedures and practices at national and city level. Up to now, only two detailed inventories of CO2 emission have been conducted at local level, one during the elaboration of the first SEAP in 2011 and one associated with the preparation of the SECAP in 2021. The Municipality was one of the first in Romania to hire a Energy Manager, namely a private operator that provides consultancy and technical assistance for planning, implementation and monitoring of energy-related interventions. This company was also in charge of preparing the SECAP for 2030. The resources currently allocated by the Municipality and the mandate of this Energy Manager are, however, limited and do not cover all sources of emissions and types of gases needed for an exhaustive and periodically updated climate neutrality dashboard to accompany the implementation of the Action Plan. Thus, the consolidation of the monitoring system is the main challenge for 2030. Secondly, the period of time available for the preparation of the Action Plan was enough to actively involve the entire ecosystem but insufficient to carry out a climate neutrality-related survey among citizens, especially in the new global context of rising risks for energy poverty. This analysis was however included as a starting point in the project proposal submitted under NetZeroCities - Horizon 2020. Thirdly, the preparation of the Investment Plan was hampered by the high inflation rates in Romania (over 15% year-to-year) and the EU and by the high risk of any investment, operational and maintenance cost projection for 2030. The costs of various imported building materials (including those coming from ex-Soviet countries), to give just an example, tripled in the last two years. The high energy prices can also impact the individual behaviours, considering that preliminary data on household consumption indicates a 8% drop in the first three quarters of 2022 against the same period of 2021. To conclude, we are expecting that during the implementation phase of the Investment Plan updates of the financial indicators will be needed.

In what concerns the per se implementation of the Action Plan we envisage both some critical milestones and iterations, as follows:

The Municipality will begin the implementation of many climate neutrality-related investment projects under NRRP (over 50 projects for energy renovation of public and residential buildings, smart city, green public transport, circular economy etc. have been submitted and selected for financing) and will submit other projects for financing under the 2021-2027 ROP (urban renewal, new parks, blue-green corridors, electric and hydrogen buses and trolleybuses, cycling infrastructure, energy renovation of public and private buildings etc.). Last but not least, in 2023 the most important metropolitan sustainable mobility investment project (first subway line), should enter the implementation phase. Overall, 2023 will bring much clarity on the maturity of measures included in the Action Plan. This might also require an update of the Action Plan and Investment Plan at the end of 2023/beginning of 2024.

For 2023, another milestone will be the result of the evaluation phase for one major project proposals with high impact on the Action Plan: the project that was be submitted in January 2023 under the EUI - Innovative Actions (New European Bauhaus) call and it is in strong synergy with the project submitted under the NetZeroCities - Horizon 2020 Pilot Cities Call and fortunately Cluj-Napoca became one of the 53 selected cities. This 2 projects are strongly interconnected and target the climate neutrality of the largest and most dense residential area in the city, with  $\frac{1}{4}$  of the total number of residents, with a large impact on the implementation of the

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

overall Climate Neutrality Action Plan.

For 2024-2027, we expect the focus to be on the implementation of the NRRP projects (which have to be completed by the end of 2026), 2021-2027 ROP investments and all three major mobility projects financed from various sources (subway, metropolitan train and metropolitan belt). The "soft interventions" (such as urban planning or behaviour changes) will also be tested in the pilot neighbourhood of Mănăștur (in the framework of the NetZeroCities and EUI projects). By the end of 2024, we expect the Climate Neutrality Coalition to be fully operational and to support the update, implementation and monitoring of the Action Plan. Overall, this interval of time will bring the largest investment in the history of the city, all of them focused on reducing the GHG emissions. It is also important to mention that 2027 will also be extremely important for the configuration of the post-2027 programming period at national and regional level, requiring a strong lobby of the local ecosystem for more resources allocated to climate neutrality. Considering that Cluj-Napoca has one of the most stable governance structures in Romania (same Mayor and a strong majority in the Local Council since 2005), we are not expecting the local elections in 2024 to bring significant changes of vision.

For 2028-2030 the focus will be on scaling the pilot "soft interventions" tested in Mănăștur neighbourhood at city and even metropolitan level, to finalise all the invest projects financed under 2021-2030 ROP and the three major sustainable mobility projects, with large impact on reducing the GHG emissions in the building and transport sector. Also, for the beginning of 2028 we are predicting that all strategic documents (IUDS, SUMP, SACEP etc.) for the post 2027 programming cycle will be updated, together with the Action Plan, emphasising once more the need to continue and even expand the interventions related to climate-neutrality.

Concluding, the present Action Plan delineates our envisioned path towards decarbonization, which is informed by our obligation as a holder of the Mission Label to generate systemic innovations and transformative actions in all emission domains, capitalizing on all our available systems. To accomplish this objective, we seek the support of both entities and citizens, whom we intend to keep engaged throughout the implementation of the Action Plan via our Cluj Net Zero City Local Coalition. We acknowledge that our pursuit entails a great deal of work, but we are convinced that, by adopting a collaborative strategic approach, we can rally citizens, companies, organizations, and institutions around our common ambition to create an unprecedented urban transition towards climate neutrality.

We recognize that this pursuit requires not only horizontal and vertical coordination but also transversal interventions, that will involve a mix of local actors. Hence, we pledge to coordinate all such endeavours to facilitate Cluj-Napoca's transition to climate neutrality, positioning our city as a hub for the deployment and demonstration of low-carbon investments in infrastructure, people, and the environment. Together with Bucharest and Suceava, Cluj-Napoca is poised to assume the role of a climate neutrality ambassador for Romanian cities.

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

# 1 Introduction

Cluj-Napoca Municipality has joined the EU Mission for 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030, with the ambition to reach climate neutrality by 2030. Cluj-Napoca's goal is to become a Net-Zero City by 2030 through reducing GHG emissions by at least 80% compared to 2021, and become a living lab for testing, maturing, implementing, and scaling-up solutions for the fight against climate change. To this end, Cluj-Napoca Municipality commits itself to deliver bold climate action, that will enable it to achieve this goal on time, by ensuring a fair and just climate neutrality transition and by not leaving anyone behind, duty that is reflected through our public commitment to enable climate-neutrality throughout Cluj Metropolitan Area.

Cluj-Napoca has taken significant steps towards climate neutrality. Climate neutrality is already an assumed goal in the IUDS 2021-2030-2050 (approved by the City Council in January 2022), which includes a comprehensive package of priority projects to achieve this goal. Moreover, Cluj-Napoca has finished the elaboration of its Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) by 2030, officially aiming to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 80% by 2030. The Plan meets IUDS 2021-2027's strategic vision (transition from EGO-SYSTEM to ECO-SYSTEM in all the areas that are related to Cluj Metropolitan Area' development) and builds on local strategic documents (the 2031 Local Heating Strategy, the 2027 Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, the 2020-2024 Air Quality Plan Improvement Plan), projects (implemented by both the municipality and its local ecosystem), programs (eg., Walkable City, Cluj-Napoca Urban Agglomeration's Energy Efficiency Improvement Program), public measures (eg., Restructuring contracts with private operators for brownfield redevelopment, Fiscal incentives for residents that make their homes energy efficient) and private ones (eg., CSR campaigns financed by business actors, that encourage, among other actions, green mobility and waste recycling). Some highlights about our city's past and present commitments to climate action include:

Energy performance standards for new buildings and consolidated NZEB skills. To receive a construction permit, all the new private buildings in Cluj-Napoca with more than 6 apartments need to either connect to the district heating system or to install a low-carbon heating unit for the entire building (rather than individual units). Moreover, buildings with a green certification (LEED, BREEAM and DGNB) benefit from a 50% reduction in property taxes, and building managers have access to nZEB accredited trainings.

Renovation of existing buildings. Cluj-Napoca Municipality co-finances thermal rehabilitation works undertaken with EU Funds (ROP and RRF). Currently, over 55% of the around 101,000 apartments in condominiums have been thermally rehabilitated – most of them with private funds.

Integrating RES generation facilities into buildings. The Municipality has already installed solar panels on approximately 15 public buildings, including schools, sports facilities and food markets. Deep renovations to nZEB standards have been performed on 8

school buildings in the city, including the installation of photovoltaic panels, LED lighting, HAVC and BEMS system and reducing CO2 emission by approximately 57 tons.

Clean buses and new and efficient trams. Around 20% of the bus fleet in the Cluj Metropolitan Area is electric (around 50% of the total public transport fleet, including trams and trolleybuses, is currently electric), including charging stations. Moreover, the current Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan proposes 100% of public transport to be green by 2030. In addition, almost the entire fleet has been replaced with new, efficient and attractive vehicles. The purchase of 41 buses led to a reduction in CO2 emission by over 2,000 tons/year, lowered the level of outdoor air and noise pollution and generated cost savings of more than €60,000/year.

Modal shift to walking and cycling. Cluj-Napoca's Walkable City Program, together with Green Cluj Investment Program, are the most comprehensive initiatives of this kind in Romania (including dedicated public transport, bike lanes, planting of new trees, rehabilitation of green spaces, charging stations, green taxi stands, smart lighting and traffic management). The programs resulted, so far, in new low emission zones within the city center (car access only for residents, employees and suppliers), dedicated lanes for public transport and bicycles, electric charging stations, stands for electric taxis, extended pedestrian and planted areas.

Moreover, Mayor Emil Boc, who is also the president of the Romanian Association of Municipalities, president of COTER, the designated Country Ambassador at the European Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy and former Prime Minister of Romania, is one the biggest supporters of climate neutrality at national and EU level. At his initiative, Cluj-Napoca was the first municipality in Romania to sign the Green City Accord and also the first city nationwide to lead the sustainable urban mobility group within the City Science Initiative Network. Shortly after Cluj-Napoca was selected among the 100 cities in the EU to become climate neutral and smart by 2030, the municipality has organized the InnoWave Summit. The other two cities selected from Romania (Suceava and Bucharest) had the chance to meet for the first time and discuss the future of climate neutrality in Romania with the coordinator of the Horizon European Mission Cities, the President of European Committee of the Regions, the European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, members of the European Parliament, the representatives of the Romanian Ministry for Research, Innovation and Digitalisation, etc. Thus, the local ecosystem and the Municipality have sent a clear statement at national and EU-level that Cluj-Napoca is highly politically committed to act as an European Lab City for climate neutrality, in line with its strategic development vision for 2030.

With regards to R&amp;I, several of the actions and outcomes from projects developed by the partners in the local NZC Coalition will provide a solid basis for implementing the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan. An innovative solution tested in Cluj-Napoca with the assistance of the Technical University provides valuable insights into the Demand Response in Block of Buildings. The project included envisioning, developing, testing at small-scale and validating an ICT-based building-wide Automated Cognitive Engine that monitors, predicts, optimises, and controls the energy flow in 10

public buildings. Two of the universities that are part of the local Net Zero City Coalition (Babes-Bolyai University and the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca) have also conducted scientific studies on urban heat island mitigation and neighbourhood-level analyses, which will directly feed into the proposed climate neutrality actions.

Another important project, implemented by the Transylvania IT Cluster in partnership with the Municipality of Cluj-Napoca and the National Research-Development Institute for Isotopic and Molecular Technologies was the EU H2020 REFLOW project, aiming to co-create circular and regenerative flows of resources at the city level. The pilot project resulted in energy consumption analyses of public buildings and the public lighting system, a smart metering system and an energy monitoring app for building administrators with live data on consumption. A community of practice on circular economy based on a retrofit kit, including recommended public policy inputs and educational toolkits towards circularity and neutrality, emerged through this project, further strengthening the collaboration between public administration, clusters, SMEs and other stakeholders.

Transylvania IT Cluster is currently implementing another project, ZeroW, in partnership with Agro Transilvania Cluster. The project focuses on systemic innovations for zero food waste, funded under the Green Deal call of the H2020 programme. Moreover, Transylvania IT Cluster established in 2017 the Transylvania Digital Innovation Hub (TDIH), through a consortium of 12 local partners. The DIH is strategically positioned as an engine of digital and green transformation and innovation in the strive for carbon neutrality.

The Transylvania Energy Cluster is building an experimental science park for the research of advanced technologies in alternative energies. The primary project outcomes include producing clean, sustainable energy for the 2,2 ha scientific park, the study of renewable energy storage, and tests, measurements, quantitative and qualitative analysis.

## 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

As previously stated, Cluj-Napoca's ambition is to become a Net Zero City by 2030, through reductions in GHG emissions by at least 80% compared to 2021 and transform into a living lab for testing, maturing, implementing, and scaling-up solutions for the fight against climate change. Thus, the Municipality is determined to meet the EU's requirement to be a climate neutral city by 2030, with the aim of having a healthy, innovative, green and inclusive city, that ensures the best quality of life, while leaving no one behind.

To achieve this goal, the specific objective no. 3 of Cluj Metropolitan Area's Integrated Urban Development Strategy for 2030 and 2050 focuses on a green, resilient and carbon neutral city. In this pursuit, Cluj-Napoca Municipality aims to ensure the environmentally friendly development of the municipality and its metropolitan area by: reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% until 2030, providing access to water and waste water infrastructure to over 99% of the population, capturing 95% of the recyclable household waste and increasing the surface of green spaces by at least 200 ha. The priorities assumed in this regard include:

Investment priority 3.1: Increasing the energy performance of collective housing complexes.
Investment priority 3.2: Increasing the energy performance of public buildings and public lighting systems.
Investment priority 3.3: Investing in centralized thermal energy supply, infrastructure for electricity supply from renewable sources and natural gas.
Investment priority 3.4: Promoting the sustainable management of water resources.
Investment priority 3.5: Preserving the natural heritage and biodiversity and developing the green-blue infrastructure.
Investment priority 3.6: Supporting the local and metropolitan implementation of integrated waste management systems and circular economy practices.
Investment priority 3.7: Reducing air and noise pollution.
Investment priority 3.8: Investing in increasing the resilience to risks, respectively the climate change and emergency response capacity.

Cluj Metropolitan Area's Integrated Urban Development Strategy for 2030 and 2050 was approved by the City Council in January 2022, following an extensive process of public consultations, during which all the objectives and priorities of the IUDS were debated with citizens and local stakeholders (the private sector, the university and research representatives, the innovation ecosystem actors and the local NGOs). All the feedback that was collected during the 7 participatory IUDS co-design sessions was included in the final strategic document, before it was officially approved by the public administration. Similar processes were carried out for all other local

strategic documents (eg., the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan, the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, the Local Heating Strategy, the Air Quality Plan Improvement Plan), in order for the entire local strategic framework to reflect the public opinion on the major ambitions and objectives that are related to the local and metropolitan development.

The main exclusion areas consist of water, waste water and waste management. These aspects do not fall under the exclusive competence of the municipality, but involve extensive responsibilities, justifying why they cannot be assumed individually by the Cluj-Napoca City Hall. For instance, the waste treatment component falls under the jurisdiction of the Cluj County Council, while the water management and waste water treatment flows are coordinated by the Someș Water Company, a public company belonging to the Cluj County Council. Another exclusion area refers to the pollution caused by the private sector, especially by the industrial one, which falls under the responsibility of the central authorities. For example, the National Environmental Protection Agency, through its county branches, is the institution that issues environmental authorizations for the economic agents, monitors their emissions, carries out controls and executes sanctions in case of breaches. The only levers that the Municipality of Cluj-Napoca can use in such cases include specific local interventions (eg., small-scale investments aimed at expanding the water and sewer network within the Cluj-Napoca Municipality) in the case of water, waste water and waste management systems, to which are added the urban planning regulations for industrial operators (eg., special requirements regarding mandatory distances between polluting industrial units and built areas), so rather indirect measures. Post-2030, these areas will be addressed according to the legislation in force at that time.

Finally, the entire process of transitioning towards climate neutrality by 2030 is collectively assumed by the entire local ecosystem. This conjointly pursued mission is reflected by the accession of the key local actors to the Net Zero City Coalition, through which our local stakeholders (presented in detail in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan and also signatories of the present 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments) have taken responsibility to actively contribute to the Cluj-Napoca's effort of growing into a climate-neutral and smart city by 2030.

Through the elaboration of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, it became very clear that working towards the climate neutrality goals will allow the Municipality of Cluj-Napoca to generate a multitude of subsidiary co-benefits. Thus, our impact pathways capture a series of co-benefits that will contribute to the quality of life in the city and the metropolitan area, but also to economic performances reached in the spirit of protecting the environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change. Among the main betterments that will be complementarily generated, we mention: the increase in the quality of life (eg., by reducing congestion and improving the safety of public spaces), the reductions in households' and economic agents' financial burdens (eg., by reducing energy costs), respectively of individuals (eg., by increasing the affordability of transport), the increases in the local budget's income (eg., through new revenue sources, respectively new savings) and the one of economic agents (eg., by increasing the productivity of the private sector and by creating new business opportunities), the improvements in air quality (eg., by reducing pollution), the optimization of the urban development process (eg., by reducing the urban flight to suburbs and improving urban aesthetics) and a better overall functioning of the community (eg., by strengthening community cohesion and collaboration).

All the above-presented ameliorations will massively contribute to attracting even more citizens in the Net Zero City Coalition, which has already begun to direct its efforts and resources towards fulfilling the assumed climate neutrality targets.

## 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

Based on the data provided in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, Cluj-Napoca Municipality has analysed the state of current affairs (according to all the data collected from the local strategic documents, together with the estimates calculated within the documentation required for the Climate City Contract) and identified, among all the proposed actions, 9 key priorities that need to be urgently addressed in order to achieve 2030 climate neutrality goal:

Integrated urban regeneration of apartment block neighborhoods. 78% of GHG emissions in Cluj-Napoca are generated by the built environment, with the residential sector being responsible for more than half of these emissions, and 77% of residents of Cluj-Napoca live in apartment blocks. This clearly leads to the conclusion that integrated solutions for apartment block neighborhoods in Cluj-Napoca must be one of the major priorities in the coming years.

Deep renovation of public and commercial buildings and brownfields redevelopment. Public and commercial buildings are responsible for around half of the GHG emissions generated by the built environment in Cluj-Napoca. As such, improving the energy performance of these buildings is of critical importance for achieving carbon neutrality in Cluj-Napoca. This target will be easier to achieve if the energy mix in Romania will continue to move towards a higher share of green sources, but it is critical to also take appropriate measures locally.

Improve energy production efficiency at district level. At the moment, the public heating system is outdated, obsolete and ineffective from the perspective of the energy waste it records. Thus, Cluj-Napoca faces a stringent need to improve the efficiency of energy production, transport and distribution systems (including the expansion of energy generation facilities from alternative, non-polluting sources) while also optimizing not only district, but also city-wide energy consumption, such as the public lighting.

Improve public spaces quality to encourage people to spend more time outdoors and limit urban heat islands. The energy use in private buildings can be significantly reduced if people are encouraged to spend more time outdoors and less time indoors. This measure also has significant health benefits, particularly in conjunction with other measures (eg., improving the quality of air and fight against urban heat islands).

Extend the network of electric charging stations and benefits for electric car users. Transport is the sector with the most significant increases in GHG emission in recent years in Cluj-Napoca, particularly commuter traffic. Addressing emission from the transport sector takes a multi-pronged approach, but of particular importance is the encouragement of electric car use, which are becoming the norm at EU level and will be mandatory since 2035.

Extend the Walkable City investment program, Cluj Bike program and update of parking policy. The on-going Walkable City Program has already transformed many areas of the city into pedestrian-only or shared spaces. This program will be expanded, with a stronger focus on residential neighborhoods, to make it more attractive for people to walk, bike, or use public transport for their daily and ad-hoc commutes. Dedicated interventions will also target the Cluj Bike program, which will become more attractive and visible through the expansion of bike lanes and the public bike sharing system, together with bicycle

parking facilities. In addition, the city-wide Parking Policy will be updated continuously, to discourage the use of private cars for daily commutes.

Creation of the Cluj Circular City program. The circular economy is a mega-trend that the municipality must rally to, in order to be able to introduce sustainable waste management practices at the local level, especially in the context where municipal waste is a severe problem of the city (which, however, characterizes the urban environment throughout the entire country).

Major green transport infrastructure and reduction of congestion in the city. Several major investments are planned in Cluj-Napoca, and the wider metropolitan area, which will create green transport alternatives for daily and ad-hoc commutes. These major investments include the metro system, the metropolitan train, and the Someș Blue-Green Corridor, which, in conjunction with continued investments in the public transport system (including smart public transport stations), the extension of bicycle path network, and the extension of pedestrian areas, will help achieve the target assumed in the Mobility Plan and the Integrated Urban Development Strategy, to have 80% of daily commutes done by public transport or non-motorized transport means by 2030. In addition, another major investment, the Southern Belt of the city, will help remove congestion from the core city, and provide an alternative for transit traffic.

Green Cluj investment program and Continued expansion of green areas. Cluj-Napoca Municipality has an ambitious plan to create 190 hectares of new green land in the city, and to plant 100,000 new trees. In addition, together with the Cluj County Council and other local administrations in the Cluj Metropolitan Area, around 12,500 hectares of new metropolitan forest will be created (i.e., a metropolitan green belt).

All these ambitions will generate a real, measurable change and radically reduce GHG emissions. In order for all these priorities to transform from strategy to reality, the entire local ecosystem will be involved in the climate neutrality efforts. Thus, depending on their individual expertise, all the signatory stakeholders will contribute to fulfilling the strategic interventions mentioned above. They will provide expertise to the municipality and will also be co-involved in various local projects (together with the other stakeholders and with Cluj-Napoca Municipality) that will lead to achieving the assumed climate-neutral vision.

# 4 Principles and process

When Cluj-Napoca Municipality decided to participate in the EU Mission for 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030, it operationalized an internal task force, that is responsible for managing the entire process (not only in terms of joining the network, but also for implementing the Climate City Contract, with all its implicit responsibilities). In order to create an internal body (City Hall's staff) that is able to cover the entire expertise needed to fulfill the climate neutrality ambition, experts from different complementary departments were chosen. The team is composed of representatives from Cluj-Napoca City Hall's following departments: Public Procurement Service, Financial Department, Investment Department, Legal Department, Urban Strategies Office, Urban Ecology and Green Areas Directorate, Energy Efficiency Office, Marketing Strategies Department; Digital Transformation and Innovation Department, together with the IT Strategy Department.

Added to these is the Urban Energy Manager, which deals with all the energy aspects within the municipality. They directly and constantly work on fulfilling the objectives assumed by the city within this mission, ensuring the smooth running of their specific activities. The task force is under the coordination of the Strategy, Local Development and Project Management Department, being managed by Dalila Ciucian, Councilor and Project Manager at Cluj-Napoca City Hall.

Mandating the above-mentioned departments was an obvious step-forward in the City Hall's functioning, given that the public commitment towards climate neutrality brought (and will still bring) new responsibilities, that were uniformly and fairly distributed within the public administration, based on each department's specificity and relevance for the assumed objectives.

However, since the transition towards climate neutrality is not an individual responsibility, but rather a collective effort, Cluj-Napoca Municipality has launched an invitation to the entire local ecosystem to engage all the key local actors in this endeavor. Mobilising the ecosystem was a smooth process, because the local stakeholders have a long history of co-working, through various partnerships, within local projects. Thus, the meetings were part of the usual processes through which the local community of experts and professionals actually works for reaching shared goals. Following a series of constructive discussions and starting with the Municipality's ambitious initiative, the creation of the Net Zero City Coalition was approved, with the scope of serving the local climate-neutrality pursuits. As a result of initiating the coalition, the entire documentation was prepared, based on the stages that were already described both in the Action Plan and in the previous sections of this document. Fortunately, the Net Zero City Coalition also enjoys the participation of regional and national actors, who empower this partnership and will help the municipality in transferring its good practices both in the North-West Development Region and throughout the country.

Net Zero City Coalition's work was based and still focuses on using already-existing local strategic documents (eg., SUMP, SECAP, IUDS), out of the willingness to ensure the continuity and sustainability of priorities that were established through previously-approved framework papers. Thus, the Action Plan resulted from integrating all the climate neutrality ambitions that have been set in prior plans and furtherly correlating them with the Mission's requirements, in order for the flow of implemented interventions to consider all the adopted local decisions, as well as align them to the latest goals.

Concluding, the key principles that will guide the Municipality of Cluj-Napoca as it implements its Climate City Contract were established with the aim of ensuring the smooth running of all the proposed interventions, in order to reach an optimal flow of action up until 2030:

Accountability: Ensuring that all parties involved are held responsible for meeting their commitments and achieving their goals in reducing emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change.
Transparency: Ensuring that information is readily available and communicated effectively to the public, stakeholders and other relevant parties.
Open attitude to new approaches: Willingness to consider and adopt innovative solutions, technologies and methodologies that can help achieve climate goals more effectively.
Co-creation: Engaging stakeholders, including citizens, community organizations, and businesses, in the development and implementation of the Climate City Contract to ensure that it meets their needs and priorities.
Innovation: Encouraging and investing in cutting-edge research and development, and adopting innovative technologies and practices, to achieve long-term climate goals.
Multi-actor and citizen engagement: Building strong partnerships and collaborations with a wide range of actors, including government, civil society, academia and the private sector, to mobilize resources and expertise towards meeting climate goals.
Systemic and demand-driven: Ensuring that the Climate City Contract is integrated into the city's overall systems and processes and is driven by the needs and priorities of citizens and stakeholders.
Monitoring and joint learning: Regularly monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the Climate City Contract and sharing the results and lessons learned with stakeholders to continuously improve and refine the process.

In the long term, the Climate City Contract, together with the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan and the related Investment Plan will go through recurring phases of iteration, because the Municipality of Cluj-Napoca perceives all these papers as living documents. Thus, as a rule of thumb, bi-annual implementation monitoring sessions will be organized, along with annual re-iteration sessions, in order to fix the necessary updates, depending on the evolution of the local context and the new European and national directives to be set with regards to climate neutrality. However, such working meetings will be organized more often - if and whenever needed - in order to solve any situation as quickly and efficiently as possible.

The Climate City Contract's implementation will be monitored by Cluj-Napoca Municipality, through its dedicated task force, but will also require the involvement of the Net Zero City Coalition's members, who will provide the needed knowledge (eg., the Energy Manager) and owned technologies (eg., devices held by the Babeș-Bolyai University and by the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca for monitoring air quality and pollution, etc.) if, where and when the City Hall lacks the necessary resources. Depending on the monitoring results and the decisions

adopted in the (re)iteration meetings, proposals for updating and revising the Climate City Contract will be initiated. The decisions will have to be accepted by the majority of the Net Zero City Coalition's members and approved by Cluj-Napoca City Hall, prior to coming into effect.
