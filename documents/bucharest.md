# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses, and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

Understanding the pivotal role urban areas play in the global climate response, District 2 of Bucharest recognises its potential to significantly contribute to the European Green Deal's objectives. Cities and metropolitan areas, including District 2, hold a unique position to expedite the transition to zero-emission environments through systemic approaches spanning governance structures and resource utilisation. As centers of social innovation and testbeds for emerging climate-neutral technologies, urban areas bear the responsibility of acting as catalysts for climate neutrality. However, achieving these ambitious goals necessitates a collaborative, multi-faceted approach involving local ecosystems and, importantly, the communities they serve.

In support of the European Union's initiatives, the European Commission launched the "100 Carbon Neutral Cities by 2030" Mission, aiming to support and showcase 100 European cities in their systemic transformation towards climate neutrality by 2030. This mission intends to position these cities as innovation hubs for all urban areas, thus leading the charge on the European Green Deal and Europe's ambition to become climate-neutral by 2050. As part of this vision, District 2 of Bucharest is committed to accelerating its efforts towards climate neutrality, aspiring to serve as a model for sustainable urban development.

District 2's action towards becoming a Net Zero City by 2030 is detailed in its 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan. This comprehensive strategy, developed in collaboration with stakeholders such as local authorities, universities and residents, aims to address the district's environmental challenges while fostering a sustainable and resilient future. The plan aligns with broader EU objectives and Romania's national policies, incorporating significant steps towards reducing GHG emissions, enhancing energy efficiency, and promoting green-blue infrastructure.

The 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan for District 2 outlines a series of interlinked interventions designed to reduce local GHG emissions by 80% by 2030. These interventions span across energy systems, the built environment, waste management, and transportation, rooted in an evidence-based, multi-level approach. The plan combines measurable, reportable, and verifiable actions with a comprehensive theory of change aimed at systemic decarbonisation. It reflects District 2's commitment to an efficient, equitable transition to climate neutrality, illustrating the district's role in the global effort towards a sustainable future. The plan envisions a dynamic and adaptable approach, with future iterations scheduled every two years to incorporate new data, technological advancements, and feedback from ongoing implementation. A comprehensive review and ongoing monitoring mechanism, through the Integrated Climate Neutrality Task Force, will ensure the plan remains relevant and effective.

# 1 Introduction

The introduction should outline the local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and describe the gap it is addressing in broad terms.

## Introduction - textual element

Bucharest, as the capital of Romania, is at the forefront of urban development, boasting the country's largest population and area. Among its six administrative districts, each uniquely managed by their respective City Halls and Local Councils, District 2 is prominent in the northeastern part of the city. Spanning an area of 32 square kilometres, it houses 372,913 inhabitants, ranking third in population size among the capital's districts. However, the population growth and density also comes at the cost of a high level of GHG emissions, mainly associated with the growing housing sector and motorisation rate. Despite Bucharest's status as Romania's most developed urban centre, as indicated by the Local Human Development Index, challenges persist, especially in addressing the needs of disadvantaged areas. The World Bank's Atlas of Marginalised Urban Areas in Romania reveals that approximately 19% of District 2's population resides in areas struggling with limitations in human capital, employment opportunities, and housing quality.

The district confronts challenges characteristic of dense city life – a deficit in green spaces, significant pollution from heavy car traffic and sanitation concerns in certain areas. The major culprit of air pollution in Bucharest, and by extension District 2, is vehicular emissions, contributing a mix of inorganic gases (such as nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide), volatile organic compounds (like benzene), and particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5). These pollutants predominantly affect areas with high population density and major traffic congestion.

Comprehensive reports, including the 2021 Report on the State of Environmental Factors for the Municipality of Bucharest and the Integrated and Sustainable Local Development Strategy of District 2 for 2021-2027, alongside the Energy Efficiency Improvement Programme (PIEE), have been instrumental in identifying the critical challenges impeding District 2's progression towards climate neutrality. These challenges encompass air quality degradation, inadequate selective waste collection capacity, a scarcity of green spaces, heavy reliance on personal vehicles, and substantial energy loss from non-energy efficient housing. The Climate Neutrality Action Plan of District 2 is a strategic response to these issues, charting a course for a sustainable and resilient urban future.

In response to these environmental challenges, the City Hall of District 2 Bucharest has aligned itself with the ambitious Mission 100 Climate-Neutral Cities by 2030. This commitment reflects the district's dedication to diminishing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fostering a community that is safer, more inclusive, and environmentally sustainable. The foundation for this vision is laid out in the Integrated and Sustainable Development Strategy of District 2 for the period 2021-2027. This strategy outlines key objectives aimed at achieving climate neutrality, with a focus on modernising and enhancing infrastructure in crucial sectors:

Energy: Transitioning to a low GHG emission energy system.
Green-blue infrastructure: Expanding and enhancing the quality of green spaces.
Environmental infrastructure: Upgrading water and sewerage systems, and promoting a circular economy through efficient waste management.
Public transportation: Emphasising the use of non-polluting or low emission transport.

In alignment with the broader ambition of Bucharest to become a green, zero-carbon city, District 2 has embarked on a series of strategic initiatives and plans addressing key areas of urban sustainability and climate neutrality.

**ENERGY SYSTEMS.** Significant steps have been taken in improving energy performance and achieving nZEB building standards by 2030. Current projects for energy efficiency are regulated by the clear EU directives that all new buildings constructed within the EU must be nearly zero-energy buildings and all funding guidelines impose this condition. One project for nZEB buildings is under implementation.

**BUILT ENVIRONMENT.** Since 2016, City Hall of District 2 has taken important steps to rehabilitate public and residential buildings. By 2023, 1268 (out of 2560) apartment buildings and all the schools

(83) have been thermally refurbished or are in progress from local funds. The aim is to reduce energy consumption by renovating them, introducing alternative energy sources as well as increasing efficiency and optimising the heating system. The plan for 2030 is to move beyond the classical rehabilitation and focus on integrated urban regeneration interventions that include green energy generation (solar panels, green roofs).

**MOBILITY &amp; TRANSPORT.** The most important structural project is the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, for which a tender will be organised. At the same time, the Bucharest Velo Masterplan is under public consultation, but it needs to be linked to the PMUD, so its implementation depends on the update of the former. The renewal of the car fleet is already being considered. To this end, 51 new trams have already been received from Astra, and procurement is under way for 130 new trolleybuses and 100 electric buses to arrive in winter. A further 22 additional trolleybuses, other trams, including electric minibuses for the metropolitan area are in the process of being purchased. Other changes needed and under implementation concern the infrastructure needed for public transport. In this respect, there are still more than 50 km of tram tracks to be rehabilitated in the city, to allow for the introduction of new trams, but also to improve the quality of public transport and increase the average travel speed (under implementation). Dedicated lanes for public transport are being implemented in several areas of the capital. There is already a pilot project in Floreasca, which is operational and has received positive feedback. For public transport, 900 information boards are to be installed in stations to inform passengers about waiting times for public transport. In contrast to 2019, there is already a 30% increase in the number of journeys made by public transport, and with the renewal of the car fleet and the infrastructure changes mentioned above, a further increase in usage is expected. Efforts have been made to enhance walkability through the clearance of 100km of sidewalks from car parking. Two projects target the improvement of pedestrian mobility in the Old City Center and Obor.

**GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE &amp; NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS.** The Sticlăriei Park project is an ecological park and thus dedicated to nature and leisure activities and has been rehabilitated with minimal intervention because it is home to many species of birds and animals with important ecological impact and educational potential. Other projects that have been implemented aim to strengthen the system of green spaces in District 2 and by creating links between existing larger green spaces and include the Shoreline improvement - phase I Fundeni and Dobroesti Lakes (including the island), Shoreline improvement - phase II Tei and Plumbuita Lakes.

To further enhance the action plan, it is crucial to emphasise the engagement with a wide array of stakeholders—residents, businesses, NGOs, academia—to ensure a comprehensive and inclusive approach to environmental sustainability. The plan will also benefit from incorporating digital transformation and smart technologies to improve intervention efficiency, particularly in energy management, transportation, and waste management. Furthermore, acknowledging the plan's positive implications for public health and well-being, enhancing District 2's resilience to climate change, and establishing a robust monitoring and evaluation framework will underscore the holistic and adaptive nature of the district's commitment to climate neutrality. This approach not only aims to mitigate environmental impacts but also to improve the quality of life for all residents, setting a precedent for sustainable urban development in Bucharest and beyond.

# 2 Work Process

This section should list the working steps carried out, for example along the NZC Climate Transition Map, or related steps planned as well as outline timeline and milestones for future iterations for the continuous development of the Action Plan.

## Work Process - combination of text and visual elements

The development of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CNAP) for District 2 of Bucharest has been a multifaceted and collaborative effort, coordinated by the City Hall of District 2. The process was structured to ensure comprehensive stakeholder engagement and participation, aligning with the principles set out in the Net Zero City (NZC) Climate Transition Map. This participatory approach facilitated a deep understanding of local needs and priorities, ensuring that the Action Plan is both ambitious and grounded in the reality of District 2. The participatory process involved citizens,

entrepreneurs, university representatives, public officials, elected officials, NGO leaders and experts in sustainable development.

**Initial assessment and planning** - The City Hall of District 2 embarked on this ambitious journey by first conducting an in-depth assessment of the district's current environmental footprint, leveraging data and insights to pinpoint critical areas for intervention. This foundational step laid the groundwork for the subsequent planning and stakeholder engagement phases. This process included the following activities:

Analysis of the strategies made available by the City Hall District 2 (Report on the state of the environmental factors in 2021 in the Municipality of Bucharest, the Integrated and Sustainable Local Development Strategy of District 2 for the period 2021-2027, the Local Development Strategy of the Marginalised Urban Area of Baicului - Pantelimon - Plumbuita and the Energy Efficiency Improvement Programme - PIEE);
Mapping private stakeholders with operating in the five areas mandated by the European Commission (buildings, transport, waste management, industrial processes and product use, agriculture, forest and green spaces);
Drafting of the questionnaire and its validation following working meetings with representatives of the District 2 of Bucharest;
Identification of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by area at the level of District 2 and source of energy (fossil, gas, energy renewable, nuclear).

The consultations were separated into two phases. Phase 1 included an online survey addressed to the citizens of Bucharest. Phase 2 included live consultations with stakeholders invited at the City Hall.

**Stakeholder engagement - Phase 1: Online consultation**

The first phase of the public consultation aimed to involve the residents of Bucharest, with a focus on those directly affected by the Climate City Contract, and living in District 2 of Bucharest. This was done by means of an online questionnaire, developed on the Typeforms platform. The questionnaire had two main objectives. The first was to assess the level of awareness of citizens in the district and the rest of the city about the objectives of the climate transition and the approach of the District 2 administration, while raising awareness of this approach. The second was to identify the priorities of the citizens of District 2 and the city in terms of the transition to a district and city with a low carbon footprint and to evaluate a set of measures with a direct impact on the carbon footprint of the sector, on the five dimensions relevant to the contract. The questionnaire was disseminated both on Urbanize Hub's and District 2 City Hall's own online channels and widely, also online, through a paid advertising campaign. Thus, regardless of the number of responses received to the questionnaire, a relevant indicator of the achievement of the first objective is the number of views of the questionnaire and the number of people who clicked and opened the form, even if they did not complete it. Thus, more than 2000 people opened the questionnaire, and 1013 started to complete it, 613 partially completed it.

A total of 593 people responded, most of them living, as can be seen in the graph below, in District 2. Interest from the target public who do not live in the sector was fairly low, with respondents being split relatively evenly between the other districts. The majority of respondents fall in the 31-40 age group (40%), with the second largest age group being 41-50. In terms of gender, however the sample was perfectly balanced. More than two-thirds of respondents are employees with higher education (67%), followed by business managers (18%). Pensioners, employees with secondary education, pupils, students and the household/unemployed category together account for only 14% of the entire sample. In terms of education, there is an over-representation of residents with higher education, both undergraduate (38%) and especially postgraduate (52%). Only 11% of respondents have a high school education or less. Given the complexity of the issues addressed, this suggests that the majority of respondents understand both the questions and the wider context in which this public consultation process took place.

Location of questionnaire respondents

According to citizens, the priority sector that needs to be addressed to turn the capital into a green, zero-carbon city is waste and wastewater management, with a score of 9.23 out of 10. In second place are green spaces and agriculture, almost on a par with transport and urban mobility (9.14 and 9.13 respectively). Industrial processes received the lowest score (8.31), followed by built environment (8.39). The City Hall is committed to continue investments in retrofitting residential and public buildings while in order to change people's habits, information and empowerment campaigns are needed to encourage citizens to make their own contribution to retrofitting buildings and reducing the carbon footprint of individual households.  $82\%$  of survey respondents are willing to change their behaviour to have a lower impact on the environment, and half of them want to actively participate in public consultations.  $40\%$  even declared their willingness to participate in volunteer activities, and a third of respondents are even willing to propose concrete solutions for green projects to be implemented in their communities.

The second phase of the public consultation for the completion of the CCC aimed to interact with a different category of stakeholders, representing institutions and organisations from the private sector, the non-profit sector and academia. A survey has been developed, with a structure that closely follows the survey for citizens, which was distributed to hundreds of relevant companies in Bucharest, from all the targeted domains of intervention. In parallel, the survey was published online, both on the media channels of the City Hall of District 2 and UrbanizeHub, and was also distributed to nongovernmental organisations in Bucharest, including representatives of the business environment and relevant academic entities. The purpose of the survey was to obtain structured and written feedback about the approach of the City Hall of District 2, but also to identify other measures relevant to the transition process to a city with a carbon neutral footprint, decarbonisation projects being implemented by private companies in the city, and possible partners in this endeavour.

The meetings started with a presentation of the approach of the City Hall of District 2 and a presentation of the state of the project so far, including a brief overview of the most important data of the project and the results of the citizens' questionnaire. The purpose of this introductory stage was to align the actors and set a framework for discussion. Each session had a timeframe of two hours and a maximum number of 30 participants.

Each session had three main topics of discussion, adapted to the targeted domain:

# Transport

a. How can we raise awareness and change people's habits?
b. Generate solutions and ideas for public transport
c. Generate solutions and ideas for alternative transport (pedestrians, two wheelers).

# Waste management

a. How can we increase citizens' awareness and change people's habits?
b. Ideas and solutions for waste recovery (circular economy)
c. Ideas and solutions for reducing waste from production processes

# Green agriculture and urban planning

a. How can we increase citizens' awareness and change people's habits?
b. Generating ideas and solutions for District 2 (urban planning, development and green spaces)
c. Food waste: solutions to address the problem both in retail and at the end consumer level Industry

a. Regulating polluting industries: generating ideas and solutions
b. Creating a circular economy ecosystem
c. Stimulating green industries in District 2 and Bucharest

# Construction

a. How can we increase citizens' awareness and change people's habits?
b. Generating ideas and solutions for District 2
c. Buildings in District 2: 2030. Scenario generation

These were stated at the outset to the participants, as fundamental questions to structure the discussions. However, the structure of the sessions was flexible and indicative, taking into account the composition of each of the groups and the specific skills present in each of the sessions.

Among institutional actors, the top priority sectors are Waste and swage management (9.6) and Transport and urban mobility (9.6). These were followed by Green spaces and agriculture (9.5), industrial processes (9) and Buildings (8.8). In addition, institutional actors were also asked to identify additional benefits for the climate neutrality process of District 2 and they mentioned making public institutions' spending more efficient, but also further steps to digitise the interaction between the administration and citizens in order to reduce trips to government offices and increase trust in the administration. 22 out of 26 declared that the entities they belong to would be willing to get involved directly. Several have already taken steps to reduce their own carbon footprint. From reducing physical paperwork to a minimum and moving meetings online to reducing emissions through building insulation, purchasing hybrid or electric vehicles, selective collection, employee awareness campaigns and reducing food waste, to various programs with greater impact in among the structures in the associative environment.

## Timeline and milestones for future iterations

The CNAP is envisioned as a living document, adaptable to the changing dynamics of urban development, technological advancements, and the global climate landscape. Future iterations will involve regular reassessments and updates, scheduled every two years, to incorporate new data, technological advancements, and feedback from ongoing implementation. This approach ensures that the CNAP remains relevant, effective, and aligned with the evolving needs and aspirations of District 2. Recognising this, the following timeline and milestones have been established for its continuous evolution:

Every two years, the CNAP will undergo a comprehensive review to evaluate progress, integrate new findings, and adjust strategies as necessary. These reassessments will ensure the plan's alignment with the latest scientific research, technological innovations, and community feedback.
An ongoing monitoring mechanism (through the Integrated Climate Neutrality Task Force) will track the implementation of the CNAP's initiatives, allowing for real-time adjustments and the integration of stakeholder feedback. This responsive approach ensures that the plan remains flexible and responsive to emerging challenges and opportunities.
Scheduled rounds of stakeholder engagement will continue to be a cornerstone of the CNAP's evolution. These sessions will serve not only as a check-in on the plan's progress but also as an opportunity to foster deeper community involvement and ownership of the climate neutrality goals.
As new technologies and innovative practices emerge, the CNAP will be updated to incorporate these advancements, ensuring that District 2 remains at the forefront of sustainable urban development.
The first major update to the CNAP, scheduled for 2025, will reflect the initial years of implementation, incorporating lessons learned and setting the stage for the next phase of action towards 2030 and beyond. These CNAP updates will also include new data on emissions (both real-time data and various GHG emissions that have not been yet available to include in this document).

neutrality according to the inventory specifications defined in the Cities Mission's Info Kit for Cities and the process outlined in the Action Plan Guidance and Explanations.

District 2's GHG emissions inventory outlines a detailed account of energy usage and resulted emissions within various sectors. In 2016, District 2's total energy use amounted for substantial figures, with Buildings, IPPU and Transport being the largest contributors. Compared to 2016, there has been an increase in the District's population, however, the public administration has been actively working on minimising residents and administrative carbon footprint through measures that target energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, waste management and behaviour change. All of these are expected to contribute to a reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

was chosen as the base year as no other recent data is available at the moment. The gap also concerns the lack of data availability on various emissions, for this purpose, CO2 emissions being the only ones taken into account. Recognising the critical need for updated and ongoing data collection to accurately monitor progress and adjust strategies towards climate neutrality, District 2 aims to innovate its approach by engaging in partnerships with academic institutions and capitalising on its involvement with the National Competence Centre. Updated and completed data will be available at the future CNAP iterations (2025).

Program of District 2017-2023, Google environmental insights, the World Bank Curb tool and the Thermos tool were all used to help in estimating the baseline for emissions. After thorough analysis the decision was made to utilize information from the Local Development Strategy of District 2016-2025 but also to focus only on CO2 emissions. The main reason for this decision was that the strategy offered accurate information related to the energy consumption of certain sectors, while the other tools offered estimates from different years, thus making it impossible to correlate information from the strategy with information from the online tools. For example, Google environmental insights offers information from 2018 the earliest and only connected to the transportation sector for the entirety of the city of Bucharest and thus transport information for 2016 or for District 2 cannot be determined using this platform. The base year was set to 2016 as that was the year that information was available in the strategy.

Keep it simple. The main reason why only CO2 emissions are accounted for is to keep calculations as simple as possible, so they can easily be determined in future measurements. Furthermore, by focusing only on energy consumption express in MWh/year and tons CO2/year emissions associated with energy consumption, communication efforts about this initiative would be more accessible and citizens would easily be able to understand the progress of the Action Plan. This plan acknowledges the fact that not all citizens are passionate or experts on climate change issues and aims to make the whole process as easy as possible to digest for both the citizens and stakeholders of District 2 Bucharest

## What are the baseline emission conversion factors?

IPCC emission conversion factors are used to offer an easy conversion method from MWh/year to tons CO2/year. These factors are calculated based on national grid energy sources or the national energy mix.

factors. The emission factors for 2016 estimates were taken from carbonfootprint.com and are emission factors published in 2019, based on 2018 national inventory which is based on 2016 data.

factors. The factors for 2030 were taken from the JRC Scientific Information System and Database Report 2022 which has updated data from the same national inventories and also estimates emission factors for 2030 based on information about national energy projects that are underway. Both 2016 and 2030 factors are IPCC compliant.

## Building sector baseline emissions – data gathered from LDS 2016-2025

The Local Development Strategy for District 2 2016-2025 provides information about District 2 population in 2016 (page 36) and the electrical energy consumption per citizen (2,395 kWh/year – page 139). With a total population of 372,913 in 2016 the total energy consumption for the building sector was calculated at around 893,126 MWh/year accounting for approximately 358,144 tons CO2 per year after multiplying with the IPCC conversion factor of 0.401 retrieved from carbonfootprint.com. According to the same strategy, District 2 does not have in its boundaries any energy production facilities, so the emissions were associated with Scope 2 emissions.

Natural gas consumption associated with individual households and tenant associations was estimated at around 84 mil cubic meters of natural gas in 2016 (LDS page 146). In the same time, LDS provides another estimate for heating in District 2 Bucharest at around 580,000 Gcal/year equivalent to approximately 69 mil cubic meters of natural gas. By applying a conversion factor of 9.97 kWh per cubic meter of natural gas to the total of 153 mil cubic meters, it was determined that natural gas accounted for 1,525,410 MWh/year of energy used.

For future calculations, yearly energy electrical energy consumption information for all residential and public buildings will be required as well as yearly quantity of natural gas for all residential and public buildings. This will ensure fast and accurate CO2 emission calculations.

# Waste sector baseline emissions – estimated data from LDS 2016-2025

According to LDS 2016-2025 page 147, the waste company collected and processed around 115,000 tons of municipal waste in 2016. For estimating the energy required to collect and process that amount of waste a series of assumptions were made.

## Collection:

Assuming 1.13 kilometers per liter and 40.23 kilometers per ton for 115,000 tons:

Fuel consumed = (115,000 tons × 40.23 km/ton) / 1.13 km/liter = 4.08 × 10⁶ liters

Energy content of diesel is approximately 35.8 MJ/liter:

Energy for collection = 4.08 × 10⁶ liters × 35.8 MJ/liter ≈ 146 × 10⁶ MJ ≈ 40,555 MWh/year (from diesel)

(1 MJ = 0.000277778 MWh)

## Processing:

Assuming 2.22 MJ per kilogram:

Energy for processing = 115,000 tons × 1,000 kg/ton × 2.22 MJ/kg = 255 × 10⁶ MJ ≈ 111,500 MWh (from electrical energy)

(1 MJ = 0.000277778 MWh)

This indicates an approximate energy requirement of around 152,055 MWh/year. After applying the conversion factors, it can be determined that approximately 55,540 tons CO2/year are generated from waste collection and processing.

Moreover, it is further assumed that energy required for waste collection and waste processing accounts for approximately 5% of total energy requirements for District 2 Bucharest. For future accurate calculations, the waste management company should provide yearly fuel consumption as well as yearly energy consumption in order to calculate emissions.

# Industrial Process and Product Use (IPPU) – Estimated data from LDS 2016-2025

Analysing information related to the economic mix of District 2 Bucharest from the National Institute of Statistics (SDI page 99) it was determined that companies that can be enclosed in the IPPU sector belong to the following classes: F – Construction (7.39%), C – Processing industry (5.53%), I – hotels and restaurants (3%), G – commerce and auto repair (34.78%), meaning out of all the economic mix a total of approximately 51% operate in the IPPU sector. Page 146 of the SDL offers natural gas consumption for non-residential clients in District 2 Bucharest at around 81 mil cubic meters or around 807,750 MWh/year, however the document does not offer electrical energy consumption data for the same clients. This means that the IPPU sector will need approximately 411,953 MWh/year of energy from natural gas. Although the document does not offer any estimates for non-residential electrical energy consumers, by analysing similar Climate Neutrality Action Plans, it is estimated that electrical energy consumption accounts for around 55% of the total IPPU sector at approximately 503,498 MWh/year. All in all, this results in a total of 915,451 MWh/year of energy required which generates around 285,117 tons CO2/year.

# Transport – Estimated data from EEP 2017-2023

The Local Development Strategy SLD does not offer any traffic-related information for District 2, except a traffic estimate for the E85 street at around 45,000 cars daily. In order to calculate the Transport baseline information for District 2 Bucharest, information from the Energy Efficiency Program of District 2 2017-2023 was used (page 69). The methodology presented in this plan considers information from 2016 and the calculations are made by extrapolating data from the Energy Efficiency Plan for Sector 5 (page 22) and adapting it to the population for District 2.

According to the National Statistical Institute and their population study for all the Sectors in Bucharest as of 1 January 2017 (page 1), the report between the population of Sector 5 and the population for District 2 is approximately 298,929 / 374,754 = 0.79. This implies that energy consumption related to transportation could be estimated to be 21% higher in District 2 compared to Sector 5. By applying this estimation method, we can determine the following estimated information for District 2 Bucharest: The sectorial transportation parc accounts for approx. 99 MWh from gasoline, public transport requires approximately 17,085 MWh electrical energy and 44,189 MWh energy from diesel, while commercial and public transport requires approximately 355,244 MWh energy from diesel and 257,043 MWh energy from gasoline. This would estimate the total transport sector energy requirement for District 2 at approximately 673,660 MWh/year generating around 177,528 tons CO2/year.

# AFOLU – Estimated data

The agricultural sector is not visible present in District 2 Bucharest, however, the total energy requirements for this sector was set to 1%. Similar to Cluj-Napoca that has an approved public Action Plan, electrical energy requirements were set at 60% and diesel requirements at 40%, leading to a total of 45,546 MWh/year of energy required and 15,823 tons CO2/year. For future iterations of this action plan, energy requirements for public lighting as well as from the City Hall Green Space Office should be taken into consideration.

# What will be done in the future to ensure better data collection?

Create a local coalition. In order to ensure better data collection over the implementation period, a working coalition comprised of experts from the City Hall and from local stakeholders will be created. This group will be responsible for requesting data from service suppliers and informing the public and local stakeholders about the progress made. For example, the local coalition will be responsible to ask the local waste operator for the total energy consumption (electrical energy and fuel) and insert that information into a dashboard (developed for this project) in order to see the latest measurements and inform the public and the local stakeholders. The establishment of this coalition is the responsibility of the City Hall through the Climate Neutrality Task Force.

Measure annually. By measuring energy usage in District 2 on an annual basis, the stakeholders involved in this initiative will be able to accurately see the impact of the proposed actions. The City Hall will have a dedicated platform where yearly measurements as well as proposed projects and their implementation status will be visible, thus ensuring full transparency and contributing even more to engaging the citizens. Besides improvements in CO2 levels, these yearly measurements will also show in real time (yearly) the change in District 2's energy profile. Another benefit of measuring annually is that local service providers will be able to see their own setbacks and enroll on the vision to minimize energy consumption and reduce CO2 emissions.

Collect energy requirements for each sector. At set times intervals energy requirements would be collected and CO2 emissions will be calculated using the same methodology to be able to determine progress.

Buildings: the buildings sector would include all public buildings and all private and residential buildings (buildings that are not used for any economic activity) in District 2 Bucharest. Annual

electrical energy consumption expressed in MWh should be asked from energy distributors for all public and private (residential buildings). Annual gas consumption expressed in MWh/year will be asked for the same category of buildings. Annual thermal energy requirements in Giga calories would be asked for the same types of buildings, the main fuel for energy and after that converted into MWh/year. Energy should be multiplied with the conversion factors to determine the yearly tons CO2 emissions.

IPPU: to determine energy requirements for the IPPU sector, electrical energy consumption for all commercial buildings in District 2 Bucharest will be asked for. For the same types of buildings, gas as well as thermal energy consumption should be asked for from energy distributors. This will ensure a known energy requirement for all the economic mix. Information from the National Institute of Statistics will provide the percentage of companies that are included in the IPPU Sector: F – Construction, C – Processing industry, I – Hotels and restaurants, G – commerce and auto repair. This percentage will be multiplied with the total energy consumption to determine the IPPU energy requirements and ultimately the CO2 emissions.
Waste: Electrical energy consumption as well as diesel consumption expressed in MWh/year will be asked from the waste company and CO2 emissions will be determined. In case this information is not available, the same estimation method would be used to estimate energy requirements using the quantity of waste collected.
Transport: For the transport sector, the same methodology used to calculate energy requirements for Sector 5 Bucharest will be adapted and used to calculate energy requirements for District 2 Bucharest. Information related to the number of registered cars and fuels can be collected from the City Hall Tax office, and information related to the number of trips can be extrapolated from Google Environmental insights considering the population number.
AFOLU: Generally, the AFOLU sector is not present in District 2 Bucharest, however information related to the total energy consumption (diesel and electricity) for hectare for green public can be obtained.

Local strategic documents - These include plans for energy efficiency, sustainable urban mobility, and air quality improvement and lay the groundwork for a comprehensive approach to tackling climate change at the local level (SDLID 2021-2027; PIEE).
Projects and programs - Initiatives both from the municipality and local ecosystem, such as urban regeneration projects, energy efficiency programs and sustainable mobility solutions, are actively pursued. These projects aim to modernise infrastructure, enhance public spaces, and promote environmentally friendly transport options.
Public measures - The local government is offering fiscal incentives to residents for energy-efficient home renovations.
Private measures - Initiatives and campaigns financed by businesses in the area focus on promoting green mobility, emission reduction and waste collection.

## Local policies, strategies, regulations

At the level of the municipality of Bucharest there are several integrated and sectoral strategies developed, or in progress, whose validity extends beyond 2021, of which the most important were taken into account in the process of formulating objectives and related directions of this action plan.

Integrated and Sustainable Local Development Strategy for District 2 2021-2027 (ISLDS) is a reference document that sets out clear objectives for the future of District 2 and its citizens, designed to meet the needs of local authority and community representatives, with the aim of improving the quality of life of citizens and the prosperity of the local economic environment. It includes an extensive list of interventions at district level. One of its missions targets improving the environmental conditions and District 2 transition to climate neutrality. In 2030 District 2 is moving towards climate neutrality by betting on green energy, blue-green infrastructure, waste management or sustainable urban mobility. Thus, the NetZero Action Plan for 2030 is connected with the objectives of ISLDS:

SO1 - A citizens' district with an attractive urban setting and modern, efficient public services that support local community development and ensure a high quality of housing

Revitalised urban environment with an increased quality of the built heritage of community interest and a representative urban identity
Regenerated collective housing neighbourhoods with a high quality of public space, adapted to the requirements and needs of residents

SO3 - Climate-neutral District with efficient and modern infrastructure

Clean, safe district with low greenhouse gas emissions due to efficient energy system
Strengthened, extended and enhanced blue-green network
Modern environmental infrastructure
Transport system oriented around non-motorised travel and public transport

Therefore, the objective takes into account the development possibilities of District 2 in the areas of:

Energy (transition to a low greenhouse gas emission energy system) - This covers both measures that are the direct responsibility of the City Hall of District 2 (energy efficiency of public buildings under its administration and of housing blocks in the district, use of renewable energy in public buildings) and measures that can be influenced by the local public administration through appropriate policies (promotion of the use of renewable energy in collective housing). In other cases (consolidation of buildings, modernisation of energy infrastructure - electricity distribution, public lighting, main and secondary heating networks), the City Hall of District 2 can support the urban actors directly responsible (Municipality of Bucharest, public utility providers, private owners) by facilitating discussions, providing the necessary data or endorsing investment projects quickly. This aligns with the objective to increase the percentage of thermally rehabilitated collective housing from 40% to 80%, showcasing a commitment to enhancing energy efficiency in residential buildings. Additionally, the target of commencing energy efficiency projects in 109 public buildings, along with the consolidation of 8 public buildings, points to significant investments in upgrading public infrastructure for better energy performance and safety.

Green and blue infrastructure (expansion of green areas and increasing the quality of existing green spaces) - The specific objective is to exploit the distinctive competence

represented by the lakes and the green spaces adjacent to them (including the Saulei Valley) and to create secondary green axes linking the main public green spaces in the district (Parc Verdi - Parc Circului, Parc Sticlăriei - National Park). The City Hall of District 2 will be responsible for regulating and developing the green spaces in the lakes area, for rehabilitating the major green spaces under the management of District 2 Public Administration and for creating new green spaces. The expansion of lakeshore development from 1 to 11 km highlights an effort to enhance natural and recreational spaces. The introduction of 5 new development projects for lake shores underlines a focus on sustainable urban planning and aesthetic enhancement of these areas. Moreover, the plan to increase green axes from 7 to 35 km and raise the per capita public green space to 15 square meters per inhabitant signifies a commitment to boosting urban greenery and biodiversity, enhancing the overall quality of life in the district.

Environmental infrastructure (modernisation of water supply and sewerage networks, development of the circular economy through an efficient waste management system) - It can be achieved through two lines of action. In the case of the first, the modernisation of the water supply and sewerage infrastructure is the responsibility of the concessionaire of the water supply and sewerage service in Bucharest, namely Apa Nova SA. This concerns in particular the replacement of cast iron and ductile iron water networks, mainly located in the central area and in the Tei and Floreasca districts, and the replacement of sewerage networks over 50 years old. The second line of action, under the direct responsibility of the City Hall of District 2, is the implementation of an efficient and intelligent waste management system that will allow to reach the targets for recycling and recovery of the different categories of waste. Reducing the length of streets without water and sewage networks from 9.1 km to zero reflects a move towards providing essential services and improving sanitation and living conditions. A significant goal to increase the waste recycling rate from a mere 0.39% to 50% by 2027 indicates a major push towards effective waste management and recycling, aligning with broader environmental sustainability goals.

Transport system in the form of a transition to clean or low-emission means of transport - The objective is to reconfigure and optimise the current transport system with a focus on fairness in terms of how urban space is distributed between the different traffic participants. This includes projects to reconfigure the main transport arteries to integrate dedicated lanes for public transport, cycle lanes, safe and generous pavements and vegetation lining. The aim is to make public transport, cycling and walking as attractive as possible. The objective also addresses the parking component by focusing on more efficient management of the existing parking stock and reducing the footprint of car parks in order to free up important land for the community. The plan to add new connections over the lakes, including at least one for vehicular traffic, aims to improve connectivity and reduce congestion. The substantial expansion of the cycling network for both daily commutes and leisure activities, along with the introduction of secure bicycle garages and a municipal bike-sharing system, reflects a strong commitment to promoting sustainable mobility. The focus on enhancing pedestrian facilities and prioritising public transport lanes demonstrates a shift towards reducing car dependency. The modernisation of tram lines and the expansion of the metro network are crucial for improving public transport efficiency, further supporting the district's move towards sustainable, low-emission urban transport.

Thus, more than 90% of collective housing will be thermally rehabilitated and a considerable proportion also includes advanced facilities such as green terraces or facades, solar panels, water catchment areas or heat pumps to reduce energy consumption and even contribute to energy production. The salt lakes, the main element of the district's blue-green network, are the most important recreational destination in Bucharest and contribute, together with the secondary green axes, to reducing the urban heat island and increasing the water absorption in the district. Regenerated housing neighbourhoods will offer a high standard of quality of life, with a housing stock

modernised in line with current energy efficiency requirements and modern trends in architectural aesthetics; neighbourhoods benefit from coherently prioritised and landscaped public spaces and green spaces that host dedicated local community activities and support active urban living. Furthermore, District 2 will benefit from an efficient, balanced and equitable transport system for all traffic participants so that more than 75% of journeys will be made by non-motorised or public transport. The public transportation network will be complemented by a utilitarian cycling network and complementary facilities (secure parking, bike-sharing system) that provide connections between the main areas of interest. The district will also develop a comprehensive infrastructure of dedicated electric car charging stations, which contributes to the adoption of this sustainable and environmentally friendly mode of transport.

Energy Efficiency Improvement Program (PIEE) includes measures to be implemented for energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction throughout the territory concerned, aiming at increasing the energy efficiency of public buildings through the rational use of energy and possibly the production of energy from renewable sources. The investment priorities are public buildings, residential buildings, energy management, public lighting and public transport. The series of short-term projects include the energy efficiency of schools, high schools, buildings where different departments of the public administration are based and residential buildings. In the medium term, in addition to energy efficiency, the modernisation of the lighting systems with photovoltaic and LED panels for both the buildings managed by the City Hall and for the parks, the creation of a thermo-solar panel system for heating drinking water for public buildings and of living space and the creation of an incinerator group with electricity production for heat recovery and domestic hot water production.

The INTEGRATED URBAN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF BUCHAREST 2021 - 2030 is the main strategic document that proposes a vision and directions for action on the development of the municipality of Bucharest in an inclusive, strategic, sustainable and long-term way. The strategy proposes a series of 5 strategic and specific objectives, as well as a transversal objective relevant for the development of District 2:

The strategic objectives for District 2 are ambitious and forward-thinking, yet there are inherent barriers and challenges to their implementation. These challenges are multidimensional, encompassing financial, behavioural, and systemic aspects.

**INFRASTRUCTURE.** In District 2, Bucharest, challenges in achieving climate neutrality by 2030 include a need for significant improvements in the energy efficiency of residential buildings. Furthermore, there is room for improvement in the transport and waste sectors, including insufficient charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, limited cycling facilities and inadequate waste collection systems for recycling. 56% of total CO2 emissions are generated by Buildings, 24% by IPPU and 15% by transportation. Buildings, especially residential ones, are the largest CO2 emitters, with the district struggling to reduce energy consumption despite the growth in housing units. The shift towards individual gas heating systems from central heating has further exacerbated emissions. The electrical infrastructure is outdated, with all 38 power points and 90% of the 825 transformer substations showing advanced physical and moral wear, lacking any electricity generation sources over 1 MW within the district. Road traffic contributes to more than 60% of Bucharest's air pollution. District 2 faces severe congestion issues, especially from commuter flows from areas like Voluntari, Dobroesti, and Pantelimon, with a motorisation rate of 713 cars per 1,000 inhabitants. The area's public transport is deemed generally good, but with weaknesses in certain parts of the district. The underground network is limited, serving only the southern and western extremities with just 5 metro stations, failing to cover densely populated neighborhoods. The district lacks sufficient cycling lanes and pedestrian paths, with the only standard-compliant cycle lane being on Fabrica de Glucoză Street. The district has 444 hectares of green spaces, which is about 14% of its total area, translating to 12.43 sq.m of green space per capita. These figures are the lowest among Bucharest's districts. Moreover, there's a noted lack of medium-sized green spaces in central areas and an urban planning trend that prioritises parking spaces over communal green areas, requiring significant urban regeneration efforts. The recycling rate in District 2 is low at 1%, with the sorting station on Gherghitei Street operating at 27% efficiency (2020).

**CAPACITIES:** One of the primary challenges in District 2 is building the capacity for climate action among individuals and entities. There is a need to create a common understanding and vision for climate neutrality, as well as to address behaviours that hinder progress, such as high car ownership and short-distance car usage. Enhancing the district's ability to mobilise local efforts towards climate neutrality, particularly at the individual and organisational levels, is crucial. Despite the relatively high levels of climate knowledge among residents and institutional actors (as confirmed by the questionnaire and public consultations), there is a need for ongoing education and awareness campaigns to ensure a more comprehensive understanding of climate issues and solutions. These could lead to changes in residents behaviour, particularly in relation to transport habits. The district's strategy includes a shift towards non-motorised and public transportation, which requires residents to alter deeply ingrained habits of car dependency. This is compounded by a rising trend in car ownership, partly due to the influx of affordable, but often less environmentally friendly, second-hand cars from other EU countries. Furthermore, while there is evident interest in climate initiatives, fostering active engagement and community participation remains a challenge. Strengthening the capacity to involve residents in climate-related activities and decision-making processes is essential. Accelerating the energy efficiency renovation of the housing stock is crucial. However, this is impeded by the limited engagement of homeowners' associations and the need for more effective models to encourage private investment in such renovations. The district faces the challenge of shifting from heavily relying on natural gas to more sustainable energy sources, which requires not only infrastructure changes but also a transformation in residents' energy consumption behaviours.

**PROCESSES:** District 2 faces challenges in urban planning and development processes. Although urban planning documents are up-to-date, they do not consistently prioritise climate neutrality, leading to predominantly carbon-intensive interventions. Regulatory barriers include bureaucratic hurdles related to expropriation, unclear micro-mobility legislation, and inefficient public procurement practices. Uncontrolled urban sprawl, especially in suburban areas, poses a threat to climate goals. Local policies and policy tools also need to be more strongly based on scientific evidence, and there is a need to foster a collective mentality at the neighbourhood level. Certain aspects crucial for the district's transition towards climate neutrality fall outside its direct regulatory control. This includes areas such as waste management and water treatment, which require collaboration with municipal-

level and national-level authorities. The successful implementation of plans like the waste management strategy, which is essential for achieving the recycling targets, hinges on effective coordination with these broader governmental structures.

**RESOURCE FLOWS:** While some urban renewal initiatives have been successful, they face implementation limitations. High project costs, limited EU funding, inflation, and public opposition to projects that limit car transit are significant challenges. The availability and capacity of private contractors are further hindered by labor shortages and unethical practices in the construction industry. Thus, developing financial mechanisms to support these costs is necessary.

**ALLIANCES:** District 2 lacks well-organised and structured community-level bodies, structures, and processes that can bridge the gap between the public administration, citizens, and urban and peri-urban environments. To address this deficit, the establishment of mechanisms for improved dialogue and collaboration among various stakeholders is essential. Building a local coalition of leaders from the public sector, academia, business, civil society, and the non-governmental sector can play a vital role in advancing the district's climate transition.

**FUNDS:** The funding barriers in District 2 related to achieving climate neutrality are substantial. Limitations in the local budget necessitate a heavy reliance on external funding sources. Challenges include the lack of dedicated funding, high upfront costs for climate interventions, uncertainties related to revenue streams, and competing priorities. Attracting private investors to climate neutrality projects is also challenging due to perceived lack of profitability, uncertainties, regulatory barriers, and limited awareness of climate neutrality benefits.

One of the primary challenges faced by District 2 in its journey towards climate neutrality is the **scarcity of dedicated funding sources**. Climate initiatives often require substantial financial resources for infrastructure upgrades, renewable energy adoption, expansion of green spaces, modernisation of the public transport system and carbon reduction projects. However, the local budget is limited and may need to allocate resources to various priorities, making it challenging to invest in long-term, low-carbon projects. The public administration needs assistance in identifying and accessing dedicated funding streams for climate actions. This includes exploring opportunities at regional, national, and international levels, as well as seeking innovative financing mechanisms, grants, and partnerships with financial institutions and green investment funds. Exploring innovative financing models, such as public-private partnerships, and tapping into national and European Union funding programs will be pivotal.
Many climate neutrality interventions involve **significant upfront investments**. Initiatives such as building retrofits, public transportation infrastructure expansion, and renewable energy projects often require substantial financial commitments. These high initial costs can be a major barrier, especially when trying to convince stakeholders of the long-term benefits. District 2 requires assistance in developing financial mechanisms to alleviate the burden of high upfront costs. This includes exploring public-private partnerships (PPPs), green bonds, revolving funds, or other financial instruments that can help spread the costs over time and attract private investment.
Some climate actions may be subject to **market fluctuations and uncertainties**, making it challenging to project future revenue streams. This is particularly relevant given the dynamic nature of renewable energy markets and carbon trading. Uncertainty can deter investors and hinder the implementation of climate initiatives.
Climate action **may not always be perceived as a top priority**, especially among residents facing economic challenges. It's essential to address this barrier, as some residents might oppose investments in climate projects that they don't perceive as directly benefiting their daily lives.
Encouraging private investors to engage in climate neutrality projects in the local industry can be challenging. Several factors contribute to this **reluctance**, including concerns about profitability, uncertainty, regulatory barriers, and a lack of knowledge and awareness about climate opportunities.

**ASSISTANCE NEEDS:** District 2, Bucharest, requires assistance in building knowledge and fostering practices necessary for accelerating the transition to climate neutrality. There is also a need for support in optimising processes to achieve local climate-neutrality objectives. The local administration requires assistance in developing strategies to attract private investment in climate projects. This includes offering incentives, simplifying regulatory processes, providing education and information to potential investors, and showcasing successful case studies to demonstrate the viability of such

investments. Addressing barriers, enhancing capacity, and fostering collaborations among stakeholders are critical assistance needs to navigate the path to climate neutrality by 2030.

# OPPORTUNITIES

Despite the challenges, District 2 has opportunities to leverage its strengths. The district could benefit from its vibrant community and the potential for civic engagement in sustainability initiatives. Collaborative efforts with educational institutions and local businesses can foster innovation and community-driven solutions. Furthermore, the district's plan to enhance its green and blue infrastructure, coupled with its focus on modernising environmental and transport infrastructure, lays a solid foundation for a sustainable and climate-resilient future.

For District 2, Bucharest, the journey towards climate neutrality and smart urban development is paved with a series of strategic opportunities across various sectors, leveraging existing infrastructure, enhancing capacities, refining processes, optimising resource flows, forging strong alliances, and securing necessary funding. This approach is not only about addressing the environmental challenges but also about enhancing the quality of life for its residents, fostering economic growth, and creating a sustainable urban ecosystem.

The district exhibits a rich mosaic of land uses, including residential, commercial, and industrial areas. This diversity presents opportunities for reimagining urban spaces with a focus on green infrastructure. By strategically integrating green corridors and enhancing urban biodiversity, District 2 can not only beautify its landscape but also positively impact the local microclimate and air quality. Moreover, the district's layout is conducive to sustainable land use changes and densification efforts, which can further the goals of climate neutrality.

INFRASTRUCTURE: District 2 plans to capitalise on the momentum of ongoing infrastructure improvements. This includes the modernisation of the electricity and district heating networks, and the expansion of green spaces. Leveraging non-reimbursable funds for transport, energy, and housing infrastructure will be crucial. The district aims to utilise existing projects as a springboard for further development, particularly in enhancing energy efficiency in residential and public buildings. Given the low waste recycling rate and underutilised waste sorting facilities, District 2 sees an opportunity in developing a more effective waste management system. This includes the implementation of a comprehensive selective waste collection system, particularly in collective housing areas, and the modernisation of water and sewerage networks. The district acknowledges the challenges in its centralised heat supply system and lack of significant local electricity generation. Addressing the increasing trend in annual temperatures and tropical days is crucial. The district will focus on expanding green spaces and enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings to mitigate the urban heat island effect and reduce energy consumption. With the lowest per capita green space in Bucharest, District 2 recognises the need to expand and maintain green areas. Creating green-blue infrastructure along lakesides and expanding public green spaces are key interventions. This approach not only enhances the district's aesthetic and recreational value but also plays a vital role in improving the microclimate and air quality.

CAPACITIES: District 2 can leverage its proximity to educational and research institutions to foster climate change studies and innovation in sustainable technologies. This can be coupled with community education programs to raise awareness about climate change. Training and capacity-building initiatives for local businesses and residents will be essential in encouraging the adoption of climate neutral practices and technologies.

PROCESSES: Implementing comprehensive waste management systems that focus on recycling, composting, and converting waste to energy can have a transformative impact. Water management also presents an opportunity, with strategies that might include rainwater harvesting, efficient usage, and the treatment and reuse of wastewater.

RESOURCE FLOWS: Encouraging local production and consumption reduces transportation emissions and boosts the local economy. Adopting circular economy principles can optimize resource use and minimize waste, aligning economic activities with environmental sustainability.

ALLIANCES: Forming strategic alliances with local businesses, non-governmental organisations, and community groups is key to driving climate neutrality initiatives. Collaborative efforts with other districts, municipalities, and regions to share resources, best practices, and jointly address environmental challenges can amplify the impact of District 2's initiatives.

FUNDS: Tapping into national and European funding for urban development projects focused on sustainability is a significant opportunity. Exploring public-private partnerships can bring additional investments in green infrastructure and innovative technologies.

As District 2 embarks on its journey towards climate neutrality and sustainable urban development, the district administration recognises the value of collaborative efforts and knowledge exchange at a national level. Engaging in dialogues with other Romanian cities that are part of The Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities, such as Cluj-Napoca, Suceava, and other cities actively working on climate neutrality strategies, is a key approach. This includes organising events and meetings for knowledge sharing and discussing best practices in climate neutrality.

The Building Capacity in Governing Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities initiative, part of a broader collaborative accord between Romanian and Norwegian Governments, currently under negotiations, will allow Romanian cities that have joined the 100 Climate Neutral Cities to learn and share best practices with the Norwegian counterparts. Through EAA and Norway Grants funding, the project proposes a comprehensive framework to enhance the administrative and operational capacities crucial for climate neutrality. District 2 will develop a partnership with Trodheim, which will enable District 2 to benefit from Trondheim's experience and expertise in sustainable urban development. This involves an integrated approach across various activities, including:

Developing an action plan to increase sustainable innovation capacity within Bucharest District 2's administration.
Establishing an Urban Lab for Green Cities to encourage the development of climate-neutral and smart city solutions through a competition and incubation process.
Implementing a program to increase administrative capacity for climate-neutral urban governance through a series of workshops.
Creating a Policy Lab for the development of local public policies that support climate neutrality.
Developing a Net-Zero monitoring toolkit and dashboard for assessing and tracking the city's climate neutrality efforts.
Organising study visits and knowledge transfer events, including participation in conferences and a closing event in Trodheim, to learn from best practices and innovative approaches to climate-neutral solutions.
Launching a communication and awareness campaign to promote the importance of climate-neutral cities, involving a series of podcasts, online campaigns, and a Climate-neutrality Urban Fest.

Learning from Trodheim's approach to funding, partnership ecosystems, and participatory budgeting will also aid District 2 in mobilising and managing resources more efficiently. By engaging citizens, community groups, and businesses in developing locally implemented solutions, District 2 can enhance its resource flows for climate neutrality through social innovation and entrepreneurial education. The incubation process for winning solutions from the Urban Lab for Green Cities, coupled with the program to increase administrative capacity for climate-neutral urban governance, prepares District 2 to manage and scale successful initiatives. This approach ensures that investments in capacity building have a lasting impact, contributing to the systemic change needed for a transition to climate neutrality.

In addition, the M100, a mirror group of the mission 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030, will facilitate the exchanges between the Romanian authorities and other public authorities in Europe for the planning and establishment of measures to support the Romanian cities selected in the Mission, bringing together the candidate cities, with the ambition to reach all the cities in Romania that are fighting to achieve the goals of neutrality climate by 2030 and 2050. M100 will organise thematic working meetings between the central government, local public authorities and regional development agencies, facilitating the dialogue and exchange of experience with the other Mission hubs in Europe and seeking to create a space where relevant stakeholders work together to identify solutions. District 2 is a direct beneficiary of this initiative.

Involving national agencies and relevant stakeholders in the initiatives organised by District 2's Local Climate Coalition will also be crucial. This approach aims to strengthen dialogue and collaboration between local and national authorities, ensuring that the local efforts align with and contribute to national climate goals.

Key strategic measures at the local level will include:

|  WASTE & CIRCULAR ECONOMY | - From a structural point of view, it was pointed out that there is a fractured governance of waste management at the city level, with no unitary approach at the municipal level even in terms of the number of fractions.
The existing infrastructure is neither sufficient nor in a good enough condition.
Preconception that a separate collection is useless, since they all end up in the same place and citizens are not familiar with the route of the waste and the sorting procedures. | - Aim for a city with zero waste, so that nothing that is thrown away ends up in landfills. To be able to get there, not only standards are needed, but also measurement and auditing processes.
Insist, beyond recycling, on reduction and repair, but also on the refusal of some products from the shelf, in order to put pressure on the producers as well. In this sense, encouraging more buy-back schemes in stores is necessary.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE & NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS | - Lack of local alliances
Insufficient data-driven insights
The overarching cost of new infrastructure surpasses the local budgeting capacity, posing a significant financial challenge.
Cumbersome bureaucracy associated with spending on climate neutrality projects can impede efficient implementation.
Poor regulations and standards at the central level regarding climate neutrality in key areas create obstacles to effective implementation.
The existence of a substantial built heritage related to industrial activities, abandoned or not in use | - The large number of local NGOs active in environmental matters provides an opportunity for collaborative efforts and diverse perspectives.
The residents' increased interest in healthy and active habits creates a favourable environment for promoting sustainable initiatives.
Collaboration with universities.  |
|  BUILT ENVIRONMENT | - The majority of the built environment consists of pre-regulation constructions, making retrofitting for energy efficiency challenging and contributing to high energy consumption.
The upfront cost of implementing energy-efficient technologies is prohibitive for building owners, deterring investment despite long-term savings.
Local regulations and incentives are not stringent enough to encourage widespread energy-efficient practices.
Lack of data on energy poverty
The behaviour of building occupants, such as inefficient use of heating and cooling systems, acts as a barrier to achieving climate neutrality. | - Information campaign among citizens was considered necessary, in order to increase responsibility towards the need to reduce energy consumption.
The need to adapt the requirements related to constructions to the present by introducing circularity in the specifications of public tenders. A plethora of options in terms of innovative energy-efficient building materials, heating systems, cooling, and lighting systems offers diverse choices.
An energy audit is also needed in the district, which would also highlight aspects of energy poverty, considering that many houses and buildings are still heated with waste and pollute extremely much for this reason.
Transform associations into prosumers, and encourage the installation of photovoltaic panels.
Incorporating green building design principles can reduce energy consumption and improve indoor environmental quality.  |

# MAIN RISKS THAT COULD IMPACT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE CITY'S CLIMATE-NEUTRALITY TARGET BY 2030

Strategic planning &amp; leadership: District 2 faces risks stemming from frequent changes in leadership, budget allocations at the local level, and shifting governmental investment priorities due to changes in leadership. This instability hinders progress, particularly in implementing major transport infrastructure projects. The central authorities' slow pace in executing these projects and their limited focus on metropolitan/urban functional areas add to the challenge.

Regulatory &amp; bureaucratic risks: These include complexities related to resources and bureaucracy associated with expropriation measures for public use, insufficient regulation and standardisation at the central level, and inefficient legislation concerning public procurement. These factors can lead to
PRIMÁRIA
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

project delays, posing a high risk, particularly for initiatives funded by the Recovery and Resilience Plan, with strict deadlines. To mitigate these risks, District 2 has proactively initiated project preparations years in advance, allowing ample time for bureaucratic processes, legal approvals, permits, interoperability and shared standards.

**Organisational capacity**: A key organisational risk is the capacity of the limited public staff to execute numerous interventions, some unprecedented in size and complexity. While the impact of this risk is moderate, given the District's track record of effectively utilising EU funds, the public administration is considering measures to address potential personnel and competence gaps. This includes seeking external expertise, engaging volunteers, and reallocating and training its staff, especially in light of the significant digitalisation of tasks.

**Awareness and engagement**: Without widespread awareness and active engagement in sustainability efforts, behavioural changes at the individual and community levels may be insufficient. Only 33% of the citizens that responded to the questionnaire were aware of the District 2 efforts to become climate neutral by 2030, showing, on the one hand, a low interest in the public policies of local administration, but at the same time the need for a greater openness of the institutions towards citizens. The local administration plans to intensify efforts to engage more stakeholders and citizens in decision-making and co-delivery processes through the Local Climate Coalition and other social and governance initiatives presented in C-1.1 and C-1.2). Communities can be engaged through participatory planning and decision-making processes to foster a sense of ownership and commitment to climate goals.

**Social equity and inclusion**: Energy and transport poverty represent the primary social risks at the local level. The District 2 vision prioritises inclusivity, ensuring that no one is left behind in the city's smart, green and digital transformation. District 2 is dedicated to ensuring that its journey towards climate neutrality is equitable and benefits all members of the community, mainly through inclusive decision-making, community-led initiatives and accessible resources.

**Environmental risks**: Air pollution stands out as the main environmental risk in District 2, Bucharest. The emissions of NO2/NOx and PM10, which are most problematic, can adversely affect the health and well-being of citizens, particularly children and the elderly. The public administration will promote and support the implementation of the Walkable District projects, as well as continue to invest in pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, encouraging people to limit the use of private cars in favour of public transportation, cycling and other forms of alternative mobility.

The transition to a city with a zero carbon footprint is a complex and collaborative endeavour, the responsibility of which is shared between several categories of actors. Regardless of the actions of the public authorities, in order to reach the necessary targets, sustained efforts are also needed on the part of companies, civil society, and citizens, and such a change also requires a minimum alignment of objectives and positions on the part of everyone.

To ensure effective implementation and continuous improvement, District 2 will adopt an adaptive management model. This approach includes regular assessments and adjustments to strategies based on the results and feedback from stakeholders.

District 2 is committed to playing a proactive role in Romania's transition to climate neutrality. By leveraging national collaborations, innovative policy mechanisms, and community engagement, the district aims to not only meet its local sustainability goals but also contribute to the broader national and global efforts against climate change.

## A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

Over the past decade, District 2 has witnessed a remarkable evolution in collaborative approaches, particularly since the emergence of various alliances in the city's development landscape. This Action Plan is a culmination of numerous initiatives undertaken at the local level, encompassing both infrastructure projects and softer interventions. The foundation of this document is deeply rooted in the strategic documents previously developed and implemented at the local and municipal levels.

Numerous projects have been executed in partnership between key local actors, including the City Hall, universities, clusters, private companies, NGOs, and citizens. These projects have primarily been financed through non-reimbursable funds, including those from a wide array of European funding programs such as Horizon (WeGenerate, DivAirCity, ReGreeneration, UrbanWISE,

WASTESHARK Collection and recycling), operational programmes (urban regeneration projects, nature based solutions), National Recovery and Resilience Plan (educational facilities construction or renovation, tramway extension, digitalisation). The evolution of these collaborative projects has traversed three phases: initial consolidation of local actors, sustainable development of partnerships, and, currently, acceleration of sustainable innovation within the local ecosystem. Since joining the mission of the 100 climate-neutral and smart cities in 2022, District 2 has effectively steered local cooperative efforts towards climate neutrality. This endeavour extends beyond the city's journey to encompass all supporting pillars: companies, universities and local NGOs.

The participatory model adopted by District 2 in Bucharest is designed to inclusively tackle the challenge of achieving climate neutrality. This model underscores the importance of collaborative efforts across a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government entities at various levels, the private sector, local citizens, academia and other cities engaged in similar environmental initiatives. The essence of this approach lies in fostering a comprehensive stakeholder ecosystem that encourages active participation, dialogue, and shared responsibility in climate action endeavours.

At the core of this model is the City Hall of District 2, serving as the central coordinating body. The elaboration and implementation of the CNAP is the responsibility of the Climate Neutrality Task Force, established within the City Hall of District 2 in 2022. This task force brings together public servants from various departments of the public administration who are also involved in national and international projects that target sustainability and climate neutrality. Operating directly within the district's administration framework, the task force acts as a central hub for climate-related policies and activities, fostering collaboration among various municipal departments. This Task Force also plays an active role in engaging with stakeholders, facilitating dialogue, collaboration and its organisation in the form of the Local Climate Coalition. This central hub is the driving force behind the establishment of various platforms and forums for stakeholder engagement, such as public consultations, workshops, and the use of digital platforms for broader reach and inclusivity. These mechanisms ensure that the voices of all stakeholders are heard and integrated into the planning and execution of climate action strategies.

Key to the participatory model is the formation of strategic partnerships with the private sector, aimed at harnessing innovation and securing investments in sustainable technologies and practices. Recognising the critical role of businesses in the transition to a greener economy, District 2 explores the idea of engaging them through incentives for green investments and public-private partnerships that facilitate infrastructure development and corporate responsibility projects focused on environmental sustainability and climate change mitigation.

Citizen involvement is another cornerstone of this model, emphasising the empowerment of the community through educational programs, awareness campaigns and participatory planning processes. By engaging citizens directly, the district aims to cultivate a culture of environmental stewardship, encouraging individuals and communities to adopt climate-friendly practices and participate actively in the district's journey towards climate neutrality. Furthermore, incorporating the needs and perspectives of marginalised groups is a fundamental aspect of District 2's participatory model for achieving climate neutrality. The district focuses on tailoring climate resilience and adaptation measures to address the specific vulnerabilities of marginalised communities. This includes ensuring equitable access to green spaces and prioritising outreach and engagement initiatives designed to reach all community segments. The District also ensures that the voices of marginalised communities are represented in decision-making processes, ensuring that policies and initiatives reflect a broad range of experiences and needs.

Furthermore, District 2 is committed to leveraging knowledge exchange and collaborative projects with other cities, both nationally and internationally. This inter-city network fosters a collaborative environment where cities can share experiences, challenges, and best practices in urban sustainability. Such collaborations enrich the district's strategies with global insights and innovative solutions, amplifying the impact of its climate actions. Academic and research institutions play a vital role in this participatory model, providing the scientific foundation for climate action and driving innovation in sustainable urban development. Partnerships with these institutions enable District 2 to base its strategies on evidence-based research, engage the academic community in sustainability projects, and explore cutting-edge technologies and solutions for climate challenges.

# - Part B - Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B represents the core of the Action Plan, shaped by local authorities, local businesses, and stakeholders, comprising of the most essential elements: scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, action portfolios and indicators for monitoring, evaluation, and learning.

# 3.4 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Module B-1 "Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways" should list impact pathways, early and late outcomes and direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits) according to and adapted from the NZC Theory of Change and the AP Guidance – clustered by fields of action.

Bayesian inference was used to calculate energy and CO2 estimates for each action, and as such, each action can be adjusted when more information becomes available. The same approach was used to estimate possible green energy produced as well as a possible increase in electrical energy demand for each action.
The direct impact of each action is CO2 tons/year associated with energy removed and calculated using the 2030 conversion factors (see table A-1.2). The way each action contributes to CO2 reduction for each of the 5 sectors (Buildings, IPPU, Transport, Waste and AFOLU) is described in table A-1.3. The energy details for each individual action can be found in table B-2.2. The tables below present the CO2 emissions reduction from energy removed by each action using 2030 conversion factors
After applying energy reductions associated with each action, and using 2030 conversion factors for each sector, the actions account for a  $80\%$  decrease in CO2 emissions (section A-1.5)
The annexed tables show how each action from the impact pathway (Built environment, Energy systems, Mobility and transport, Green infrastructure and nature based solutions, Waste and circular economy) is integrated in the overall energy reduction calculations for each sector (Buildings, IPPU, AFOLU, Transport, Waste) and how they contribute to an and overall CO2 reduction of  $80\%$  after 2030 energy conversions in table A-1.5

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways– textual and visual elements

Complete list of projects for each early change/action can be found in the Annexes (numbered from 1 to 25 and grouped by fields of action).

**Mobility &amp; Transport** – The proposed interventions aim to create a more sustainable, efficient and accessible mobility system in District 2. The priority sustainable mobility interventions favoured by survey respondents is to expand, optimise and modernise public transport, followed by the implementation of intelligent traffic management systems, encouraging walking and cycling/walking by making transit and walking areas more accessible and increasing the safety of vulnerable users, adopting urban design that encourages the pedestrian rather than the car by creating pedestrian spaces that allow you to get from point A to point B as a pedestrian. Therefore, these proposals are transformed into direct actions that include the expansion of public transport networks, development of extensive cycling and walking infrastructure, and the promotion of electric vehicles and shared mobility solutions. This transformation is not just about improving mobility but also enhancing the quality of urban life. In order to change citizens' habits, it is necessary first of all to offer sufficiently good alternatives in terms of public transport.

**Energy systems** - A pivotal aspect of the action plan is the transformation of District 2's energy systems. This includes the adoption of smart energy management in buildings, increasing the use of renewable energy sources like solar panels, and enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the district. These measures are crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and moving towards a more sustainable energy model. They showcase how public infrastructure can lead by example, promoting sustainability while ensuring public spaces are comfortable, safe, and cost-efficient to maintain. Furthermore, an informed community is more likely to support and participate in sustainability initiatives, driving further innovation and investment in green technologies.

**Built environment** – The focus of these interventions is on renovating public buildings, transforming industrial areas for better use, and redesigning public spaces for sustainability. They pave the way for long-term outcomes where buildings adhere to high energy efficiency standards, underutilised spaces are functional and vibrant, and neighbourhoods are enriched with green spaces. Citizens prioritised the intervention aimed at providing tax breaks for owners who renovate their buildings themselves, while stakeholders consider that implementing building regulations, promoting nZEB standards, encouraging associations to become prosumers and encouraging the installation of photovoltaic panels are key strategies.

**Waste management and circular economy** - In tackling waste management, District 2 is adopting a circular economy approach. Initiatives include advanced recycling facilities, waste-to-energy plants, and support for local businesses in reducing waste generation. These efforts are crucial in minimising the environmental impact of waste and promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns. Regarding the possibility of changing people's behaviour, participants agreed that this is a complex issue that also involves educating them to adopt more environmentally friendly behaviour, reducing waste generation and increasing the percentage of those who recycle, as well as improving collection capacity and infrastructure. At the same time, the need to sanction inadequate waste management behaviours more strongly and consistently by law, both for citizens and companies, was also agreed.

Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions - The action plan also includes significant investments in green infrastructure and nature-based solutions. This includes developing urban green spaces, promoting sustainable building practices, and integrating environmental considerations into urban planning. These steps are essential for creating a resilient urban environment that can withstand the challenges posed by climate change.

Community engagement and participation - Central to District 2's strategy is the active involvement of its citizens. The plan includes measures to empower residents, enhance public awareness of climate issues, and encourage participation in local environmental initiatives. This community-focused approach ensures that the transition to climate neutrality is inclusive and reflective of the residents' needs and aspirations.

For each field of action, interventions will be implemented to support the main pathways that have direct impact on emission reduction. By intertwining these cross-cutting activities with strategies that have a direct impact on emissions, the holistic approach ensures that sustainability efforts are robust, inclusive, and effective. Education and capacity-building efforts ensure that all community members and stakeholders understand the importance of emission reduction and have the knowledge to contribute to these efforts. By involving stakeholders in the policymaking process, cities can ensure that policies are not only ambitious but also practical and aligned with local needs. All those initiatives ensure that technical and infrastructural changes are accepted and embraced by the community, leading to sustainable, long-term reductions in emissions.

District 2's action plan for climate neutrality represents a comprehensive and multi-disciplinary approach to tackling environmental challenges. By addressing key sectors with innovative solutions and prioritising community involvement, District 2 sets a precedent for sustainable urban development and paves the way for a climate neutral future.

B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

0
PRIMÁRIA
Climate Neutrality Action
Plan
C

The total emissions that are not accounted for in this Action Plan is 20% (243,742 CO2 tons/year). The building sector, including residential and commercial properties, remains a significant source of residual emissions. This highlights the need for continued innovation in energy efficiency, the adoption of renewable energy sources, and the retrofitting of existing buildings to meet higher energy standards. Despite efforts to reduce emissions, the reliance on fossil fuels for heating, cooling, and electricity in buildings persists as a challenge. Transport's share of residual emissions underscores the difficulty of completely decarbonizing this sector. While advances in electric vehicle technology and improvements in public transportation can reduce emissions, residual emissions from heavy-duty vehicles as well as outdated personal vehicles remain problematic. Improving and expanding the public transit, and promoting the `15 minute city` concept, can make public transportation more attractive than personal vehicle use. Enhancing cycling and walking infrastructure can encourage non-motorized forms of transportation and on the long term contribute to reducing the residual emissions. Emissions from waste management, including landfill emissions and those from the treatment of wastewater, represent a smaller but persistent challenge. Comprehensive recycling and composting programs can minimise waste generation and reduce landfill emissions. The IPPU sector includes emissions from industries where process emissions and high-temperature requirements complicate decarbonisation efforts. Replacing or retrofitting aging electrical infrastructure could reduce emissions. However, new technologies can drastically reduce energy losses and generate significant reductions in emissions on the long-term. While AFOLU accounts for a small percentage of residual emissions, it highlights the importance of sustainable land management practices and reforestation. Offsetting measures are already included in the current Action Plan, as the proposed interventions include major carbon sink projects.

Integrating the New European Bauhaus values into District 2's journey towards climate neutrality can significantly help in reducing the residual emissions. As it combines design, sustainability, accessibility, affordability, and investment to help deliver the European Green Deal, NEB can provide the guiding principles in District 2 urban development processes.

Incorporating nature-based solutions and capitalising on the existing pathways, District 2 will leverage the restorative power of natural processes and ecosystems to mitigate GHG emissions and improve biodiversity. Planting trees within urban areas (especially on vacant lands or integrating green spaces into residential areas) will significantly absorb CO2 emissions from the atmosphere. Green roofs can contribute to reducing residual emissions by enhancing building insulation, thereby reducing energy demand for heating and cooling. Green corridors that connect parks and other green spaces will provide additional carbon sequestration opportunities.

District 2 Bucharest will also prioritise soft interventions aimed at behaviour change, awareness, governance enhancements, policy development, and stakeholder engagement. This strategy aligns with the Climate City Contract's goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2030 and emphasises the importance of leveraging European-funded projects and fostering collaboration among local stakeholders.

Behaviour change interventions to encourage residents and businesses to adopt more sustainable practices. These campaigns will focus on reducing energy consumption, promoting waste reduction, and encouraging the use of sustainable transportation modes such as walking, cycling, and public transit.
Awareness programs to educate the community about the importance of carbon reduction and the benefits of sustainable living. These programs will include workshops, seminars, educational materials, and public events aimed at raising awareness about climate change mitigation and adaptation.
Governance structures and mechanisms to support climate action initiatives effectively. This will involve enhancing coordination among local government departments, establishing dedicated climate action task forces, and fostering collaboration between the public and private sectors.
Policies and regulations aimed at reducing emissions across various sectors. This could include building codes promoting energy efficiency, incentives for renewable energy adoption, and regulations to reduce waste generation and promote recycling.
European Union funding opportunities to support climate mitigation and adaptation projects developed by local stakeholders. These projects may include initiatives to improve energy efficiency in buildings, expand renewable energy infrastructure, implement sustainable

transportation solutions, and enhance green spaces and biodiversity. One such example is the UrbanWISE project that implies series of activities aimed at enhancing the administrative capacity of the 2nd District of Bucharest to assess, reduce, and monitor emissions through tailored solutions. These solutions will be adapted for specific zones within the district, encompassing various types of urban structures, including residential buildings, public green areas, public transportation, schools, and more. The project aims to foster sustainable urban development, engage the community, and promote decarbonisation in District 2 Bucharest, with a strong focus on environmental awareness, capacity building, and long-term impact.

Capacity building programs, such as BUILDING CAPACITY IN GOVERNING CLIMATE-NEUTRAL AND SMART CITIES (partnership with Norwegian cities) to empower local communities, businesses and public agencies to take proactive steps towards carbon reduction. This will involve training sessions, skill-building workshops, and technical assistance programs focused on climate-smart practices and technologies.
Participatory decision-making processes that engage diverse stakeholders in the development and implementation of climate action plans. This will include citizen forums, stakeholder consultations, and collaborative planning workshops to ensure that climate initiatives reflect the needs and priorities of the local community.

Furthermore, a digital twinning solution designed for climate neutrality will be employed. This innovative approach will use a virtual replica of the district to simulate, predict, and manage the impacts of various climate action initiatives, enabling precise planning and implementation of strategies to address residual emissions. The digital twin involves creating a comprehensive virtual model of the district that integrates data across key sectors, including transport, industry, waste management, and buildings. By leveraging this digital twin, District 2 will be able to simulate the effects of various climate action initiatives, accurately identify areas of persistent residual emissions, and test the efficacy of different strategies for emission reduction and offset. The digital twin will serve as a dynamic planning and decision-making tool, enabling the district to optimise its climate action plans and ensure that interventions are both effective and efficient.

District 2 will collaborate with local stakeholders, including public agencies, academia, NGOs, and businesses, to develop and implement offsetting projects. These projects will be monitored and evaluated regularly to ensure their effectiveness in achieving carbon neutrality by 2030.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for further refining the Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract.

## Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration – textual elements

The 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan for District 2 Bucharest sets forth a comprehensive approach to achieve climate neutrality, yet it also acknowledges the presence of ongoing challenges and the need for iterative updates to adapt to evolving circumstances and insights.

A primary methodological challenge lies in consolidating diverse data sources for effective monitoring and evaluation of progress towards climate neutrality. To address this, District 2 plans to develop a unified digital platform that integrates data across all environmental and urban development indicators (especially GHG emissions). Ensuring continuous and meaningful participation from all community sectors, including marginalised groups will be a priority. The city plans to enhance its engagement strategies through digital tools and targeted outreach programs to ensure inclusivity in the climate action process. Securing adequate funding for large-scale infrastructure projects and sustainability initiatives is an ongoing issue. The city intends to explore innovative financing solutions, including public-private partnerships, green bonds, and leveraging EU funding programs, to support its climate neutrality goals.

Developing a robust framework for monitoring progress and evaluating the effectiveness of implemented actions will enable timely adjustments and optimisations to strategies based on performance data and feedback.

Strengthening the capacity of local government, businesses, and the community through targeted training programs and educational initiatives aiming to build a knowledgeable and empowered

community that actively participates in and supports climate action. Continuous exploration and incorporation of cutting-edge technologies and solutions that can accelerate the achievement of climate neutrality. This includes smart urban infrastructure, renewable energy technologies, and sustainable waste management systems.

## Milestones for implementation

- Initiation of the first set of infrastructure projects and completion of projects with secured funding (Local, national and European funding). The Local Climate Coalition will also be established in 2024 and the first meeting will be organised once the CNAP is approved by the Mission.

- Review and update of the CCC Action Plan based on initial results and stakeholder feedback. Expansion of renewable energy sources and green infrastructure projects. Updated information of emissions and other gasses not included in the GHG inventory at this moment.

- Implementation of advanced waste management systems, expansion of public transportation networks and green spaces rehabilitation. Introduction of educational programs focusing on sustainability.

- Evaluation of progress towards climate neutrality goals. Adjustment of strategies based on achieved outcomes and updated climate science.

and beyond - Continuous iteration of the CCC Action Plan to address any remaining challenges and incorporate new technologies and methodologies for sustainability.

Certain actions, particularly those related to extensive infrastructure transformations and deep societal behavioural changes, may require timelines extending beyond 2030. The city envisions adopting a phased approach, prioritising actions based on their impact and feasibility, and gradually expanding efforts to encompass more complex initiatives. This includes ongoing investments in green technology, sustainable urban development, and comprehensive community engagement programs. Acknowledging that societal behavioural changes are critical to reducing carbon footprints, sustained efforts over time are required to facilitate and maintain them. District 2 plans to implement ongoing campaigns and programs to foster a culture of sustainability and climate consciousness.

## Integration with local planning cycles

The iterative nature of the CCC Action Plan will be aligned with existing local planning cycles, ensuring that updates are synchronised with broader urban development and environmental planning efforts. This alignment will facilitate the integration of climate action priorities into all relevant municipal planning and investment decisions. Committing to biennial reviews of the CCC Action Plan to incorporate latest scientific findings, technological advancements, and feedback from stakeholders will ensure that the plan remains aligned with the most effective strategies for achieving climate neutrality. Ensuring that updates to the CCC Action Plan are integrated with the city's urban development plans and environmental policies will ensure that climate action is a central consideration in all future development initiatives. Developing targeted strategies to ensure inclusive participation from all segments of the community, including marginalised groups will include utilising digital platforms for wider engagement and creating opportunities for direct involvement in planning and implementation processes.

## Your text

District 2 of Bucharest motivation to join the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" is driven by a deep sense of responsibility towards addressing the urgent global issue of climate change. The city recognises the multifaceted benefits of embracing this mission and the moral imperative to contribute to international efforts to combat climate change. District 2 Bucharest acknowledges that climate change is a global problem that requires a collective response. By aligning with the EU Mission, the city is demonstrating its commitment to being part of the solution, taking regional and global responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. In the heart of Bucharest, District 2 is transforming into a model of sustainability and green living. By 2030, its vision is not just an ambition but a reality where life thrives in harmony with nature. This will be achieved by interventions in key areas.

The motivation behind joining this mission comes from an acute awareness of climate change's challenges and opportunities. District 2 seeks to leverage its participation to accelerate the implementation of innovative solutions across energy, infrastructure, mobility, waste management, and urban green spaces. By doing so, the district aspires to not only contribute significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions but also to reach a vision of a climate-neutral, inclusive and vibrant urban future.

District 2 has taken significant steps towards climate neutrality. This goal is also assumed in the ISLDS 2021-2027 which includes a comprehensive package of objectives and priority projects to achieve climate neutrality. The Climate Neutrality Action Plan officially aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 80% by 2030 and builds on the ISLDS, projects (implemented by the City Hall and other local stakeholders), programs (PIEE 2017-2023) and the results of citizens and stakeholder consultations (organised specifically for the elaboration of the CCC).

The approved Integrated and Sustainable Local Development Strategy of District 2 of Bucharest Municipality for 2021-2027 (ISLDS) includes measures concerning the development of the blue-green system and urban infrastructure, reorienting them towards an approach focused on responding to the challenge of climate change and sustainable development. The third objective targets climate neutrality and considers the development opportunities for District 2 in the areas of energy (transition to a low greenhouse gas emission energy system); green and blue infrastructure (expansion of green areas and increasing the quality of existing green spaces); environmental infrastructure (modernisation of water supply and sewerage networks, development of the circular economy through an efficient waste management system); transport system in the form of a transition to clean or low-emission means of transport.

Some key actions that describe the district's ongoing commitments include:

Consolidation and energy efficiency of the built environment. District 2 has invested in the thermal rehabilitation of both residential (428 buildings rehabilitated since 2020 and 153 planned for 2024) and public buildings (83 schools rehabilitated or in progress).
Modernisation of the energy infrastructure. nZEB standards have been integrated in the rehabilitation plans and one project is under implementation.
Rehabilitation of major green spaces in the sector and the creation of secondary green axes between them. District 2 has made significant progress in the rehabilitation of parks and blue-green infrastructure. Projects currently under implementation include Sticlăriei Park, Shoreline improvement of Fundeni and Dobroiești Lakes (including the island) and Tei and Plumbuita Lakes. Green spaces across neighbourhoods have also been improved and refurbished.
Developing cycling infrastructure and services. District 2 of Bucharest signed the financing contract (NRRP) and approved the Technical Documentation for the construction of 36km of cycling lanes. The City Hall has also installed three secure bicycle parking spaces.
Increasing the attractiveness and performance of the public transport system and encouraging pedestrian mobility. The City Hall has invested in renewing the public car fleet as 51 new trams, 130 trolleybuses and 100 electric buses have been purchased. The

public administration is also preparing for the rehabilitation of 50km of tram tracks. In terms of pedestrian mobility, the District has cleared 100km of sidewalks from parked cars and has developed two projects that aim to transform busy areas in pedestrian-only areas (Old Centre and Obor).

# Vision for climate neutrality by 2030

The District 2's climate neutrality vision for 2030 encompasses transforming into a green, sustainable and smart urban area. By focusing on energy efficiency, renewable energy, sustainable mobility and waste reduction, District 2 aims to significantly reduce its carbon footprint.

District 2 aims to thermally rehabilitate over 90% of collective housing units, incorporating advanced energy-saving features such as green terraces, solar panels, and cutting-edge water and heat management systems. This will significantly reduce energy consumption and contribute to the district's energy production capabilities. Continuing its pace of investment, District 2 is focusing on the thermal rehabilitation of housing and public buildings, with an emphasis on passive building standards. This initiative is part of its broader effort to improve energy efficiency across the district's built environment.

In collaboration with the Water Agency of Romania and the City Hall of District 1, the City Hall of District 2 will contribute to the identification and removal of the sources of water quality degradation near the lakes. To create the secondary blue-green axes, the street profiles will be reconfigured to introduce planting (in partnership with the Municipality of Bucharest, where appropriate) and the major green spaces will be rehabilitated (addition of planting, introduction of irrigation systems, permeabilisation of surfaces). The lakes, as the cornerstone of its green-blue network, will be developed into Bucharest's foremost leisure destinations. In conjunction with expanding secondary green axes (Parcul Verdi – Parcul Circului, Parcul Morarilor – Parcul Sticlăriei – Parcul Național), these areas will play a critical role in mitigating urban heat island effects and enhancing the district's water absorption capacity. To ensure modern technical and utilities infrastructure, the City Hall of District 2 will support the utility providers (E-Distribuție Muntenia, Apa Nova, Termoenergetica) in their efforts to upgrade and modernise the networks.

District 2 will offer the most comprehensive network of recreational cycle paths, supplemented by a robust network of cycle lanes and facilities, including secure parking and a bike-sharing system. It also plans to expand infrastructure for electric vehicles, with a significant number of charging stations to support the transition to sustainable transportation modes. Several pedestrian zones will reinforce the identity of the neighbourhoods and support social cohesion. The local street system will be predominantly configured as residential areas where the focus is on the safety of traffic participants and the quality of public space. Public transportation will be encouraged through investments for the renewal of car fleet, extension of tram and metro infrastructure, and additional management services. Residents of the capital will have easy access to integrated transport service passes and GHG emission-free travel bonus schemes so personal car ownership will become redundant.

District 2 will benefit from the implementation of European funded projects developed in partnership with other local, national and international institutions. Projects such as Regreeneration, DivAirCity, WeGenerate (Horizon Europe), UrbanWISE (NetZero Pilot City) will contribute to achieving the District's goal for reaching climate neutrality. Through these initiatives, the District has also established a network of partners, with Romanian universities and NGOs that will actively participate and support the City Hall, as part of the Local Climate Coalition.

District 2's initiative for climate neutrality is also boosted by an inclusive approach, underscoring the importance of a participatory governance model. Citizens and stakeholders contributed to the elaboration of the Action Plan. The main benefits of the initiative to reduce the district's climate footprint, ranked by citizens, are shown in the Figure 1. All these benefits have received scores over 8, being considered important by the respondents.

In implementing its Climate City Contract, District 2 is guided by principles of accountability, transparency, co-creation, innovation, and multi-actor engagement. The district is committed to an inclusive process that involves citizens, businesses, academia, and other stakeholders in co-creating sustainable solutions. Monitoring, joint learning, and adapting to new approaches are integral to successfully realising climate neutrality goals.

Through its participation in the EU Mission, District 2 of Bucharest aims not only to achieve its climate neutrality ambition but also to reap co-benefits such as improved well-being, health, equity, financial savings, and social cohesion. The district envisions its journey towards climate neutrality as a model for other cities, contributing valuable insights and practices to the collective effort to combat climate change.

The most important benefits of District 2 Bucharest approach to climate neutrality

This vision includes several pivotal areas of action with associated co-benefits:

Modernising public and residential buildings, with a key focus on retrofitting existing buildings and ensuring that new constructions adhere to nZEB standards. These initiatives aim to significantly reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the overall reduction of the district's carbon footprint. The shift towards clean energy sources will significantly decrease air pollution levels. This not only contributes to a healthier environment but also enhances the quality of life for District 2's residents by mitigating respiratory and cardiovascular conditions associated with poor air quality. Retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency not only contributes to climate goals but also results in substantial cost savings for residents and businesses. Lower energy consumption reduces utility bills, freeing up financial resources for other uses.
Reimagining urban mobility, by promoting a shift towards sustainable modes of transportation. This includes enhancing public transport services, expanding cycling and pedestrian networks, and implementing smart mobility solutions. The goal is to decrease reliance on private vehicles, thereby reducing traffic congestion and pollution levels. Lower emissions from transportation and industrial activities will lead to fewer health issues among the population, also encouraging physical activity.
Developing blue-green infrastructure by expanding green spaces, development of green roofs and rehabilitation of waterways. These measures not only contribute to carbon sequestration and biodiversity enhancement but also improve the urban microclimate and provide recreational spaces for residents. Access to enhanced green spaces and a cleaner environment supports mental health by reducing stress and providing spaces for recreation and relaxation.
Enhancing waste management and circular economy practices by introducing new waste sorting infrastructures and promoting public campaigns aimed at reducing waste and increasing recycling rates, District 2 aims to move towards a zero-waste model. This effort will be supported by the development of circular economy initiatives that encourage the reuse and recycling of resources.
Supporting social inclusion and equity through the implementation of programs that ensure that the benefits of climate neutrality and sustainable development are accessible to all community members (affordable and accessible public transportation, energy-efficient housing, and inclusive green spaces), including marginalised groups. This approach

underscores the commitment to equity, justice, and ensuring that no one is left behind in the transition to a sustainable future.

Developing education and capacity building focused on climate-neutral education will play a crucial role in fostering a culture of sustainability among residents. By engaging citizens in sustainability initiatives (community gardens, participatory planning processes and urban innovation incubators) and providing them with the knowledge and tools to contribute to climate action, the district aims to build a community that is actively involved in shaping its sustainable future.
Creating opportunities for growth as the drive towards climate neutrality encourages innovative practices. The transition towards a green economy opens up new job opportunities in sectors such as renewable energy, sustainable construction, and environmental services. This diversification of the job market can spur local economic development and innovation (solutions for various challenges through the UrbanLab for Green Cities).

However, District 2 recognises the challenge of achieving absolute climate neutrality across every sector due to existing technological, financial and infrastructural constraints. While the majority of emissions reductions will come from widespread systemic changes, some areas may require targeted interventions post-2030 to fully neutralise their carbon impact. These exclusion areas, primarily related to heavy industry, heating system, and parts of the transportation sector, will be addressed with targeted strategies that go beyond 2030. These aspects do not fall under the exclusive competence of District 2 City Hall, but involve extensive implications from Bucharest City Hall. Plans for these areas include investing in breakthrough technologies, securing additional funding, and revising regulatory frameworks to facilitate a transition post-2030. Another exclusion area refers to the pollution caused by the private sector, which falls under central authorities responsibility. The only levers that District 2 City Hall can use in such case include specific local interventions (e.g. investments in sustainable mobility, extension of cycling lanes, incentives for green transportation, and specific urban planning regulations for private operators that pollute). To address areas not fully covered by the 2030 timeline, the district plans to develop targeted strategies that outline specific interventions and timeline extensions. These strategies will be integrated into the broader climate action framework, ensuring a cohesive and comprehensive approach to achieving long-term sustainability and resilience.

By capitalising on the opportunities presented by existing and future infrastructure projects, fostering strong partnerships at the local and national levels, and engaging the community in the co-creation of sustainable solutions, District 2 of Bucharest is setting a path toward a transformative and sustainable future.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

This is the core section of the Commitments document that should summarise at least 3 or 4 systemic strategic priorities that need to be implemented for your city to become climate-neutral by 2030. These should be meaningful changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in your city, like decarbonising the heating system in the city or generating 100% energy from renewables. The individual commitments between your city and other stakeholders should address these key priorities and contribute to reaching them. The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan should describe all interventions, including those to reach your priorities and all further actions, in detail and describe how your city plans to implement them.

Strategic priorities for climate neutrality

The commitments outlined below represent a collaborative effort among the city administration, local stakeholders, and the broader community to realise these transformative changes.

# Systemic strategic priorities

Energy efficient buildings: A cornerstone of District 2's strategy is the enhancement of energy efficiency in both residential and public buildings. A significant focus is placed on retrofitting existing buildings and ensuring new constructions meet stringent energy efficiency standards, such as nZEB requirements. This includes substantial renovations to improve insulation, heating and cooling systems, alongside the adoption of sustainable energy production from sources like solar panels for residential and public heritage buildings. Moreover, financial support will be extended to owners' associations for upgrading their buildings, and initiatives will be launched to generate electricity from renewable sources for use in public buildings.
Sustainable transport and active mobility: Redefining transportation in District 2 to prioritise non-motorised travel and public transport is key to reducing the district's carbon footprint. This includes expanding public transportation networks with eco-friendly options like electric buses and trams, enhancing cycling and pedestrian infrastructure to encourage active modes of travel, and implementing traffic management strategies to reduce congestion and promote low-emission vehicles. Sustainable transport and active mobility are not merely about reducing carbon footprints. They're about fostering a sense of community, encouraging healthy lifestyles and reclaiming the city for its people.
Waste prevention and recycling: The plan advocates for a circular economy model, focusing on waste prevention, recycling, and recovery. It outlines the establishment of comprehensive waste management programs, including sorting, recycling, and composting facilities accessible to all residents and businesses. Educational campaigns aim to raise awareness about the importance of reducing waste generation and encourage the adoption of sustainable consumption patterns. Through these measures, District 2 intends to minimize its waste footprint and promote recycling and material recovery as key components of its climate neutrality strategy.

Urban regeneration of communist neighbourhoods: Addressing the unique challenges of communist-era neighbourhoods, the projects aim to modernise and revitalise these areas while improving their sustainability and liveability. These efforts focus on integrating green spaces and community amenities, clearing sidewalks of parked cars, expanding the pedestrian areas and fostering social cohesion. The involvement of local communities in the planning process ensures that regeneration efforts are aligned with residents' needs and aspirations, contributing to the overall enhancement of the district's urban fabric.

Enhanced green infrastructure: Recognising the critical role of green spaces in mitigating climate change, enhancing biodiversity and improving urban air quality, District 2 commits to a substantial expansion of its green infrastructure (to achieve the 26 sqm/resident ratio). This includes the development of new parks and green corridors, the integration of green roofs in urban planning and the restoration of natural habitats within the urban area (lakes and parks). Partnerships with local environmental organisations, educational institutions, and community groups will be essential in promoting biodiversity and engaging citizens in greening initiatives.

Building partnerships at the local level: The plan underscores the need for building strong partnerships among various stakeholders. This includes fostering cooperation between municipal authorities, businesses, civil society organisations, and residents. Platforms for dialogue and knowledge exchange facilitate the sharing of best practices and resources, enhancing the effectiveness of climate action initiatives. Engaging local communities in decision-making processes ensures broad support and participation in the district's climate neutrality efforts.

Digital transformation and inclusive climate action are pivotal transversal strategies that underpin all efforts towards achieving climate neutrality in District 2. Recognising that sustainability challenges are intertwined with the need for technological innovation and social equity, these strategies aim to leverage digital tools and ensure broad participation in the climate action agenda.

Digital transformation for climate action: Leveraging digital technologies to enhance climate action efforts represents another key priority. District 2 aims to develop a comprehensive digital platform that integrates data on energy consumption, waste management, transportation and air quality.

As District 2 of Bucharest embarks on the ambitious journey to fulfil its Climate City Contract and achieve climate neutrality by 2030, several key principles will guide the implementation of its strategies and actions. These principles are foundational to ensuring that the process is inclusive, effective and responsive to the needs of the community and the environment.

District 2 of Bucharest will adopt a comprehensive approach to implementing its Climate City Contract, guided by the key principles that prioritise climate action and community engagement.

Building a strong mandate. In response to the city's participation in the EU Mission for 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030, District 2 Bucharest has established an Integrated Climate Neutrality Task Force. This task force comprises experts from various complementary departments, ensuring a well-rounded expertise to fulfil the climate neutrality ambition. District 2 Bucharest has distributed responsibilities among key city departments, taking into account the specificity and relevance of each department to climate objectives. This approach ensures a collective effort across relevant departments. Recognising that climate neutrality is a collective effort, the municipality has invited the entire local ecosystem to participate in the mission. Local stakeholders, already accustomed to working together through partnerships, have been actively involved in co-creating the Climate City Contract. Building on the success of engaging local stakeholders, the municipality will establish the Local Climate Coalition, which will include a range of local and regional actors, all working together to advance climate-neutrality goals. Building a shared understanding between municipal, regional, national, and EU stakeholders is crucial for effective climate action. District 2 has tapped into existing networks and forums at the regional, national, and EU levels and participated in relevant climate initiatives, conferences and working groups to create relationships and share best practices.

Co-designing a Portfolio. District 2 commits to a co-creation approach in developing and implementing climate actions. For the purpose of this endeavour, a thorough review of existing policies and strategic documents related to climate action was conducted. This has allowed to identify gaps and areas where new or accelerated interventions are needed, resulting in the creation of a comprehensive portfolio that integrates existing initiatives with new, more ambitious climate actions. By integrating citizen questionnaire and local stakeholder consultations into the co-design process, District 2 Bucharest created a climate action portfolio that is reflective of the community's desires and takes into account the expertise and insights of those directly impacted by climate actions. This approach enhances the effectiveness and relevance of the climate mitigation and adaptation efforts in the district. The district pledges to foster an environment where all community members and stakeholders feel empowered to contribute to climate action. This involves creating platforms for dialogue, collaboration and co-decision-making, ensuring that everyone, including marginalised and underrepresented groups, has a voice in shaping the city's climate-neutral future.

Taking action. The local administration will actively execute the actions and interventions outlined in the Climate City Contract. Resources and personnel will be allocated to ensure that the initiatives progress as planned, and regular progress reporting will ensure accountability. District 2 is committed to maintaining high levels of accountability and transparency throughout the implementation of its Climate City Contract. This involves clear reporting on progress, challenges, and outcomes, as well as making information accessible to all citizens. Accountability mechanisms will be established to ensure that commitments are met, and feedback loops will allow for continuous improvement. Understanding that climate change impacts and solutions are interconnected across different sectors and systems, the district adopts a systemic approach in its climate action planning and implementation. This means addressing the root causes of GHG emissions and environmental degradation, rather than focusing solely on symptoms. Actions will be demand-driven, responding directly to the needs and priorities identified by the community and stakeholders.

Learning &amp; Reflecting. District 2 Bucharest has established a robust monitoring and evaluation framework, complete with defined key performance indicators and targets. Regular reviews and feedback mechanisms involve stakeholders, enabling continuous improvement. The local administration views the Climate City Contract as a living document and commits to regular updates. The Local Climate Coalition and the Integrated Climate Neutrality Task Force (representing the City Hall) will play a vital role in monitoring and providing the needed knowledge and resources to support the implementation of the Climate City Contract. Proposed updates and revisions will require the approval of coalition members and the endorsement of District 2 Bucharest.

Making it a new normal. District 2 is open to exploring new technologies, practices, and business models that can accelerate its transition to a sustainable and resilient urban area. This includes leveraging smart city solutions, renewable energy technologies and green infrastructure initiatives. The Urban Lab for Green Cities will facilitate the co-creation process, encouraging residents to develop innovative solution for climate neutrality. These solutions will also pave the way for other cities that choose to embark on this journey to climate neutrality. District 2 will foster an environment of joint learning, where insights and lessons learned are shared among stakeholders. This will enable the city to adapt and refine its strategies over time, ensuring they remain effective in the face of changing circumstances.

These principles collectively form a strong foundation for District 2's efforts to combat climate change. By adhering to these guiding principles, the municipality is well-equipped to navigate the complexities of climate action and foster a more sustainable and resilient future for its residents and the environment.

The CNAP outlines a phased approach with key milestones stretching from 2024 to 2030 and beyond, reflecting the iterative nature of climate action planning. The CNAP is intricately aligned with local planning cycles, ensuring that climate action priorities are seamlessly integrated into broader urban development and environmental planning efforts. This strategic alignment underscores the importance of climate action as a central consideration in all future development initiatives. Biennial reviews of the CNAP will incorporate the latest scientific findings, technological advancements, and stakeholder feedback, ensuring that the plan remains at the forefront of effective climate action strategies.

The Climate City Contract's implementation will be monitored by District 2 City Hall, through its dedicated task force, but will also require the involvement of the Local Climate Coalition. Depending on the monitoring results and the decisions adopted in the iteration meetings, proposals and updates of the CCC will be initiated.

Component 9, Intervention 5. Establishment and Operationalization of Competence Centers

Project: NetZeRoCities – National Competence Centre and solutions for the development of Climate Neutral and Smart Cities – 6/16.11.2022

Funding Contract No. 760007/30.12.2022

Through the project „NetZeRoCities – National Competence Centre and solutions for the development of Climate Neutral and Smart Cities”, Funding Contract No. 760007/30.12.2022, funded through Romania's National Recovery and Resilience Plan, Component 9, Intervention 5. Establishment and Operationalization of Competence Centers, we want to develop the „Romanian Competence Centre on Climate-Neutral Smart Cities”, which will support Romanian cities to achieve Climate Neutrality by 2030 for the cities selected by the EU Mission and by 2050 all Romanian towns. The Centre’s Core Consortium includes strategic partners directly connected to Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Suceava, and other cities.

The Competence Centre represents a network-of-excellence tool for increasing the chances of success with the EU Climate Mission and Carbon Neutrality goal. The consortium organized within the project consists of the National University of Science and Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest, National Institute for Research and Development in Informatics ICI Bucharest, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Technical University of Civil Engineering Bucharest, „Ștefan cel Mare” University of Suceava, SC HOLISUN SRL, SC Beia Cercetare SRL, SC Datacor SRL, SC Intelligent Convergent Solutions ICOS SRL, SC Building Technology Group R SRL, ORANGE România SA and Robert BOSCH SRL.

Our Competence Centre promotes system innovation across the value chain of city investment, targeting multiple sectors such as governance, transport, energy, construction, and recycling, with support from powerful digital technologies. Cities require a shift in regulations, approaches, and instruments combined with the willingness to go beyond existing schemes and habits. It requires an attitude change towards practical implementation that includes concerns of people and stakeholders working together: citizens, local governments, central and regional governments, and European institutions. Following the vision of creating a safe, livable, and lovable living space, urban neighborhoods offer an excellent opportunity to implement and validate new ideas and innovative concepts. This is why our Competence Centre focuses on the city's static (i.e., city infrastructure) and dynamic (i.e., people, businesses) components.
