# 1 Introduction

The introduction should outline the local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and describe the gap it is addressing in broad terms.

Given Prato's desire to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, the process of identifying the Plan's guidelines was based on the analysis of existing planning instruments, evidence from thematic tables and the main national plans (NRRP, PNIEC).

On the basis of considerations regarding planning instruments, existing objectives at local and national level, and in the light of the technologies currently available (and already ripe for possible use in the short and medium term), initial general guidelines are proposed that can guide the specific actions that will be implemented:

Decarbonising thermal and electrical consumption by reducing demand and increasing the efficiency of plant systems in the civil and industrial sectors;
Promoting the electrification of consumption in the civil sector and in mobility;
Increasing local energy production from renewable sources (mainly photovoltaics);
Encourage the consumption of energy from renewable sources, not necessarily produced locally;
Disseminating conscious consumption models, aimed at reducing the use of raw materials and their reuse and recycling;
Promoting alternative and low-impact forms of mobility;
Increase carbon storage/absorption.

Furthermore, in order to make the analysis as comprehensive as possible, all areas of intervention are considered (i.e, buildings, transport, waste, IPPU and AFOLU) and all categories of greenhouse gases.

For years, the international and continental arena has recognised that urban areas play a crucial role in defining sustainable economic, social and cultural development strategies for the future of the planet. United Nations programmes such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, together with European programmes such as the Urban Agenda for Europe, Urban Innovative Actions (UIA), Urbact and the Urban Development Network (UDN), demonstrate the importance of urban areas in international medium- and long-term planning.

The European Green Deal, adopted in 2020, aims to achieve zero net CO2 emissions by 2050, thus promoting sustainable development based on the moderate use of natural resources. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Next Generation EU programme was launched to address the environmental transition, ensure social and economic resilience, and promote digitisation and innovation in order to foster sustainable and economic recovery.

In Italy, it is fundamental that the theme of urban areas be at the center of the national political debate, promoting the planning of a National Urban Agenda that represents the complete framework of a new political and cultural season, integrating the theme of urban policies into the national strategies. In this context, the Region of Tuscany's Structural Planning can play a leading role in the integration of local strategies in the international and continental context, coordinating with the regional sustainable development programmes and creating a harmonious balance between metropolitan, urban and inland areas. The set of Structural Plans can therefore constitute a mosaic of Urban Agendas for the local sustainable development strategies of the Tuscany Region, within the national and European context.

The Municipal Council Resolution 89/2015, entitled 'Programmatic guidelines for the formation of the variant to the Structural Plan and the new Operational Plan of the Municipality of Prato', constitutes a document of strategic importance that has guided the action of the Municipal Administration in the definition of urban policies and has played a significant role in inserting the vision of the city within

planning tool Introduction - textual element international and continental, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Urban Agenda for Europe. This ensured adequate coherence with global strategies.

The active participation of the Municipality of Prato in the partnership on Circular Economy, within the Urban Agenda for Europe, contributed to raise awareness on the role of the city and its peculiarities in relation to sustainable development strategies at regional, national and European level. This document was presented as the Urban Agenda for Prato, a visionary tool outlining medium- and long-term strategies for achieving sustainable development of the city and promoting the integration of different municipal planning tools. The adoption of this tool entailed a constant involvement of the community and favoured the active participation of citizens and stakeholders in the strategic and policy choices of the municipal administration.

Participatory processes and co-design processes were initiated to involve the community in order to outline a shared vision and define collaborative processes for its effective realisation. In particular, the co-design process was conceived and implemented in line with the systemic approach of Net Zero Cities, which suggests acting collaboratively, seeking first to understand the interdependencies between the actors in the area and their actions, in order to explicate the barriers that hinder change and to co-create a portfolio of actions (i.e., co-design a portfolio) that support the overcoming of those same barriers. Aware of finding ourselves within an exploratory path and strongly dependent on the reference context (the city of Prato), we worked on a process that would allow us to create synergies between public administration, stakeholders and citizenship in order to concretely involve the collective intelligences along a transition path that will lead us to the implementation of meaningful impact pathways towards climate neutrality.

The city of Prato adopted its Urban Agenda in 2015, which contains the overall vision and strategies for sustainable local development that guided decisions on urban and territorial policies. In 2020, through the Single Programming Document (DUP), the city administration aligned its planning tool with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These aim to harmonise the city's vision in a manner consistent with international and European planning documents, in order to contribute to the achievement and monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as to exploit related opportunities for the city's socio-economic sectors.

The Structural Plan of the Municipality of Prato, known as Prato Urban Agenda 2050, is conceived as the medium- and long-term vision tool for the city, in tune with the new European planning instruments. It defines the coordination of urban policies and the strategic positioning of the city in the global competition between territories. Prato's social, economic and cultural peculiarities are considered and integrated in the current major international and European programmes, recognising them as central elements for a sustainable development of the city. The involvement of all citizens and stakeholders is guaranteed through participation and co-designing strategies, in order to share the vision and define the actions necessary to achieve it. The project outlines areas of action and strategies related to development.

The Prato 2050 Urban Agenda aims to provide a comprehensive blueprint for the city, identifying Prato's strategic role at regional and sustainable urban level, in line with international goals such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Urban Agenda for Europe. It also positions itself in relation to new ongoing programmes, such as the European Green Deal and Next Generation Europe, in order to nominate the city's actions and projects for future regional, national and European funding. Moreover, it is based on an in-depth analysis of the city's specificities and places it in the global competition between territories; it focuses on innovation, digitalisation and new economic models based on the environment and the social; it promotes a narrative of the city as the contemporary centre of Tuscany and develops actions to support its historical, economic and cultural

heritage, with special attention to the sustainable and circular textile district. The municipal administration of Prato has placed green transition at the centre of its programme, in line with the climate target to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030. This commitment will be reflected in the first European Climate Act, due to be adopted by the end of the year, together with NextGenerationEU and the Budget 2021-2027. The plans adopted must include appropriate measures to achieve European targets on renewable energy, energy efficiency, pollution control, sustainable mobility, protection of biodiversity and support for the transition to food systems and a circular economy, leaving no citizen behind.

The integration of planning actions (e.g., the Municipality's Operational Plan (MOP), the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP), the Sustainable urban mobility planning (SUMP) and the Smart City Plan, was promoted to ensure the centrality of environmental issues in urban policies and to realise the vision of Prato as a Green City.

In general, Prato has promoted a holistic view of environmental issues, culminating in the Prato Green Deal, with the aim of promoting healthy lifestyles, improving people's physical health, strengthening social relations and developing the ability to care for the quality of collective living spaces.

Among the various programmes to promote a healthy and sustainable lifestyle, the Riversibility project is innovative because it envisages the creation of a Bisenzio river park with new sports facilities, spaces for aggregation, and new buildings for associations, in accordance with the WHO Toronto Charter. Another programme, known as '100 Piazze', envisages the realisation of widespread green public spaces in the city's identity places. In addition, a project is underway to bury the Declassata, the city's most important east-west traffic artery, in order to create a new urban park. Within this urban, environmental and sustainable mobility planning perspective, coordinated actions are being developed in the field of health planning, in synergy with the innovative management models of the Smart City Plan. These efforts place citizens' health at the centre of urban policy decisions.

The Municipality's Operational Plan (MOP) redefined the paradigms of the city, considering it as an interconnected system of green and natural areas surrounding built-up areas, following the approach of landscape urbanism. This approach has placed Prato at the centre of international discussions on urban resilience. Furthermore, the Action Plan for Urban Forestry introduced the role of nature in urban areas to promote citizens' health.

In 2019, the City of Prato obtained funding through the Urban Innovative Actions programme for the Prato Urban Jungle (PUJ) project, which is part of the Prato Green Deal. PUJ aims to transform three densely populated districts of the city into environmentally active areas using nature-based solutions. The project is based on the collection of environmental data via sensors and the creation of a digital twin of the neighborhoods to constantly monitor environmental data and assess the impacts of the projects.

In addition to these interventions, the administration has promoted overall coordination and action with stakeholders through the SEAP. This plan includes interventions in public and private buildings, discussion tables with stakeholders, and environmental education activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the city. The main objectives of the SEAP are the energy requalification of public assets, the reduction of consumption and increase in energy efficiency in private sectors, the increase in the production and use of renewable energy, and the promotion of a culture of energy saving and rational use of energy among citizens, operators and businesses in the area.

The Prato Green Deal also developed an overall mobility strategy through the PUMS, which positioned the city of Prato as a national benchmark for sustainable mobility policies. The PUMS aims to satisfy people's mobility needs to improve their quality of life in the medium and long term. The main objectives concern the promotion of sustainable mobility, satisfying the different mobility needs of residents, businesses and users, improving accessibility to the city's key destinations, safety, health, accessibility and information for all, reducing air and noise pollution, reducing air pollutant

# 1. Building a robust systemic approach

The Municipality of Prato has adopted a systemic approach to accelerate decarbonisation actions, ensuring alignment between all investments and stakeholders required to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The city's commitment to promoting change has remained unchanged, even in the face of changes in elected administrations. Concern about the climate crisis and the desire to put the environment at the centre of its strategies and operational plans have been translated by the Municipality of Prato into concrete actions of urban transformation. The Municipality adhered to the ambitious 2030 target through the Mission of the Cities, thus demonstrating its willingness to confirm its commitment and to translate it again into practical actions to tackle climate change.

The active involvement of the entire local ecosystem, including citizens, civic organisations, the media, and the public and private sector, is a key element. In order to facilitate meaningful collaboration, the Municipality of Prato has established a dedicated transition team that coordinates the different skills and perspectives from various disciplines within the city, involving representatives from the various sectors of Prato's society, in order to foster collaboration, innovation and joint investment. Specifically, the Municipality of Prato has designated a dual governance to address the 2030 climate neutrality challenge: an internal and an external one. Within the city government, a team has been set up to establish strategically strong relationships between key departments (e.g., energy, mobility, public buildings); specifically, a governance composed of the Mayor and the Councillors for the Environment, Mobility and Circular Economy and for Budget and Innovation has been envisaged, which will be supported by the Planning and Circular Economy Office as Technical Secretariat, and by a scientific coordination to be carried out by UNIFI DIDA/DAGRI, CNR IBE/INO.

By promoting the stipulation of a memorandum of understanding (i.e., DGC no. 20 of 04/02/2022) with the relevant figures for citizenship (e.g., trade associations, social partners, public and private bodies) the aim is to functionalise the planning and design of calls for proposals and financing opportunities that will arise in the context of the NRP. This protocol constitutes a coordination table formed by the subjects identified by the signatory parties, coordinated by the Municipality of Prato, which meets periodically, at least once every two months.

It is, therefore, an instrument facilitating dialogue between the municipal administration and the territory's stakeholders within the City Mission and also with higher levels of government (regional, national, European). At the moment, economic categories (Pistoia-Prato Chamber of Commerce, Confindustria Toscana Nord, CNA Toscana Centro, Confartigianato Prato, Confesercenti Prato, Confcommercio Prato, Confcooperative, LEGACOOP, CGIL Prato, CISL, UIL), participated companies (ALIA Servizi Ambientali, REVET, GIDA, Interporto della Toscana Centrale, Toscana Energie, ESTRA, Consiag, Autolinee Toscane), social partners (Società della Salute di Prato, USL Toscana Centro, Consulta del Terzo Settore), research bodies and universities (PIN - Polo Universitario Città di Prato, CNR, UNIFI, ENEA, ISPRA).

The Municipality of Prato actively participated in national mission platforms and networks between cities, including the European Community Mission Platform made available to cities selected in the Net Zero Cities call; where it shared its experiences and learnt from others, at the

in order to improve their climate actions. These actions will help ensure a cross-sectoral commitment and concrete mobilisation of the resources needed to achieve the 2030 climate neutrality targets.

Analysis of the context of the Municipality of Prato and the status quo

By understanding the challenge from multiple perspectives and learning from past actions, the City of Prato has demonstrated valuable potential in accelerating the impact of climate efforts. The city has deepened its analysis of the territorial context and addressed the complex issues of climate change mitigation and adaptation, identifying barriers to the necessary changes.

The analysis of the context on which the Climate Neutrality Plan was defined was carried out through two phases. During the first, the general framework was analysed and elaborated through the analysis of the urban and territorial, social, natural and economic context. This was followed by a further mapping of the infrastructures in the area, the vehicle fleet and the status of renewable energy production plants.

During the second phase, the Municipality then conducted, in collaboration with the University of Florence, a co-design process that involved economic and social actors in order to understand the reference context, the criticalities, barriers to be overcome and opportunities to be exploited to achieve climate neutrality. The co-design process was conceived and implemented in line with the systemic approach of Net Zero Cities, which suggests acting in a collaborative manner; in a first phase (i.e. the listening phase), focus groups were organised, associating the various stakeholders in the area with the macro-themes on which the climate neutrality strategy is based (e.g. energy efficiency; sustainable mobility; circular economy; agriculture; land use and urban forestry). The objective was to identify the problems and a first category of barriers that hinder the change towards climate neutrality; from the reconstructed state of the art, all the material obtained was then reworked and analysed. This made it possible to derive an overall result that provides a better understanding of which actions have already been activated, whether there are opportunities for development and whether there are gaps, weaknesses or strengths. During the second phase of the participatory process, a selection of representative actors from the area was again convened to take part in the design of activities to support climate neutrality with respect to the four macro-themes identified.

National Plans and Prato Municipality Plans: Identification of Strategic Directions

The Municipality of Prato collaborated with all the city's stakeholders to aggregate information and data; a fundamental action to create an overview and shared understanding of the scale and scope of change required. Bringing together different perspectives, experiences and lessons learnt from existing climate strategies and efforts, the City identified gaps and interpreted consumption-related emissions on the ground as a consequence of an interconnected system. Existing climate policies, greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and progress to date were then analysed. This formed the basis for the formulation of a solid action and investment plan, based on the analysis of

the following: of the main National Plans, including the NRRP and the PNIEC; of the existing planning tools, specifically the Municipality's decarbonisation operational plans (e.g., PAES, Next Generation Prato, Agenda Urbana Prato 2050, PUMS, Prato Smart City) of the evidence that emerged from the thematic tables, and of the technical studies of the Municipality of Prato carried out in collaboration with CNR and the company Iridra.

The Municipality of Prato then conducted an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, assessing the social, economic and environmental drivers to ensure the technical and financial feasibility of the transition to climate neutrality. In addition to monitoring scope 1 and 2 emissions, the Municipality also identified and collected data on scope 3 emissions. The year identified for updating the emissions inventory is 2019. As far as emissions are concerned, a total of 915,150.19 tonnes of CO2 were emitted in the Municipality of Prato as of 2019. 31.86% of emissions are associated with private and commercial transport, followed by the residential sector (24.53%) and non-ETS industries (23.97%). The tertiary sector accounts for 15.19%, waste for 2.64% and public buildings for 0.60%. This is followed by public lighting with 0.45%, the agriculture sector with 0.42% and the municipal fleet with less than 0.01%.

In addition, future scenarios were simulated that outlined the possible starting points for urban transformation, illustrating, with different levels of detail, the alternatives that could be implemented at the local level; synergies, co-benefits, risks and trade-offs arising from each intervention were identified. The scenarios illustrated how the various sectors included in urban change (e.g., technology, governance, policy and regulation, finance, business models, culture, citizen participation and social innovation) can contribute to closing the gaps and barriers previously identified.

# 3. Definition of strategic directions and actions for the Climate Neutrality Plan

The Municipality of Prato has brought together efforts from various departmental structures and stakeholders to create a coherent portfolio of interventions. It comprises a series of mutually reinforcing synergetic initiatives that strengthen the connections between the various actors involved in the planning and implementation process. Specifically, interviews were conducted with the contact persons of the mobility, town planning and energy offices, with some public and private companies and start-ups in the area. This phase was followed by the sending of data collection forms to obtain proposals for decarbonisation actions already implemented (from the year of the inventory to date) and those planned for the future.

On the basis of considerations about existing planning tools and objectives at local and national level, the Municipality of Prato has identified the strategic directions to follow in order to reach the 2030 climate objective; to achieve this objective, a framework of integrated actions has been outlined. Firstly, the decarbonisation of thermal and electrical consumption in the civil and industrial sectors was envisaged. This was achieved by reducing energy demand and increasing the efficiency of plant systems. In parallel, the electrification of consumption in both the civil and mobility sectors was promoted, for example by encouraging the adoption of heat pump air conditioning systems, electric vehicles and low-impact transport solutions. In order to reduce dependence on traditional energy sources, local energy production from renewable sources was increased, mainly through the implementation of photovoltaic systems. However, the objective was not limited to local production, but the consumption of energy from renewable sources was also encouraged, regardless of their geographical origin. In this context, it was crucial to promote conscious consumption patterns aimed at reducing the use of raw materials and their reuse and recycling. Finally, to offset residual emissions and contribute to carbon absorption, the focus was on increasing carbon storage and the adoption of absorption practices. By integrating these actions, the Municipality of Prato has committed to the ambitious goal of climate neutrality by 2030.

Once the actions to be implemented were identified, the impacts in terms of reducing thermal and electrical consumption and related emissions were estimated, the timeframe for implementing the actions, the targets to be achieved, and the indicators to monitor progress. Positive effects on areas such as health, the economy, resource management and social inclusion were also assessed; this evaluation made it possible to prioritise certain actions and select the most useful impact indicators for monitoring. An economic-financial analysis was then carried out in order to understand the economic resources needed to implement the actions on the basis of the Municipality's budget availability and the economic instruments to be adopted (e.g. incentives and financing).

## 4. Implementation of the plan

The Municipality of Prato will promote and communicate the portfolio of actions to stakeholders, citizens and society at large. This communication will generate a proactive impulse and strengthen the local ecosystem, contributing to the realisation of the portfolio's actions over time. This will lead to profound changes in the mindsets, interactions and involvement of stakeholders with respect to the climate neutrality goal. In implementing the portfolio, the Municipality of Prato will involve local governments (Region and Province), public or utility companies, large business organisations, SMEs, households, residents and communities. For the implementation of actions, it will be crucial to establish strong connections and a shared understanding of priorities among stakeholders, where the focus will be on inclusion, intersectionality and social justice to ensure an equitable transition. The City of Prato's transition team will coordinate implementation between different organisations and groups, creating opportunities for synergies and benefits across the city.

## 5. Monitoring and adaptation of the plan

During the progress monitoring phase, the Municipality of Prato will assess how actions contribute to the achievement of climate neutrality goals. A strong focus will be placed on the data and responsibilities of each stakeholder, so that the learning process during monitoring is continuous. It will be important to observe early signs in the results that indicate that progress is headed in the right direction. The objective will not only be to evaluate the results of actions, but also to understand the complementary changes needed to be successful, such as changes in policy, regulation and behaviour. The Municipality of Prato will use a set of quantitative indicators to monitor the different actions in the portfolio but value will also be placed on qualitative signs of change (e.g., raising awareness of environmental issues among citizens) in order to foster a shared understanding of the changes taking place and facilitate the ecological transition process itself. During the monitoring phase, solid evidence and knowledge about the efficiency of actions and their implementation in different urban contexts and critical emission domains will be constantly learnt from the data.

In addition, an adaptive approach will be adopted for portfolio actions and objectives. Continuous work will be done to adapt actions and objectives to the changing urban context and new stakeholder insights, allowing for modifications and improvements when necessary. The logic of the implemented strategies will also be frequently updated in order to adjust the trajectory towards optimal results and a positive overall effect. In the long term, the effort supported by the Municipality of Prato may be used as a reference point by other municipalities and cities to also embark on a path towards climate neutrality.

Prato is one of the largest textile and fashion districts in Europe and its territorial conformation is closely linked to the dynamics of industrial development. In particular, in Prato the urban and industrial fabric develop in a functional mix relationship in the core of the city, while along the southern axis distinct, albeit close, industrial nuclei are more localised than residential districts. These are the reasons for the scarcity of continuous urban fabric in the Corine Land Cover data (table 1).

Despite the availability of green areas, which are mainly developed in the belt areas, the agricultural-rural vocation is weak in Prato. The vast flat area to the south-southwest of the city is characterised by the widespread presence of permanent meadows and arable land and, above all, cereal cultivation. This area of the city is also home to a large park of about 300 hectares that is mostly used for leisure time activities. Nevertheless, the Municipality of Prato boasts widespread woodland in the northern hilly area, which is also associated with olive-growing activities.

It is this physical structure of the territory that explains the city's relatively low urbanisation, whereby urban functions absorb about 33% of its surface area (3,236 ha of land, 2021 data). The land cover classes of the Corine Land Cover dimension this territorial profile of the Municipality of Prato more precisely.

According to Urban Index data [3], in fact, urban discontinuity is combined with an index of internal urban compactness higher than the national level (94%) and a very low housing dispersion index (about 1%). Population density is, therefore, very high: there are 1,986 inhabitants per  $\mathrm{km}^2$  in the Municipality of Prato, a density second only to that of Florence at the regional level (ISTAT, Risk map data 2018).

The rate of non-utilisation of dwellings is low, at  $29\%$ , and the average age of the building stock (as of 2011) is medium-high, at 31 years (the average age is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the ages of dwellings built after 1962, where age means the difference between the year of the census and the year the dwelling was built). According to the 2011 ISTAT census data, there are 35,515 buildings, of which 22,747 are residential. The minority is built of reinforced concrete (approximately  $39.5\%$ ), while  $54.5\%$  is built of load-bearing masonry. 45.4 per cent were built before 1960, 43.7 per cent in the period from 1960 to 1990 and only 2 per cent are new buildings (built after 2005).

The Municipal Operational Plan identifies 6 sites of archaeological interest, 5 of which are located within the urban area and one at Monte Lopi.

# Social context

Prato is the second city in Tuscany by population (after Florence, the regional capital) and the third in central Italy. For years the Municipality has held the national record for the highest incidence of foreign citizens out of the total: today, one in four inhabitants of Prato is not an Italian citizen.

Migratory flows from abroad explain the exceptional demographic growth trend of the city, which has gained more than 20,000 inhabitants in the last 20 years. The attraction of foreign nationals was very intense in the early 2000s, until 2008, after which the trend stabilised on variations of less than half a percentage point per year, while still remaining in positive territory today. The demographic historical series is interrupted by a few demographic peaks, the last in 2021 on the occasion of the ISTAT revision of the methodology for calculating the number of people in the territory.

Since the average number of members per family in Prato - as in most of Italy - is decreasing significantly, population growth is matched by a more than proportional increase in the number of families in the Municipality. Indeed, ISTAT data show that almost 81,000 families now live in Prato, compared to 75,000 in 2009 (+8%).

From a demographic and social point of view Prato qualifies as a dynamic and young city compared to the rest of Tuscany and the national average. The continuous influx of population from abroad determines, in fact, a lower average age than the national average and that of all the provinces in the region (45.6 are the average years of Prato's population, against 47.8 in Tuscany and 46.4 in Italy). The demographic trend of the Italian population, on the other hand, follows the profile of the other territories: it is not younger and has a structurally negative 'natural' demographic balance (deaths are higher than births).

The main demographic indicators make it possible to grasp the demographic fragility to which the city of Prato is also exposed, despite the mitigating effect of immigration. The indicators are traditionally based on the ratios between three age classes: that of 'children and young people' (0-14 years), that of 'adults' of working age (15-64 years) and that of 'the elderly' (65 years and over). Almost 45,000 elderly people and less than 26,000 very young people live in Prato, compared to 126,400 people between 15 and 65 years of age, so the structural dependency index is  $54\%$  (population 0-14 and  $65+$  compared to 15-64 years of age) and the old-age dependency index is  $34\%$  (population  $65+$  compared to 15-64 years of age). Even the old age index, which measures the proportion of elderly (over 65 years) with respect to younger generations (under 15 years), confirms that in Prato there are 165 elderly people for every 100 young people (it is 225 on average in Tuscany, 193 in Italy).

|   | Municipality of Prato | Tuscany | Italy  |

The 'fast' demography of immigration is also responsible for Prato's particular position in the official demographic forecasts (ISTAT): Prato is a city destined to grow and in the next few years will definitively exceed the threshold of 200,000 inhabitants, thus confirming its position as the exception in a national context that is increasingly old and poor in human resources. The pace of growth will, however, be dampened by the increased mortality of the Italian population, which will take in the full-bodied generations of baby boomers in the older age groups. Within Tuscany, the province of Prato represents the only territory destined to grow with both a ten-year (2032) and twenty-year (2042) perspective.

ISTAT has drawn up a synthetic index of social and material vulnerability (IVSM) to express the exposure of certain segments of the population to situations of risk, understood as the uncertainty of their social and economic condition. The IVSM index is constructed through the synthesis of seven indicators referring to the dimensions of social and material vulnerability considered most relevant for the formation of a national ranking of municipalities (incidence of the population without a qualification; incidence of families with 6 and more members incidence of single-parent families out of the total number of families; share of families composed only of the elderly (65 years and over) with at least one member over 80; incidence of the population in a condition of serious housing crowding; incidence of NEETs; incidence of families with children in which no one is employed or retired from work. This index marked for Prato a value of 100.9 points in 2011, fell to 97.4 points in 2014, but in the last update in 2018 it returned to the level of 100.7 points (the highest figure among Tuscany's capital municipalities).

Below are some useful indicators for assessing the social conditions of the Municipality, compiled at national level with data from the 2011 census [3]. The assessment compared to the national context is also reported. In summary, the Municipality of Prato appears to have a critical social condition, with a medium-high level of vulnerability.

# Economic Context

According to 2020 ISTAT data there are 32,710 local units and 110,965 employees. Consulting the Urban Index database [3] shows that with respect to economic capital Prato has a high index of economic dynamism. This is a synthetic index, elaborated at national level, calculated as the arithmetic mean of the standardised values of the following indicators:

Agriculture = Agriculture employees / Total population *100
Manufacturing  $=$  Manufacturing Workforce / Total Pop \*100
Trade = Trade employees / Total pop *100
Services = Services employees / Total pop *100.

The territory has a compound average accommodation function rate compared to the nationalterritory of 3.3, calculated as the ratio of the number of hotel beds multiplied by 10,000 and the product of resident population and land area  $(^{km2})$ . The percentage of employees in  $^{APS}$  and  $^{KIBS2}$  enterprises (economic sectors J, K and M) out of the total number of employees is high, at  $10.37\%$ , as is the proportion of APS and KIBS enterprises (economic sectors J, K and M) out of the total number of local units, at  $16\%$ .

Finally, the territory has an average high utilised agricultural area of  $82.5\%$ . The surface area agricultural total is about  $64\%$  of the municipal territory.

# Infrastructural context

The Municipality of Prato is crossed by the regional road SR6 and provincial road infrastructure and is also connected through the Rome-Naples railway line. The mobility system in the territory of the Comune di Prato is currently structured on some main axes and corridors that connect it to the metropolitan, regional and national system. They can be grouped into:

Main external road network, including the A11 motorway, the first and second Tangenziale Ovest (Western Bypass), the SR325 and a series of axes connecting with neighbouring municipalities;
An internal main road network;
A railway network, consisting of the FS Florence-Prato-Pistoia-Lucca-Viareggio line and the FS Prato-Bologna line (Direttissima), with three stations where regional and non-regional trains run (Prato Centrale);
a network of cycle paths stretching some  $50~\mathrm{km}$ , connecting green areas within the Municipality with extensions outside it.

The manager of the integrated water service for the Municipality of Prato is Publiacqua S.p.A, which manages the aqueduct and sewerage services in the municipal territory.

The main infrastructures related to water service are:

Agna drinking water plant
drinking water plant Falda 1
drinking water plant (with biological denitrification process) at Falda 2 (Baciacavallo area)
Saint Lucia plant
central Le Bartoline
adduction and distribution network totalling approximately 540 km
connections to end users

The aqueduct network (adduction, distribution and connections) is in line with the needs of the Municipality of Prato, albeit old.

In the last decade, management strategies for the best use of water resources have been implemented thanks to investments aimed at reducing network losses (e.g. through districtisation, to reduce pressures) and enhancing groundwater abstraction through wells (both new and reactivated).

As for the sewerage network, which largely dates back to the 1970s-1980s, it is based on a system of collecting mixed water to the two purification plants of Baciacavallo (the main one) and Calice, managed by G.I.D.A. S.p.A..

The system consists of:

a network of main collectors, some of which follow the routes of ancient gore
a network of secondary collectors and a minor network that capillary transfers the mixed water to the main pipelines
lifting stations
spillways to discharge excess rainwater in the mixed sewer network into the environment

Prato's gore are a defining feature of the city's history, which has used them since ancient times to build on the resource of water as the engine of its development.

There are still some promiscuities between the networks and the gore system, which are, however, on a path of progressive separation with specific initiatives also shared between the service manager and the municipal administration.

Investments aimed at rationalising the sewerage system were also significant, sometimes aimed at overcoming the criticalities associated with the mixed system that also transfers stormwater overload to the sewerage system.

Prato's relationship with water is also represented by the persistence of innovative investments, which over the last 40 years have seen the realisation of one of the most important urban water reuse systems (civil and industrial):

of the industrial aqueduct, which uses water for reuse;

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

of the industrial sewage system, which drains waste water from production activities via special pipes to the Baciacavallo purification plant, allowing it to be treated in a targeted manner and lightening the load on the civil network.

These infrastructures represent a fundamental action for Prato's textile production system, and open up new scenarios and future potential for further human-water relations, linked to new models of city management according to the principles of the circular economy.

# Vehicle fleet

The trend of the municipal vehicle fleet and the detail on passenger cars alone are shown in the following graphs. It can be seen that over the period 2009 - 2021 (latest ACI data available) both the number of total vehicles and the number of cars grew by  $2.2\%$  (+3,379 units) and  $2\%$  (+2,339 units) respectively.

# Status of RES - Renewable Energy Source

The Energy Services Manager (in Italian GSE) makes available to users the Atlaimpianti portal, an interactive geographical atlas on which it is possible to consult the main data on the electricity and heat production plants that the GSE incentivises throughout Italy. Information on plants is broken down by type of source used or incentive mechanism. The data, extracted in March 2023, are updated to July 2021.

As far as photovoltaics are concerned, there are a total of 1,239 installations, 391 of which have an output of less than  $3\mathrm{kWp}$  (with a total output of more than  $1,038\mathrm{kW}$ ), 595 installations with an output of between 3 and  $20\mathrm{kWp}$  (with a total output of  $4,764.1\mathrm{kW}$ ) and 253 installations with an output of more than  $20\mathrm{kWp}$  (with a total output of approximately  $41,312.7\mathrm{kW}$ )

# BASELINE 2019

The approach used in this analysis to estimate emissions from energy consumption in the territory of the Municipality of Prato as of 2019 is the same as that used to define the BEI as of 2009 within the PAESC and refers to the following expression:

$$
E i = A ^ {*} F E i
$$

where:

$\mathsf{Ei} =$  emission of pollutant 'i' (t/year), i.e. the quantity of pollutant 'i' (expressed generally in tonnes) generated and emitted into the atmosphere as a result of a given activity;

$\mathbf{A} =$  activity indicator, i.e. the parameter that best describes the activity that generates an emission, to which a pollutant can be associated, related to the unit of time (usually the year);

FEi = emission factor of pollutant i (t of pollutant/unit of product, t of pollutant/unit of fuel consumed, etc.), i.e. the amount of pollutant released into the atmosphere for each unit of activity indicator.

The standard emission factors used in the analysis are given below, indicating the source reference.

|  FUEL TYPE | FE standard [CO2MWt] | SOURCE  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Petrol | 0,249 | ELCD – European Life Cycle Database  |
|  Automotive and heating oil | 0,267 | ELCD – European Life Cycle Database  |

|  Biofuels | 0 | ELCD – European Life Cycle Database  |
|  Electricity (national as of 2019) | 0,415 | Rapporto ISPRA 343/2021  |

Table 8. Standard emission factors (Source: SEAP Guidelines).

Local electricity production was also included in the 2019 EMI. Based on the criteria given in the SEAP Guidelines, a local emission factor was calculated for electricity. This factor 'values' energy produced from renewable sources and green energy purchased from the local authority in terms of CO2 reduction, according to the following formula:

$$
F E _ {E E} = \left[ \left(C _ {E E} - P L _ {E E} - C V\right) * F E _ {N E} + C O _ {2 P L} + C O _ {2 C V} \right] / \left(C _ {E E}\right)
$$

where:

EEC = Total Electricity Consumption

PLEE = local electricity production [MWhe].

$\mathrm{CV} =$  purchase of green/renewable electricity by local authorities [MWhe]  $\mathrm{FENE} =$  emission factor of

national or European electricity [eMWhe].

$\mathrm{CO2PL} = \mathrm{CO2}$  emissions from local power generation [t].

$\mathrm{CO2CV} = \mathrm{CO2}$  emissions from the production of certified green/renewable electricity purchased from local authorities [t].

All installations that meet the following criteria must be considered in the inventory:

the installation/unit is not included in the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS);
the plant/unit has an input thermal energy of less than or equal to 20 MW in the case of fossil fuels and biomass combustion plants, or less than or equal to 20 MWe nominal power in the case of other renewable energy plants (e.g. wind or solar).

The logic is that small plants respond to local electricity demand, while larger plants produce electricity. The diagram below can be used to determine the inclusion or non-inclusion of plants in the BEI.

Below we will analyse each sector in detail, associating energy consumption with the contribution of each in terms of CO2 emissions.

# PUBLIC SECTOR (BUILDINGS AND LIGHTING)

From a perspective of reducing CO2 emissions in the Municipality of Prato, the energy consumption of the municipal administration and the related emissions play a particularly important role. The organization enjoys high visibility and its behavior serves as an example and affects its credibility in interactions with other entities. At the same time, energy expenses represent a significant item in the municipal budget and their reduction in times of limited funds widens the administration's scope for action in other fields.

Public sector consumption refers to all electrical and thermal users owned and/or directly managed by the Municipality, i.e. those on which the Municipality has the possibility of acting to reduce consumption and emissions.

The energy consumption was provided by the municipal Energy Manager and by the companies that distribute electricity and natural gas in the municipal area.

The total consumption of municipal buildings and public lighting is 12,702 thermal MWh and 18,357 electrical MWh.

In particular, the consumption of diesel for heating in the residential sector and the consumption of LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) for heating in the civil sector (residential and tertiary) were calculated by re-proportioning the activity data available at provincial level on the basis of demographic data provincial and municipal; Furthermore, it is assumed that LPG is used for both automotive and civil uses. Therefore, having separated the portion relating to automotive consumption, the portion relating to the civil sector was deducted. This consumption was allocated to the tertiary and residential sectors with the same percentage incidence of natural gas consumption in the two sectors.

Emissions in the civil sector in 2019 amounted to 363,484 t of CO2. In particular, emissions in the residential sector are equal to 224,470 t of CO2 while in the tertiary sector they are equal to 139,014 t of CO2.

The analysis of consumption in the industrial sector was based on the following sources:

Municipal electricity distributor "e-distribuzione S.p.A." – the activity data reported by the distributor for the industrial sector also includes the electricity consumption associated with the charging infrastructure of electric traction vehicles and systems relating to the waste sector. Therefore, the consumption relating to the aforementioned sectors (calculated separately) has been separated from the industrial sector and reported in specific sections (transport sector and waste sector);
Municipal methane distributor "Toscana Energia" - the activity data relating to natural gas consumption reported by the distributor for the industrial sector also includes consumption associated with plants operating in the waste sector. Therefore, consumption relating to the waste sector (calculated separately) has been separated from the industrial sector and reported in a specific section (waste sector).
Oil bulletin of the Ministry of Economic Development - the activity data relating to the consumption of fuel oil in the industrial sector was calculated by re-proportioning the provincial data.

Emissions from the industrial sector in 2019 amounted to 219.392 t of CO2, of which  $54.7\%$  due to thermal energy consumption:

CONSUMPTION IN THE PRIVATE AND COMMERCIAL MOBILITY SECTOR

The electricity used was calculated from the number of electric, petrol-hybrid and diesel-hybrid vehicles constituting the municipal vehicle fleet $^4$ . In particular, the number of equivalent vehicles was calculated by considering the percentage of plug-in hybrid electric cars running on petrol and diesel for petrol-diesel hybrids through the registrations of cars in Italy broken down by fuel type. For plug-in hybrid petrol-diesel cars, an average mileage of 50 per cent was assumed in electric mode and the remaining 50 per cent in petrol-diesel mode.

The average annual kilometres travelled (referring to the Region of Tuscany) was deduced from the Report prepared by the UnipolSai Observatory $^{5}$ .

Finally, the average consumption (kWh consumed per km travelled) of electric vehicles reported in the document of the Regulatory Authority for Energy Networks and the Environment (ARERA) $^{6}$  was taken into account for the calculation of the electricity used.

Natural gas consumption was calculated from the number of natural gas and petrol/methane vehicles. In particular, the number of equivalent vehicles was calculated by assuming for petrol/methane vehicles that 90 per cent of kilometres are driven on natural gas and the remaining 10 per cent on petrol.

The average annual kilometres travelled (referring to the Region of Tuscany) was deduced from the Report prepared by the UnipolSai Observatory.

The activity figure for the consumption of LPG for motor vehicles (liquefied petroleum gas) was calculated by reproportioning the provincial figure taken from the Ministry of Economic Development's oil bulletin on the basis of the number of equivalent cars deducted from the municipal and provincial vehicle fleet provided by ACI.

In particular, the number of equivalent vehicles was calculated by assuming for petrol/liquid gas vehicles that 90 per cent of kilometres are driven on liquid gas and the remaining 10 per cent on

The consumption of petrol and diesel was calculated by reproportioning the provincial data taken from the Ministry of Economic Development's oil bulletin on the basis of the number of equivalent cars deducted from the municipal and provincial vehicle fleet provided by the ACI. For these fuels (petrol and diesel), a biofuel percentage of 8% was considered, in line with the reference legislation on the obligation to mix biofuels (considered zero emission).

The consumption calculation performed refers to the entire municipal vehicle fleet. Therefore, in order to calculate the consumption of private and commercial transport only, the consumption of the car fleet controlled/managed by the municipal authority and of public transport (calculated as described in the following sections) was subtracted.

Emissions from private mobility as of 2019 amount to 291.592 t CO2. Biofuels, as sources derived from biomass, do not contribute to emissions:

# WASTE SECTOR

In the Municipality of Prato, a door-to-door municipal solid waste collection service is provided by Alia Servizi ambientali S.p.A. In addition, the company Gestione Impianti Depurazione Acque, better known as G.I.D.A., is also present in the Municipality, offering environmental services in the wastewater and liquid waste sector.

The solid waste considered in the analysis refers only to municipal waste as at the time of the analysis there was no available activity data on the industrial waste produced.

# BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT/TERTIARY INSTALLATIONS (NON-MUNICIPAL) - ALIA SERVIZI AMBIENTALI S.P.A.

The electricity use and natural gas consumption of Alia's plants in the Prato area (reported in scope 2 and scope 1, respectively) were derived from the company's Carbon Footprint of Organisation (CFO) performed in 2019.

For undifferentiated waste, the amount of waste destined for waste-to-energy and landfill outside the Municipality of Prato (scope 3) was derived from the data provided in the Sustainability Report 2019. The emissions associated with these treatments were calculated using emission factors in the Ecoinvent database (latest version available) by extrapolating from the processes Municipal solid waste  $\{\mathrm{RoW}\}$  treatment of municipal solid waste, sanitary landfill and Municipal solid waste  $\{\mathrm{IT}\}$  treatment of municipal solid waste, incineration only direct fossil CO2 emissions. In addition, the CO2 emissions related to the processes in the waste-to-energy plant and landfill are only due to the use of natural gas (the diesel fuel of the vehicles used in the landfill was not taken into account). Finally, using the conversion factors for natural gas, the associated energy consumption was calculated.

# PRIVATE AND COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT- ALIA SERVIZI AMBIENTALI S.P.A.

Alia Servizi Ambientali SpA has a fleet of vehicles for collection services, sweeping and treatment/disposal plants distributed among the sites in which it operates.

Greenhouse gas emissions generated directly by Alia SpA are essentially attributable to transport related to collection and sweeping carried out in the served territory and to transport to treatment/disposal plants.

The emissions related to waste collection vehicles in the Prato territory were calculated by reproportioning the total emissions reported in the Sustainability Report 2019 referring to the collection services carried out in all the municipalities in which the company operates with the amount of waste collected in the Municipality of Prato.

The calculation of emissions related to the transport of waste downstream of collection at third-party facilities was carried out using the same methodology as described above, reporting this value in scope 3 as these emissions occur outside municipal boundaries.

It is assumed that the vehicles used by Alia are diesel-powered. Therefore, using the conversion factors for diesel, the associated energy consumption was calculated. A biofuel percentage of  $8\%$  was considered for this fuel.

This plan was developed to capitalise on the opportunities offered by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), a crucial initiative to promote a green and digital transition in Italy, favouring equity and inclusiveness. The NRRP, structured in 6 missions ranging from digitisation to green transition, provides the framework on which the 'Next Generation Prato' strategy document is based. The latter is designed to respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by the NRRP, helping to prepare the territory and production system of Prato to face future challenges. The document represents the result of an in-depth reflection process, involving key stakeholders in defining the city's future strategy. It outlines guidelines for the ecological transition and the adoption of new models economic, with the aim of generating positive impacts on the territory. At the same time, it serves as a starting point to guide the city's future activities. Co-design was conducted in cooperation with local stakeholders, such as trade associations, trade unions, public and private entities, in the context of the Prato Circular City governance table. The technical work was coordinated by the Prato Municipality's Europe  |

Starting from the policies already active in the area, initiatives and commitments have been systematised to promote local sustainable development, focusing on the needs and potential of the textile district. The result is the definition of 24 project files, constituting a portfolio that complements existing paths and suggests new directions for innovation, cohesion and regeneration of the city.
For Prato, this represents a crucial moment to face and overcome the economic and social challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Thanks to the NRRP resources, the city becomes a context in which innovative projects contribute significantly to the narrative of its evolution and the surrounding area. |  |   |

In accordance with Article 37 of Legislative Decree 36/2023, the approval of the Three-Year Programme takes place in compliance with _ of planning documents, consistent with the budget and according to the rules of the economic economic and financial programming, as well as the accounting principles. The annual list, which is an integral part of the programme, details the works to be started during the first year, specifying for each work the source of financing, indicated in the estimate, in the budget or otherwise available. It is important to emphasise that the non-inclusion of a work in the annual list does not preclude its implementation. In fact, unforeseeable situations, calamitous events or new legal or regulatory provisions may make it necessary to implement works not originally planned. The flexibility of the Public Works Programme thus makes it possible to respond in a timely and adequate manner to circumstances that require immediate and not previously planned interventions.  |

Baseline reduction target = Baseline emissions – residual emissions.
Emission reductions planned for in existing action planning and strategies should be quantified per sector.
Emissions gap = Baseline emission reduction target – Emissions reduction in existing strategies.

# A-3.2: Systems &amp; stakeholder mapping

The barriers identified during the process divided into the co-design and portfolio co-design phases (described in detail in Module A-3.3) are presented below and grouped according to two criteria:

macro themes to which they belong (energy efficiency, sustainable mobility, circular economy, agriculture, land use and urban forestry);
lever of reference systemic change (the lever represents the area of intervention on which it is necessary to act to overcome that same barrier).

The main results and suggestions that emerged from the reconstruction of the state of the art are also reported.

# ENERGY EFFICIENCY

Systemic Lever of Change: Education &amp; Training

In all levels of education from school to university, there is an absent
integrated training on energy efficiency;
Professionals do not have the opportunity to update their skills;
There are no adequate training courses for young professionals entering the job market;
Systemic Change Lever: Capacity Building
Citizens, companies and private actors find it difficult to find their way around energy efficiency policies.

Systemic Change Lever: Awareness Raising

The Chinese community, an integral part of the city's productive reality, is not sensitised to the issue of energy efficiency;
Lever of systemic change: Regulation, legislation &amp; procurement
Bureaucracy prevents proper dialogue and thus understanding of practices;
The absence of a stable regulatory framework does not facilitate investment planning
on energy efficiency especially by private individuals;
Lever of systemic change: Fiscal measures
There are no credit measures for companies to encourage energy efficiency actions;
Lever of systemic change: Financial support
There is a lack of incentives for the removal of asbestos from roofs and subsequent replacement with photovoltaic panels;
Lever of systemic change: Data &amp; Tech
Digitisation of procedures and shared platforms are missing;
The non-publicly available emission inventory hinders the definition of
effective strategies;
There is no mapping of public spaces to assess the installation of new photovoltaic systems (energy for businesses and the city in general)

Systemic Change Lever: Convening &amp; Partnerships

There is a lack of experience in setting up energy communities;
There is a lack of a vision of the freight village as a central player in building partnerships, including inter-provincial partnerships;
there is a lack of experimentation on the interport as a pilot subject for innovative and sustainable solutions.

# STATE OF THE ART

## Main results

There are numerous private initiatives related to energy efficiency and transversal to all the sectors surveyed, from punctual interventions such as relamping, home automation, boiler replacement, to more complex investments, such as the installation of photovoltaic systems, the replacement of more energy-efficient production machinery or insulation interventions. Where these interventions have not already taken place, it is planned to implement them in the short term (2-5 years);
much attention is paid to data: in many cases, technologies (from domotics, to the digitisation of production processes, to the use of drones) have already been implemented to monitor consumption, dispersion and emissions. Where the technology is not already in place, plans are being made to implement it;
there emerges a marked awareness of the need to set up networks, including intersectoral ones, both with a view to establishing energy communities and new partnerships (including public-private), both to access calls for tenders and funding and with a view to energy optimisation (consortia and cooperatives);
regulations and procurement play a key role, both with a view to cutting red tape (e.g. for energy efficiency measures) and with a view to regulatory stability, which promotes investment planning also in the long term;
there is a lack of adequate training in energy efficiency in practically all the sectors questioned, which is indispensable both for accessing financing and procedures related to energy efficiency and for re-skilling for new job opportunities;
working on awareness and communication emerges as a determining factor, to be strengthened and extended in the long term

## Suggestions accepted:

allocate suitable public spaces for the installation of renewable energy plants to produce clean energy for distribution to the city;
implement the use of hydrogen accumulators;
promote energy communities, including cross-sectoral ones;
the figure of the energy manager could represent the link between the different sectors, also with a view to setting up energy communities;
it is important to work on the awareness and education of the Chinese community on energy efficiency issues.

# SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY

## MAIN BARRIERS

**Systemic Change Lever: Awareness Raising**
There is a lack of a general city culture around the issue of sustainable mobility (resistance to abandoning the car for travel)

**Systemic Lever of Change: Education &amp; Training**
Technicians and managers often do not participate in training courses;
Adequate training on the subject is lacking at all levels of education and training;

**Lever of systemic change: Communication**
Communication on sustainable mobility issues is inadequate (it

is necessary to talk about active rather than slow mobility

## Systemic Change Lever: Convening &amp; Partnerships

The absence of dialogue between business and public administration is not conducive to micro-mobility;
The absence of dialogue between neighbouring municipalities does not favour effective inter-municipal and inter-provincial sustainable mobility strategies

## Lever of systemic change: Financial support

The absence of adequate and affordable funding does not facilitate the transition to sustainable mobility;
The absence of incentives does not facilitate corporate car sharing.

## Lever of systemic change: Infrastructure (Physical assets)

The discontinuity between the city's cycle paths is not conducive to their use;
The lack of security discourages micro-mobility and pedestrian mobility;
Public transport infrastructure is inadequate and discourages its use;
A plan for inter-municipal and inter-provincial connections for sustainable mobility (Prato-Florence tramway) is missing;
There is a lack of an inter-municipal and inter-regional logistics management plan that promotes sustainable mobility;
Architectural barriers do not favour the use of public transport (especially for the disabled).

## Lever of systemic change: Data &amp; Tech

The absence of a shared platform for mobility data collection does not favour the formulation of effective strategies;
The absence of data-driven strategies does not allow the formulation of an adequate action plan for infrastructure enhancement.

## STATE OF THE ART

## Main results:

a number of initiatives already underway in terms of awareness-raising, communication and capacity-building emerge;
a culture of sustainable mobility is still struggling to take hold among the citizenry;
the absence of adequate infrastructure is the main critical issue in the transition to sustainable mobility, both with respect to micro-mobility and pedestrianisation;
security is a frequently evoked theme;
the freight village represents a strategic element of logistics, to be conceived not only as a link between the city and its districts, but also from an inter-provincial perspective;
the need to connect the logistics of the textile district to the railway system emerges, from an inter-provincial and inter-regional perspective. Here again, the freight village is a strategic regional hub;
data and technology are a key tool for sustainable mobility that is still too little used;
the training of the mobility manager is a central issue. Indeed, the mobility manager represents a strategic linking figure in the creation of synergies and partnerships;
The strengthening and promotion of public transport and its usability are unanimously demanded by all parties questioned.

The absence of an alternative by-product category hinders reuse in the food sector;
The legislation defining prunings as special waste does not allow their reuse;
Failure to recognise nature as a legal entity does not foster a culture of sustainability;
The management of the agro-forestry plan is sporadic and sectoral;
There is no regulation on the reuse of food waste;
The technical health regulations on feeding create a food waste barrier (it immediately becomes waste);
The date of minimum durability, which is regulated at European level and can be read at national level, is unsustainable, given the expiry date only for fresh products;

## A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

### The undertaken Participatory process

The co-design process was conceived and implemented in line with the systemic approach of Net zero cities (fig.1) which suggests acting in a collaborative manner, seeking to understand, first of all, the interdependencies between the actors of the territory and their actions, in order to explicate the barriers that hinder change (understand the system - Phase 1) and to co-create a portfolio of actions (co-design a portfolio - Phase 2) that support the overcoming of those same barriers. Aware of finding ourselves within an exploratory path and strongly dependent on the context of reference (the city of Prato), we worked on a process that would allow us to create synergies between public administration, stakeholders and citizenship, in order to concretely involve the collective intelligences along a transition path that will lead us to the implementation of meaningful impact pathways towards climate neutrality.

Fase 1 | Understand the system: Focus group

In this first listening phase, we organised focus groups associating the various actors and stakeholders in the area (Fig.2) with the macro-issues on which the city's climate neutrality strategy is built: energy efficiency, sustainable mobility, circular economy, agriculture, land use and urban forestry.

The categories questioned through the numerous listening round tables were as follows:

a first group consisting of the Municipality's subsidiaries, trade associations, banks and foundations, research institutes, large-scale retailers, companies, agricultural bodies and associations linked to the short supply chain, farms, professionals, environmental associations, bodies linked to mobility and public administration (land government, roads service, town planning government, agriculture and environment);
a second group consisting of trade associations, businesses and start-ups, sports clubs, traders, citizens' committees, public administration; a third group consisting of third sector bodies, and public administration; a fourth group consisting of the boys' and girls' municipal council.

To construct the Prato Carbon Neutral tables within the focus groups, tables already active on other projects of the Municipality of Prato were used (Table Governance PCC, Section agriculture and short supply chain PCC, Pathway Structural Plan, Pathway 'We the centre', Table with school directors periodically coordinated by the Department of Education). This made it possible to involve stakeholders accustomed to confronting each other, provoking a more fruitful dialogue and activating fertile ground from which to extrapolate, as early as this preliminary phase, proposals and suggestions to be fed into the subsequent workshop phase.

Fig. 2 - Territorial actors participating in the Focus Group

The main objective of this first phase was to identify the problems and a first category of barriers to change towards climate neutrality. For this purpose, the process was organised on the basis of two macro-actions:

an initial introductory part, linked to the subject matter, was presented by the administration and the various managers involved in the subject matter, by means of a summary restitution of both the framework policies and the concrete actions carried out within that framework;
a workshop phase introduced by an initial divergent action, in which the various actors were asked to construct and visualise the state of the art (with respect to the category they represented) through a specially designed tool (fig. 3), which would help us to return not only a snapshot of the initiatives underway (now), but also possible actions being implemented or planned in the next two years (near) and strategies to aspire to in the next five to eight years (next). At this stage, we also tried to analyse
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

and understand relevant policies and regulations, especially at the local and regional level, relevant to the city's transition to climate neutrality.

a second convergent action, supported by a specific tool (fig. 4), guided us towards the definition of concrete problems, which were in many cases the basis for a plenary cross-sectoral discussion between the different sectors present at the working tables.

Fig. 4 - The problem definition tool

With particular reference to the co-design meetings with the Boys' and Girls' City Council, two specific meetings were organised. The first meeting was aimed at stimulating boys' and girls' awareness and involvement, in order to reconstruct with them a state of the art around the topics addressed, aimed at answering the question "what am I doing about the topic of energy efficiency/sustainable mobility/circular economy/agriculture, land use and urban forestry", through the 3N tool and a storyboard (fig. 5). In the second and final meeting, we expanded the awareness dimension by asking each of the participants to identify with one of the roles proposed through the tool inspired by De Bono's 6 hats (fig. 6). The tool was designed to stimulate empathy and different types of thinking according to the role assigned, bringing out the creative abilities of the young people and youth participants, and making concrete proposals related to the topics discussed.

# 3 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B represents the core of the Action Plan, shaped by local authorities, local businesses and stakeholders, comprising of the most essential elements: scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, action portfolios and indicators for monitoring, evaluation and learning.

# 3.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Module B-1 "Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways" should list impact pathways, early and late outcomes and direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits) according to and adapted from the NZC Theory of Change and the AP Guidance – clustered by fields of action.

Connection between context and planned actions

# 1. Strategic assessments

The policy adopted for the evaluation of emission reduction strategies to achieve the net zero objective by 2030 was based on the results obtained from the GHG inventory conducted to reconstruct the 2019 baseline (Module A-1), taking into account the opportunities and barriers that emerged in the co-planning and portfolio co-design phase (Form A-3) and further assessments conducted in the area. Furthermore, in defining the plan, particular emphasis was given to the active involvement of the community in the design and implementation of these strategies, ensuring that they are responsive to the needs and perspectives of citizens.

In detail, to address these challenges effectively, a multi-criteria approach has been structured, adopted as a guideline for the definition of sectoral emissions reduction objectives and the related strategy implemented for the definition of the Impact Pathways. Based on this information, a plan was then developed that gives maximum priority to emission reduction strategies, pushing the global target to 83% compared to the 2019 baseline value, with the aim of minimizing the residual component of emissions. Finally, to compensate for this residual component, actions linked to the production of electricity from renewable sources and reforestation programs have been envisaged.

The criteria used to identify improvement potential for each sector are detailed below, adopting a qualitative scoring approach:
CENTRO DI PRATO

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

#

Environmental Impact: To evaluate the environmental impact, three score scales were evaluated (high, medium, low) based on the percentage of incidence of emissions from the specific sector on the 2019 EIB:

High: Emissions ≥20%

Medium: Emissions included in the 10%+20% range

Low: Emissions ≤10%

Barriers: As regards barriers, three score scales were evaluated (high, medium, low) based on the number and complexity of the results that emerged from the preliminary analysis with stakeholders and assessments conducted in the area in terms of obstacles to overcome for each sector with reference to the themes of energy efficiency, circular economy, sustainable mobility, agriculture, land use and urban forestry:

High: Barriers represent numerous significant and complex challenges to address. They may include technological, financial or political obstacles that require strategic interventions and considerable resources to overcome.

Medium: Barriers challenges of moderate size and complexity. They may include obstacles that require some effort to overcome, but which can be addressed with a well-structured action plan and adequate resources.

Low: Barriers represent relatively fewer challenges and are easier to overcome. They may include barriers that require only limited interventions or relatively fewer resources to successfully address.

Opportunities: As regards opportunities, three score scales were evaluated (high, medium, low) based on the suggestions that emerged in the co-planning and co-design phases in addition to further specific assessments conducted in the area in terms of opportunities offered by the sector in terms of adoption of possible innovative technologies, access to economic incentives and behavioral changes:

High: Opportunities represent interventions or strategies that offer high potential for reducing CO2 emissions. These can include the implementation of innovative and highly efficient technologies, the potential for energy production from renewable sources, the adoption of ambitious public policies and significant economic incentives, as well as large-scale behavioral changes.
Medium: Opportunities indicate interventions or strategies with moderate emissions reduction potential. They may involve the adoption of existing but less advanced technologies, medium potential for energy production from renewable sources and public policies and economic incentives of limited scope, as well as behavioral changes on a more limited scale.
Low: Opportunities represent interventions or strategies with relatively limited emissions reduction potential. These may include actions that lead to only small improvements in efficiency or resource use, limited potential for energy production from renewable sources and public policies or economic incentives of limited scope, as well as behavioral changes at individual or local scales.

La tabella seguente mostra i risultati della valutazione multicriterio, con l'evidenza degli scoring identificati per ogni criterio in riferimento ai singoli settori:

|  Sector | Environmental impact | Barriers | Opportunity  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Residential | High | High | Medium  |
|  Industrial | High | Medium | High  |
|  Municipal | Low | Medium | Medium  |
|  Tertiary | Medium | High | Medium  |
|  Agricultural | Low | High | High  |
|  Mobility | High | High | High  |
|  Waste | Low | Medium | Medium  |

Table 10 Evaluation of the sector's potential.

Finally, all these assessments were integrated to identify the main areas of intervention and the most effective strategies to adopt to reduce GHG emissions and mitigate environmental impacts. For example, a sector that has a high environmental impact, high opportunities for improvement (e.g. obsolete technologies, ease of access to incentives, etc.) and barriers that can be easily overcome (through specific targeted actions) represents a top priority on which to focus on more challenging objectives. in terms of emissions reductions by 2030.

Below are the strategic assessments conducted for each sector, which were used as a guide for planning:

Residential Sector: The residential sector represents a significant item in terms of GHG emissions (24.53%), mainly linked to energy consumption. Therefore, the actions identified in the Impact Pathways were mainly focused on strategies to reduce the energy needs and increase the energy efficiency of domestic users, which include both technological interventions and behavioral changes. The main barriers here are resistance to change in energy consumption habits and the costs associated with improving the energy efficiency of buildings.

Industrial Sector: Industry, with its significant environmental impact (equal to  $23.97\%$ ), represents an important challenge in the transition towards sustainability. In the Prato area, there are ample opportunities for innovation, linked to the presence of energy-intensive companies with potential for improvement in terms of technologies, also thanks to the specific incentives provided for industrial activities. These can lead to a reduction in emissions through the optimization and improvement of production processes, as well as through the installation of photovoltaic systems on large industrial areas. From this point of view, also in light of the obligations established by the new legislation in terms of sustainability balance sheets, particular importance in planning was reserved for the definition of climate neutrality objectives and plans by a sample of energy-intensive companies. The main barriers that emerged in the co-planning phase concern the difficulty of companies in orienting themselves on energy efficiency policies and the need to raise awareness among the Chinese community (an integral part of the city's production reality) on sustainability issues (with particular focus on energy efficiency energy).

Municipal Sector: Although the Municipality itself has a relatively low footprint in terms of direct emissions (1.05%), it plays a crucial role in promoting sustainability at a local level. The actions planned for this sector mostly include activities linked to energy efficiency interventions and the

redevelopment of public buildings and sports facilities managed by the Municipality. In this sector, planned interventions for Public Residential Buildings (ERP) were also considered, the benefits of which were however accounted for within the Residential Sector. Barriers identified here may include bureaucracy and lack of funding for environmental investments. However, the Municipality has the opportunity to play a leadership role in promoting sustainability through innovative policies and pilot projects.

**Tertiary Sector:** The tertiary sector, which includes services and trade, has an average impact in terms of emissions (15.19%). Based on the study of the context and the actual opportunities, in this case actions were mostly planned related to the electrification of thermal consumption and the reduction of energy needs. The main barriers here are resistance to change in energy consumption habits and the costs associated with improving the energy efficiency of buildings.

**Agricultural Sector:** Agriculture, although it has a limited impact on direct emissions (0.42%), represents a key sector especially in terms of energy production from renewable sources. From this point of view, a preliminary evaluation was conducted on the Prato area aimed at evaluating the actual potential for installing agrivoltaic systems, also taking into account the nature of the crops present. Furthermore, the envisaged strategy aims to reduce heat consumption linked to the use of fossil fuels in agricultural vehicles and the adoption of more efficient agricultural practices. Possible barriers considered include dependence on conventional agricultural practices and lack of access to sustainable markets.

**Mobility Sector:** Mobility represents one of the sectors with the highest environmental impact (32,19%). However, one of the main challenges in this sector is the high dependence on private vehicles powered by fossil fuels. In this case, given the relevance of the sector and the high opportunities for improvement, an articulated plan of actions has been structured that generally aims at disincentivizing the use of private vehicles by improving the offer of local public transport services (also through infrastructural improvements and the type of services offered) combined with soft mobility strategies. The plan also envisages a gradual transition to the use of electric vehicles for the remaining share of private internal combustion vehicles. In this context, the possibility of hydrogen-powered vehicles has also been investigated, as well as the identification of speed-limited zones in the context of urban roads.

**Waste sector:** The waste sector has a relatively low impact on direct emissions of 2,64%. In addition, the current solution of separate waste collection represents an excellent adaptation to the context of Prato and It does not seem to offer further room for improvement. Consequently, the overall strategy of actions adopted within the plan focuses on the installation of photovoltaic systems and the purchase of green energy.

With regard to the renewable energy share, a spatial study was conducted focusing in particular on photovoltaic technology (being the one with the greatest potential, as shown in the results shown above in Table 9). The strategy included in the plan envisages the sizing of plants according to two approaches:

When specific studies or detailed information on the area were available, calculations were made considering the maximum potential of the relevant sector. For example, in the industrial sector, reference was made to a study conducted on the potential for photovoltaic installation in Macrolotto 1, Macrolotto 2 and Artisan Areas. Other examples are in the public sector, where a study was conducted on the potential for photovoltaic installation on a landfill site, and in the mobility sector, through a study

on usable parking areas. The application of this approach therefore leads to a production of electricity from photovoltaics that could exceed the requirements of the relevant sector.

In the absence of detailed information, production from photovoltaics was sized to cover 20% of the residual electricity needs of the reference sector by 2030. The demand was estimated by considering both the reduction in energy consumption linked to the energy efficiency actions included in the plan, and the increase in consumption linked to electrification actions (e.g. heat pumps, electric cars, induction hobs, etc.). The value of producibility thus estimated was finally validated by considering the percentage ratio between the equivalent covered surface area and the total roof surface area in the reference sector.

In particular, we emphasize the importance of adopting a dynamic approach to ensure the continued effectiveness and relevance of the plan. This dynamism will be crucial to ensure that the plan is able to adapt and respond in a timely manner to changing needs and challenges that may emerge over time. To achieve this objective, annual monitoring will be carried out on the actions foreseen within the plan, constantly adapting them to the dynamic evolution of society.

To achieve this, it will be essential to implement an active process of monitoring and analyzing feedback from stakeholders involved in the implementation of the plan and the Prato community, as described in the next section. This process of monitoring and analyzing feedback will be continuous and iterative, allowing for an ongoing evaluation of the plan's performance and identifying any areas where improvements can be made. It will be crucial to be sensitive to the needs and perspectives of the community, incorporating their voices into the decision-making process and in updating the plan's strategies..

## 2. Citizen Involvement Plan

In the context of the Municipality of Prato, all the actions prepared within the Impact Pathways include specific strategies to involve citizens through awareness-raising campaigns, webinars and other initiatives. Regardless of the transition phase in which the city finds itself, its inhabitants are recognised as key drivers to catalyze significant changes. Prato's history is marked by a long tradition of civic participation and community engagement, factors that provide a solid foundation for involving citizens in decision-making processes and climate neutrality initiatives.

In addition to investments in physical infrastructure, the mobilization of advanced policy-making and governance capacities plays a central role in adequately engaging Prato's local communities.

Actions initiated in transition pathways carefully consider the contribution and experience of Prato citizens, as they hold a wealth of resources, knowledge and networks that can be activated to address complex challenges related to environmental sustainability. Moreover, new technologies can act as catalysts to further enhance citizen participation, although it is crucial to understand and systematize current and emerging practices. In this context, citizen involvement in Prato is not only desirable, but becomes an indispensable component to ensure an accelerated and socially supportive transition to climate neutrality.

In the context of the city of Prato, the adoption of innovative methodologies for citizen involvement plays a fundamental role in the process of co-creation and design of climate neutrality initiatives.

From this point of view, the Municipality may consider adopting some of the following methodologies:
CENTRO DI PRATO
UNIVERSITÀ DI ROMA
Climate-Neutrality
Commitments
O

Citizens' Climate Assembly: The Citizens' Climate Assembly is a democratic instrument that aims to directly involve a randomly drawn sample of citizens to help propose and implement municipal policies. The assembly is deliberative, i.e. it is based on a method of dialogue and argumentation among participants. It is convened at most once a year, on a temporary basis, on a particularly relevant issue, mainly on climate-related topics within the competence of the Municipality of Prato.

Distributed Dialogue: This approach involves a series of conversations organized by stakeholders in different geographical areas and through different media, including online forums. The commissioning body of the distributed dialogue is responsible for selecting the policy issue, providing clear questions and background information, as well as tools for planning and facilitation. This method aims to overcome the isolation of different groups and create a clear channel between them, collecting the results of conversations to feed into the decision-making process.

Future Workshops and Future Tours: These workshops aim to form a vision of the future and identify objectives and problems, involving a group of participants in formulating concrete solutions and proposals for action based on their experiences. This method proves particularly effective for addressing local or neighboring issues and planning specific local actions.

World Café: This method makes use of an informal, café-like setting where participants discuss an issue in small table groups through several rounds. Each table has a host who summarizes previous discussions to new participants. Emerging main ideas are discussed in plenary sessions to assess follow-up possibilities.

Fishbowl: This method involves speakers, seated in the center of the room together with a facilitator, initiating the conversation, while other participants listen from the periphery. The discussion is open to anyone who wishes to join in, promoting a dynamic and inclusive dialogue.

Decidim: Decidim is an open-source digital platform for citizen participation and participatory democracy. Adopted by several cities, including Barcelona, Decidim allows citizens to propose ideas, participate in polls, comment on ongoing proposals, and vote on important issues, promoting greater participation and transparency in the decision-making processes of the Municipality of Prato.

In the context of citizen involvement in the Municipality of Prato for climate sustainability transition initiatives, it is important to consider both positive and negative feedback that may influence the process. Positive feedback, or synergies, may amplify the effects of actions undertaken, while negative feedback, or undercuts, may hinder their success. Here is how these concepts can be applied:

## Positive feedback (synergies):

Active participation: Meaningful citizen involvement can lead to greater awareness and a sense of responsibility towards sustainability, creating a virtuous circle of support and collaboration.

Knowledge sharing: Citizen participation can lead to the sharing of knowledge and experience, providing innovative ideas and creative solutions to environmental challenges.

Legitimation of decisions: Involving citizens in the decision-making process can increase the legitimacy of environmental policies adopted by the Municipality, enhancing their acceptance and adherence by the community.

Empowerment: Active participation of citizens can increase their sense of ownership and empowerment, encouraging them to actively contribute to building a more sustainable city.

# Negative feedback (undercuts):

Disparities in participation: Disparities in citizen participation may arise, with some groups being over-represented compared to others. This could lead to decisions that are not representative of the interests of the entire community.

Resistance to change: Some sectors of the community may resist change or sustainability policies, fearing negative consequences on their activities or lifestyle.

Frustration and disillusionment: If involvement initiatives do not produce tangible results or if citizens' opinions are not taken into account.

To address this feedback, it is essential to promote fair and inclusive participation, ensuring transparency, accessibility and accountability in decision-making processes. Furthermore, it is important to continuously monitor the results of engagement initiatives and in the context of monitoring, strategies will be adapted according to the feedback received from the community.

|   |  6.12 | Technology/Infrastructure. With regard to local public transport, the Urban Sustainable Mobility Plan scenario proposes interventions of particular relevance to the transport offer aimed at integrating the urban and extra-urban dimensions of public mobility services and networks. The proposed intervention envisages the use of part (about 20 thousand m² ) of the areas no longer used by the freight yard located near the main station as a hub. The presence of the Interporto and the interconnection with the railway line have led to a clear weakening of the functions of the Prato central railway yard, leaving a substantial part of areas adjacent to the consolidated city unused, with obvious effects of abandonment and degradation. | Started | Made |  |   |

|  Transversal Actions |  | Governance & Policy: Awareness-raising campaigns Awareness-raising campaigns take the form of strategies aimed at stimulating citizens' interest and providing background information on relevant issues, playing a crucial role in positive community readiness and facilitating the implementation of reduction actions. Although the effects of such initiatives are often difficult to quantify directly, their impact lies in creating awareness and establishing a social climate conducive to collaboration and change, particularly towards a sustainability paradigm. In particular, in the context of the plan to reduce emissions by 2030, it is planned to design a series of campaigns, realizing events and webinars, aimed at raising awareness among the various stakeholders on the actions to be taken to reach the target. By promoting sustainable practices and providing information on technologies and facilities, these initiatives aim to achieve sustainability targets. Below is an outline of what could be the topics for the sectors: - Residential Buildings: Raising awareness on energy efficiency strategies for private buildings, such as replacing obsolete boilers with heat pumps, replacing low-efficiency household appliances and promoting a more sustainable lifestyle. In particular, the Municipality of Prato's 'Sustainable Condominiums' project aims to promote the | Started | Started | n.a. |   |

|   |  | energy requalification of condominium buildings by providing technical advice and information on available incentives. Through public meetings and the collection of applications, participating buildings will be selected. Subsequently, an energy diagnosis will be carried out to identify efficient interventions. Proposed interventions will be presented to apartment blocks, which can then decide to proceed with implementation. Qualified suppliers will be selected to implement the interventions, and the project will provide supervision during implementation to ensure that the standards and energy savings are met.

Industry: Awareness-raising on emissions reduction and sustainability reporting initiatives (such as Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi), Sustainability Reporting, etc.) and publicizing calls for tenders that incentivise energy efficiency and renewable energy production.

Tertiary sector: Awareness-raising on good practices to contain energy consumption and on the implementation of advanced technological solutions to make commercial spaces more energy efficient.

Agriculture: Awareness-raising on replacement and modernisation of machinery and tractors, adopting more energy-efficient technologies and reducing environmental impact (e.g. Agriculture 4.0, agri-voltaics, etc.).

Sustainable Mobility: Promotion of the use of electric vehicles, public transport and  |

For these initiatives, the Municipality intends to organize events on the territory in collaboration with the Italian Environmental and Bicycle Federation, an environmental organization committed to the diffusion of the bicycle as a means of daily and leisure transport, with the aim of promoting practices that favor the diffusion of soft mobility, illustrating available solutions and incentives.

With regard to awareness, it is important to emphasize that the Municipality already has an active collaboration with Legambiente Prato. For instance, in 2022 a new edition of the 'Prato Well-Kept City: I take care of it' campaign was carried out, which promoted the correct use of the city's dog-walking areas, a greater knowledge of the 'Regulations for the protection and welfare of animals in the city' and also made all dog owners aware of a more positive and mutually respectful coexistence between animals and citizens.

From this point of view, in order to make the tools implemented in the emission reduction plan more effective, the Municipality intends to strengthen this collaboration with Legambiente by planning new events on sustainability issues.

In addition, a few years ago the Municipality of Prato renewed an initiative in cooperation with Alia Sevizi Ambientali called 'Che Prato! More differentiated waste collection, more decorum'. The initiative aims to involve the citizens of Prato and economic activities in a process to increase information and  |

**Purchasing Groups**
Purchasing Groups represent communities of citizens united in a wide range of initiatives to promote an ecological and responsible lifestyle. The primary objective of Purchasing Groups is often to obtain discounts or advantageous conditions through collaboration and group strength.
One example is the Solidarity Purchasing Groups (SPG) whose peculiarity lies in the fundamental principle of solidarity, which materializes through close collaboration with small local producers sharing values of respect for the environment and for people. This movement, rooted in environmental and social awareness, obtains increasing support from municipal administrations that promote its spread through patronage and active support.
Within this initiative, other categories of Purchasing Groups have been defined in recent years, which aim to extend their action beyond the traditional procurement of foodstuffs.
In particular, focusing on the Parto area, the objective is to | Started | Started |  |   |

|   | create the conditions to form citizens' purchasing groups for the realization of photovoltaic/solar thermal systems, replacement of boilers, insulation, purchase of certified green energy and purchase of electric cars. The phases of the initiative are subdivided as follows:
communication campaign: within six months of launch;
collecting pre-applications from households or small businesses;
defining an agreement with installers and banks;
assistance to households and businesses by means of on-site inspection and feasibility;
appointing each customer with a trio of approved installers;
free adherence to the proposals of the partner banks by users.
In the context of green electricity, Purchasing Groups are now widespread throughout the country, especially with regard to the construction and installation of photovoltaic systems on roofs and small privately owned land. One example is the GASEnergy Association, the association's main objectives are:
promotion of savings and efficiency as the main renewable sources;
purchase of certified green electricity;
promotion of self-production by individuals and territories;
promotion of projects of particular significance.
Purchasing Groups can negotiate with energy suppliers to obtain discounted rates or special conditions for group members. This can be done  |

|   |  | through the collective purchase of large quantities of energy, which allows members to benefit from lower prices than they could obtain individually. In the case of PV installation, Purchasing Groups can negotiate with suppliers and installers to obtain group discounts on the purchase and installation of solar panels. This collective approach allows members to access sustainable technologies at a more affordable cost, promoting the widespread adoption of renewable energy solutions. With regard to the purchase of electric cars, GAs can negotiate with dealers or directly with manufacturers to obtain group discounts on the purchase of zero-emission vehicles. This type of collaboration gives members access to cheaper automotive technology, while encouraging the adoption of environmentally friendly vehicles. |  |  |  |   |

Overall, the 2030 target is an  $83\%$  reduction in emissions compared to the 2019 baseline.

The graph below shows the  $\%$  emission reductions for each sector. It should also be borne in mind that there are several actions within the plan that are not associated with directly quantifiable impacts in terms of CO2 emission reductions, but which, in addition to their ability to feed into other actions, are likely to increase the plan target.

|  1.1 Action outline | Action name | Energy requalification of private residential buildings  |
|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | The intervention involves the complete energy upgrading of private buildings, including the optimisation of the building envelope and heating/air conditioning systems. The upgrading measures include the implementation of advanced solutions to improve the building's thermal insulation. In parallel, heating and air conditioning systems will be optimized to reduce energy consumption and maximize the overall efficiency of the building and system. The action does not consider the installation of self-producing energy systems. Currently, approximately 60% of the Municipality's residential buildings are in the lowest energy class G. As part of the proposed European Directive on the energy performance of buildings, ambitious targets for improving the energy efficiency of buildings are included. It is expected that by 2030 at least 16% of non-residential buildings will outperform the worst performers, increasing to 26% by 2033. For residential buildings, the aim is to reduce the energy consumption of the building stock by 16% by 2030 and between 20% and 22% by 2035. In addition, 55% of this reduction is to be achieved by renovating the least efficient buildings. Specifically, public and non-residential buildings should be renovated and upgraded to at least energy class F by 2027 and at least class E by 2030. Residential buildings should be refurbished to become at least class G to at least class F by 2030 and at least class E by 2033. Member States must then set specific timetables for the transition to higher energy performance classes by means of new national building renovation plans, in line with the path they have set for themselves to have a zero-emission building stock by 2050. The Municipality of Prato will encourage this action with measures such as the energy desk, information and awareness campaigns, building  |

|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | The intervention envisages the replacement of boilers with heat pumps, with the aim of involving 85% of private buildings not included in the complete energy requalification intervention (Sheet 1.1). According to the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (NIPEC), a strengthening of policies to promote energy efficiency in the residential sector is envisaged at national level. This involves achieving a redevelopment of the existing building stock. A crucial aspect for the reduction of building-related emissions concerns the more widespread adoption of heat pumps as the primary heating system. Heat pumps represent advanced technological solutions that allow not only heating but also room air conditioning and domestic hot water production. In addition, the development of heat pumps and the electrification of other uses will be favored by the increasing spread of domestic photovoltaic systems. This technology plays a strategic role in the air-conditioning of civil buildings in the Prato area, as it maximizes energy efficiency and reduces environmental impact. The Municipality of Prato will encourage this action with measures such as the energy desk, information and awareness campaigns, building regulations, energy planning and bureaucratic simplification. These measures will aim to: - facilitate the authorisation process - oblige action to be taken before national obligations or achieve higher performance values than national ones - make known all the possible incentives that can be accessed to finance the type of intervention concerned - raise awareness among stakeholders for change  |

| 1.3 Action outline | Action name | Replacing gas hobs with induction hobs |
| Action type | Technical interventions |
| Action description | With a view to improving household heat consumption efficiency, the replacement of traditional hobs with induction hobs certainly plays a key role. This intervention would lead to an increase in heat exchange efficiency, due to the fact that induction hobs directly heat the cooking vessel, guaranteeing maximum energy efficiency (lower energy consumption for the same amount of heat transmitted), with a reduction in average cooking times. In addition, the conversion of thermal consumption into electrical consumption would allow the needs to be covered by green energy (self-produced and/or purchased). Currently, in Italy, the purchase of an induction hob can benefit from the furniture bonus, with a tax deduction of 50% over 10 years (with an expenditure ceiling of €8,000 for 2023 and €5.000 for 2024, as part of renovation work). Induction hobs are expected to increase significantly in the European market by 2040, and are expected to be the most widespread technology in the coming years, as shown in the graph below. |

|  1.4 Action outline | Action name | Replacing an obsolete household appliance for low-income households  |
|   | Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   | Action description | In the current context, a large part of a household's energy consumption is directly related to the use of obsolete, low energy class appliances. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that many households are unable to replace these appliances due to financial constraints. The cost incurred by households for energy consumption could be reduced through the adoption of more efficient appliances. To address this challenge, specific support actions for low-income households should be identified, providing them with access to more modern and sustainable technologies. This would not only help reduce long-term costs, but also promote greater energy efficiency and mitigate the negative environmental impact associated with the use of low-efficiency appliances.

In this context, the action identified for the Municipality of Prato envisages the replacement of an obsolete household appliance (chosen from ovens, fridges, dishwashers and washing machines) with a class at least A+ for low-income households.

The Municipality will undertake to find the funds for an annual call for tenders to incentivise the purchase of higher efficiency appliances, which will be repeated until 2030.

These annual calls for tenders offer continuity in assisting households, promoting the use of energy-efficient technology and contributing to the long-term reduction of energy consumption in the Municipality. This action not only aims to have a positive impact on the environment, but also to provide support to low-income households with a positive effect on the household economy in the long run.  |

|  1.5 Action outline | Action name | Replacement of fluorescent lamps with LED lamps in residential buildings  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | Energy consumption related to room lighting typically accounts for a significant share of total household consumption, ranging from 10% to 60% of total consumption in homes. In view of sustainability, it is crucial to increase the energy efficiency of lighting devices and maximize the use of natural light in order to reduce the energy demand and thus the environmental impact of buildings.
In recent years, developments in production cycles have offered considerably more efficient alternatives to conventional lamps. LED lamps provide vastly superior energy efficiency and compensate for higher initial costs with an extremely longer service life.
The high-efficiency lamp market has experienced sustained growth in the past years and It is estimated to continue to grow exponentially until 2026, thanks to product optimisation and regulatory guidelines that have banned low-efficiency lamps in the European Union for several years.
In this context, the intervention identified for the Municipality of Prato envisages the replacement of low-efficiency lamps with modern high-efficiency LED lamps in private homes. LED lamps are considerably more energy efficient than fluorescent lamps, consume less energy to produce the same amount of light, thus reducing costs for the households involved and contributing to an overall decrease in energy consumption.
The Municipality of Prato will encourage this action with measures such as the energy desk and information and awareness-raising campaigns.  |

|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | As far as Prato's district companies are concerned, there is a structural plan that is currently active for Macrolotto 1 and will also become active for Macrolotto 2 and the Artisan Areas in 2025.
Prato's 1st Industrial Macrolotto is the largest industrial subdivision built in Italy in the 1980s on a totally private initiative.
This industrial area extends in the southern district of the Municipality of Prato for about 150 hectares, where today more than 700 micro and small enterprises employ about three to four thousand people.
Once these works and the production and office settlements envisaged by the subdivision plan were completed, the 1st Macrolotto gave rise to the company 'CONSER, consortium services of the 1st Industrial Macrolotto of Prato' to better protect the investments by qualifying the area from both the infrastructural and service points of view and to manage the centralized water recycling plant with annexed industrial and fire-fighting aqueduct.
The general objective of the action is to define and implement on the area related to Macrolotto 1 strategies for the technological-environmental requalification of the industrial building heritage and the effects of the possible environmental and bioclimatic improvements deriving from them. Starting from the framework of the current urban planning forecasts for the area, the research experiments with design solutions that aim to prefigure an architectural and environmental redevelopment of Macrolotto 1, through a densification of the built environment that guarantees zero land consumption while significantly increasing the available usable surfaces, that aims to enhance urban resilience, to reduce and subtract CO2 emissions, to mitigate the urban heat island effect and to sustainably manage the runoff of rainwater on urban surfaces. In particular, the research has explored solutions for the extension of industrial buildings that go beyond the thresholds set by the Operational Plan's Technical Implementation Regulations, demonstrating the possibility of substantially increasing industrial volumes, given the unavailability of additional areas designated for this function in the Municipality, with extension scenarios that guarantee an improvement in the buildings'  |

The general strategic actions proposed for the redevelopment of the industrial building fabric from a climate-neutral perspective, through zero land take densification, urban greening, sustainable runoff management and urban heat island mitigation in the area, concern:

energy and environmental redevelopment with the possibility of extension of industrial buildings, with the aim of increasing the usable surface area and at the same time differentiating and improving the quality of spaces, while ensuring a substantial reduction in energy requirements and related climate-changing emissions, through:

Expansion of industrial buildings at zero land consumption with additions in superelevation or alternatively with construction of new volumes 'bridging' over existing buildings;
Energy retrofitting of building envelopes to adapt their thermal insulation capacity to current regulations with the adoption of external insulation;
Installation of solar renewable energy generation systems on roofs, with a raised canopy type to reduce the heat input to the building below and at the same time ensure shading of the roofs with integrated green roof technology solutions;
Implementation of solar renewable energy systems with canopies on car parks and in public spaces.

|   |  | The environmental rebalancing of open spaces and urban areas, through: • Urban reforestation interventions; • Modification of road sections for the insertion of bioswales, technological-environmental systems capable of regulating and managing the stormwater cycle; • Transformation of road surfaces through the adoption of strategies and design solutions aimed at reducing the road cross-section by favoring the introduction of alternative mobility systems (public mobility and bicycle and pedestrian mobility). In view of the volume bonus, the University of Rome 'La Sapienza' carried out a study on Macrolotto 1 proposing a scenario of redevelopment and extension of industrial buildings with minimal transformation and 26% enlargement. In particular, a minimal intervention is proposed, non-invasive with respect to the existing building, with a 26% enlargement of the gross usable surface area with respect to the existing one. The intervention modalities refer to sheds with prefabricated or reinforced concrete frame structure (added together they make up 94.5% of the total) and aim at not interfering with the continuation of the activities present on site, not going to affect the inside of the buildings except punctually. The main variables taken into account when defining the interventions are the type of roofing and the length of one of the sides, less than 30 m. Two main types of interventions are proposed: • façade extensions, raised above ground level, to ensure access to the structure by vehicles and goods and not to increase land occupation, leading in some cases to the need for small portions of demolition; • bridge elevations for buildings with a side of less than 30 m, with a structure independent of the main hall and elevated approximately 2 m above the existing roof or for those greater than 30 m with the need to drill holes in the roof to insert structural pillars. The demolitions are partial, referring to the connecting sheds or to part of the office areas. In addition, existing photovoltaics are retained, when present. However, photovoltaic canopies are only to be installed on extensions, flat roofs or on the sloping part of sheds. It is proposed to install green roofs on roofs that do not accommodate photovoltaics or sheds. Starting from the energy consumption outlined above, the introduction of a photovoltaic energy grid was planned on canopies strategically positioned above the new building  |

|   | elevations, strategically positioned above the industrial buildings and largely above the new extension volumes built on top, using 500 Wp panels for a total surface area of 400,062 square meters, 37.4% of the total roof surface area. The total installed power is 119,779 kWp. Only the benefits in terms of emission reduction linked to the installation of new photovoltaic systems have been accounted for in this sheet, while, due to the absence of specific data, the potential benefits linked to the reduction of the building's energy demand (mainly linked to an improvement in the thermal insulation of the existing parts considering that the extensions will have to be zero emission net of the photovoltaic installation) have been neglected. The effects of heat island reduction fall under the specific adaptation section. Potential absorptions related to urban reforestation interventions, on the other hand, have been considered separately in the offsetting section.

Potential absorptions related to urban reforestation interventions, on the other hand, have been considered separately in the offsetting section. In addition to the redevelopment in Macrolotto 1, similar projects are also planned for the district companies in Macrolotto 2 and the Artisan Areas from 2025. From the analysis conducted on the 2nd Macrolotto in Prato, it represents a vast industrial development area that was created in the 1980s thanks to private initiative. It extends over about 150 hectares in the southern district of the Municipality of Prato and hosts more than 400 micro and small enterprises, providing employment for about 3.000 employees.

# Figure - Typology and boundaries of the buildings in Macrolotto 2

The figure below shows that areas amounting to approximately 754.700 square meters have been built in Macrolotto 2 in Prato. Photovoltaic emerges as a key technology for Prato's Macrolotto 2 in the coming years, as the installation of solar panels on industrial roofs offers numerous advantages. These include:

Exploitation of existing space: Industrial rooftops represent a vast available and often under-utilized area, so installing photovoltaic panels on these spaces maximizes land use without having to occupy additional land.
Renewable energy production: Photovoltaic enables the generation of clean and renewable energy.
Economic benefits: The installation of photovoltaic systems can generate significant savings on energy bills, as well as the possibility of potential incentives for renewable energy production.
Corporate sustainability: Companies within Macrolotto 2 can demonstrate a concrete commitment to environmental sustainability by integrating clean energy sources into their daily operations.

|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | The Municipality has decided to promote a series of initiatives aimed at supporting energy efficiency in the textile district until 2030.
From this point of view, some 38 companies in the course of 2023 have already initiated various actions within the framework of the financing provided for within the “Energy Efficiency Call for Companies in the Prato-Pistoia Textile District”, managed by the Prato-Pistoia Chamber of Commerce and described within the financing sheets among the implementation tools.
The data of the companies, that took part in the call, as well as the type of interventions carried out, were used as a basis for the evaluation of future scenarios and potential savings, foreseeing the involvement of new companies with a target of approximately 300 projects financed by 2030 (considering that of the 108 requests for funding received by the Municipality, only 38 have currently been financed to reach the maximum ceiling of 4. With this in mind, it is planned to set up a special call for tenders aimed at incentivising efficiency-boosting interventions, especially focused on the reduction of thermal and electrical consumption with particular attention to small and medium-sized enterprises, which will be encouraged through higher contribution percentages.
The first category of interventions will aim to support projects to reduce thermal energy consumption within the textile district companies.
This could include, for example, actions such as replacing steam generators, reusing thermal waste, insulating machinery and piping, installing systems for monitoring and rational thermal energy management, and other solutions aimed at improving efficiency in the thermal sector.
At the same time, the second category of interventions will be dedicated to improving the efficiency of electricity consumption, with the aim of financing projects aimed at, for example, replacing electric motors with high-efficiency  |

|   |  | units, installing inverters, replacing compressors and/or improving the efficiency of compressed air distribution systems, improving the energy efficiency of production processes and lighting systems, modernizing electrical substations, and installing systems for monitoring and rational management of electricity.

This initiative therefore aims to replicate the successes achieved through the already active public funding programme, with a commitment from the Municipality to renew the two-year call.

In addition, participating companies will be encouraged to purchase certified renewable electricity through Guarantees of Origin, thus demonstrating their commitment to a sustainable energy transition.

The Municipality of Prato will also promote the implementation of this action with measures such as energy desks and information and awareness campaigns.  |

This obligation will become increasingly stringent in the coming years until 2028, when it will also include SMEs listed on EU-regulated markets. In terms of climate change in particular, companies are required in the ESRS to provide evidence that their greenhouse gas emission reduction targets are science-based and compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C.
One of the most popular initiatives to enable organizations to define targets and related mitigation plans in line with the objectives defined in the Paris Agreement is the Science-Based Target Initiatives (SBTI).
The initiative, a collaboration between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), aims to provide a standardized and scientifically sound approach to guide companies towards a state of carbon neutrality in a manner consistent with social climate and sustainability goals and within the biophysical limits of the planet. Specifically, the SBTI Net-Zero Standard defines corporate “net-zero” as a pathway characterized by two phases:
Reduce emissions in Scopes 1, 2 and 3 to zero, or to a residual level consistent with achieving net-zero global emissions, or to a sector level in eligible pathways aligned to 1.5°C;
Permanently neutralize any residual emissions upon reaching the target year zero and any greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere thereafter.  |

|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | The first intervention identified in the municipal sector envisages the optimisation of the management aspects related to energy consumption, through the entrusting of the management and maintenance service of the thermal power plants of municipal buildings, with related technological improvement and building and plant energy upgrading. The actions envisaged include, for example, specific interventions on building automation systems aimed at a punctual management of the temperatures inside individual rooms and high monitoring and control capabilities. In detail, from a contractual point of view, the Municipality intends to contract the energy management service through Energy Performance Contracting (EPC). This is a type of contract that provides the Municipality with guaranteed energy savings and facilitated access to third-party financing (FTT). The EPC, in fact, foresees that the ESCo (i.e. the service provider) carries out energy efficiency upgrading and improvement of facilities and buildings owned by the Municipality. The investment is borne by the ESCo, which may use its own or third-party financial means. The Municipality, for the duration of the contract, pays the ESCo a share of the energy savings generated by the efficiency measures. In this way the ESCo recovers the initial investment.  |

|  3.2 Action outline | Action name | Efficiency enhancement of sports facilities  |
|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | In the context of public buildings, facilities and services, specific actions for sports facilities in the Prato area have been identified within the emission reduction plan.
In this case, there are plans to improve thermal consumption efficiency by replacing obsolete thermal energy production plants with more efficient systems.
In particular, the targets set for 2030 include the replacement of systems used for generating thermal energy in swimming pools, gyms and serving football and rugby pitches.
The gradual replacement of systems is assumed in order to favor more efficient systems, functional for different uses, aiming at electrification (e.g. replacing boilers with heat pumps).
The panorama of buildings used for sports in the Municipality of Prato is varied and consists of various open-air facilities, each equipped with at least one pair of changing rooms, currently served by a gas or LPG heating plant. The number amounts to 22 buildings used for football, rugby and five-a-side football, to which must be added the 'Lungobisenzio' municipal stadium, the 'M. Ferrari' athletics track and 3 tennis courts.
Other facilities for outdoor sports practice are the model car track in lolo, the skate park area in viale Galilei and the archery field in Via Gora del Pero, all equipped with small heat production systems.
The indoor sports buildings of city importance are the 'Pala Kobiliça' sports hall and the 'Palarogai' skating rink.
In addition, the Municipality of Prato owns five indoor swimming facilities and the 'Colzi-Martini' swimming facility in Via Roma with outdoor pools.
The new rehabilitation pool in Via Roma is under construction and the new Olympic-size pool in lolo is being planned.
Also owned by the municipal administration are eight bowling alleys, located at various points in the city in the vicinity of green areas, each generally equipped with a heating system for heating the interior rooms.
The number of school gyms in which amateur or competitive sports activities are practiced is 29,  |

|   | Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   | Action description | Among the actions planned for sports facilities in the Prato area, in addition to the actions expressly focused on thermal consumption efficiency (described in the previous sheet), specific actions have also been identified to reduce electricity consumption.
The European Commission established strict ecodesign requirements for light sources in the EU Ecodesign Regulation 2019/2020 (Single Lighting Regulation, SLR). In spring 2022, the EU Commission also revised the ROHS DIRECTIVE 2011/65/EU and further restricted the exemptions for the use of mercury in light sources defined in Annex III. As a result of these legal measures, the following lamp types can no longer be placed on the EU market:
T5 circular fluorescent lamps from 25 February 2023;
Compact fluorescent lamps with plug-in base (CFLni) as from 25 February 2023;
T5 and T8 linear fluorescent lamps as from 25 August 2023;
Halogen bulbs (G4, GY6.35, G9) from 1 September 2023.
In this case, re-lamping of the lighting systems in the halls, gyms and swimming pools, as well as indoor premises, will be planned in line with the requirements of the regulations.
The current context sees a gradual but sporadic replacement of lighting fixtures in sports venues (mainly halogen or metal halide) with LED lighting fixtures.
In the complete replacement, foreseen within the scope of the action described, the lighting requirements provided for by the CONI regulations and the federal regulations of the sector, for the level of discipline practiced, must be verified, also taking into consideration - for swimming facilities - the peculiar phenomenon of reflection and refraction of light on the water surface.
The interventions include the replacement of old lamps and ceilings with new high-efficiency LED  |

|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | Within the reduction plan, specific strategies were also included for Public Residential Housing. Specifically, between 2014 and 2020, a total of 498 pre-existing boilers were removed and replaced with condensing models as part of an energy improvement programme. The analysis of the impact of these replacements, defined only over the two-year period 2019-2020, shows a significant reduction in consumption. In addition, specific work was carried out at three buildings located at via del Girasole 26/1-2-3, consisting of 18 dwellings subject to Public Residential Housing regulations. These involved the dismantling and subsequent replacement of single-glazed wooden window frames with new PVC frames with high energy performance, characterized by a thermal transmittance coefficient (Uw) of at least 1.29 W/sq mK, with additional masonry work for proper installation. Similar work was carried out in three other facilities located in via del Malfante 54, 56 and 71, involving 20 dwellings subject to Public Residential Housing regulations. Here, the single-glazed wooden window frames were replaced with new energy-efficient white PVC frames, accompanied by minor masonry work for an appropriate fit. The overall effect of these actions was a significant improvement in the energy efficiency of the buildings concerned, evidenced by the advancement of the overall energy class from G to F, as assessed through energy audits. N.B. Reductions in consumption and emissions have been accounted for within the residential buildings sector.  |

|   |  Action description | Also in the context of the Public Residential Housing, further future efficiency actions are planned at the buildings located at via del Girasole 26/1-2-3 and via del Malfante 71, through an energy upgrading programme between 2022 and 2026. In both cases, similar interventions will be carried out: building insulation, roof insulation, installation of thermoregulation systems, replacement of condensing boilers and seismic upgrading with re-roofing. These interventions will allow an advancement of three energy classes, from F to C.
In addition, during the period 2022-2026, significant interventions have been planned on two buildings located at via Rubieri 49-55 and via Zipoli 23/29, involving a total of 48 dwellings subject to Public Residential Housing regulations. These interventions include roof insulation, replacement of window frames, introduction of new shutters, installation of thermoregulation systems, replacement of condensing boilers, and seismic improvement works. Together, these interventions have led from energy class G to class E.
At the same time, in the context of the 110% Superbonus programme, energy efficiency measures were started on two buildings located at via Capitini 1-13 and via Parini 16-18, involving 54 and 24 dwellings respectively, some of which are subject to Public Residential Housing regulations. The interventions consisted in the construction of thermal insulation, replacement of window frames, introduction of new shutters and installation of new condensing boilers. These works led to an energy improvement from energy class G to class E.
Finally, an energy efficiency intervention was carried out on a building located via Rondine 16, involving 6 dwellings, one of which is subject to Public Residential Housing regulations. The intervention involved the construction of a thermal coat, bringing the building from energy class G to energy class E.  |

|   |  Action description | As far as self-production from RES is concerned, based on the analysis of the territory's actual potential, the installation of photovoltaic panels for a total power of about 3 MWp has been planned.
The Municipality is also planning to build a third photovoltaic plant at the 'Coderino' landfill, which has already undergone reclamation and safety works, with a total capacity of about 1.990 kWp.
In particular, the sizing of the systems was based on the 20% coverage of energy consumption in the residential sector estimated to 2030, which also considers the increases in electricity consumption linked to electrification strategies (e.g. heat pumps and induction hobs) and the expected benefits of energy efficiency measures.
According to a study carried out in the Prato area, this intervention would require the installation of panels on an area corresponding to about 4% of the total potential useful area of the public sector.
The Municipality will undertake to find the funds to finance the interventions directly, also thanks to contributions obtained at national or European level.  |

|  4.1 Action outline | Action name | Replacing boilers with heat pumps in tertiary buildings  |
|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | According to the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (NIPEC), policies to promote energy efficiency in the tertiary sector are to be strengthened. This involves achieving a redevelopment of the existing building stock. A crucial aspect for the reduction of building-related emissions concerns the more widespread adoption of heat pumps as the primary heating system. Heat pumps represent advanced technological solutions that allow not only heating but also room air conditioning and domestic hot water production. In addition, the development of heat pumps and the electrification of other uses will potentially be fostered by the increasing spread of photovoltaic systems. This technology plays a strategic role in the air-conditioning of civil buildings in the area, as it maximizes energy efficiency and reduces environmental impact. The PNIEC emphasises the importance of this energy transition, encouraging the use of heat pumps as one of the preferred solutions for air conditioning in buildings. In this context, the action defined on the territory of Prato envisages the replacement of boilers with heat pumps in the activities operating in the tertiary sector, with the objective of involving the activities responsible for about 50% of the thermal consumption for the global heating of the sector and an expected saving of 18,828 MWh. A primary role in the implementation of this action will be played by the three new Steering Committees: Steering Committee for actions in the public service sector (State Institutions, Tuscany Region, Province of Prato, ASL Toscana Centro, University of Florence, etc.); Steering Committee for actions in the field of private services of public interest (Diocese of Prato, ETS, Third Sector, Associations, etc.); Steering Committee for private sector actions (large-scale retail trade, trade associations and services, etc.). The Municipality of Prato will encourage this action with measures such as the energy desk, information and awareness campaigns, building regulations, energy planning and bureaucratic simplification. These measures will aim to: facilitate the authorisation process obliging action to be taken before national obligations or achieving higher performance values than national ones  |

|   |  Action type | Other/Governance & Policy  |
|   |  Action description | In the territory of Prato, a trade union ordinance will be issued pursuant to Article 5 of Presidential Decree 74/2013 aimed at establishing restrictions on the use of air conditioning systems (heating and cooling) inside private buildings, with the objective of managing energy consumption more effectively. With regard to heating, the regulation will provide for a maximum set point temperature set at 19°C, with a tolerance of ±2°C. In addition, the operating period of the plants will be reduced by 15 days compared to the current regulations, foreseeing, for example, a delayed start-up of 8 days compared to the usual switch-on date and an earlier end of 7 days compared to the traditional switch-off date. The daily operating time of the plants will be reduced by 1 hour. This initiative is an extension of the Ministerial Decree of 6 October 2022 No. 383 (valid for the reference year 2022-2023), known as the 'National Plan for the Containment of Gas Consumption - Heating Containment Measure'. As far as cooling is concerned, the regulation stipulates a minimum temperature set point of 28 °C. According to ENEA good practices, an increase of the thermostat set point from 26 to 28 °C could result in energy savings of approximately 25% on the electricity used for cooling. The ordinance is expected to come into force in 2024. This measure aimed at regulating and optimizing the use of heating and cooling systems is part of broader strategies aimed at promoting a more responsible use of energy resources and reducing environmental impact, in accordance with the objectives of sustainability and limiting energy consumption. The Municipality of Prato will also encourage this action with measures such as energy counters and information and awareness campaigns Finally, special attention will be given to the issue of controls and sanctions, a necessary  |

|  4.3 Action outline | Action name | Installation of photovoltaic panels to cover the electrical needs of the tertiary sector  |
|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | As far as self-production from RES is concerned, based on the analysis of the territory's actual potential, the installation of photovoltaic panels on the useful surfaces of the roofs of tertiary activities has been planned for a total power of about 57 MWp and an expected producibility of 68,380 MWh of electricity.
The sizing of the systems was based on the coverage of 20% of the residential sector's estimated energy consumption by 2030, which also takes into account increases in electricity consumption linked to electrification strategies (heat pumps) and the expected benefits of energy efficiency measures.
A primary role in the implementation of this action will be played by the three new Steering Committees:
• Cabina di Regia for actions in the public service sector (State Institutions, Tuscany Region, Province of Prato, ASL Toscana Centro, University of Florence, etc.);
• Cabina di Regia for actions in the field of private services of public interest (Diocese of Prato, ETS, Third Sector, Associations, etc.);
• Steering committee for private sector actions (large-scale retail trade, trade and service associations, etc.).
In addition to national incentives for such interventions, the Municipality of Prato will encourage this action with measures such as the energy desk, information and awareness campaigns, building regulations, energy planning and bureaucratic simplification.
These measures will aim to:
• facilitate the authorisation process
• obliging action to be taken before national obligations or achieving higher performance values than national ones
• make known all the possible incentives that can be accessed to finance the type of intervention concerned  |

|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | On farms, diesel consumption in tractors is one of the main items in terms of climate-changing gas emissions. A viable alternative, with a view to reducing the carbon footprint, is to replace diesel tractors with biodiesel tractors. Biodiesel is a biofuel, i.e. a fuel obtained from renewable sources such as vegetable oils and animal fats. Modern technologies implemented in tractors allow the use of biodiesel, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The INAIL notice¹ of 2023 offered a specific example of a financial incentive for tractor replacement, and it is plausible to expect a number of similar initiatives at national or regional level in the coming years. From this point of view, the action identified for the Prato area envisages that out of the total number of farms with at least one diesel tractor, 60 per cent will have replaced their tractors with biodiesel technology by 2030, reducing consumption by 5,691 MWh thermal. The action will be promoted through indirect measures by the Municipality, both through activities carried out by the Energy Desk in favour of local agricultural entrepreneurs, and through the dissemination of information on existing calls for tenders in the agricultural sector and with specific support activities for joining them. The Municipality will take steps to make the supply of biofuel easier.  |

|  5.2 Action outline | Action name | Modernisation of agricultural machinery and vehicle fleet  |
|   | Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   | Action description | The efficiency of agricultural machinery, together with the adoption of sustainable farming practices, are two other important items in the reduction of farm emissions.

From this point of view, the intervention defined for agricultural enterprises operating in the Municipality of Prato aims to promote the upgrading of agricultural machinery (replacement of obsolete machinery) and to introduce precision farming techniques and Agriculture 5.0 technologies. The aim is to improve agricultural production and reduce environmental impact through the use of modern equipment and advanced practices.

Possible actions include the purchase of machinery, equipment and devices aimed at

• support investments in precision agriculture;
• purchase of advanced machinery, field sensors, weather stations, data collection drones, automatic handling systems, automatically guided vehicles and flexible handling systems, with control and data transmission capabilities for remote diagnostics, remote control and monitoring of working conditions and processes;
• purchase of specific machinery and equipment to reduce the use of plant protection products and optimise the use of fertilisers;
• purchase of advanced equipment for the livestock sector, characterised by a high level of technology and automation.

The intervention therefore envisages the modernisation of agricultural machinery and vehicle fleets (excluding tractors considered in action 5.1) with a view to the gradual implementation of Agriculture 5.0 practices and technologies in the main farms operating in the Prato area, which are cumulatively responsible for a total thermal consumption of at least 3,000 MWh_{th}.

The action will be promoted through indirect measures by the Municipality, both through  |

|  5.3 Action outline | Action name | Agri-voltaic installation  |
|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | Agro-voltaics, with its innovative fusion of solar energy production and agricultural practices, brings with it a number of concrete advantages. According to estimates made using the FADN (Agricultural Accountancy Data Network) database, the energy supply costs borne by farms across the country (including fossil fuels for fuel and combustibles) represent on average more than 20% of variable costs, with higher percentages for some production sectors, such as granivores (around 30%). Therefore, investments dedicated to energy efficiency and the production of renewable energy for self-consumption result in lower costs that can increase, even significantly, agricultural profitability.  |

Furthermore, the introduction of agri-voltaics creates opportunities for shared value creation in the area. Collaboration with agronomists, agricultural enterprises and stakeholders in the sector will foster the exchange of knowledge and technology, encouraging innovation in existing agricultural practices and promoting beneficial synergies for the entire community. Another major benefit is to offer farmers an additional source of income, allowing them to reinvest in their farming activities. This will not only help increase competitiveness, but also contribute to enhancing the efficiency of local farming operations. It is important to emphasise that agri-voltaics is particularly suitable for permanent crops such as meadows and pastures, while it may not be optimal for arable land mainly dedicated to cereal and wheat crops (although specific

|   | solutions have already been studied for this type of crop as well). An agri-voltaic system must be characterised by configurations aimed at guaranteeing the continuity of the agricultural activity: this requirement can be declined in terms of 'density' In order to assess the density of the photovoltaic application with respect to the installation site, it is possible to consider indicators such as power density (MW/ha) or the percentage of the total area covered by the modules (LAOR). On the basis of a study of the actual potential of the Prato area, the installation of agri-voltaic modules was planned considering only agricultural areas related to permanent crops, permanent meadows and pastures, and excluding arable land (because it consists mainly of cereals and wheat) When dimensioning, good industry practice suggests adopting a maximum LAOR of 40%. In our case, as a precaution, we considered a LAOR of 30%, estimating the power density with the following formula: [MW/ha] = 0.6 (LAOR 30%, modules 350 W). Based on this assessment, the specific intervention involves the installation of 350W agri-voltaic modules for a total of about 190 MWp. This power would use about 7% of the agricultural area of the Prato territory. In addition to national incentives for such interventions, the Municipality of Prato will encourage this action with measures such as the energy desk, information and awareness campaigns, energy planning and bureaucratic simplification. These measures will aim to: - facilitate the authorisation process - make known all the possible incentives that can be accessed to finance the type of intervention concerned - raising awareness among stakeholders for change In order to achieve the above objectives, it will also be important to promote the development of Energy Communities in the Municipality. It should be noted that the Municipality has already committed itself, with Municipal Council Resolution No. 306 of 03/10/2023, to support and promote initiatives that may lead to the development of Renewable Energy Communities with a view to a concrete and effective sustainable development at local level in implementation of Legislative Decree 199/2021 and Tuscan Regional Law 42/2022.

|   |  Action type | Physical/ spatial interventions  |
|   |  Action description | One of the most important strategies envisaged to reduce the use of private vehicles within the Municipality of Prato is based on the strengthening of the local public transport (LPT) system, with the aim of increasing LPT use from the current 6% to 50% by 2030
To achieve this target, a number of specific actions have been identified:
• build the first urban tramway line Stazione c.le-Museo Pecci, capable of transporting at least 2,000 passengers per hour per direction increasing the frequency from 3 to 6 passages per hour on average on the LPT network,
• increase the number of buses from 60 to 90 during peak hours, with only electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles
• make access to the service free of charge for all users, at least for a period of time.
The urban tramway and plays a strategic role in completing the metro-tramway connection between the cities of Florence and Prato along the 'Firenze Peretola-Prato Museo Pecci - Prato ex-Banci area' ridge, representing a key intervention in the framework of the development of collective mobility systems in the metropolitan area.
With regard to the realisation of the integrated tramway system, the Municipality of Prato has already signed a PROGRAMME AGREEMENT FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE FIORENTINE TRAILWAY SYSTEM IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA AND THE METROPOLITAN INFRASTRUCTURAL CONNECTION  |

|   |  | BETWEEN THE CITIES OF FLORENCE AND PRATO, which aims to
• To define a strategic reference framework concerning the guided collective mobility system in the metropolitan area, including respectively the completion of the Florentine tramway network, its metropolitan extensions and the extension of this system to the city of Prato along the strategic backbone 'Firenze Peretola - Prato Est Museo Pecci - Prato ex-Banci area'.
• Define the implementation modalities of the tramway extension 3.2.1 "Piazza della Libertà - Bagno a Ripoli" financed for the amount of EUR 80 million by the 2014-2020 Development and Cohesion Fund through the reprogramming and new allocation of resources to the Region of Tuscany approved by CIPE Resolution 40/2020.
• Identifying ways to start and continue projects, and defining strategies for finding the necessary financial resources within a shared priority framework.
The Municipality will endeavour to find the funds to finance the interventions directly, also thanks to contributions obtained at national or European level.  |

|   |  Action type | Physical/ spatial interventions  |
|   |  Action description | In order to further reduce the share of journeys by private vehicles in the most densely populated urban area (a necessary objective not only for reducing emissions but also for increasing road safety and the usability of public spaces), in addition to the strengthening of the LPT (sheet 6.1), the strategy envisages increasing the attractiveness of the main road network in such a way as to allow for greater traffic fluidity. In particular, through the enhancement of some particularly congested infrastructural nodes it is possible to considerably reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere due to stationary vehicles in traffic jams, as well as to save time for users. The objective of the action is therefore to strengthen the main road network in order to limit the improper use of the local road network by reducing, within the latter, the so-called 'through traffic', i.e. that component that has crossed the dense city to reach a destination outside it. In quantitative terms, the aim is to reduce local traffic using private vehicles with internal combustion engines (car/motorbike/van), with the goal of reducing its use from the current 82% to 26% by 2030. By improving the practicability of the main road system, access to the interchange car parks for the car-LPT modal exchange is also favoured. These car parks, in fact, as provided for by the recently adopted Structural Plan, are located right on the main road system and connected to the public transport system. With regard to the main road network, the infrastructure, upgrading and safety measures included in the assumed scenario include in detail • Completion of the Second West Ring Road (Lots 3 and 6): the intervention is aimed at giving continuity to the alternative route to the west,  |

|   |  | mending the relations between Nuova Montalese, Via Pistoiese and the roundabout in Viale Unione Europea; in addition, the southern section, already almost completely completed, of the second ring road between Via Ponte dei Bini and the 'Declassata' is to be opened to traffic. • Redevelopment of the 'Declassata' (viale Leonardo da Vinci): the intervention is on the municipal, regional and national agenda thanks to the recent agreement between the parties for the development of the detailed design of the doubling of V.le Leonardo da Vinci in the area between via Nenni and via Marx (the so-called 'Soccorso' subway, see next box). To the west of the city, the 'Declassata' axis will be affected by the widening to four lanes Urban Plan of Sustainable Mobility of Prato Plan Document 41 (two in each direction) in the short stretch near the junction with the second western ring road. An intervention of a completely different calibre concerns the arrangement of the most central part of the infrastructure, near the 'Soccorso' (first aid station), with the provision of a separation of transit vehicle flows from those at destination, to be realised by means of a subway. Subway of the "Soccorso" The doubling of the "Declassata" between Via Nenni and Via Marx envisages the construction of a tunnel approximately 500 metres long with two lanes in each direction. The estimated cost of the work is approximately 60 million euro, completely financed with ministerial funds. • Roads in the hamlets: this category includes the new road connection between the hamlets of Tobbiana and Iolo connected to the three-lane widening of the A11 motorway. • Safety and redevelopment works: the redevelopment of the system of squares to the north of the historic centre (Piazza Mercatale, Piazza Ciardi and Piazza del Mercato Nuovo) is part of the broader strategy of enhancing and promoting the public spaces that hinge on the Serraglio station and the University. The redevelopment of the three squares, included in the Reference Scenario, is the first step in this strategy. On the road system front, the redevelopment of Via Foscolo is planned through the realignment of the road layout between the New Hospital roundabout and the Via Ciulli roundabout.  |

|   |  Action description | The Pedibus is a walking bus, a caravan of children travelling to school in groups, accompanied by two parents: a 'driver' and a 'controller' who closes the line. The Pedibus travels in sunshine and rain and everyone, accompanying adults and children, wears a high-visibility waistcoat. Like a real bus, it departs from a specific point and, following a set route, picks up passengers at designated stops along the way. The parents responsible for each individual pedibus ensure that it is started and maintained. It is currently one of the safest, most environmentally friendly and fun ways to get to school. The initiative, promoted by the Demos project, has been very successful. To date, in fact, ten schools in Prato have taken part in this activity (Scuola Alberto Manzi, Scuola Cicognini, Scuola Italo Calvino, Scuola Cesare Guasti, Scuola Antonio Bruni, Scuola Dalla Chiesa Scuola Salvo D'Acquisto, Scuola Puddu Scuola Santa Gonda, Scuola Pizzidimonte, Scuola Meucci, Scuola Marcocci, Scuola Mandela, Scuola Iqbal, Scuola Don Milani, Scuola De André, Scuola Da Vinci, Scuola Ammannati) for a total of around 1,200 students. For each school that joined the Pedibus, 2 to 4 lines were activated: • green line: teddy bears • red line: panda • blue line penguins • orange line wolves  |

As part of the action plan to reduce emissions, the service is to be expanded, with the goal of increasing pedibus trips to 5,000 per day by 2030. The Municipality could enhance the pedibus service by providing the necessary material (e.g. high-visibility waistcoats) and improve signposting.  |   |   |

|   |  | In addition, an expansion of urban school transport is also envisaged by means of the use of buses with the goal of increasing the number of trips per day from the current 1,600 to 5,000 by 2030. In this case, the increase in the supply of seats is linked to the purchase of electric buses for 'closed-door' services and traditional buses (as per the previous sheet) and the introduction of subsidized forms of season tickets. The Municipality will adapt the signage to make the service safer and will provide suitable personnel to manage it. The Municipality will also endeavor to find the funds to finance the interventions directly, also thanks to contributions obtained at national or European level.  |

|   |  Action type | Physical/ spatial interventions  |
|   |  Action description | As a further action aimed at reducing the use of private cars with internal combustion engines, the Municipality plans to introduce car pooling, car sharing, bike sharing and electric scooters with the goal of reaching 5,000 trips per day by 2030. Since 2015, the city of Prato has favoured the localisation on its territory of a free-floating car sharing service in cooperation with Florence. While there is no doubt that the reality of Prato, compared to the country's metropolitan areas, presents conditions of less attractiveness and profitability for car sharing operators, there is equally no doubt that the presence of highly relevant poles of attraction make it an area of attention and development. The presence of the Pecci Museum, the museum centre of contemporary art in Tuscany, the dynamism of Prato's production market, with the influx of national/international operators, integration with the system of the Florentine metropolitan area and proximity to the airport make it an area with a marked presence of city users and thus of potential customers/users of car sharing services integrated with long-distance collective services (HS/HC, airport, etc.). It will therefore be a matter for the Administration to solicit the market of car sharing operators, giving facilities in terms of access to the urban area and making public recharging infrastructures available; this is to highlight the Administration's clear strategy in favour of converting the carsharing fleet to electric vehicles. This is confirmed by the same choice made with respect to the fleet serving public facilities.
The action also promotes the dissemination of sharing services through the support of:
• experimenting with peer-to-peer car sharing (in particular through condominium car sharing, with a preference for electric vehicles);
• technologies for the integration of the different systems, particularly with regard to the use and information of users;
• company mobility management measures that favor the replacement of company fleets.  |
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

#

|   |  | The levers that the Administration will be able to activate involve aspects of communication, information and training, in order to raise awareness of sustainable mobility models among the population, city users and commuters, as well as more tangible forms of facilitation, such as reserving parking capacity (blue lines), installing recharging points at the city's parking areas, access to regulated areas (see LTZ), etc. in order to reward virtuous behavior. In addition, the Municipality of Prato, in the context of sustainable mobility, has made 200 electric scooters available in free-floating mode. The circulation area in which it is possible to move is 16 square kilometres and includes the historic centre and other areas of the city. There are 24 stations (also called hub points) where it is possible to rent a scooter and they are all located at strategic points, such as railway stations and entrances to the historic center. The Municipality will enter into agreements with car sharing and bike sharing companies to implement the service in the area and may encourage the use of carpooling apps. In addition, the Municipality will provide benefits for companies that adopt carpooling, such as free permits to circulate in the LTZ.  |

|  6.5 Action outline | Action name | Strengthening railway transport FI-PO and Valbisenzio  |
|   | Action type | Physical/ spatial interventions  |
|   | Action description | In the area of railway transport, the primary intention is to activate Memoranda of Understanding and programme agreements with Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI) and the Region of Tuscany, in order to define common paths that are useful and necessary to achieve the construction of the new stops/stations identified, both on the Florence-Prato-Pistoia railway line and on the Prato-Bologna line along the Bisenzio Valley.

For almost one hundred years, the Florence-Prato-Bologna line was the railway infrastructure connecting Italy in a north-south direction. Since the opening of the TAV tunnel, Florence-Bologna has undergone a downgrading in terms of service, opening up new opportunities for both regional and interregional passenger traffic and national and international freight traffic. Through the investments currently being made by RFI, in particular the construction of the high-speed station in Florence (which will make it possible to free the existing tracks at the Florence Santa Maria Novella station from TAV traffic), it will be possible to increase the frequency of the service and, through the construction of new stops, to increase its capillarity. Investments will also have to be made in the types of railway vehicles so as to streamline the service in relation to stopping, stopping and restarting times.

Alongside the upgrading of the railway infrastructure, a strengthening of the rail transport service will also be necessary, which can be implemented through a series of activities, the main ones of which will be those of:

• Enhance and utilise the potential of existing railway infrastructures, such as the Florence-Prato-Pistoia line and the Prato-Bologna line, by increasing the frequency of the service (increasing the daily number of train runs), with the same railway infrastructure (without the need for infrastructure works);

• To increase the rail transport service along the Florence-Prato-Pistoia axis, both with reference to the current  |

Lucia/Coiano, thus intensifying the frequency of train passage in order to create a surface metro service along the Bisenzio Valley; · Activation of memorandums of understanding and programme agreements with Trenitalia and the Region of Tuscany, in order to define useful and necessary common paths to arrive at the allocation of greater resources to increase the service along the two railway lines Florence-Prato-Pistoia and Prato-Bologna, intensifying the frequency of train passage. In view of the special location of the Florence-Prato Pistoia railway line, an activity is planned to strengthen the relationship between this railway line and the city center based on the following interventions: · Enhancement of the Prato Porta al Serraglio station as a 'new gateway' for pedestrian access to the historic center (the 'Prato Piazza Duomo' station) for those arriving by rail along the Florence-Prato-Pistoia line, exploiting the potential of the proximity between the station and Piazza del Duomo; · Enhancement of the Prato Porta al Serraglio station as a fulcrum and potential reference point between the Florence-Prato-Pistoia railway line and its users, and the urban axis with a strong characterisation of public activities that from the Fabbricone descends towards Piazza del Mercato Nuovo, the University Pole, the car park in the Serraglio structure, the Porta al Serraglio  |

• Encourage architectural redevelopment of the Serraglio station, also as a 'New Gateway' to the city center;
• Enhancement of the central station's role as an intermodal pole between rail transport (Florence-Prato-Pistoia and Prato-Bologna) and public road transport connected to the rest of the city, as well as a priority pole connected by means of a transport infrastructure in its own/shared seat (protected bus/tramway/train lane) with the other strategic pole for Prato's mobility system, i.e. the Pecci Museum area and the former Banci (arrival point for the tramway connection between Prato and Florence Peretola currently being planned);
• Redevelopment of the pedestrian and bicycle connections of the connecting axis represented by Central Station-Ponte alla Vittoria-Piazza Europa-Viale Vittorio Veneto-Piazza San Marco-Centro Storico;
• Enhancement and strengthening of the role of the Borgonuovo station as an intermodal and landmark hub in the western part of the city, with expansion of the service parking area, improvement of its connection with the western ring road by creating a direct link with the latter, a reference node within the public road transport system, connection with the bicycle mobility system both eastwards towards the center and westwards beyond the ring road.
The Municipality, in agreement with the Region and the Municipality of Florence and Ferrovie dello Stato, will endeavor to find the necessary resources, also by activating national and European contributions, to upgrade the necessary infrastructure.  |

|   |  Action type | Physical/ spatial interventions  |
|   |  Action description | In addition to the actions already described for urban mobility, the strategy for planning actions to reduce transport-related emissions also includes a series of actions focused on extra-urban transport.
The current extra-urban lines provided by Autolinee Toscane include:

• 213FIRENZE - MONTALBANO
• 214PRATO - VAL DI BISENZIO
• 51PQFQUARRATA - FIRENZE
In particular, one of the planned actions aims to reduce the number of daily trips by private internal combustion vehicles through the expansion of extra-urban public road transport services, with the goal of achieving a 20 per cent increase in use by 2030 (compared to current values).
The other action, on the other hand, focuses on out-of-town school transport and also targets an expansion of the current service with a target of a 20 per cent increase in use by 2030.
From this point of view, the Municipality of Prato undertakes to revise the agreement with Autolinee Toscane providing for additional resources, which will be recovered through internal funds and national or European contributions, in order to optimise the service with respect to the set objective. This agreement may provide for the commissioning of new buses, an increase in frequency, and possible concessions on season tickets, especially for students.  |

|   |  Action type | Physical/ spatial interventions  |
|   |  Action description | In terms of logistics-related transport, the 'Last Mile' initiative is an important intervention included in the action plan for reducing emissions.
Through this initiative, in the area of retail delivery of goods (business supply), the aim is to limit the access of vehicles used for goods transport into the city centre, thus avoiding approximately 84,000 daily trips by 2030 with internal combustion vehicles.
In this context, the 'moving boxes' initiative envisages a series of strategies and actions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of goods from the logistics hub to the final consignee. In particular, through the introduction of 'moving boxes' of standard material and size, which can be transported both from one operator to another and from the various operators to the logistics hub in order to optimise the journeys of individual operators.
A joint action is planned to introduce an obligation to use electric vehicles for logistics and a rational and sustainable management of logistics through the City Gate project. The latter envisages a preliminary monitoring for the optimisation of transport and an operational phase with a series of vans, managed by specialised companies in the sector, which will be able to provide companies in the district with a transport service for raw materials, allowing detailed tracking of the journey.
To optimize logistics management, the Municipality will involve the Prato Interporto, identified as the main logistics hub for the Prato district, financing the various interventions either with its own funds or with contributions from supra-municipal bodies.
By concentrating the arrival of goods at the Interporto by rail, for which work is in progress to adapt the existing tunnels to the new European gauge standards for goods transport, it is possible to organize internal storage and warehouse management through the use of vehicles and machinery that use hydrogen for their traction.
The production of hydrogen can also take place within the Interport by means of an electrolysis  |

|   |  Action description | The conversion of private vehicles with internal combustion engines to electric vehicles is an action strategy envisaged in the plan after all possible reduction actions aimed at disincentivizing the use of vehicles by private individuals.
In particular, the action envisages by 2030 the conversion of 50 percent of local daily trips made by private cars and motorbikes (evaluated as the residual of trips by private vehicles after the implementation of the planned actions with reference to the strengthening of the LPT and improvement of urban roads) into electric vehicles.
In addition, in addition to local travel within the Municipality, by 2030 it is expected that 25% of the total daily extra-urban travel carried out by private cars and motorbikes will also be converted to electric (evaluated as a residue of the actions to strengthen extra-urban transport services). The Municipality will undertake to promote and make citizens aware of sustainable mobility issues through the energy desk and various events in the area and to implement infrastructural interventions in the Prato area based on the widespread distribution of electric recharging points (detailed intervention in the next sheet).  |

|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | In support of what is planned in terms of electrification of public and private vehicles, the plan calls for a commitment by the Municipality to set up electric recharging points throughout the territory. In particular, the action aims at the implementation of the territorial infrastructural works foreseen in the Electric Mobility Plan approved by the Municipality of Prato and present in the addresses of the Municipal Administration and foresees the evaluation of a possible adhesion to the convention with the Consorzio Energia Toscana (C.E.T.) to establish a framework agreement. The objective of this agreement will be to identify an entity responsible for the installation, ordinary and extraordinary maintenance, and long-term management of the electric infrastructure dedicated to recharging electric vehicles, making it accessible to the public. The actions will be carried out following the directives provided by the Municipality of Prato. During this transition to electrically powered vehicles, targeted measures are being implemented to guarantee the quality of urban spaces and areas of interaction, adhering to the principle that the introduction of electric vehicles should not compromise accessibility indiscriminately. The goal is to install around 4,000 electric charging stations by 2030 to cover the needs of bus modernisation and the replacement of private combustion cars with electric cars. Once a plan for charging points has been defined, the Municipality will draw up an expression of interest in which, for example, public land will be given free of charge for at least 10 years, so that operators can install the charging stations with their own resources, and the Municipality will not incur any financial outlay.  |

|  6.11 Action outline | Action name | Increasing soft mobility by expanding and upgrading the city's cycle network and incentivising the purchase of bicycles.  |
|   | Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   | Action description | The issue of cycling, as indicated in the PUMS, requires specific treatment in Prato that goes beyond the current view of bicycle use for recreation to establish itself as a mode of transport for everyday mobility.
The low modal share of cycling in the city is certainly not consistent with the orographic characteristics and size of the Prato territory. It will therefore be a matter of identifying and completing a bicycle and pedestrian network that makes it convenient in terms of relations served, travel time, comfort and safety to travel by bicycle not only for those who live-work in the city centre, but also for those who reach the poles of attraction of city mobility (places of work and study, public services, etc.) from the hamlets. Alongside the definition of the network scheme, the PUMS is called upon to upgrade existing relations, to recognise the integration between the urban network and the supra-local network on which the Region of Tuscany is committing itself with specific funding. Finally, in addition to the bicycle and bicycle-pedestrian network, the PUMS includes interventions on the front of the development of services and the integration of cycling with other modes of transport: from bicycle stations to the diffusion of bicycle parking points in the vicinity of poles of mobility attraction (public services, banks, shops, etc.). It should be borne in mind that the scarcity of bicycle parking points has been reported as a critical issue by the local community itself (online survey), and that at the same time these are measures that can be implemented in the short term, are certainly low-cost and characterize the commitment of the public administration.
The framework of interventions related to cycling is, already in the Reference Scenario (SR) shown in the figure below, very articulated. At present the bicycle network in Prato extends for about 60 km, mainly along nature or leisure routes (along the Bisenzio river, Fosso di Iolo, etc.). The planned linear and punctual interventions, summarized in the table below, concern:
• Bicycle network - The interventions are distributed in different parts of the  |

In addition, it is envisaged that services to cycle mobility will be realised through the construction of:

A velostation near the Prato Centrale station as part of the reorganisation of the integrated public and private mobility hub;
An equipped and safe bicycle parking area at the Prato Borgonuovo station to ensure rail-bike integration within the closest station and service to the new hospital in Prato. The intervention integrates and completes the bicycle connection between the hospital and the railway station.
Installation of racks at urban mobility hubs (schools, social and health services, shopping, leisure and sports facilities, etc.).
The Municipality will strive to promote the purchase of bicycles through communication and awareness-raising, collaborating with national initiatives such as the bicycle bonus, considering offering a subsidy of up to Euro 800 per bicycle for up to 10,000 bicycles.
Furthermore, through the energy desk and various events in the area, the Municipality will promote and raise awareness of sustainable mobility issues among citizens.

|   | Action description | On the source of local public transport, the SUMP scenario proposes interventions of particular relevance to the transport offer aimed at integrating the urban and extra-urban dimensions of public mobility services and networks.
Public mobility hub at Prato Centrale Hub of public (road-rail) and private mobility to be realised through the reorganisation of the Prato Centrale interchange.
The proposed intervention envisages the use of part (about 20 thousand m²) of the areas no longer used by the freight yard located near the main station. The presence of the Interporto and the interconnection with the railway line have led to an evident weakening of the functions of the central Prato railway yard, leaving a substantial part of areas adjacent to the consolidated city unused, with evident effects of abandonment and degradation.
At the same time, the city, due to its demographic size and vocation in the territorial context, has an urgent need to reorganise its public mobility nodes, giving dignity and value to the urban landscape while optimising vehicle flows to and from the station. This option also finds a point of attention and confirmation in the interest manifested within the POR-FESR Regione Toscana 2014-2020, which identifies in the sustainable mobility interventions actions aimed at the realisation and/or enhancement of interchange systems between different modes of movement and their equipment (such as car park-exchangers, velostations, parking areas, etc.).
ROP-ERDF Tuscany 2014-2020
• Specific Objective: Increase sustainable mobility in urban areas
• Creation of infrastructures and interchange nodes aimed at increasing collective mobility and the environmentally friendly distribution of goods and related transport systems. The new Prato 'hub' will have to perform functions:
o supporting public mobility: transit and parking of urban and suburban LPT services, bus station (ticketing, information, service to transit users, etc.);
o parking area for private vehicles (300 parking spaces), of which 10% are equipped with electric charging stations and 5% near the exits to be allocated to persons with mobility difficulties and 10%,  |

|   |  | also near the exits, to be used as 'pink parking spaces';
o velostation with cycle workshop function, etc;
o offices for the management of the bike and car sharing service;
o complementary (including commercial) activities.
The realization of the public transport hub will allow the station square to be freed from the parking of both public and private vehicles, reorganizing the spaces in such a way as to maintain the proximity of the station:
a stop for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers of public transport services; - a limited number of parking spaces for kiss and ride;
the taxi rank;
parking spaces for the car sharing service;
bike sharing service stations. An outline and dimensioning of the public transport hub is given below  |

|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | With regard to self-production from RES related to the mobility sector, a detailed analysis was conducted based on the evaluation of the actual potential of the Prato territory.
The analysis revealed an actual potential for the installation of photovoltaic systems on suitable surfaces of mobility-related facilities, in particular car parks and stations, with the goal of achieving a total capacity of about 6 MWp.
This strategy not only aims to provide a renewable energy source for the mobility sector, but also contributes to optimising the use of existing and future infrastructure by integrating sustainable solutions into urban development projects. The decision to install photovoltaic panels on these facilities underlines the commitment to a more sustainable energy transition and mobility.
Some examples of potential areas identified for the installation of modules include:
• Public area in Via Leonardo da Vinci with disused textile company that can be converted for photovoltaic production, totalling about 69,000 m2 available;
• Exchange car park in the Museum's forecourt, with the potential to install photovoltaic shelters on approximately 6,000 m2;
• Exchange car park in Via Eugenio Barsanti, with potential for installation of photovoltaic shelters on approximately 1,050 m2;
• Interchange car park in Via Udine, with the potential to install photovoltaic shelters on approximately 2,000 m2;
• Autolinee Toscane depot in Via del Lazzaretto 70, with an availability of approximately 15,000 m2 of open area and 2,300 m2 of shed (net of the photovoltaic system already installed).
In addition, it is planned to extend this initiative to the new car parks that are being planned.  |

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

A land use (LU) analysis of the Municipality was performed based on available 2016 data extracted from the land use map of the Tuscany region. This database included 44 classes that were used to identify the type and extent of forest areas present within the Municipality. All the classes surveyed were aggregated into six main classes: broadleaf forests, needle forests, olive groves and herbaceous areas, the latter including meadows and annual herbaceous crops. The fifth class consisted of urban areas and the sixth of all the other classes (e.g. cemeteries, greenhouses, sports areas, etc.) An additional layer containing information on both public and private trees located in the urban area of Prato was developed by coupling a georeferenced inventory of urban trees (UTI) owned by the Municipality with the photographic interpretation of the distribution of private trees (Fig. 2b), in order to have a realistic number of urban trees within the Municipality, excluding extra-urban forest areas.

Based on the study carried out by the CNR (National Council for Research), the Prato area offers the possibility of planting around 190,000 trees with an annual absorption of 33,000 tCO2 by 2030.

For the reduction of residual emissions, the Municipality of Prato, assuming it can realise all 190,000 trees, will foresee a series of interventions in the existing and projected public green areas, identified by the Operational Plan, also implementing the strategies of the Urban Forestation Action Plan, owned by the Municipal Administration.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

It should be noted that the Municipality has already made provision within the Urban Forestation Plan, adopted in 2018, for the planting of approximately 1,500 trees/year, on public and private areas, through specific calls for tenders and private resources.

Planting activities include:

Direct planting in municipally owned areas
Plantations in areas owned by other public bodies, with whom to develop special agreements
Planting in municipal areas promoted by private funding
Planting in private areas with private funding

In particular, the urban forestation intervention in Santo Stefano Park envisages the creation of a mixed tree and shrub stand through the transformation of an area with an extension of about 3.5 ha, located in a peri-urban area near the New Hospital of Prato - Santo Stefano.

The project stems from the desire of the area's owner to provide the health facility with a green space appropriate to the importance and function of the site. The area identified covers two areas, one adjacent to the Santo Stefano Hospital and one belonging to the Municipality of Prato. This area is considered at high risk of flooding, with a return time of less than 30 years, as demonstrated by the flooding event of the Vella torrent on 4/5 October 2010.

In addition to contributing to the mitigation of heat islands and increasing biodiversity, the intervention will have a significant visual impact on the landscape. This intervention will transform the landscape of this portion of the city's peri-urban belt, characterised by the contrast between densely urbanised and cultivated areas.

The total cost of the action is €22,050,000.00 net of the costs of processing and preparing the land.

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part C "Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030" aims to outline any enabling interventions, i.e. with regard to organizational setting or collaborative governance models, or related to social innovations – designed to support and enable the climate action portfolios described in Module B-2 as well as aiming to achieve co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Module B-1).

## 4.1 Module C-1 Organisational and Governance Innovation Interventions

Module C-1 "Organisational and Governance Innovation Interventions" consists of a summary table, listing organizational and governance interventions and describing their impact (C-1.1) and a section for more detailed descriptions and comments (C-1.2).

|  Control Room | A Cabina di Regia (or CoR) is a crucial municipal coordination body for the formulation of targeted operational plans in different thematic areas. Within the framework of the objectives outlined by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRP), a specific CoR dedicated to the drafting of the strategic plan for 'Next Generation Prato' has already been set up in the Prato area. The CoR, when drafting the strategic plan for the Next Generation Meadow, undertakes to coordinate the different components involved in the decision-making process. This includes the definition of clear objectives, the constant monitoring of activities and the periodic evaluation of the results obtained. | Municipality of Prato | Municipality of Prato | This entity would thus play a major role in the synergetic management of collaborative efforts for the implementation of planned projects in the tertiary sector, which include energy efficiency actions (e.g. electrification and management optimisation of thermal consumption) and actions aimed at self-production and purchase of green electricity.

|  Introduction of a permanent municipal ordinance aimed at the optimal management of heating systems | It is planned to introduce a new municipal regulation that will define restrictions concerning the use of heating systems. According to this regulation, a maximum heating temperature of 19°C will be set, with a tolerance of ±2°C. In addition, the operating period of the systems will be reduced by 15 days compared to the current regulation. This will result in a delayed start of 8 days compared to the usual date and an earlier end of operation of 7 days compared to the traditional end date. The daily operating time of the plants will be reduced by 1 hour. | Town Planning Office of the Municipality of Prato | Municipality of Prato and Citizenship, Economic Activities | The regulation is a fundamental lever to push citizens and economic actors on the territory of the Municipality of Prato in the conscious use of heating systems, and allowing an important reduction in energy savings. The objective is to better manage the plants and also change the behavioural and cultural model of citizens. |   |
|  Building regulations | The revision of the building regulations includes the introduction of stricter limits in terms of energy efficiency and production, anticipating current regulations in Italy. These updates aim to promote sustainability in construction and reduce CO2 emissions. | Energy Office of the Municipality of Prato | Energy Office of the Municipality of Prato
Energy distributors in the Municipality of Prato | The Building Regulations will allow for an improvement of the building-installation system in terms of environmental sustainability and reduction of CO2 emissions |   |

|  Mobility Management | Mobility management actions in medium-sized cities like Prato are generally managed by the mobility manager identified in three professional figures:
Mobility managers for companies with more than 300 employees or employing more than 800 people;
Area mobility managers, for local authorities, with coordination functions supporting company mobility managers;
School mobility manager whose actions cover:
organising and coordinating the home-school-home travel of school staff and pupils;
maintaining links with municipal facilities and transport companies;
coordinate with other schools in the same Municipality;
to verify solutions, with the support of the companies operating local road and rail transport services, for the improvement of services and their integration;
ensure intermodality and interchange; | Mobility Office | Municipality Citizenship | Traffic reduction: Promoting alternatives to the private car, such as carpooling, public transport and cycling, not only reduces road congestion, but also travel time and the risk of accidents. This improves traffic flow and makes travelling more efficient for all citizens.

Improved air quality: By reducing the number of vehicles on the road, especially those powered by fossil fuels, air pollution is significantly reduced. This leads to cleaner, healthier air for all residents, with direct benefits on health and quality of life.

Reducing carbon emissions: Promoting low-carbon means of transport, such as public transport and cycling, actively contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This is essential to tackle the climate crisis and to achieve the emission reduction targets set at international level.  |

|  Purchasing Groups | Purchasing Groups represent communities of citizens united in a wide range of initiatives to promote an ecological and responsible lifestyle. The primary objective of Purchasing Groups is often to obtain discounts or advantageous conditions through collaboration and group strength. One example is the Solidarity Purchasing Groups (GAS) whose peculiarity lies in the fundamental principle of solidarity, which materialises through close collaboration with small local producers sharing values of respect for the environment and for people. This movement, rooted in environmental and social awareness, obtains increasing support from municipal administrations that promote its spread through patronage and active support. Within this initiative, other categories of | Municipality | Municipality Citizens Companies Tertiary activities | Promotion of sustainable energy: Purchasing Groups allow citizens to access sustainable technologies, such as photovoltaic systems and electric cars, at more affordable prices through the negotiation of group discounts. This promotes the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources, contributing to the transition to a more sustainable, low-carbon energy system.

Reduced energy costs: By working together and negotiating discounted tariffs, members of Purchasing Groups can save on energy costs, whether through the purchase of certified green energy or the installation of photovoltaic systems. This allows households and small businesses to reduce their energy bills in the long run, while |   |

|   | Purchasing Groups have been defined in recent years, which aim to extend their action beyond the traditional procurement of foodstuffs. In particular, focusing on the Parto area, the objective is to create the conditions to form citizens' purchasing groups for the realisation of photovoltaic/solar thermal systems, replacement of boilers, insulation, purchase of certified green energy and purchase of electric cars. The phases of the initiative are subdivided as follows: -Communication campaign : within six months of launch; -collecting pre-applications from households or small businesses; -defining an agreement with installers and banks; -assistance to households and businesses by means of on-site inspection and feasibility; -appointing each customer with a trio of approved installers; -free adherence to the proposals of the partner banks by users. In the context of green electricity, Purchasing |  |  | increasing their economic resilience. Encouraging the adoption of eco-friendly technologies: By facilitating access to electric vehicles and sustainable energy solutions at more affordable prices, buying groups encourage the adoption of environmentally friendly practices and technologies. This contributes to reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality and mitigating climate change locally and globally.  |

|   | Groups are now widespread throughout the country, especially with regard to the construction and installation of photovoltaic systems on roofs and small privately owned land. One example is the GASEnergia Association, the association's main objectives are:
promotion of savings and efficiency as the main renewable sources;
purchase of certified green electricity;
promotion of self-production by individuals and territories;
promotion of projects of particular significance.
GAs can negotiate with energy suppliers to obtain discounted rates or special conditions for group members. This can be done through the collective purchase of large quantities of energy, which allows members to benefit from lower prices than they could obtain individually.
In the case of PV installation, GAs can negotiate with suppliers and installers to obtain group discounts on the purchase and installation of solar |  |  |   |

With regard to the purchase of electric cars, GAs can negotiate with dealers or directly with manufacturers to obtain group discounts on the purchase of zero-emission vehicles. This type of collaboration gives members access to cheaper automotive technology, while encouraging the adoption of environmentally friendly vehicles. |  |  |  |   |

"Prato is a vibrant, contradictory, innovative, conflictual city: a city that, since the beginning of the 20th century and particularly after the Second World War, has been a formidable urban, social, cultural and economic laboratory in which new models have often been experimented.

Today, compared to international metropolises, it is a small city, but within it has all their complexity. In fact, it is part of those medium-sized cities in which new social models of coexistence, new forms of production, and innovative ways of educating the younger generations are being experimented globally: medium-sized cities that are endowed with that flexibility, capacity to absorb change, and readiness for innovation necessary to verify the effects of these transformations in a short time and indicate new possible scenarios towards which to set out on the difficult path of overcoming the international economic crisis.

Prato is an ever-changing reality.

Prato aims to increasingly characterise itself as a place of contemporaneity, a place where its important signs of the past and those of today find new forms of dialogue. Prato then shall be understood as the city of fashion, of visual and performing arts, of coexistence and multiculturalism, of new economic sectors, of experimentation in the circular economy and urban practices of recycling, of innovation in youth training, as a sustainable and young city, of participation and openness in civic practices related to the commons, a city of innovation and social inclusion, a city of solidarity.

Prato with its 196,277 inhabitants is the second largest city in Tuscany and the third largest in Central Italy in terms of number of residents. It is world-famous for its textile district, with more than 3.500 SMEs, which account for about 3% of European textile production, making it the most important district in Europe. The textile district's strategies over the years have led to choices aimed at sustainability and the strengthening in research and development of the traditional sector, i.e. that based on the regeneration of fibres from used clothes, which has made Prato a forerunner of circular economy practices in the past and which today can count on the great professionalism of its workers. Alongside the textile district, since the 1990s the fast fashion district has grown, which, with more than 4,000 clothing companies, makes Prato a leader in Europe and a reference point for large-scale organised distribution.

Tradition and innovation come together to form a strong combination that has transformed Prato in recent years into a city that has based its wealth on a lively cultural melting pot with more than 130 nations from around the world, integrating different cultures, knowledge and lifestyles.

Prato plays a strategic role in the regional context and in the metropolitan area Florence – Prato – Pistoia, and with respect to this assumption the municipal administration has elaborated a medium-long term vision, based on a perspective of Sustainable Development, as a strategic prerogative on which to concentrate planning and towards which to converge the actions of both public and private sectors. Prato also has a great tradition in innovation not only in its manufacturing production but also in the local government's ability to experiment in services to citizens, thanks to the possibilities offered by information technology and new organisational methods. In recent years, the municipality has worked intensively to equip itself with a number of strategic planning tools with the aim of efficiently orienting its actions, especially on the themes of digital, ecological and circular transition.

It is in this direction that the City of Prato's adhesion to the EU Mission '100 Climate Neutral &amp; Smart Cities' and thus its commitment to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 should be read.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Articulate your 2030 climate neutrality ambition, as expressed and defined in your Cities Mission Expression of Interest (EoI). This should include your ambition and commitment to a 2030 horizon as a whole city, as well as describe any exclusion areas and summarise how these areas would be addressed beyond 2030. (A more detailed plan for exclusion areas should be included in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.) Your 2030 ambition should be supported at a minimum by a Council decision, and it is recommended that it is also supported by a wider stakeholder group. We also recommend you to list other co-benefits you aim to achieve when working towards the climate neutrality goal, like well-being, health, equity, justice, financial savings.

Prato is recognized as housing Europe's largest textile district and is a global leader in sustainable textile practices. The city launched the Prato Green Deal in 2014, a comprehensive approach aimed at integrating environmental policies to achieve climate neutrality. This initiative focuses on ecological transition, circular urban metabolism, and smart city concepts, employing various planning and governance tools to address environmental, sustainable mobility, energy, and circularity issues. These tools include plans and projects like the Municipal Operational Plan, Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP), Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), Prato Forest City, Prato Urban Jungle, Riversibility, Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), and initiatives for energy efficiency and circular urban development funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

In April 2014, Prato joined the Covenant of Mayors, committing to a  $20\%$  reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020 alongside the European Commission. The SEAP, adopted in December 2015, aimed to better integrate environmental policies within Prato, focusing on the energy renovation of public assets, reducing consumption, enhancing energy efficiency across various sectors, and promoting renewable energy and energy-saving practices among residents and businesses.

Continuing these efforts, Prato reaffirmed its commitment in 2019 by joining the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, targeting a  $40\%$  reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 and enhancing climate change resilience. The city's strategy towards climate neutrality, initiated in 2019, links urban, environmental, forestry, and health planning in collaboration with the Tuscany Region, unfolding in three phases:

# Phase 1: Analysis of Environmental Data, Trees, and CO2 Emissions (completed)

Through a collaboration with CNR IBE, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the city's climatic and environmental conditions, leveraging:

a) Sentinel satellite and hyperspectral flight data for monitoring summer surface temperatures, urban heat island effects, vegetation indices, land use, tree canopy, surface reflectivity, sky view factor, and carbon sequestration capabilities;
b) The deployment of 45 AirQuino sensors across the city for continuous monitoring of temperature, humidity, particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), CO2 levels, and other pollutants;
c) The installation of an Eddy Covariance super-station in June 2021 to track CO2 levels and gas exchanges, providing high-frequency urban flux measurements to evaluate seasonal dynamics and the impact of mitigation efforts;
d) The creation of a Digital Twin system in partnership with CNR IBE, integrating sensor network data, satellite observations, climate and atmospheric information, socioeconomic data, and models to describe inter-variable relationships (https://dev.airqino.it/digital_twin/);
e) For the Structural Plan, we correlated environmental data from the Digital Twin with demographic and socioeconomic indicators in the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) to identify areas where lower-income and vulnerable populations face higher risks from heatwaves and lack access to public green spaces, by using data such as:

Population density segmented by census area, with specific attention to vulnerable groups aged 0-5, 6-11, and over 65;
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

#

Deprivation index, comprising four indicators of socio-economic hardship: low education levels, unemployment rates, the proportion of rented homes, and household density per census area;
Prevalence of single-person households, referred to as the density of 'lone persons';
Built-up area ratio, calculated as the proportion of developed land to the total area of each census section;
Income levels, analysed by dividing the average household income into deciles within each census section.

The integrated mapping of environmental, demographic and socioeconomic data has made it possible on the city of Prato to quantitatively highlight how the weakest groups, with lower income, are also those subject to greater risks of heat waves, and characterised by greater distance from public green infrastructures. This integrated analysis has highlighted the need for policy development that considers social, economic, and environmental factors simultaneously. The Diffuse Forestation project identifies priority areas for mitigating environmental issues affecting vulnerable groups.

f) Within the general framework of the SECAP, an update of all emission data of the city was carried out.

Step 2: Assessment of the maximum CO2 storage capacity achievable through forestation (completed).

a) Percentage increases in green areas, to assess mitigation capacity.
b) Wood volume increases to assess carbon storage capacity in relation to the plants used and their size/age.
c) A modeling approach to determine mitigation contributions from various species sizes and types.

Step 3: Definition of actions to be developed in different areas to achieve climate neutrality, based on data from Step 2 and related to

Sustainable mobility, through the implementation of further strategies dedicated to the private and public sector;
Existing buildings, through retrofitting and energy efficiency of public and private buildings, to be defined in the SECAP;
Industrial production and public services, with the implementation of carbon neutral strategies by private and public companies, working together in the city's governance model for Prato's circular and green transition.

Joining the EU Mission '100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities', Prato aims for climate neutrality by 2030, targeting an 83% reduction in CO2 emissions from 2019 levels, used as the reference year, throughout the entire municipal territory. The remaining part of the emissions will be compensated through specific carbon storage/absorption actions implemented on a municipal scale. This orientation was also reaffirmed in the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), approved by City Council Resolution No. 8 of 22 February 2024.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

This is the core section of the Commitments document that should summarise at least 3 or 4 systemic strategic priorities that need to be implemented for your city to become climate neutral by 2030. These should be meaningful changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in your city, like decarbonising the heating system in the city or generating 100% energy from renewables. The individual commitments between your city and other stakeholders should address these key priorities and contribute to reaching them. The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan should describe all interventions, including those to reach your priorities as well as all further actions, in detail and describe how your city plans to implement them.

In line with Prato's goal to reach climate neutrality by 2030, the development of the Climate City Contract's strategic directions was informed by an evaluation of existing planning tools, insights from thematic discussions, and key national strategies (National Recovery and Resilience Plan, Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan). Based on an assessment of these planning resources, the local and national objectives, and the current state of technology, we propose initial overarching guidelines to shape the forthcoming specific interventions:

Decarbonize heating and electricity usage through demand reduction and enhancing the efficiency of systems in both the civil and industrial sectors;
Advance the shift towards electric power for civil energy use and transportation;
Boost local generation of renewable energy, with a focus on solar photovoltaic systems;
Encourage the use of renewable energy sources, whether locally produced or not;
Foster sustainable consumption habits that minimize raw material use and maximize their reuse and recycling;
Support the adoption of sustainable and low-impact transportation options;
Enhance the capacity for carbon sequestration.

By adopting these measures, the Municipality of Prato aims to fulfill its ambitious objective of climate neutrality by 2030, cutting CO2 emissions by 83% and compensating for the remaining emissions through carbon sequestration efforts.

# 4 Principles and process

Highlight the key principles that will guide your city as it implements its Climate City Contract, like accountability, transparency, or an open attitude to new approaches. The process should encompass principles like co-creation, innovation, multi-actor and citizen engagement, and should be systemic and demand-driven in nature. It should also be based on monitoring and joint learning. The Commitments Guidance document provides more specific guidance on how to integrate these principles into your own process.

Climate Governance. Urban areas are among the main contributors to the ongoing climate crisis. In our vision, the city system, understood as the interconnection between inhabited areas, commercial and industrial zones, green and agricultural areas, must be at the center of new strategies for sustainable development and of the paradigm shift in the economic, environmental, and social logics. Urban policies must therefore integrate health, urban planning, environmental, mobility and innovation policies into a single integrated sustainable urban development strategy aiming at building more resilient and healthier cities. With the Urban Agenda 2050, Prato commits to a bold, future-oriented vision emphasizing human health and a renewed collaboration across economic, social, and cultural policies, which prioritizes digital and circular transitions, the social impact of economic practices, local supply chains, environmental initiatives, urban forestry, nature-based solutions, and sustainable mobility as key drivers of sustainable growth, resilience, and community well-being. Climate governance will then be based on two main pillars:

Next Generation Prato, which is the result of an intense process of reflection, sharing and dialogue with the main stakeholders on the strategy that the city intends to adopt for the implementation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, addressing issues and proposing a portfolio of projects that ensure the ecological transition and new economic models capable of producing positive impacts in the territories, promotes a new concept of urban governance, which brings together public administrations, enterprises, the third sector, universities and citizens, emphasizing the centrality of environmental and nature issues in Prato's urban policies. The signatories of the 'Memorandum of Understanding for the Governance of the Next Generation Prato' include the Municipality of Prato and a number of significant entities in the area: the PIN - Polo Universitario Città di Prato, the

Pistoia-Prato Chamber of Commerce, Confindustria Toscana Nord, Cna Toscana Centro, Confartigianato Prato, Confesercenti Prato, Confcommercio Prato, Confcooperative, Legacoop, Cgil Prato, Cisl and Uil. The parties have agreed to work closely with the city administration, with the aim to enhance the exchange of information about funding opportunities in sectors considered priority and strategic, and share human resources and expertise to ensure the success of the funded projects.

Prato Circular City, which since 2020 has been the strategic initiative led by the city government to enhance Prato's reputation as a "circular city", set up a permanent table with local stakeholders to promote shared, integrated and participatory circular economy actions and build a circular city governance. Prato Circular City proposes four main areas of focus: revitalizing the textile sector, urban resource management, managing urban resources, encouraging circular consumption, and promoting sustainable urban farming practices, with governance as a cross-cutting theme reflecting the most important aspects in the city's transition to the circular economy. In the context of "Prato Circular City", special emphasis has been placed on the sustainability of the textile and fashion industry's products and processes, which in the recent years has become a crucial concern. Many companies in the district stand out for their commitment to the environment and quality, achieving various Oeko-Tex and Global Recycled Standard (GRS) certifications, alongside adherence to the DETOX protocol, which underlines the ever-increasing commitment to sustainability as a fundamental value within the district's operations. To tackle these challenges and effectively progress towards a circular economy, specific working groups have been established in collaboration with economic and social sectors, including:

An observatory on the end-of-waste regulation, to monitor and influence regulatory development related to the end-of-life of products;
An observatory on labour and training needs, dedicated to analysing the sector's labour and training needs to support the adaptation of skills to new market demands;
A cross-disciplinary working group on environmental and digital transition to explore and implement digital solutions that can support sustainability and efficiency in the sector.

These working groups represent a strategic and coordinated approach to address environmental, economic and social challenges in the district, while promoting innovation and sustainability in line with the goals of "Prato Circular City".

A key initiative focused on promoting a range of activities to enhance energy efficiency within the textile sector through to 2030. In this regard, during 2023, 38 businesses within the Prato textile district started implementing energy efficiency projects, facilitated by a funding initiative managed collaboratively by the Municipality of Prato and the Chamber of Commerce of Pistoia-Prato, working closely with local economic and social groups. These initiatives, which aim to reduce thermal and electrical consumption, especially in SMEs, are part of a wider programme that aims to finance around 300 projects by 2030. Funded projects fall into two categories: those aimed at reducing thermal energy consumption, through the adoption of technologies such as the replacement of steam generators, the reuse of thermal waste, insulation and the installation of energy monitoring systems; and those aimed at improving electricity consumption, through the replacement of motors and compressors with more efficient solutions, the modernisation of lighting systems and rational energy management. This initiative seeks to build upon the existing success of the funding program, motivating businesses to switch to renewable electricity sources and promoting energy awareness campaigns.

Participatory co-design and involvement of stakeholders and citizens. The co-design process of the Climate City Contract in Prato was carried out following the systemic approach proposed by Net Zero Cities, based on a collaborative action aimed at understanding the interdependencies between local actors and their actions. This made it possible to identify and address the barriers to
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

change (Understand the system - Phase 1) and subsequently co-create a set of actions (Co-design a portfolio - Phase 2) to overcome them. During this process, characterised by a strong dependence on the city context, efforts were made to create synergies between public administration, stakeholders and citizenship. The aim was to actively involve collective intelligence in a transition process that led to the implementation of meaningful initiatives to achieve climate neutrality. The result was a systemic transformation, crossing different sectors and spheres of the city, working on technical solutions, democratic participation, capacity building, economic sustainability and social innovation. This process required collaborative, flexible, and adaptable governance over time, capable of involving all actors at different levels of commitment, to work together actively towards a more sustainable city. This involved engaging economic categories (Pistoia-Prato Chamber of Commerce, Confindustria Toscana Nord, CNA Toscana Centro, Confartigianato Prato, Confesercenti Prato, Confcommercio Prato, Confcommercio Prato, Confcooperative, LEGACOOP, CGIL Prato, CISL, UIL), public companies (ALIA Servizi Ambientali, REVET, GIDA, Interporto della Toscana Centrale, Toscana Energie, ESTRA, Consiag, Autolinee Toscane), social partners (Società della Salute di Prato, USL Toscana Centro, Consulta del Terzo Settore), research bodies and universities (PIN - Polo Universitario Città di Prato, CNR, UNIFI, ENEA, ISPRA) in a series of co-participatory planning workshops.

The first phase of the co-design process (Understand the system) took place between October and December 2022 and was characterised by 8 meetings involving 15 categories of stakeholders on the topics of energy efficiency, sustainable mobility, circular economy, urban forestry, agriculture and land use.

The first stakeholder group consisted of the municipal companies (5), category associations (6), research institutes, large retail organizations (1), companies (20), agricultural associations linked to the short supply chain (6), farms (4), professionals (6), environmental associations (2), bodies linked to mobility (3) and public administration (land government, roads service, town planning, agriculture and environment); the second group by trade associations (6), companies and start-ups (6), sports clubs (2), businesses (5), public administration; the third group by third sector bodies (8) and the fourth consisted of the City Council of boys and girls.

The second phase of the co-design pathway (Co-design a portfolio) was articulated in four workshops that took place in January 2023, engaging stakeholders across energy efficiency, sustainable mobility, circular economy, and urban afforestation, agriculture, and land use, supported by experts in the various thematic areas of the University of Florence, with the aim of co-creating impact pathways, through the definition of concrete and radical actions, expected medium and long-term results and direct and indirect co-benefits.

The municipal administration played a crucial role, promoting public debate through general planning, development of specific projects, implementation of actions, adaptation of regulations and involvement of stakeholders. This daily commitment has made it possible to transform environmental strategies from a public administration initiative to a project shared at all levels of the city, with the active participation of all citizens.

**Economic development based on the principles of the SDGs.** Prato is one of the largest textile centres in Europe and a global leader in yarn and woollen fabric production. With over 7,000 businesses, the Prato district is renowned for its fabrics for the clothing industry, furnishing textiles, knitting yarns, knitted products and garments, non-wovens and special fabrics for industrial uses. The district of Prato has historically based its fortunes on the reuse of textile waste from production and clothing waste from all over the world. This activity was made possible in the past thanks to the support of the district's innovative mechanical-textile industry, which was able to design machineries to recycle these fractions that would otherwise have been considered waste. The issue of product and process sustainability in the textile &amp; clothing supply chain has become strategic in recent years. The city administration has promoted a series of initiatives, projects and recently a

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

series of calls for proposals to promote the digital and ecological transition of the district thanks to an extraordinary contribution of EUR 10 million from the state's 2021 budget law, to support the digital and ecological transformation of the district. These projects align with several strategic actions:

Socio-environmental sustainability in production, including energy efficiency improvements, ecological company transitions, circular economy solutions, and enhancements in workplace health, safety, and prevention culture, all within the framework of a just transition.
Technological and digital evolution, emphasizing the digital advancement of small and medium-sized enterprises, the incorporation of key enabling technologies, and the introduction of product or process innovations.

Thanks to its participation in the Cities Mission, Prato can accelerate the dynamics of ecological and circular transition through targeted policies aimed at operationally supporting the territorial production system in this transition to climate neutrality, in which a special attention is paid to the involvement of vulnerable groups to ensure a just transition. In fact, in addition to the aforementioned urban forestation measures in areas with the highest risk of environmental and socio-economic vulnerability, the Action Plan provides specific incentives for low-income households, such as facilitating the replacement of obsolete household appliances, and promoting the energy upgrading of public social housing buildings to improve the quality of housing assistance.

Monitoring and joint learning. During the monitoring phase, the Municipality of Prato will focus on assessing the progress and effectiveness of the actions undertaken in achieving climate neutrality goals. Every two years, a comprehensive review will be conducted to assess the progress towards climate neutrality. Special attention will be paid to data analysis and accountability of each stakeholder, thus ensuring that monitoring results in a continuous learning process. It will be crucial to identify early signs in the results that indicate progress in the right direction. The aim of monitoring extends beyond merely measuring the outcomes of actions; it also involves discerning the additional adjustments required for success, which may include modifications in policies, regulations, and behaviors.

In this evaluation process, the Municipality of Prato will employ a range of quantitative indicators to monitor the different actions undertaken. However, it will also value qualitative indicators of change, such as citizens' growing awareness of environmental issues. This approach will help to strengthen a collective understanding of the ongoing transformations and facilitate the transition towards climate neutrality. Through monitoring, there will be a continuous acquisition data and knowledge in relation to the efficacy of the actions implemented and their impact across different urban settings and key areas of emissions.

An adaptive approach to portfolio actions and objectives will also be adopted. We will continuously work to align actions and objectives with the changing urban context and new insights emerging from stakeholders, making changes and improvements where necessary. The implementation strategy will also be frequently updated to adjust the trajectory towards optimal results and an overall positive impact.

Over time, the commitment of the Municipality of Prato could stand as a model and reference point for other municipalities and cities aiming to pursue similar pathways towards climate neutrality.
