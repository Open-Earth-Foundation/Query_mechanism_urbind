# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

The present document describes the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan of the Municipality of Kozani. The transition that the Municipality undergoes due to the reduction and termination of the lignite production and use for electricity generation in the local power plants, has a considerable negative impact on employment and economic prosperity. However, the transition is seen as a major opportunity for changing and restructuring the local economy through a diversification from the traditional one-dimensional dependence on mining-related activities towards an economy which generates employment opportunities in renewable energy, circular economy, smart technologies, manufacturing of renewable energy equipment, small and medium size food producing companies, precision farming etc. The development and implementation of the present Climate Neutrality Action Plan is highly valued and is considered to be a very strong policy framework and practical implementation toolkit for the development of a new narrative for the city of Kozani which will improve the quality of life and the health conditions of its citizens.

Kozani participates in the Covenant of Mayors initiative since 2012 and since then a thorough monitoring process of GHG emissions has been undertaken on an annual basis. A summary of the greenhouse baseline gas emissions inventory for the reference year 2020 is presented and a quantification of the various sources is briefly outlined. Due to a variety of targeted policies and actions undertaken by the Municipality, a significant reduction in the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions of the order of approximately  $33\%$  was accomplished between years 2010 and 2020. The major sources of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions are attributed to private buildings producing an approximate  $45\%$  of the total emissions. In addition, the tertiary sector is responsible for  $28\%$  of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions, whereas transport accounts for  $23\%$ .

The current climate neutrality action plan aims to accomplish the removal of the remaining  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions (except an approximate of  $20\%$  of residual emissions); and to develop inventories, monitoring processes and emission reduction portfolios for the remaining GHG emissions. The proposed key priorities and strategic interventions are on energy efficiency optimization, renewable energy generation, sustainable urban mobility and transportation, waste management and circular economy, sustainable resource optimisation and governance.

A major challenge for Kozani is the replacement of the heat source which is utilised in its very successful district heating system. One of the most important and critical actions of the present climate neutrality plan is the replacement of lignite as the source of thermal power, through the gradual introduction of a range of available renewable energy sources. In addition, the reduction of thermal energy demand for heating is a major priority and this is planned to be accomplished through the implementation of an extensive deep retrofit and upgrade of the built environment, use of smart technologies and change in the behaviour of the residents.

A high penetration level of renewable energy sources in the local energy mix is planned driven by both public and private funding, which is expected to reduce and/or offset the electricity use in all sectors; and at the same time, it will provide the required power for sustainable mobility using electric vehicles. The climate neutrality plan also proposes measures that will optimise waste management and enhance the circular economy.

The introduction of targeted smart technology and digitisation applications in everyday life activities will reduce energy consumption, private car usage and it is anticipated to improve quality of life.

Research, development and adoption of new sustainable energy technologies including the introduction of hydrogen as an energy carrier is a priority of the local Higher Education and Research institutions.

A management structure and an operational plan that will promote and monitor the plan is proposed. Transparency, social participation, mobilisation of the youth, interaction among local authorities and stakeholders are key requirements for a successful outcome.

The preparation of the Action Plan has been a dynamic process which has been undertaken by a team of experts either employed in the MoK, or in other local stakeholders (UoWM, CLUBE, CERTH) or originated from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, supported by external financial advisors (FCNC) and expert advisors from abroad. The team members interacted and worked closely under a rigorous well - managed and intensive process with local authorities, businesses, professional associations, key stakeholders, youth organisations and schools who were actively participated and engaged in meetings, discussions, workshops, and various publicity activities. During this process, all the above players travelled a long distance and managed to co-create and acquire ownership of the present Action Plan finally committing themselves to enthusiastically adopt the common effort for a climate neutrality of Kozani by the year 2030 as the most significant challenge for the city and its citizens which is anticipated to offer significant improvements in the quality of life.

A governance system is proposed that will focus on the continuous monitoring, appropriate adaptations and successful implementation of the plan through strong engagement of all stakeholders and especially of the Kozani's citizens.

# Introduction

The introduction should outline the local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and describe the gap it is addressing in broad terms.

# Introduction - textual element

The Municipality of Kozani (MoK) is a pioneering local authority in environmental and energy management issues and has demonstrated a strong will to dynamically move forward in the field of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and energy saving policies. By recognising the fact that:

limiting the pollutants that contribute to the greenhouse effect ensures a cleaner living environment, contributes to improving the quality of life of citizens and creates conditions for economic and cultural development
saving energy in buildings and in transport guarantees direct financial benefits for the citizens and the release of financial resources for the Municipality
the promotion of RES contributes to the independence from conventional energy sources.

In 2011 the Municipality of Kozani highlighted environmental awareness as a central priority of its policies by joining the "Covenant of Mayors for Sustainable Energy and Climate" which is the main European movement in which local and regional authorities participate voluntarily committing to undertake initiatives at the level of local communities with the aim of increasing energy efficiency and the use of RES which will lead to the reduction release of pollutants responsible for the greenhouse effect.

The Municipality of Kozani has developed pioneering energy and environmental applications for the country, such as a central district heating system, a waste management and recycling system, a program for installing PV systems in all schools, an energy efficiency programme for replacing all municipal lighting with LED etc. There is also significant activity in a variety of energy saving activities, bioclimatic applications, educational activities etc.

The organisational framework that emerged as a result of the planning and implementation of the measures foreseen in the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), is estimated to have facilitated the more effective use of financial tools and the inclusion of the proposed measures in various financial aid programs, in order to implement targeted actions and projects in line with the central environmental and energy policy of the municipality.

The climate crisis remains the defining challenge of our time and climate change is a serious concern with profound implications for our planet. Kozani acknowledges that cities play a key role in responding to the climate crisis and in achieving climate neutrality.

The Municipality of Kozani has the potential and the Mayor as well as the Municipal Council have the ambition to accelerate the transition of the city to climate neutrality by 2030.

The decision of the Greek Government for decarbonization and for decommissioning of the locally based lignite mines and power plants by 2023 with a simultaneous transition to a greener energy and economy aligns with Kozani's vision for climate neutrality and joins the rapidly growing global community that acknowledges this climate emergency.

The region of Western Macedonia region has a population of total 270,000 people. Its economy is dominated by the lignite mining industry directly employing approximately 5200 people, while many more companies relate their operation on this activity. The Greek Government, in order to be aligned with the global $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ mitigation efforts, has entered the lignite phase-out and it is planned to complete it for all operating units, as reflected in the Greek National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP, 2019). Only one lignite-fired powerplant will continue to operate, the Ptolemaida V unit, which is currently in commissioning phase and will burn lignite at the latest until 2028. By 2023 80% of total lignite PPs installed capacity will be decommissioned. An estimated total number of about 16,000 jobs could potentially be affected directly and indirectly by the mines closure.

In order to address the severe socio-economic implications of the rapid lignite phase-out, the Greek Government announced a Master Plan for the Just Development Transition (JDTP) in support of the Regional Operational Program 2021-2027 and the Smart Specialization Strategy for Western Macedonia.

More financing tools have been recently become available from: a) the Regional Operational Program 2021-27 and the Smart Specialization Strategy for WM, b) the Green Fund, c) the Just Transition Fund (ERDF), d) an InvestEU dedicated scheme, and e) the public sector loan facility by the EIB¹. The development and implementation of the current Climate Action Plan is greatly aligned with the objectives of the aforementioned programs and will be significantly benefitted by the availability of appropriate funding which is specifically targeted to the region of Western Macedonia.

Just Transition Development Plan (JDTP): Kozani, Florina and the Municipality of Megalopolis in Arcadia, belong to the EU regions with the greatest dependence on fossil fuels. These areas face the consequences of the long-term one-dimensional dependence on lignite activity, in contrast and to the detriment of all others, but also the stagnation of previous years in preparing a new, balanced and sustainable development model.

The "Just Transition Development Plan of lignite areas" is based on five development pillars, which are as follows: Clean energy, Industry and trade, Smart agricultural production, Sustainable tourism, Technology and education. It includes enhanced investment incentives to attract investments, as well as specific land uses for the tens of thousands of acres of land of lignite fields which will be released. The total amount of funding, including the necessary leverage of private resources, is estimated to exceed five (5) billion euros, originated from EU and national resources, with the main vehicle being the new independent Operational Program for the Just Transition of the new NSRF 2021-2027.

The NSRF (National Strategic Reference Framework) for the next programming period 2021-2027 has a separate Thematic Objective dedicated to supporting the transition to a low carbon economy in all sectors (TO4). This TO has included programs related to RUE in public buildings such as Operational Program (OP) "Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation" (EPANEK), OP "Transport Infrastructure, Environment and Sustainable Development" (YMEPERAA) and the 13 Regional Operational Programs (ROP).

This is the most appropriate time for Kozani to act and maintain its leading role in the emerging green energy sector, as it did for decades produce more than 70% of the country's total electric power, but from fossil fuels (lignite). However, the national policy for a transition to low-carbon economy has a strong negative social impact associated with job losses and income reduction for the area. Facing this challenge, Kozani is determined to take advantage of the move towards a greener future, by utilising the local expertise, the infrastructures and the newly available funding opportunities for the creation new and greener jobs and offering new developmental opportunities for Western Macedonia.

The management of the transition to a climate-neutral community is seen as both a major challenge and an opportunity to build a better future for the city and its citizens considering the associated benefits for citizens such as improved environment quality, healthier lifestyle, more and better jobs.

Citizens will play a pivotal role in driving systemic transformation towards climate neutrality in a participatory process as users, producers, consumers, owners or political actors, together with local stakeholders from academia, the energy sector, mobility, buildings, ICT, agriculture, forestry etc.

Kozani aims to act as a leading city and a paradigm which can inspire the rest of the Greek cities and beyond: if Kozani can do it, other cities can do it as well!

The Mayor and the Municipal council of the city recognize the need to adapt to the national and European plans towards climate neutrality; and, to this end, the Mission team of Kozani has been established to work and guide the city towards this goal. The initial task of the Mission team of Kozani was to respond to the call of the European Mission and was accepted to join the "100 climate neutral and smart cities". According to the Mayor:

"Kozani is going to make a leap into the future, with the help of the Mission of Kozani".

The Mission of Kozani team has been engaged in networking with local, regional and national stakeholders using their experience in implementing large scale projects to facilitate decision making and integration and create synergies with policy frameworks.

Kozani believes that the co-creation approach for the transformation of the city 'with the citizens and for the citizens' is the best way forward and a series of citizen engagement

initiatives and events have been organized based on a long-term plan for the participatory process.

Partnerships have been established with other cities, with regions, with the research and business community and other stakeholders, as well as with the wider financial sector, public and private, also through the stakeholder engagement workshops.

These latter, in the form of “Living Labs”, have been held in the last quarter of 2021, focusing on the thematic areas considered as the most important for the city’s Climate Neutrality and Smartness challenge, notably:

Urban transformation
Renewable Energy generation
Management of resources
Circular economy
Digital Transformation
Mobility and transport

Accompanied by the transversal themes of:

Sustainable entrepreneurship
Agriculture
Financing opportunities
Social resilience

Kozani established a Citizen’s Climate Board to process the results of the citizens’ and stakeholders’ engagement events and relate the ideas to the climate-neutral transformation plan of the city.

The successful work that took place in the first phase of the Mission set the foundations for further activities and awareness raising campaigns with the citizens and for the citizens to co-develop the climate city contract, that will enable the desired transformation. Intensive one-to-one meetings and workshops with key stakeholders were organised to capture and finalise their requirements that are now in the centre of the aforementioned process.

Summarising all the above, it is apparent that the Municipality of Kozani follows a detailed plan to develop an ambitious and at the same time realistic climate city contract, uses the best available practices and expertise that can be mobilised, adopts a participatory approach, putting its citizens and stakeholders in the centre, and strongly commits to become climate neutral by 2030.

The plan for climate neutrality builds on a number of existing strategies and takes into account the benefits in terms of CO₂ emission reductions attributed to these strategies.

The present document of the Climate Action Plan describes in detail the roadmap and all the associated required steps in terms of portfolios of actions and the governance that are crucial

in order to accomplish the set climate neutrality targets. A quantification of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions that are mitigated through each particular action is carried out at an annual basis in combination with the level of the necessary financial investment is presented.

The evolution of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, primary energy consumption and investment funding that are associated to the particular actions of the plan are presented until year 2030. The plan is expected to accomplish a total reduction of $80\%$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions between 2020 and 2030 and a proposal for addressing the residual emissions is outlined.

The present document is part of the City Climate Contract of Kozani, it was developed in parallel and is directly interlinked with the required Investment Plan and the Commitments documents which are part of the current submission.

The whole effort was substantially enhanced through the intensive and productive collaborative process that was carried out with the NZC Advisors team which was allocated; and, their substantial guidance and support is highly appreciated.

# Work Process

This section should list the working steps carried out, for example along the NZC Climate Transition Map, or related steps planned as well as outline timeline and milestones for future iterations for the continuous development of the Action Plan.

# Work Process - combination of textual and visual elements

The Municipality of Kozani after its successful selection among the "100 climate neutral and smart cities by 2030" of the relevant EU Mission, has highly prioritised the preparation of its climate city contract and has taken a number of solid actions.

A project management office (PMO) was established and has been led by the Cluster of Bioeconomy and Environment (CluBE) of Western Macedonia. Core members of the PMO are the Mayor's team, UoWM (the University of Western Macedonia), AUTH (the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki), CERTH (the Center for Research and Technology Hellas) and the company FCNC (financial consultants). Figure 1 below shows the structure of the PMO and all interactions linked to it.

The whole team has as a central pillar of its operation the climate transition map and has already organized one-on-one meetings and workshops with key stakeholders and citizens to capture their requirements, build a strong mandate and co-create the portfolio that will enable the desired change.

The project's KPIs have been defined to facilitate continuous monitoring and a scientific review strategy has been established and adopted to assure that the project's goal will finally be met.

The collaborative work has been initiated in 2021 and intensive interaction between the core members followed in order to map and define the details of the current state of the system components that are anticipated to influence the evolution of the climate action plan. The baseline emissions inventory was accurately defined and validated. The submission of Kozani's SECAP for 2020 was accepted and formed the basis for the development of portfolios of actions in the energy field that would contribute to the Climate Action Plan's objectives. The core partners worked on the Mobility and Transport portfolios and also the strategic planning related to Waste and Cyclic economy. A continuous process of interactions with stakeholders was followed and various publications were made to the public and to targeted audiences.

Figure 3 illustrates the major steps that were followed for the preparation and the submission of the Climate City Contract.

* The Scope 2 emissions due to the use of electricity in transport is negligible due to the very small percentage of electric vehicles (currently less than 5%).
** No waste is managed/sent to landfill within the Municipality boundary.
*** The amount of energy that is used in order to manage waste processing is included under the Buildings and Trasport sectors.
*** There are no significant industrial processes within the Municipality boundary. The small industries in Kozani mainly use grid supplied electric energy for machinery, etc. In addition, the agricultural sector primarily uses grid supplied electric energy for pumping and irrigation purposes. Agriculture also uses Diesel for agricultural machinery. Thus, the corresponding energy consumption has been included in Buildings (scope 2) and Transport sectors.

# A-1.2: Emission factors applied

* Primary energy calculation is based on the national Regulation for the Energy Performance of Buildings (KENAK - Government Gazette B' 407/09.04.2010) and the Technical Guidelines of the Technical Chamber of Greece (TOTEE 20701-1/2017). KENAK is also used for the CO₂ emissions calculation of the local DH system.
** CO₂ emissions are calculated using the method of IPCC (IPCC 2006, IPCC Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories, Prepared by the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme, IGES, Japan.) updated by the JRC (Bastos, Joana; Lo Vullo, Eleonora; Muntean, Marilena; Duerr, Marlene; Kona, Albana; Bertoldi, Paolo (2020): GHG Emission Factors for Electricity Consumption.

** No waste is managed/sent to landfill within the Municipality boundary.
*** Estimation of emissions in tonnes of CO₂ equivalent/year from solid waste disposal sites (corresponds to 0.1350 tonnes CH₄/year). There is an ongoing measurement campaign for the estimation of emissions from wastewater handling. Since the results need to be evaluated and further processing, they are not included here. However, they will be monitored, assessed and discussed in future reports.
*** There are no significant industrial processes within the Municipality boundary. The small industries in Kozani mainly use grid supplied electric energy for machinery, etc. Also, the agriculture sector primarily uses grid supplied electric energy for pumping and irrigation purposes. Agriculture also uses Diesel for agricultural machinery. Thus, the CO₂ attributed to AFOLU and IPPU is included in Buildings (scope 2) and Transport sectors.

A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

The Municipality of Kozani belongs to the Region of Western Macedonia which was established in 2011 with the Law 3852/2010 "Kallikratis" Program (Government Gazette A' 87/07.06.2010) through the merging of the pre-existing Municipalities of Aiani, Dimitrios Ypsilantis, Elimia, Ellispontos and Kozani. The municipality of Kozani has as its natural borders the mountain range of Vermio from the East, Mount Burinos from the West, Mount Siniaciko and the heights of Komanos to the north and the artificial Lake Polyphytos to the south.

The capital of the MoK is the city of Kozani, its largest city, which is also the administrative centre of the Region of Western Macedonia. The historical headquarters of the MoK is Aiani, which is built near the site of the ancient city of the same name. The total area of the Municipality amounts to 1,071 km² while its permanent population is 71,388 inhabitants according to the 2011 census.

The Baseline Emissions Inventory (BEI) according to the SECAP of MoK, attributes energy consumption and CO₂ emissions to the following sectors: a) buildings, b) lighting, v) transportation, d) tertiary sector, e) agriculture and f) industry. A summary of the primary energy consumption and emissions per sector is presented in Figures 5 and 6 above.

Figure 5 presents the total CO₂ emissions from the Municipality of Kozani for the year 2010 and Figure 6 presents the emissions for the year 2020 (baseline year for SECAP). The total energy consumption for the Municipality of Kozani in the year 2010 was calculated to be equal to 1,027,511.17MWh and the corresponding emissions were estimated at 394,371.97 tonnes CO₂. In year 2020 the energy consumption was reduced to 829.857,67MWh and the estimated emissions were equivalently reduced to 262,698.64 tonnes CO₂. Summary of energy consumption data attributed to each activity within the boundaries of the Municipality is presented in detail in Tables 2 and 3 above.

The private sector plays a major role in energy consumption and CO₂ emissions. Especially in the building sector, the estimated energy consumption by the private sector is to a very large extent much greater than the corresponding consumptions by the Municipal sector.

If the overall data of Tables 2 and 3 are divided by the population size, then the Municipality of Kozani with 71,388 inhabitants (ELSTAT, 2011) shows energy consumption per inhabitant equal to 14.39 MWh/inhabitant and emissions equal to 5.52 tnCO₂/inhabitant per year. In 2020 those values were reduced to 11.62 MWh/inhabitant and 3.68 tonnes CO₂/inhabitant per year.

Figure 17: Primary energy consumption between 2010 and 2020

Figure 7 illustrates the time evolution of primary energy consumption between 2010 and 2020 and the contribution of each sector, while Figure 8 shows the corresponding  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions.

It is clear that the major energy consumer and source of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions is the buildings sector and mainly the private residences. Buildings in MoK were mainly built either during the period 1980-2010 where the Thermal Insulation of Buildings Regulation was applied; or, before 1980 there were no obligations to insulate buildings. However, in 2010 the Regulation for the Energy Performance of Buildings (known as KENAK) has been introduced where new buildings not only have to be insulated but also to account for their energy efficiency.

While only a small number of buildings was built after 2010 in MoK, since 2011 the Ministry of Environment and Energy has implemented a number of energy savings programs for residences. The purpose of these programs has been to retrofit existing buildings to achieve high energy efficiency (low energy consumption and low emissions). A total of 18,269 residences exists in the Municipality of Kozani. Their distribution in the five Municipal Units is described in Figure 11.

Although these energy savings programs had a small impact in the first years of their implementation in the Municipality of Kozani, however since 2020 a significant number of buildings were retrofitted, 657 residences in 2022 out of 1651 in total, which accounts for about  $9\%$  of the total households in MoK.

The energy consumption for the residencies consists of their electric energy consumption ( $\sim 20\%$ ) and their heating energy consumption ( $\sim 80\%$ ). The city of Kozani and the communities of Nea Haravgi and ZEP use at a very high percentage ( $\sim 99\%$ ), heating energy provided by the Municipal District Heating Company. The District Heating system distributes thermal energy which is produced by the locally based powerplant of St Demetrios which belongs to the Public Power Corporation (PPC) and utilizes lignite. However, in areas which do not have access to the District Heating system, the main fuel is diesel oil. Biomass fuels such as wood and pellets are also used at a much lower percentage.

The current situation is unsustainable as the costs for the lignite-associated CO₂ emissions are extremely high and also the St Demetrios powerplant will cease its operation in 2025 according to the National Energy and Environment Plan. Consequently, an urgent action is required in order to find alternative source of thermal energy. This is a major challenge for the Municipality of Kozani, but it is seen as a major opportunity because a centrally managed action of reducing the carbon footprint of the District Heating system in Kozani would have a major impact leading to a drastic reduction of the emissions related to heating and will help to accomplish the 100% target set by MoK. On the other hand, residences, the major energy consumer need to be shielded against energy losses. This can be achieved through an appropriately designed, funded and implemented energy retrofitting plan. These actions should be prioritised in the residences of MoK that are not connected to the District Heating system since their impact is even higher.

At the same time, numerous new renewable energy installations, as it is depicted in Figure 15, mainly photovoltaics, connect to the electrical system and contribute towards the reduction of the local emissions coefficient of electricity (Figure 16). NEEFE is the national emission factor for electricity based on data from the CoM Default Emission Factors for the Member States of the European Union - Version 2017, (JRC: http://data.europa.eu/89h/jrc-com-ef-comw-ef-2017). EFE is the local emissions factor for electricity and is calculated based on the current local (MoK limits) green energy production (data obtained by the RAE the Regulatory Authority for Energy).

The emissions gap, defined as the amount and type of emissions to be addressed by the Action Plan, is composed of the emissions baseline minus the residual emissions being offset minus the emission reductions already planned. The emission reductions planned in existing action planning and strategies equals 37,913.96 tonnes CO₂ or about 14% of the baseline emissions. The total emissions gap to be addressed by this Action Plan is 217,670.88 tonnes CO₂. Residual emissions in this Action Plan amount of about 6%. These emissions can not be reduced through actions and have to be offset. Planting trees is important in fighting the climate change. The Municipality of Kozani planted about 3205 trees within its administrative boundaries which are estimated to capture 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually.

While this inventory focuses on the CO₂ emissions, other pollutants are planned to be accurately quantified, assessed, and addressed with appropriate actions through the dynamic implementation of the Climate Action Plan. The more significant GHG that are going to be quantified and assessed are Methane (CH₄) and Nitrous Oxide (N₂O). A thorough Inventory will be developed as a priority action and monitoring, and assessment will be included in future progress reports during the implementation of this plan.

Methane contributes to climate change due to its positive radiative forcing effect and is considered to be the second most significant greenhouse gas after CO₂. The major emitting sources are enteric fermentation, landfilling of wastes, coal extraction and leakage from the coal, gas and oil distribution system. Emissions from landfilled waste in Kozani are very limited and they are calculated to about 0.1350 tonnes CH₄ for the baseline year 2020. They are accounted as their equivalent in CO₂ (approximately 3,375 tonnes CO₂.eq) which is added to

the total CO₂ emissions and they are proposed to be addressed with actions of this plan. In addition, Methane emissions from wastewater handling for 2020 are currently estimated to be about 8,380 tonnes of CH₄. Emissions from agriculture have not been calculated at this stage. However, it is planned to carry out a detailed study on the livestock numbers and their contribution to CH₄ production. Coal extraction has been drastically reduced in the region of Western Macedonia during the last decade. Moreover, no coal-mining activity is currently present within the boundaries of the Municipality of Kozani that could contribute to CH₄ emissions. There is also no coal, gas or oil distribution network within the boundaries of MoK as the major source of heating is DH, oil carried by small tank trucks and wood.

Nitrous oxide (N₂O) contributes to climate change due to its positive radiative forcing effect, and the gas has a relatively high global warming potential. The agriculture sector dominates emissions of N₂O while other important sources are road transport, combustion sources and waste processes. There are no previous studies on the N₂O production within MoK. There is an estimation for the emissions from wastewater handling for 2020 according to which 1,105 tonnes N₂O are emitted annually. DEYAK and MoK plan further actions to reduce this contribution to the GHG emissions. Appropriate studies on the contribution of transportation and land use are planned to be carried out in order to provide the data required to assess N₂O contribution to the emissions inventory of Kozani.

Despite of their high Global Warming Potentials hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, Sulphur hexafluoride (SF₆) and Nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃) also known as the F-gases, are expected to have a significantly smaller contribution to the GHG emissions in Kozani, due to the limited existing activities that contribute towards their formation. However, they will be included when appropriate studies will be conducted during the implementation of the Climate Action Plan.

# A-2.2: Description &amp; assessment of policies

The CO₂ emissions in the City of Kozani have been reduced by approximately over 30% between 2010 – 2020, as compared to the baseline year of 2010. The largest reduction appears in the residential and tertiary sector.

This is a result of the City's policies so far, coupled with a number of external reasons, such as the economic crisis in the country which caused a general reduction in energy consumption, the decommissioning of lignite power plants and national initiatives (Save Energy at Home) supporting energy retrofitting for public and private buildings. The local policies are aligned to the national and European legislative and regulatory framework. However, the apparent negative consequences of the gradual reduced participation of lignite in the national energy mix and the corresponding downsizing of the local mining activities during the last decade, had a considerable impact on the local economy causing high unemployment rates. This impact was magnified by the current urgency to decarbonise the power generation, and has alerted the municipality authorities to undertake early action towards a more sustainable development plan and a transformation to an economy that could utilise the existing expertise and infrastructure on power generation, towards renewable energy and energy savings activities. For this reason, some of the initiatives were pioneering for the country.

To achieve decarbonisation and deliver the EGD's goals at the lowest possible cost, it is necessary to break the silos in which energy generating and consuming sectors currently operate; bringing together the electricity and heating sectors on the energy supply side and linking them with major energy consumption sectors on the demand side. The recent technological developments (e.g., novel heat generation technologies, rapid innovation on storage devices, digitalisation, demand response schemes, building integrated energy systems, decreasing prices of RE generation systems, integrated digital twin solutions) in parallel with the EU's ambitious new growth strategy that places energy efficiency, sector coupling and renewability at the forefront of sustainable development (reflected in relevant initiatives, strategic documents and financial frameworks such as the REPower EU, Clean Energy Package, the Fit for 55, the 2021-2027 long-term Horizon Europe budget, NextGenerationEU), can set off large-scale demonstrations offering a great opportunity to make the integration of RES production and storage, while coupling multi-vector carriers a win-win scenario towards achieving climate neutrality and equitable economic recovery.

A major asset of the municipality is the presence of the local University of Western Macedonia, which was founded during the last decade, and which provides higher education degrees related on energy, environment, information technology, management, regional development etc; and the University Departments carry out research and development work on the above subjects interacting with the national and European academic network and transferring knowledge and best practices locally. In addition, two more important institutions for the area of innovation are the following: i) CERTH, the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, which develops breakthrough innovations through its Research Institutions in the fields of energy, transport, ICT, etc and ii) CLUBE, the Cluster of Bioeconomy and Environment of Western Macedonia, which includes as its members an important number of key stakeholders

of the Region including all Regional Municipalities and secures their interaction, mainly through planning and implementing innovative projects and policies, especially at EU level.

## Local strategies

In addition, the following local and regional strategies of the Municipality of Kozani, contribute to gradually carbon neutrality of Kozani namely:

The Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) of the Municipality of Kozani,
Circular Economy Strategic Action Plan of the Municipality of Kozani,
Local Waste Management Plan 2021-2025 of the Municipality of Kozani,
Digital Transformation Strategy "Kozani-Smart City" of the Municipality of Kozani (2020),
The Business Plan for the Sustainable Urban Development Strategy 2017 – 2023,
The Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) of the Municipality of Kozani (2019),
Municipality's Gender Equality Plan.
Moreover, pilot's inclusive character is in line with Municipality's Gender Equality Plan, as well as other initiatives with similar provisions (i.e., New European Bauhaus).

The development and implementation of the above local strategies over the previous years, has been a major asset for Kozani which cultivated the conditions for the next major step which is the climate neutrality by 2030. All of the aforementioned local strategies, each at different level, were taken into account and contributed towards the development of the CAP. On the other hand, the very demanding requirements of the CAP imposes considerable pressure for the amendment and refinement of the local strategies and the setting of more ambitious targets. The most important influence on the CAP was originated by the SECAP. The rigorous development and evolution of the SECAP during the past decade allowed a very good understanding of the various contributors of GHG emissions; and also a detailed planning of actions that could reduce them. The process of developing the CAP inevitably focused on the particulars of each individual strategy in order to achieve the best possible alignment and compliance and at the same time identified issues that can be amended in the individual strategies in order to enhance their impact on the targets of the CAP.

# National policies

National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) (https://ypen.gov.gr/energeia/esek/) - The National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) constitutes for the Greek Government a Strategic Plan for Climate and Energy issues and presents a detailed road map for the achievement of comparable Energy and Climate Goals by the year 2030
Action Plan for addressing energy poverty (https://ypen.gov.gr/energeia/dimosievmenoschedio-drasis-gia-tin-katapolemisi-tis-energeiakis-endeias-sdee/) - The purpose of the Action Plan for addressing energy poverty is to map and analyse the characteristics of the most vulnerable households in order to understand better and design more efficient policy measures to achieve the goals set by NECP.
Just Development Transition Plan (https://www.sdam.gr/home-page) - With the aim of the just transition of its lignite areas, Western Macedonia and Megalopolis, the Government set a new operational programme in 2020.
National Climate Law – From 2022 the National Climate Law no. 4936 regulates the transition to climate neutrality and adaptation to climate change, emergency provisions to address the energy crisis and protect the environment (https://www.taxheaven.gr/law/4936/2022)

From the above strategies, the NECP plays a significant role in the development of the CAP as it quantifies in detail the nationally set targets for the evolution of the energy mix and also the spatial distribution and allocation of energy facilities. However, the most significant national policy that will influence and benefit the CAP is the Just Development Transition Fund that has a paramount local focus in the distribution of funds for actions that coincide or align with those of CAP.

# National initiatives

# A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers

The development of the Climate neutrality action plan and its successful implementation has to overcome a variety of systemic barriers and obstacles that are outlined below. Some of the issues that are outlined were raised during the interaction with various stakeholders and citizens.

A major issue is that although the social and economic pressures from the requirement for a transition to an economy of low carbon dependence are substantially increasing at a very fast pace, while the transformation of the local economy is occurring at a slow pace. The major categories of systemic barriers are listed below accompanied by a brief explanation:

## Legislation / regulatory framework

Land uses for Renewable Energy. Currently there is no clear planning or a land use framework to define the zones for the development of renewable energy installations; as a result, there are conflicts with other land uses such as agriculture, causing local frictions and increasing resistance to new installations of wind farms and photovoltaics. Consequently, there is an urgent need for the development of a land use framework especially for renewable energy installations both on a national and on a regional level, as this will facilitate the transition process towards a cleaner energy mix. To this end, by decision of the Regional Council of Western Macedonia, an integrated Special Spatial Plan for renewable energy sources is being prepared, which is expected to be put to Public Consultation in October 2023. It concerns a plan that will document the capacity of Western of Macedonia to welcome investments in the RES sector.

Licensing procedures of Renewable Energy projects. At the moment the procedure is slow and there are uncertainties, especially in the final stage. According to the recent bill passed in the Greek Parliament, it is foreseen, among other things, that there is a drastic acceleration of the licensing procedures and specifically, a reduction of the average time for licensing new RES projects to 14 months from the current 5 years, as well as the development of electricity storage projects with installed power of at least 3.5 GW by 2030, throughout the country.

Treatment of energy communities. The new law 5037/2023 passed by the Greek Parliament in March 2023, improves the situation and defines an attractive framework for the operation of Energy Communities, introducing two distinct types of Energy Communities: Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) and Citizens' Energy Communities (E.K.P.), while at the same time differentiating energy netting (net metering) and virtual energy netting (virtual - net metering), thus modernizing the operating framework of the Energy Communities.

Regulatory framework for the operation of the District Heating (DH) network of Kozani. The situation with the DH should be modified to ensure the continuous and uninterrupted supply of thermal energy to the DH system (regardless of source). According to the current regulatory system, the powerplants are selected to participate in the daily electricity generation schedule independently of whether they support local

DH or not. As a result, at an increasing number of occasions, when the PPC St Demetrios plant was not required to operate for electricity generation, there was no sufficient heating power for Kozani leading to the use of very high quantities of oil which was used as an emergency measure.

Special treatment and simplification of licensing procedures (e.g. local urban plans and interventions, urban regeneration, energy upgrades, integration of RES in buildings, development of green roofs, location of charging stations, etc.) in cities that wish to become climate neutral. In this direction, the network of Greek cities that have committed themselves to become climate neutral can raise the relevant issues and produce solid proposals to the Greek government in order to address all relevant issues that hindering their efforts.

**Bureaucracy:**
Complexity of legislation for the implementation of new investment plans and development of new projects
Bureaucratic procedures
Slow justice system

The problem of Bureaucracy remains perennial in Greece and difficult to deal with. In any case, it is expected that a simpler and more functional system for processing administrative procedures is instituted in the Public Administration, through the reformation and updating of the legislative framework for the National Policy of Administrative Procedures, which is jointly advanced by the Ministries of Interior and Digital Governance. Regarding the municipalities in particular, they will provide the services that fall under their responsibilities, through the new platform of "myDimos.Live.gov.gr" remotely and by tel-conferences.

**Funding:**
Limitations of available resources
Limitation of existing funding schemes
Flexibility in relation to the financing of the DH system,
Requirement for additional financial support e.g., for deep retrofitting of buildings, installation of renewable energy systems in buildings etc

**Structure of the local economy**
High level of one-dimensional dependence on lignite power production activities.
Limited investment in other industrial activities
Local economy mostly dependent on trade and services
Collapse of the local lignite power generation, causing a significant reduction in the municipality's economic activities

The long-term dependence of Western Macedonia on lignite has created conditions of technological and economic lock in at a regional level, as more than 34% of the Gross Value Added (GVA) in the region derives from lignite activities, while around 10% of local employment is directly or indirectly related to lignite production. Western Macedonia will be

Climate Neutrality Action Plan of the Municipality of Kozani
ΔΗΜΟΣ ΚΟΖΑΝΗΣ Municipality of Kozani
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

called upon not only to redefine and adjust its production model, but also to immediately create a completely new and productive environment in conditions of zero lignite dependence focusing on the development of new activities.

In order to address the socio-economic implications of the rapid lignite phase-out, the Greek Government announced a Master Plan for the Just Development Transition (JDTP) for the period 2023-2029 which is based on five key development pillars for Western Macedonia:
Clean energy development
Industry manufacturing activities and trade
Smart agricultural production
Sustainable tourism
Research, innovation, technology and education

The implementation of the Master Plan measures is expected to mobilise €5 bn for Western Macedonia for the period 2023-2029. In order to ensure that the lignite phase-out will not negatively affect the regional economy, Kozani can build on its strengths and competitive advantages, including the high concentration of specialized human resources, its industrial culture, energy infrastructure, an agriculture sector with high potential, existing academic and research structures, its strategic geographic position in South-Eastern Europe and design and associate all its developmental efforts under the strategic goals of the City Climate Contract. The proposed actions are anticipated to boost the employment and the economic activity of the city and the region.

## Social background:
High unemployment and staff shortages as a result of the recent economic crisis.
Serious structural problems with a very high unemployment rate especially among young people.
Limited career development opportunities for educated people
Limited industrial activities (beyond PPC).

Integrated and coherent policy measures that combine training with work employment subsidy are important in order to ensure a fair transition with limited negative impacts on the income of local population. The combination of employment programs with reskilling/upskilling will enable local workers to be absorbed quickly by the labor market and will contribute to attracting new investment. The funding of these specific actions is eligible through the Just Transition Development Plan of Western Macedonia with a total amount of €175 m, for the period 2023-2029.

## Demographic problem
A critical challenge for the long term development of Kozani which also indirectly influences the successful implementation of the CAP, is the demographic problem which impacts mainly the small remote communities of the MoK. Population decreases, a problem obvious not only in the Municipality but dramatically affecting the whole region.
Slow rehabilitation of the mines that could provide useful lands. These lands could be used for agriculture purposes and other business activities.

The support to the University of Western Macedonia needs to be enhanced as the limited recruitment of academic and research staff in critical areas is an issue. This has the consequence of a limited capacity to develop and support new technologies

The above-mentioned issues along with the departure of highly educated and trained people due to limited opportunities leads to a decreased number of scientific personnel available at the region.

Greater support for public services and infrastructures (such as health and care infrastructure, urban transport etc) is also required in order to incentivise inhabitants, especially young people, to remain in the area and also to maintain social life and cohesion in small communities outside the urban core of the city. In this direction, the new wing of the Kozani General Hospital, approximately 5,500 square meters, is expected to be completed within the next 3 years, upgrading the services provided to the citizens of the wider area on many levels.

## Town morphology / existing infrastructures:

The municipality consists of an urban centre (Kozani) and a number of small local communities, located around the city with very different characteristics covering a large geographical area. This leads to:

The requirement for different types of policies and actions
Existence of very narrow streets
Limited parking spaces
High concentration of inhabitants around the city centre
Difficulty in developing bicycle routes, limited green spaces
Limited capacity of the electrical grid for the support of new renewable energy installations
Lack of industrial parks and infrastructures to host new industrial activities

## Mobility:

Electric mobility develops slowly in Greece. This is mainly due to

The high prices of electric vehicles
The technology, which is still under development.
The lack of an extended network of electric chargers.
The difficulties arising due to the topography and morphology of Kozani
The limited parking spaces (required to completely charge an electric vehicle).

At the same time, the Greek Government and local authorities have decided to promote electric mobility since it offers an appealing alternative to conventional internal combustion based automobility.

## Social engagement:

The engagement and active participation of citizens in similar actions is traditionally rather limited. The climate action plan is determined to implement innovative ways in order to enhance participation and convey the ownership of the decision-making process to the

citizens, especially targeting the younger generation and exploiting the capabilities offered by smart technology and digitisation. The Municipality has realized this situation and plans to establish an innovative participatory model that places the citizens in the epicentre of the action plan.

In Western Macedonia, several actions and interventions have been undertaken related to the transition process, mainly concerning studies from various stakeholders, but also integrated projects on a municipal or regional level. The interventions of the local stakeholders such as the regional authorities, municipalities, academia and business community, chambers and trade unions, so far show a widespread skepticism towards the accelerated and time-pressing process of delignification. However, there is an increasing understanding in the local community of the necessity for lignite phase-out, while ensuring that the local population and economy do not face hardship from the transition process. It is becoming increasingly clear that the energy transition is not just about choosing the best technical solutions to decarbonize the energy system but relies heavily on human habits and behaviors as well as societal transformation and should ensure that no region or worker is left behind ("Just Transition"), especially for Western Macedonia where the transition is accompanied by a generalized reconstruction of the current economic paradigm.

## Other

Large number of old buildings: The vast majority of buildings have been built before 2010 and lack modern insulation and heating system technologies, resulting in high energy losses and deep retrofitting needs.
Challenging climatic conditions: The Municipality of Kozani is located in the northwestern part of Greece and has an average altitude of around 700m resulting in one of the coldest weather conditions in Greece. Therefore, more energy is required to assure the buildings' sufficient heating causing increased GHG emissions.

## A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

The Municipality of Kozani is in the process of founding a Developmental Corporation which, under its supervision, will focus on the creation and implementation of participatory models for climate neutrality, and ensure the active participation of citizens and stakeholders.

The ecosystem of the climate stakeholders of Kozani includes all parts of the quadruple helix: academia and research, local authorities, enterprises and - of course - the local society. The Municipality, as well as the Cluster of Bioeconomy of Western Macedonia (CluBE), which is a multi-actor platform for cooperation, are uniquely placed to cultivate cooperation between these groups as well as with other cities.

Citizens will play a pivotal role in driving systemic transformation towards climate neutrality in a participatory process as users, producers, consumers, owners, or political actors, together

with local stakeholders from academia, the energy sector, mobility, buildings, ICT, agriculture, and forestry.

The Development Corporation will implement an interactive participatory framework that can confront levels of power to encourage diversity and participation in decision-making from bottom-up initiatives.

The participatory models which are utilised for the development and execution of the climate action plan are based on the principle of inclusion, making the maximum effort to actively engage people from all demographic groups, without discrimination for income brackets, and especially focusing on vulnerable demographics that can often be underrepresented, such as the elderly, the unemployed, low-income citizens, minorities, and other groups. the most significant asset of the Municipality is its youth; consequently, its mobilisation and engagement are key levers for the successful outcome of the whole process. The educational community is very enthusiastic to link and enrich its conventional curriculum content and delivery modes to the City's vision for climate neutrality through structured programmes and targeted activities starting from early childhood to University level students.

Kozani agrees that the co-creation approach for the transformation of the city 'with the citizens and for the citizens' is the best way forward and a series of citizen engagement events have been organised based on a long-term plan for the participatory process.

The co-design processes also include open workshops (Living Labs) and the results will be put into consultation with the Citizens' Climate Board facilitating a participatory planning. In addition, student community engagement, which was utilised since the start of the ambition for Kozani's climate neutrality, has been pursued through school contests on climate-neutrality and digitalisation. More specifically, citizens have been given the opportunity to evaluate the proposals and at the same time make their own proposals and suggestions.

All participatory processes will be subjected to a system of design, testing and redesign based on participant feedback, so that improvements can be made on the participatory models and potential issues can be ironed out during the process.

An important aspect of the engagement plan is the thorough explanation and the persuasion of the citizens about the benefits that are anticipated from the successful implementation of the various components of the action plan.

Figure 20: Portfolios of actions related to Energy

The Municipality of Kozani is endowed with natural capital to take advantage of renewable energy opportunities: excellent solar resources, good wind sites, and substantial land and water bodies available for solar and wind generation. It has the potential worth investigating

Climate Neutrality Action Plan of the Municipality of Kozani

for: pumped storage, power blocks in power plants that could be reconfigured to run on heat generated by renewable electricity with the aid of thermal storage, the possibility of large-scale stationary storage in batteries, and the production in future of green gas to be utilized in power blocks or otherwise.

The Municipality of Kozani and Western Macedonia in general, could be a flourishing and innovative centre of economic growth and employment, leveraging its comparative advantage and social capital to the full, as an alternative energy transition pathway. Benefits would not be for the region and for Greece alone; rather for neighbouring countries in the Balkans, by becoming a centre for alternative energy and for energy storage services. This would also enable much higher penetration rates of variable renewables in Greece and the Balkans. Such an energy transition, preserving the energy identity and energy employment of Western Macedonia, can be expected to greatly facilitate the social acceptability of an overall energy transition of the region.

The Municipality of Kozani has a long-standing involvement, expertise, and successes in the general field 'Energy' and this is considered to be the most important priority area that will contribute to the accomplishment of climate neutrality.

In order to refine the plan and visualise the impact pathways, it has been decided to divide the Energy field of action into four separate particular Energy portfolios:

Renewable Energy Generation
'Greening' of District Heating
Energy Efficient Buildings
Smart Energy Systems

## Renewable Energy Generation

The portfolio includes a number of important actions which will have a significant effect on the accomplishment of the targets of the climate action plan. Some of these are listed below:

A 7MW Photovoltaic Power Plant is under preparation by the Energy Community of the Municipality of Kozani which will produce enough 'green' electric power that will cover the requirements of the Municipality.
A continuous effort is underway for upgrading of the Public Lighting through the introduction of LED lights and smart lighting management in order to significantly reduce electric energy consumption.
Currently there has been an enormous progress and growing interest on the planning, licensing, installation and operation of large scale renewable energy systems in the MoK, thus leading to an increasingly green energy mix. The installations are in their majority photovoltaic parks and wind farms. The attractive elements that contributed to this development is the availability of land and the existence of an established electric power transmission grid due to the thermal power plants of the region. A considerable number of these installations belong to energy communities. In the development of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan only small scale installations have been taken into account and a rather conservative assumption has been made that only 10% of the current applications for the development of renewable energy systems will be

materialised until 2030. Even this safe assumption is sufficient to drive the local emission factor for electricity at a level which is much lower that the national one approaching almost zero during the period of 2026-2030.

The climate action plan involves the introduction of a large number of PV and thermal solar systems to existing buildings will lead to reduced energy consumption and CO₂ emissions.

## ‘Greening’ of District Heating

The District Heating of Kozani is an important asset for Kozani. However, currently it is powered by heat produced by the lignite-fired power plant Agios Dimitrios of PPC and also by oil burners in order to cover peak demand.

The climate action plan aims towards providing “clean” energy to the citizens through the gradual ‘greening’ of the power source initially using natural gas and at a later stage though the electrification of the system with electricity which is provided by renewable sources. The electrification process will take place by using electric boilers and/or heat pumps.

Certain stakeholders of the MoK have already been involved in technical and financial discussions and others have undertaken feasibility studies.

The MoK participates in the NEUTRON project as the Lead partner, under the action entitled ‘Accelerating cities’ transition to net zero emissions by 2030’ – ‘NetZeroCities’. Under the NEUTRON pilot, the participating partners develop and showcase the methodology to support the transition via the definition of existing innovative technologies, such as the Green Heat Module (GHM); they implement this methodology in sectoral pilots, including energy production from RES and energy-from-waste (EfW), Digital Twins, Budling Information Modeling, and accelerate a just transition while focus on energy decarbonization of district heating, smart buildings, just transition, and circular economy in building sector, as well as to any other economic activity, including industry and agriculture.

## Energy Efficient Buildings

Figure 21 graphically illustrates the actions that are included in the plan for upgrading public and private buildings for improved energy efficiency.

The deep energy retrofit of private residences is the most significant action both in terms of GHG emission reductions and associated costs; and, it is expected to have a major impact reducing energy demand, CO₂ emissions and effectively reduce energy costs for the citizens. This action is the result of successful national initiatives which need to intensify and develop further at local level through appropriate resourcing. The adoption of bioclimatic principles on architectural design and regulations will be of major importance. The engagement of citizens is of paramount importance.

## Smart Energy Systems

Smart technology will be fully exploited "Smart Building" and Energy Management System for the monitoring and management of one or more facilities (buildings) which mainly aims at energy management, with the target of saving resources and reducing the costs and expenses of managing the Municipality's facilities, as well as the possibility for monitoring and upgrading the living conditions inside the buildings, by using digital twin - 3D models.

## Pilot Projects

In addition to the well-defined actions of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan, a number of pilot projects are under consideration in order to test the feasibility of innovative technologies at large scale. A list of pilot project can be outlined as follows:

EHHUR will tackle socio-economic and cultural challenges through relevant case studies facing social segregation, vulnerable residents (experiencing energy poverty), coal transition, depopulated and degraded historic centres.

# Mobility and Transport

Transport is a vital sector towards climate neutrality of Municipality of Kozani. Decisive policies, smart investments and changes in demand can trigger a vital shift towards cleaner transport modes and reduce the sector's impact on the environment, climate and our health. Transport connects people, cultures, cities, countries, and continents. It is one of the main pillars of modern societies and economies, allowing producers to sell their products across the world and travellers to discover new places. Transport networks also ensure access to key public services, such as education and health, contributing to a better quality of life. Connecting to transport helps boost the economy in remote areas, creating jobs and spreading wealth.

As demand has increased, so has the overall energy efficiency of new passenger cars, vans and trucks, planes, and ships, but not at the same pace as total transport emissions. The sheer volume of transport activity has impacted our GHG emissions and demands on all types of transport are expected to increase.

The city of Kozani is well-positioned to transform its mobility landscape and embrace sustainable transportation solutions. With a range of strengths at its disposal, the city can strategically navigate the pathways to achieve a greener and more efficient mobility system. Some of the Municipality's strengths are:

Existence of a pedestrian area where all special land uses, public and professional, commercial and recreational uses are included
The total length of sidewalks constitutes 16% of the total road network of the area
Implementation of a controlled parking system with vending machines
Detection of black spots
Fair pricing
Minibus operation
There is no through traffic within the city
Existence of a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUBM) and participatory planning of the local community

Climate Neutrality Action Plan of the Municipality of Kozani
ΔΗΜΟΣ ΚΟΖΑΝΗΣ Municipality of Kozani
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

A number of opportunities may arise for mobility and transportation within the Municipality of Kozani and these include:

The local community realizes the need to switch to walking
Introduction of an electric shared bicycle system
A large part of the road sections were identified without parking
Parking seems to decrease and zero depending on the distance of the studied streets from the city centre.
Shift to gentle means of transport
No through traffic
Introduction of electrification
Interconnection of urban transport
The local community realizes the need to switch to cleaner means of transportation

Kozani has already implemented the following projects:

Municipal fleet maintenance
Green initiative – eMotion
Information Events for New Vehicle Technologies
Operation of two routes with the minibuses of the Municipality of Kozani
Configuration of surrounding green spaces
Amendment of the approved city plan for the regeneration of the city center of Kozani
Elaboration of a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan
Urban infrastructure renewals

Municipality of Kozani aims to become climate-neutral by 2030. This cannot be achieved without a sustainable mobility system, based on cleaner and more active transport modes, cleaner fuels and, where possible, reducing the need for mobility.

Thus, Kozani will take advantage of future actions to be implemented in the “Transport and Mobility” field in order to reduce further GHG emissions and move effectively to climate neutrality.

Mobility and Transport consists of **six(6) main portfolios** that can lead to further reduction of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions until 2030.

Introduction of alternative fuel in transportations
Upgrade of Public Transportation Systems and Urban Logistics
Walkability &amp; Cycling Strategy
Introduction of IT technologies to Mobility
Infrastructures Upgrades &amp; Mobility Measures
Incentives and Citizen Engagement

The MoK participates in the project **JUST STREETS** (Mobility justice for all: framing safer, healthier and happier streets, HORIZON-MISS-2022-CIT-01). JUST STREETS is the project

proposal from a team of 30 partners from 17 countries, including 12 cities representing more than 4,5m citizens. It aims to transform cities' car-centered mobility narratives that take for granted that streets are for motorized traffic only, promoting walking, cycling and other active modes of mobility.

## Waste and Circular Economy

The Municipality of Kozani places particular emphasis on the promotion and implementation of actions towards the reuse and recycling of part of the MSW. It should be noted that the Municipality of Kozani, unlike most municipalities in the country, implements a program of Sorting at Source and recycling four streams of recyclable waste, with the result that the collected materials that are taken to DIADYMA SA facilities for processing have less residue than loads collected from the blue bin network. The Recyclable Materials (RA) collected from the recycling bins of the four streams have a purity that exceeds 95%.

From the micro-sorting at RECYCLABLE MATERIALS SORTING CENTER per material stream, packaging materials are again basically obtained which are also utilized in the correct stream.

Already in the Municipality, in addition to recyclable materials (paper, plastic, glass, metals), separate collection programs of various waste streams such as bio-waste, frying oil, lamps, batteries, bulky and green are operating.

The Municipality of Kozani is responsible for the collection of the mixed solid waste of the entire Municipality as well as the Recyclable Materials (RA) within the city of Kozani. DIADYMA is responsible for the collection of household waste bins outside the urban center of Kozani as well as the bins of bio-waste, green waste, bulky waste and frying oil.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan of the Municipality of Kozani
ΔΗΜΟΣ ΚΟΖΑΝΗΣ Municipality of Kozani

All the mixed and recyclable waste collected by the Municipality is transferred to the Local Waste Management Unit (WMU) of Kozani, while the organic waste and bio-waste collected by DIADYMA SA are sent directly to the Waste Treatment Unit (WTU) of Kozani.

Kozani participates in the following projects/actions:

SYMBI project concerning the Industrial Symbiosis for Regional Sustainable Development and Circular Economy based on Resource Efficiency
In2UCO project: INTEGRATED INNOVATIVE PILOT MANAGEMENT OF FRYING OILS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF CITIZENS &amp; STUDENTS
NOMAD project: NOVEL ORGANIC RECOVERY USING MOBILE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY
LIFE-IP CEI-GREECE project: CIRCULAR ECONOMY IMPLEMENTATION IN GREECE
SYMBIOSIS project: SYMBIOTIC NETWORKS OF BIO-WASTE SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT
Energy Communities of Kozani

Kozani moves to optimization of the waste management and recycling collection network including the introduction of new streams for sorting at source and scalability by 2030 and further development of Smart Waste Management (IoT) systems (i.e., full installation of sensors on bins and waste collection vehicle fleet). Six separate streams (a seventh is implementing at the moment) are already installed in the largest part of the Municipality. Kozani is trying continuously to increase Sorting at Source and recycling through installation of Green points.

Regarding circular economy, the vision of the Municipality of Kozani is:

To be a pioneer municipality in the adoption of circular economy practices in Greece as well as in their promotion in social and economic level, by shaping new circular economy patterns and governance practices at the local Government level
To utilize the circular economy practices and the related funding to create new jobs that will offset part of the de-lignification losses
To act as a catalyst for the circular economy throughout Northern Greece, with particular emphasis on the development of innovation structures and practices that will create long-term comparative advantages for the Municipality and its residents

Thus, Kozani will take advantage of future actions to be implemented in the "Waste &amp; Circular economy field in order to reduce further GHG emissions and move effectively to climate neutrality.

Waste &amp; Circular economy consists of three(3) main portfolios that can lead to further reduction of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions until 2030.

## Cross-sectional initiatives

## Digitisation

Digitisation can leverage human and social capital, entrepreneurship, knowledge, intelligence and creativity. Moreover, it can change the way of doing things and working effectively through collaboration, networking, and participation. Western Macedonia and the Municipality of Kozani in particular, is in dire need of modernizing its production base to become attractive for entrepreneurs and young highly skilled people, while at the same time addressing the needs of an aging and unevenly distributed population.

Digitisation runs horizontally across all impact pathways and is considered to be a highly important constituent for the accomplishment of the climate neutrality.

The initial phase of the implementation of the plan is about governance and more precisely on the organizations' competence to define their needs clearly and be able to integrate the solutions into their wider operations. Equally important is the organizations' ability to support the use and continuous demand for data and the upgrade of digital tools. The second phase concerns the supply and operation of the necessary systems that could revolve around functions and utilities such as: smart governance, smart economy, smart mobility, smart environment, smart energy, smart living, etc.

In parallel, developing citizens' digital skills is of paramount importance to ensure access to education, human resources management, in an inclusive society that enhances creativity and fosters innovation.

It has to be mentioned that the CAP proposes a number of digital actions which are planned for the later stages of the plan's implementation. In this way, smart technologies will have become more robust and easier to use and also the level of familiarisation of the citizens will improve through targeted learning initiatives. It is well-understood that digital tools without a strong community and trust process just adds an extra layer of complexity and can become a barrier. It is quite apparent that all the proposed digital tools are not in an urgent need at the beginning and can be strategically added without creating additional complexity and barriers. Whether all the proposed platforms are required or not will be dynamically assessed as the implementation of the plan evolves and maybe it is quite likely that tools that are more familiar to everyone can be exploited especially in the beginning.

Despite the above reservation, the development and implementation of particular digital tools can have significant co-benefits to remote small communities as they can improve access to services locally without the need to travel to the urban centre of the MoK. The same is the case for particular disadvantaged social groups where the use of digital tools can facilitate access to services, reduce the sense of isolation and improve the chances of inclusion.

## Open Mall

The Municipality of Kozani, in cooperation with the Commercial Association of Kozani and the participation of businesses, proceeds to the development of a Municipal Open Trade Center called "Open Mall". The action concerns the implementation of targeted interventions to upgrade the functionality and aesthetics of the intervention area which is located in the city center with the adoption and use of smart applications. The portfolio includes a number of actions which will be implemented by the Municipality and actions that will be implemented by the Commercial Association.

Among others, the actions include upgrade of public lighting, planting of trees, upgrade of parking spaces, improvement of accessibility, installation of urban furniture made from environmentally friendly materials, acquisition of modern mini-buses that will offer free access to citizens, smart parking spaces, smart crossings etc.

In addition, through the use of smart systems, it is expected to reduce the city's operating costs, harmonize with European guidelines for sustainable mobility and waste management. The Open Mall project is in line with the principles of environmental protection. More specifically, the proposed interventions contribute to the limitation of air pollutant emissions and/or the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the rational management of municipal waste, as well as the proper energy management and energy savings. The reduction of traffic congestion, the reduction of travel time to the city center and traffic on the main streets of the city during peak hours as well as the immediate reduction of the energy footprint of roadside

electric lighting are some of the proposed interventions that move towards environmental protection and resource efficiency. Improving energy efficiency both in public buildings and in the private sector (businesses) will lead to a reduction in energy consumption and consequently to a reduction in emissions to the atmosphere. In addition, improving air quality means limiting the exposure of the population to pollutants.

## Green Hydrogen

An Innovation Hub for green hydrogen and energy storage in Western Macedonia (H2-HUB) funding of 18 million euros has already been secured. It will include a hydrogen cluster based at the National Centre for Research and Technological Development (CERTH) in Ptolemais, an electronic hydrogen technologies application platform and a Centre for Hydrogen Studies at the University of Western Macedonia. The infrastructure will be complemented by a hydrogen technology park consisting of a 1 MW photovoltaic park, two electrolytes to produce 60 kg of green hydrogen per day which will initially be used in two municipal heavy-duty refuse trucks and two smaller personnel and supply vehicles.

The project entitled "H2 Innovation Hub" has been included in the Just Transition Development Plan (SDAM) of the Region of Western Macedonia ("Territorial Plan for Fair Transition of Western Macedonia" - Priority 2: Energy Transition-Climate Neutrality, Renewable Energy Sources (RES) Promotion, 2nd consultation, June 2021) acting as an Innovation Zone, with the coordination of research institution CERTH/CPERI located in Ptolemaida.

Furthermore, the Public Power Corporation (PPC) and Motor Oil have introduced it Hellenic Hydrogen, for the development of hydrogen applications, with the first objective of developing a "Hydrogen Valley" in Western Macedonia which will include the development of a 100 MW

electrolysis plant to produce approximately 11,789 tonnes of renewable hydrogen using wind and solar energy.

# The development of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan

In order to estimate the influence of each intervention on $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, an in-house computational model by the University of Western Macedonia that it calculates the emission reduction caused by each selected action and accumulates all the individual reductions in order to estimate the total combined effect. A detailed time evolution of all the actions that are introduces has been carefully decided and their effect on GHG emissions has been estimated using either measured data from previous experience or values that are found in the scientific literature are utilised. This process is not very straightforward as the emission coefficients proposed sometimes vary significantly. In these cases, a more conservative approach has been followed in order to remain on the conservative side of the calculations.

The computational model contains historical data related to past energy and energy savings interventions in the Municipality of Kozani and has also been used in order to perform parametric studies on the influence on GHG emissions of various parameters that are related to factors such as the type of interventions, their prioritisation, their intensity, the individual emission factors, the time-evolution of implementing various actions of the plan etc. The above sensitivity analysis studies proved to be extremely useful for quantitative and qualitative decisions related to the development of the climate action plan.

In parallel, economic aspects of each intervention have been included in the model and the effect of changes on the particulars of individual actions on the total cost requirement was estimated. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were carried out for the development of a hierarchy interventions in terms of resulting $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions reduction per unit of investment cost; or otherwise 'value for money' or each intervention.

The model is under continuous development and refinement, and it is planned to be used during the implementation of the action plan as this will be a dynamic process. In addition, the model will be used to monitor progress in GHG emissions reduction in combination with other tools that are used to support the implementation of other plans of the Municipality, e.g., the SECAP.

Figure 28 shows the percentage participation of the proposed interventions in the energy savings for year 2030.

The building sector interventions have a tremendous share in energy savings of MoK. Consequently, it is highly important to develop a local funding initiative which will strongly support this intervention. In addition, the most important challenge for the successful outcome of the climate action plan is the engagement of citizens in undertaking the renovation of their houses and flats. Inevitably this requires strong financial incentives as it is addressed in the associated Investment Plan.

Among the green energy actions proposed, Figure 29 shows that the renewable energy projects that are under planning and preparation to be installed through private funding, occupy the largest share in terms of installed capacity (approximately  $64\%$ ). Renewable energy installations on Municipal buildings are also very important ( $29\%$ ) and installation on private buildings roofs have a share of approximately  $6\%$ .

Most of the electric lighting network includes lighting fixtures and lamps, most of which are of old technology with significantly higher energy consumption than modern ones. With the supply and installation of more energy-efficient equipment in the street lighting of the Municipality of Kozani, the ultimate goal is to save resources, reduce operating and maintenance costs and improve the lighting quality of the local authorities. The purpose of replacing the lamps with conventional lamps is to use LED line technology lamps which give white lighting (without the use of filters), highlight architectural elements of the cities, with the main characteristics of high efficiency, low energy consumption and long life, resulting in minimal maintenance required. The purpose of installing an electronic management system with the ability to adjust light flow is the ability to respond to all management needs, with the ultimate goal of a more rational management of financial resources and improving the quality of the service provided to citizens. With the help of the above interventions, 5,813.60MWh can be saved and correspondingly the production of 907.89 tonnes CO2/year can be avoided.  |

Covering District Heating Thermal Needs with Green Energy

|  Action outline | Action name | Covering district heating thermal needs with green energy  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   | Action description | The plan includes three stages of improving the District Heating emissions of the Municipality of Kozani. The reference in terms of CO_{2} emissions is the average value of the three years 2018-2020, i.e. 91,813.17 tn CO_{2}.
• Until the year 2024, the situation remains as it is, with the supplied heat coming from the AIS Agios Dimitrios and the oil boilers of DEYAK. The CO_{2} emission factor is 0.347 tn CO_{2}/MWh.
• In the years 2025 and 2026, the model that will be utilized is heat production of 95% from the Agios Dimitrios power plant with lignite combustion as today and 5% from electric boilers which will be supplied with green electricity (via PPA). The cost of the electric boilers is taken over by PPC SA. In this case district heating CO_{2} emissions drop to 87,222,508 tn CO_{2} (4,590,658 tn CO_{2} reduction compared to the reference). The emission factor is set at 0.330 tn CO_{2}/MWh.
• In the years 2027 and 2028 the supplied heat will come from the following mixture:
45% Ptolemaida Unit V (lignite combustion)
45% Cogeneration of Heat and Electricity (CHP fired with natural gas) at the facilities of the former Kardia power plant
6% Thermal solar installation (production of hot water from the sun)
4% Electric boiler (electricity from green energy source through PPA)
The solar thermal installation will have a thermal power of 15MW, it will be built by DEYAK and the cost is expected to be 30,000,000.00 €.
The cogeneration unit at Kardia power station s is financed by PPC SA (at a cost of 99,200,000.00 €).  |

The cost of interconnecting District Heating with the new scheme that will provide it with thermal energy is 55,000,000.00 € and is divided into the cost of interconnecting pipelines (42,000,000.00 €), construction of a new District Heating pumping station and renovations (12,000,000.00 €) and accompanying projects (1,000,000.00 €).

The benefit of this combination will be a drop in emissions compared to the reference by 44,116,272 tn CO₂, as its emissions drop to 47,696,894 tn CO₂. The emission factor of district heating drops to 0.180 tn CO₂/MWh.

As the plan so far contains a small percentage of green energy and the Municipality is planning with a horizon of drastically limiting CO₂ emissions over 80%, it was proposed to DEYAK and the proposal was judged to be realistic in the years 2029 and 2030 the share of 45% of thermal energy from burning lignite to be replaced by the simultaneous increase of the participation of cogeneration to 60% and the introduction of thermal energy production from a system of heat pumps (heat pumps) with a participation of 30%. The heat pumps will be supplied with green electricity (probably via PPA). The remaining required thermal load continues to be provided by 6% Solar thermal installation and 4% Electric boiler.

The cost of heat pumps with a total thermal power of 30MW is estimated at 39,000,000.00 € (1,300,000 €/MWth). The benefit of this combination will be a drop in emissions compared to the reference by 83,305,207 tn CO₂, as its emissions drop to 8,507,959 tn CO₂. The emission factor of district heating drops to 0.032 tn CO₂/MWh.

# Penetration of vehicles fuelled by CNG and LPG

|  Action outline | Action name | Penetration of vehicles fuelled by CNG and LPG  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | Action type | Introduction of alternative fuel in transportations  |
|   | Action description | The transportation sector plays a significant role in global carbon emissions, making it crucial to explore alternative fuels and technologies that can help reduce environmental impacts. One promising solution is the use of vehicles powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG) or compressed natural gas (CNG). These clean-burning fuels offer several benefits over conventional gasoline or diesel vehicles, ranging from reduced emissions to enhanced fuel efficiency.

LNG and CNG vehicles emit fewer greenhouse gases compared to their gasoline or diesel counterparts. Natural gas combustion produces lower levels of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and virtually eliminates particulate matter emissions. When considering the entire fuel life cycle, including extraction, processing, and transportation, natural gas still exhibits lower overall emissions compared to conventional fuels. This makes LNG and CNG vehicles an effective strategy for mitigating climate change and improving air quality in urban areas.

In addition to lower CO₂ emissions, LNG and CNG vehicles significantly reduce the release of pollutants that contribute to poor air quality.

|   | Action description | As cities and municipalities seek to reduce their carbon footprint and combat climate change, transitioning municipal fleets from conventional vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs) emerges as a promising solution. The electrification of municipal vehicles brings numerous benefits, with a key focus on decarbonization and the mitigation of CO2 emissions.
One of the most significant advantages of EVs is their ability to produce zero tailpipe emissions. By replacing conventional municipal vehicles, such as buses, garbage trucks, and service vehicles, with electric alternatives, local governments can make substantial progress in reducing CO2 emissions. As EVs do not rely on fossil fuels and use electricity as their primary energy source, they contribute to a significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and help combat climate change.
The rise of EVs aligns seamlessly with the integration of renewable energy sources. By coupling EV adoption with renewable energy, we a powerful combination is realised that accelerates the transition to a sustainable energy ecosystem. Moreover, EVs mitigate the release of harmful pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM).
EVs are inherently more energy-efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles. Electric drivetrains convert a higher percentage of energy from the grid to power at the wheels, reducing energy waste. Additionally, EVs feature regenerative braking systems that capture and store energy during deceleration, further improving overall efficiency. By optimizing energy usage, EVs contribute to a more sustainable transportation system, aligning with the goals of resource conservation and environmental stewardship.  |

|   |  | Finally, the rapid development of EV technology has led to improvements in battery performance, driving range, and charging infrastructure. As battery costs decline and charging networks expand, the economic viability of EVs continues to improve. While the upfront cost of EVs may still be higher than conventional vehicles, the total cost of ownership, including fuel and maintenance expenses, tends to be lower over the vehicle's lifetime. By transitioning to EVs, individuals and businesses can achieve long-term cost savings while making a positive environmental impact. This action foresees the replacement of 10% of private vehicles (passenger cars and heavy-duty vehicles such as trucks) of Kozani by the end of 2030. This accounts to 2,487 vehicles. Apart from that an additional 4.8% reduction of the private vehicles is also expected to take place by the end of 2030 due to the population shrinkage of the Municipality. This fact is based on the progressive reduction of private vehicles provided by the Hellenic Statistical Authority based on data of the period 2010-2020. The following graphs illustrate the replacement of private vehicles and the shrinkage of the aforementioned fleet of Kozani.  |

|   | Action description | Upgrading Municipality's logistics planning is a crucial step towards achieving sustainable and efficient urban transportation. These include:

**Creation of Small Urban Supply Chain Centers:** The establishment of small urban supply chain centers strategically located within The Municipality offers multiple advantages. These centers serve as consolidation points where goods from various suppliers are collected, sorted, and redistributed using eco-friendly transportation modes. In the context of the optimization of the urban supply chain, it is considered appropriate to establish a specific schedule for loading and unloading, which should be observed by all parties. In this way, the traffic of loading and unloading vehicles is avoided, which are usually more voluminous and can create traffic and parking problems, during peak hours when a large number of residents move. With the specific schedule, loading and unloading will take place during the periods of the day when there are no significant traffic loads of other vehicles. At the same time, it is foreseen to define specific parking places for the loading and unloading vehicles so that they are not forced to park illegally and obstruct the traffic. The specific positions are reserved exclusively for these types of vehicles only during the opening hours. These spaces will be able to be contracted via a telematics system. Thus, an intelligent supply management system which includes loading and unloading schedules, and optimal routes will be developed. In addition, loading and unloading places will be developed in areas of commercial interest. The observance of of loading and unloading time-schedules is connected to the jurisdiction of Municipal actions of the  |

|   |  | Municipality and Traffic Police. The supply management system will be developed realized by mid 2026. Moreover, in Kozani 5 areas are identified in order the centres to be established within the Municipality starting from mid-2026 until late 2028.

**Use of Municipal Electric Two-Wheeled Vehicles:** electric bicycles or scooters, for appropriate tasks within the municipality can significantly contribute to decarbonisation efforts. These vehicles provide an efficient and environmentally friendly alternative for tasks that do not involve heavy freight or large distances. By opting for electric two-wheelers instead of conventional gasoline-powered vehicles, municipal servants can reduce local air pollution, noise levels, and greenhouse gas emissions. This include the purchase of 5 two-wheeled electric vehicles that will be used by the municipal servants. The adoption of electric two-wheeled vehicles in municipal logistics offers the opportunity to integrate renewable energy sources into the transportation system. Charging stations for electric vehicles can be powered by solar panels or other renewable energy technologies, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and further lowering the carbon footprint. This integration supports the decarbonization of the transportation sector and contributes to the overall mitigation of CO_{2} emissions. This will be realized by the end of 2029.

This action showcases a commitment to sustainability and inspire other stakeholders, including businesses and residents.  |

|   | Action type | Walkability & Cycling Strategy  |
|   | Action description | Promoting walkability within cities not only enhances the livability and well-being of residents but also contributes to sustainable development and environmental conservation. This action includes:

**School Green Routes:** Creating dedicated pedestrian-friendly pavement and street formations in front of school complexes encourages students and their families to walk to school instead of relying on private vehicles (formation of green school routes). By prioritizing safety and accessibility, these measures promote active transportation, reduce traffic congestion around schools, and significantly lower CO₂ emissions. Furthermore, this action fosters a healthier lifestyle for children and enhances their overall well-being. The formation of school green routes rings is a measure that can create favorable traffic and urban planning conditions for children for safe and comfortable movement to and from school complexes. Therefore, the intensity of the measures needs to have an escalation in order to bring the desired results. This kind of escalation in the case of student movements begins with the interventions on the roads within the school rings and intensifies with the more drastic interventions on the roads around the perimeter of the school complexes. In particular, for the case of school facilities in the Municipality of Kozani, it is proposed to develop rings on the streets located within a radius of 250m from the buildings under consideration. The Municipality of Kozani, identified 39 school complexes in order to proceed to this measure. This include the formation of approximately 0.07km2 by the end of 2030.  |

Figure 42. Enhanced accessibility area.

**Pedestrian Crossings:** Developing crossings that prioritize pedestrian safety and convenience further promotes walkability. Actions such as densification of pedestrian crossings, elevated crossings, and the implementation of smart crossings improve the flow of pedestrian traffic and enhance safety. By facilitating the movement of pedestrians and ensuring efficient crossing opportunities, these actions encourage more people to choose walking as their preferred mode of transportation. This measure includes the formation of 14 nodes until 2030.

**Creation of Green Routes Connecting City Attractions:** Establishing green routes that connect the city's attractions creates an interconnected network of walkable paths. These routes, often lined with green spaces and parks, encourage residents and tourists to explore the city on foot. By providing attractive, safe, and accessible walking options, these green routes not only enhance the walkability of the city but also contribute to the overall reduction in carbon emissions. Green routes are planned by taking under consideration the following conditions: a) safe crossing arrangements for pedestrians, b) motor

|  Action outline | Action name | Infrastructure Upgrade to Enhance Mobility  |
|   | Action type | Infrastructures Upgrades & Mobility Measures  |
|   | Action description | The establishment of well-planned and efficient infrastructures plays a pivotal role in enhancing mobility within a municipality. Kozani will implement a comprehensive package that includes various infrastructure improvements, in order not only to improve traffic flow, road safety, and accessibility but also contribute to decarbonization and the mitigation of CO2 emissions.  |
|   |   |  1. **Change/Reduction of Speed Limits:** this measure, particularly in non-prioritized road networks, enhances road safety and reduces fuel consumption. Lower speeds result in smoother traffic flow, reduced traffic congestion, and fewer abrupt acceleration and deceleration events, thereby reducing CO2 emissions from vehicles. This measure includes the purchase and installation of 600 signs which will be installed progressively from 2024 until 2030 according to the following schedule:  |
|   |   |  Signs for speed limit  |
|   |   |  1.000  |

network hierarchy, including the creation of ring-roads, which will improve traffic distribution and reduce the reliance on congested city center. By diverting through traffic to outer ring-roads, local roads experience reduced traffic volume and congestion, leading to improved fuel efficiency and lower emissions. The reorganization will be studied and implemented by the technical service of the Municipality. For the prioritization of the streets of the urban network, the streets are classified into categories according to the degree of the basic function (mobility or access) that they perform: a) "Free Avenue", b) "Main arterial road", c) "Secondary arterial road", d) "local distributor road" and e) "Local street". This will be realized the first semester of 2025.

**Light Traffic Areas in Neighborhoods, City Center, and Sensitive Areas**: The Municipality designs light traffic areas in neighborhoods, city centers, and sensitive areas prioritizes pedestrians, cyclists, and public transportation, reducing the dominance of vehicles. Promoting non-motorized transportation options leads to lower carbon emissions, improved air quality, and a healthier urban environment. This measure includes the formation of light traffic area of approximately $478.000\mathrm{m}^2$. This will be implemented based on the following time schedule:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

By enhancing traffic efficiency, this infrastructure improvement reduces fuel consumption and associated CO_{2} emissions, contributing to decarbonization efforts. This action concerns approximately 200m of formation of one-way street which will implemented by the end of 2024. 5. **Upgrading Intersections to Enhance Road Safety (Small Roundabouts)**: The Municipality will upgrade intersections with traffic calming measures (small roundabouts) which will contribute in improving road safety and reducing the frequency of stop-and-go traffic. Smoother traffic flow reduces fuel consumption and emissions, while the enhanced safety encourages walking and cycling and thus, further reducing vehicle reliance. Kozani plans to establish 14 nodes that will upgrade traffic conditions. The measure is planned for the period of 2025-2026. 6. **Spot Node Improvements with Low-Cost Interventions**: This low cost interventions at spot nodes, such as improved signage, markings, and pedestrian crossings, enhances safety and accessibility. These interventions encourage active transportation and discourage unnecessary vehicle use. The Municipality plans to improve 30 nodes starting from 2025 until late 2027. 7. **Reinforcement of Horizontal and Vertical Signaling - Marking**: This measure improves traffic efficiency and safety. Well-designed road markings, clear signage, reduce traffic congestion. This will be installed at 46.35 km of the total road network of Kozani from late 2026 until late 2027. 8. **Creation of Ring Road to Prevent Congestion**: The Municipality will establish a peripheral ring road in order to divert traffic around the city center, preventing congestion and reducing fuel consumption caused by stop-and-go traffic. This infrastructure improves overall transportation efficiency and supports CO_{2} emissions reduction. This ring-road will be ready by the end of 2026.  |

|   |  | 9. **Boxing of Legal Parking Spaces and Creation of Parklets:** By boxing legal parking spaces and repurposing them as parklets or green spaces, Kozani can reclaim valuable urban land while discouraging private vehicle use. This measure concerns 25 parklets which will be realized by late 2026.

**Replacement of Road Paving Materials on Selected Streets:** The Municipality will replace conventional road paving materials with eco-friendly alternatives, such as permeable pavement or recycled materials. These reduce the carbon footprint associated with road construction and maintenance. Additionally, these materials can improve stormwater management, reduce heat island effects, and contribute to overall environmental sustainability. These materials will be installed at approximately 15km of road network of the city of Kozani by the end of 2025.

The establishment of this comprehensive infrastructure package, encompassing speed limit changes, road network reorganization, intersection upgrades, brings multiple benefits. Beyond improving traffic flow, road safety, and accessibility, these infrastructure enhancements contribute to decarbonisation and the mitigation of CO_{2} emissions.  |

Sorting at Source

|  Action outline | Action name | Sorting at Source  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | Action type | Sorting at Source enhancement & Recycling  |
|   | Action description | Sorting waste at the source is a vital practice in the fight against climate change and the reduction of CO2 emissions. This action aims to enhance this field and to upgrade recycling in the Municipality. Although, waste management is the most suitable field for practicing circularity, however, it is still a national issue to be resolved. This is not the case of Western Macedonia. In Western Macedonia recycling is an enhanced sector, although upgrading is also welcome.

By implementing effective waste sorting systems, Municipality of Kozani can significantly contribute to decarbonisation and the mitigation of CO2 emissions. This is due to the fact that when waste is properly sorted at the source, recyclable materials can be diverted from landfills. Organic waste can be composted, and recyclable materials such as paper, plastics, glass, and metals can be recycled. By reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills, the production of harmful greenhouse gases, including CO2 and methane, is minimized. Moreover, sorting waste at source promotes higher recycling rates. By separating recyclable materials from general waste, these materials can be efficiently processed and reused in the manufacturing of new products. Recycling reduces the need for extracting raw materials, conserves energy, and decreases CO2 emissions associated with the production process.

At the end of 2020 the Municipality of Kozani have already proceeded to minimize the disposed waste to approximately 36% of the total fraction, when compared to the levels of 2010. Although, this quantity can be further reduced. Thus, Kozani plans to proceed on the following actions in order to minimize as  |

possible the disposed waste, and consequently the CO₂ emissions.

**Green Spots**: These are strategically placed facilities where residents can properly dispose of specific types of waste. By providing accessible locations for proper disposal, these facilities promote responsible waste management practices and reduce the likelihood of such items ending up in landfills or being improperly handled, minimizing associated CO₂ emissions. Moreover, green spots often include recycling stations where residents can deposit recyclable materials separately. This facilitates efficient material recovery and increases recycling rates, reducing the need for raw material extraction, energy consumption. Kozani plans to strategically establish 12 spots throughout the Municipality as well as at least two Mobile Green Spots will serve the smaller areas of the municipality, in which there is no easy and quick access to a fixed Green Spot. Their role, in addition to collecting materials for recycling and reuse, will also be informative – educational. At these spots, citizens and businesses will deposit waste, separately for each category, either waste for recycling or special management, or items for reuse. Green Spots is a first sorting and classification of materials into reusable and recyclable. Green Points can vary in size, with or without special infrastructure. According to the Government Regulation 18485/2017 (Government Gazette 1412/B) they are classified as Green Points, inside or outside settlements and especially in:

Small Green Spots and
Big Green Spots
Neighborhood Green Spots
Mobile Green Points

This action starting from late 2025 and will finalised until the end of 2027, according to the following schedule:

Pay-as-You-Throw Program: The Municipality plans to implement a pay-as-you-throw program, which considers it as an effective way to encourage waste reduction and sorting at the source. Pay-as-you-throw program charges residents based on the amount of waste they generate. This incentivizes waste reduction by encouraging individuals to be more mindful of their consumption habits, leading to a decrease in overall waste generation. Reduced waste translates to lower CO₂ emissions from waste disposal processes, connected to landfill emissions. Moreover, this program motivates individuals to separate recyclable materials, such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal. Kozani will charge lower council rates to everyone who produces less waste and/or recycles more. By implementing this prevention action, the Municipality of Kozani focuses on the promotion and support of sustainable production and consumption model and encourages the production and use of products that ensure the efficient use of resources, particularly promoting the reparability, durability and reusable nature of products. The program will begin at mid 2024 and will continued until the end of 2030.

Establishment of creative re-use Centre: Kozani plans to establish this type of centre which is a community space where volunteers offer their skills to repair broken or old items. The required tools and materials will be available to repair clothing, furniture, electrical appliances, bicycles, etc. In this centres visitors bring their damaged items and along

|   |  | with the experts do their repairs. This centre promotes a culture of repairing and reusing instead of discarding and buying new items. By extending the lifespan of products, they reduce the demand for new production, which often comes with significant CO_{2} emissions. Repairing and reusing items also conserve resources and energy, contributing to a more sustainable and circular economy. Moreover, this centre diverts items from landfills, reducing the environmental impact associated with waste disposal. The creative re-use centre will be established by mid 2026.
**Park of Circular Economy**: This is one of the good practices of the promotion of circular economy as well as industrial symbiosis, i.e. a process by which the waste or products of one industrial (or industrial process) become the raw materials for another. The application of this concept allows the use of materials in a more sustainable way and contributes to the creation of a circular economy. A Park of Circular Economy is therefore a community of industrial activities, located in a common space, within which members actively cooperate, using circular economy practices, so that:
To maximize economic, environmental and social benefits
Minimize environmental impact and resource consumption
To strengthen the economic and environmental development of the region/community The Circular Economy park will be established on the outskirts of Kozani. This park will be used by the all the Municipalities of Western Macedonia and will be financed by the Regional Authority which considers it as an emblematic action. Thus, this is not an action programmed of the Municipality, however Kozani will harvest the benefits of this action.  |

|   | Action type | Certification and Green Procurements  |
|   | Action description | Green certification of a Municipal Authority is a powerful tool for promoting sustainable development, mitigating CO_{2} emissions, and creating environmentally conscious communities. Green certification provides a comprehensive framework in order to assess, monitor, and improve their sustainability performance. This certification sets clear targets and guidelines for reducing CO_{2} emissions, promoting renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency, and implementing sustainable practices across various sectors. This involves transitioning to clean and renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency in buildings and infrastructure, and promoting sustainable transportation options.

Green certification emphasizes the importance of preserving and protecting natural resources within the municipality. It encourages the adoption of sustainable land-use practices, the conservation of green spaces, and the promotion of biodiversity. With this certification Kozani fosters community engagement and education on sustainability issues. It encourages awareness raising among residents, businesses, and educational institutions about the importance of reducing CO_{2} emissions and adopting sustainable practices.

The objective of the Municipality of Kozani is the certification of products and services so that they bear Circular Economy Certification and/or Ecolabelling, as a result of which the efficient use of resources is achieved (e.g. use of secondary raw materials) so that it becomes easier and safer to disassembly, reuse and recycling. In general, there is a lack of specifications and certification bodies  |

In addition, Kozani will proceed in training of the municipal employees on Green Public Contracts. This action is expected to contribute to the achievement of circular economy in the field of public contracts and procurement of the municipality. By using its purchasing power, the Municipality to procure goods, services and projects with reduced environmental impact, it can contribute at local, regional and national level to the achievement of national and international sustainability and environmental policy goals. In this context the Municipality aims also to the development of an information application for selection criteria for choosing the appropriate Green Public Contracts/Circular Public Contracts. Training will begin from the beginning of the action plan along with the development the development of the application.  |

|   | Action type | Awareness Raising for Waste Treatment  |
|   | Action description | The current action is about the Educational programs concerning awareness raise activities & encouragement in the participation of citizens in the traits of Circular Economy. Raising awareness campaign are interrelated concepts that must be developed together because through information comes awareness and through awareness citizens become more receptive to being informed and ultimately to actively participating. Therefore, in the context of strengthening environmental awareness and creating a culture on circular economy issues, it is necessary that the citizens should be continuously informed. The Municipality of Kozani, in the context of promoting Circular Economy issues, will draw up a publicity - information program with targeted education and awareness actions for all its citizens. The composition of the training, publicity and information program presupposes the optimal combination of: 1. factors linked to the target groups (availability, level of knowledge, etc.) and 2. external factors (budget, available experience, etc.). The people/recipients of the information programs should be selected so that they can then act as multipliers of the message and thereby expand the number of recipients. It is also very important that the information programs do not only work at the start of the program, but continue throughout its duration to support its implementation for the maximum possible period of time. The main actions of the program refer to the following: A. Educational Activities in Schools  |

|  Action outline | Action name | Digital organization and management platform for work-flows, processes, cases and documents.  |
|   | Action type | Software Platform  |
|   | Action description | The Document Management Information System is an integrated solution for digital document management and recording workflows with support for digital signatures. It works in a fully online environment as it is a (web-based) application. It is based on Open Source Software, with customizations, adaptations and extensions thereof, to fully cover the needs of the end user.

The Platform includes:
• Document Management System
• Business Process Management System
• Digital Document Signature System
• Possibility of Protocol System Integration
The Platform provides an easy-to-use, fast and secure document, file and information management environment.
With simple and specific procedures, each user has the ability to add-remove, edit, search electronic documents/files in their storage space. The user can create groups, cases, folders and subfolders. There is a process of marking, using tags/descriptions, for easier searching of the documents. By using optical character recognition (OCR) technologies, it provides the ability to search text in PDF documents and JPG images. At the same time, with the use of free text search, the user can search for any word/sentence in the texts, search with identifiers of the document (date, author, title, creator, etc.) or based on the characterization he has given (label, category, etc).
The management environment is designed to be accessible even to unfamiliar users. With flexible and simple procedures, each user has the possibility to adjust the organizational structure of the System according to his preferences, to give access to other users to his documents or to lock his files.

## B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emission

In order to improve the quality of life and remove residual emissions, the Municipality of Kozani will introduce green spaces and proceed to the afforestation and reforestation of areas in the Municipality. Ways to enhance carbon in soil such as former lignite-mines phytoremediation are also evaluated. At the same time new bioenergy production stations with carbon capture and storage system (BECCS) will be installed. Moreover, the installation of a direct air capture (DAC) pilot system covering its energy needs by the excess energy of RES is an alternative.

CERTH participates in Life Terra (https://www.lifeterra.eu/en) which is one of Europe's largest climate action initiatives. It brings together 16 experienced organisations from 8 countries and is led by the newly established Life Terra foundation. Life Terra is founded on the fact that tree planting is regarded as the most cost-effective nature-based solution to capture carbon. As part of a multi-faceted mitigation strategy, planting trees can play an important role in the fight against climate change and the devastation it causes (heat waves, drought, forest loss, desertification, erosion, flooding). Life Terra seeks to bring people together to plant 500 million trees in Europe, harnessing and monitoring nature's own carbon capture mechanism and enabling citizens to take urgent action against the climate crisis.

So far, within the administrative boundaries of the Municipality of Kozani, about 3,205 trees have been planted, including an iconic plantation effort of 2,030 trees with a clear significance and message towards the local society! According to international literature, a mature tree (older than 15 years) captures annually about 20-40kg of CO₂. Based on the number of trees already planted and the above annual capture amount, the trees planted in Kozani during the LIFE Terra project contribute to the capture of approximately 64 to 128 tonnes of CO₂ per year. By the end of the project (2025), based on its objectives, 250,000 trees will be planted in the region of Western Macedonia (most of them in mining areas). It is therefore estimated that these trees will contribute to the capturing of 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes of CO₂ per year.

En effort has already been initiated in order to quantify the amount of trees and other types of vegetation that currently exist and cover various topographical areas within the boundaries of the territory of the MoK. A second step is the development of a model that estimates the amount of CO₂ that is mitigated by the various types of flora. As part of the Climate Action Plan, a detailed inventory will be developed which will monitor the changes in the distribution of the various types of vegetation and the use of land in general, on an annual basis. At the same time the amount of mitigated CO₂ will be monitored and in combination with the monitoring of the CO₂ emissions from other sources, the estimation of the residual emissions will be more accurately calculated. This will allow a more accurate quantification of the requirements for new planting of trees beyond the amount of trees that will be planted in the framework of the Life Terra programme. In parallel, the MoK will organise a continuous planning process that will dynamically identify and prioritise the public spaces for planting of trees, seeking at the same time all the necessary resources. At the same time, the co-creation process of the CAP will engage citizens in the process of making their own individual contribution by 'greening' their privately owned land and/or participating voluntarily in the actions of the Municipality.

* Available data are being assessed and it is possible either by the final submission or during the monitoring process to add initial information and target values for this indicator.
** This indicator is already monitored as the local Emission Factor for Electricity (EFE). However, due to the large number of PV installations in MoK its values are now negative. The Action Plan development team has to consider while a negative EFE should be used as a residual emissions reduction factor or kept to zero.
*** Other indicators are going to be added in future versions of the plan and during the monitoring process. The number of buildings that are being retrofitted, the number of electric car charging spots and the public funds spend to the actions are some of the indicators that the development team is going to add.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 47: IoT network and Smart City applications

The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has created a profound opportunity to reimagine urban living, enabling us to transform our cities into Smart Cities. The Municipality of Kozani is at the forefront of this change, utilizing a LoRa-based IoT network. By 2030, MoK aims to integrate smart devices into numerous application domains, creating an extensive, data rich IoT network, as shown in Figure 47.

The core objective of this ambitious plan is to harness the power of data for decision-making. IoT devices across the MoK, embedded into infrastructure and public services, will constantly collect a vast array of data. This data will provide valuable insights into the functioning of the city, feeding into data-driven decision-making procedures.

A significant benefit of this IoT initiative is the potential to dramatically reduce emissions, contributing to the fight against climate change. By leveraging smart technologies, solutions such as smart fleet management and smart parking will become an integral part of Kozani's urban ecosystem.

On the other hand, smart parking systems could reduce congestion and associated vehicle emissions. These systems provide real-time information about available parking spaces, minimizing the time drivers spend searching for a spot. This not only saves time but also reduces the carbon footprint of each journey.

# 2) Citizen participation and citizen-driven e-democracy

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 48: Citizen participation platform and its components

The Municipality of Kozani is setting an ambitious goal to adopt a citizen participation platform by 2030. E-democracy, or digital democracy, refers to the use of technology to enhance democratic processes within a political unit. The proposed platform is one tool aimed to foster bilateral dialogue between the municipal council and its citizens. Some indicative components of the platform are presented in Figure 48.

The goal is to create a participatory environment where citizens can receive real-time information and engage in discussions. This transparent approach ensures that policies and plans are subject to public opinion and critique, making the city's governance more accountable and responsive.

This open dialogue is expected to drive climate-friendly decisions, as the citizens become more involved and aware of the city's environmental footprint. By enabling citizens to propose local laws, the city is harnessing the collective intelligence and innovative thinking of its populace to find novel solutions to environmental challenges. This could result in innovative climate initiatives and an increased commitment to sustainability within the community.

# 3) Transparency for municipal decisions

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 49: Transparency for municipal decisions.

In an effort to ensure transparency and foster public trust, the Municipality of Kozani is going to bring municipal decision-making processes into the digital sphere, as presented in Figure 49. Central to this effort is the creation of an online platform where critical information, including procurement details and municipal council decisions, will be made publicly accessible. This is a significant step forward in promoting open governance and deepening democratic engagement.

The proposed online platform will serve as a hub of information, about the inner workings of local governance. By making key details about procurements and council decisions available to the public, the Municipality of Kozani aims to cultivate an environment of transparency.

This transparent approach is expected to have a substantial impact on the relationship between the city's residents and its local authorities. With an increased understanding of municipal processes, citizens can develop a stronger sense of trust and confidence in their local governance structures. This open dialogue and accountability can lead to a more inclusive city administration that is more closely aligned with the needs and aspirations of its citizens.

# 5) Establishment of the appropriate management scheme for Kozani 2030

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 52: Establishment of the appropriate management scheme for Kozani 2030

The Municipality of Kozani is set to undertake a crucial step towards achieving climate neutrality by establishing an appropriate management scheme, the transition team, as illustrated in Figure 52. A central component of this scheme is the reinforcement of the Kozani's Development Organisation (KDO) through proper authorisation. This will equip the organisation with the necessary resources to carry out a variety of activities, that are vital to the pursuit of climate neutrality.

Under this framework, the KDO will play a pivotal role in driving climate action, ensuring that all efforts are aligned with the overall goal of climate neutrality. The organisational capacity will be augmented to effectively handle the scale and complexity of these climate-related initiatives.

However, what makes the Mission of "100 climate neutral and smart cities by 2030" unique, is the approach related to citizens' and stakeholders' inclusion and the co-design of the overall process. MoK has facilitated the establishment of the Citizens' committee in the last years and

initiated its upgraded role in the management scheme from the very beginning of the Mission's announcement.

Furthermore, the Municipality of Kozani plans to assemble the local ecosystem of related actors and stakeholders, fostering a collaborative environment to pursue their common objective. This includes businesses, environmental organizations, community groups, educational institutions, and other stakeholders who can contribute to the cause. This collective effort is critical, as achieving climate neutrality requires a holistic and comprehensive approach, addressing a wide range of interconnected issues.

By unifying these actors under a common goal, Kozani can harness their collective expertise and resources, creating a powerful force for climate action. This inclusive approach not only accelerates progress but also ensures that the actions taken are well-rounded, addressing the needs and concerns of all stakeholders.

# C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions – textual and visual elements

## 1) Upskilling and reskilling

In a rapidly evolving digital world, keeping pace with new and emerging technologies is crucial. Acknowledging this, the Municipality of Kozani is initiating a forward-looking program focused on upskilling and reskilling its citizens.

The cornerstone of this initiative is the establishment of a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) laboratory for primary and secondary school students. The STEM laboratory is set to be a vibrant learning hub where young minds can engage with cutting-edge technologies and acquire skills that are vital in today's technology-driven world. The laboratory will offer a hands-on, explorative learning environment, encouraging students to dive into subjects ranging from coding and robotics to renewable energy and sustainable engineering.

Beyond providing an innovative education for young students, the initiative also aims to change and adapt the university study courses to include all the necessary modules, required for the transition to a climate neutral society.

Continuous learning and apprenticeship programs will be also put in place, focusing on emerging technologies and their applications. These programs are expected to equip Kozani's citizens with the necessary skills and knowledge to adapt to the shifting technological landscape.

A central goal of these upskilling and reskilling efforts is to foster a workforce capable of supporting the implementation of green and sustainable technologies in the region. As Kozani pursues its ambition of climate neutrality, a workforce skilled in these areas will be critical. They will drive the transition to renewable energy sources, develop and maintain sustainable infrastructure, and implement innovative solutions to environmental challenges.

## 2) Awareness-raising campaigns &amp; actions to citizens, pupils, and students

presentation and dialogues on clean energy and climate change, the encouragement of private initiatives such as used cooking oil recycling and planting plants at school, as shown in Figure 53.

These actions promote the learning of concepts such as climate change and bioeconomy from an early age to younger generations, as well as the education of older adults who do not often have the opportunity to access this kind of information.

# 3) Promotion of carbon farming to local farmers

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 54: Benefits of carbon farming for local farmers

Recognizing the pivotal role that agriculture plays in carbon sequestration, MoK aims to promote the concept of carbon farming among local farmers, with particular emphasis on those setting up new farming operations.

Carbon farming refers to agricultural practices that can absorb and store  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  from the atmosphere, a process known as carbon sequestration. This includes practices such as reforestation, cover cropping, and rotational grazing, which not only sequester carbon but also enrich the soil, boost crop yields, and enhance overall farm productivity.

The Municipality of Kozani's initiative will involve educating farmers about these practices, showing them the potential benefits and teaching them how to incorporate carbon farming into their operations. This involves various actions promoting the concept and providing guidance and consultation services. It's a comprehensive effort designed to ensure farmers have the necessary knowledge, skills, and support to implement these practices effectively.

This approach holds significant promise for increasing income for local farmers. By adopting carbon farming practices, farmers can improve the health and fertility of their soil, which can lead to higher crop yields and, consequently, increased income. Moreover, there are emerging markets for carbon credits, which could provide an additional income stream for farmers who can demonstrate they are sequestering carbon.

In addition to the economic benefits, carbon farming can make a significant contribution to  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  removal from the atmosphere, aiding in the fight against climate change. These farming practices also promote environmental phytoremediation, a process that uses plants to remove, detoxify, or immobilize environmental contaminants, thus improving the health of the local ecosystems.

Figure 55: Benefits of citizen ambassador programme

In a bid to strengthen citizen participation and enhance the connection between its people and local governance, the Municipality of Kozani is set to launch a pioneering Citizen Ambassador Programme. This innovative initiative will consist of voluntary "ambassadors" from various demographic groups or neighbourhoods who will connect community and local government.

This programme is designed to enable direct communication of citizen concerns to the local government. The selected ambassadors will gather feedback, concerns, and suggestions from their respective communities and present them to the local authorities. This will ensure that the voices and concerns of Kozani's citizens are heard and considered in municipal decision-making processes.

By representing specific demographic groups or neighbourhoods, these ambassadors can provide an understanding of the unique challenges and needs of their communities. The benefits of a Citizen Ambassador Programme are summarized above in Figure 55. It is also expected to foster increased social participation. By giving citizens a direct channel to voice their concerns and contribute to the decision-making process, the initiative encourages citizen engagement and active participation in local governance. This inclusivity can lead to a more informed and engaged citizenry, fostering a stronger sense of community and shared responsibility for the city's well-being.

# Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for further refining the Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract.

## Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration – textual elements

The effort for the preparation of the climate city contract and the climate action plan has been very intensive and continuous. There is a lot of team work and interaction with citizens and stakeholders, since they are the center of the co-design approach of the future Kozani as analytically described in the 3 reports, uploaded in the platform under the category “other” (PDF file:1st Phase CCC - Stakeholders' Workshops and CCB Summary Report, PDF file: 2nd Phase CCC - Stakeholders' Engagement Report and PDF File: 2nd Phase CCC - Citizens' Engagement Report). At the same time there is an ongoing networking effort with the other Greek cities in order to facilitate both the preparation and more importantly the implementation process.

The Municipality of Kozani has now developed its climate city contract and officially submitted it on 13.09.2023. The under-establishment transition team, as described above in Figure 52 (p.230), will be in charge of the contract's implementation, whose scientific review will take place in three steps and more specifically in:

2026: 1st official review of the CCC
2028: 2nd official review of CCC
2030: final review of CCC and recommendations

The emblematic project prioritizes the groups of actions that are going to take place as next steps and defines them as follows:

The establishment of the transition team, that will be in charge of the project's implementation
Intensification of awareness-raising campaigns to spread the message to every single citizen
Implementation of the actions defined as ‘early changes’
Implementation of the actions defined as ‘later outcomes’

Explain your city's motivation to join the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" and highlight your city's present commitments to climate action. You may also want to include the aims of this document.

# Your text

The Municipality of Kozani (MoK), with its more than 71.000 citizens, is located in the north-west part of Greece and has been the entire Greece's energy centre since 1955, when the huge lignite deposits were discovered and their exploitation to produce electricity has begun. For the following decades, Kozani has held a leading role in the country's electricity scenery, producing more than 75% of the country's total electricity.

This heavy production of electricity brought high development standards for the entire Region, but, as it was based on fossil fuels, this development came at a high cost, as the environmental degradation and the health problems came along, further multiplying as the lignite-based electricity production surged in the beginning of the current century.

However, things started changing in the last decades at global level: the Paris Agreement in 2015, signed by the vast majority of countries around the world, calls for holding the rising temperature level at "well below" two degrees Celsius to avoid an irreversible environmental degradation.

Greece has signed the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, in December 2015, as it has also supported the European Green Deal, approved in 2020. The EU Green Deal legislated that EU's greenhouse gas emissions should be 55% lower in 2030 compared to 1990, with the main goal of achieving climate neutrality in 2050.

In light of the above, the bold decision of the Greek Government in 2019 for the decarbonization of the electricity production and the decommissioning of the lignite mines and power plants by 2028 with the simultaneous transition to a greener energy and economy aligned with Kozani's vision for a greener future and better standards of living and well-being. Kozani has been preparing its post-lignite development (Post-lignite Development Plan 2020, Kozani's Declaration on Climate Neutrality 2021) and has been actively promoting the Paris Agreement's targets, also in line with the EU's Green Deal and the Greek National Strategy on Energy and Climate (2019).

At the same time, Kozani is looking into the present and future and considers it is high time to act and maintain its role as the leader of energy production in the country: being a pioneer on energy and environmental topics, the city can take advantage of the well-established local know-how on these fields and change its development model, transitioning to sustainable technologies and thus keep pioneering in the future, inspiring the rest of the Greek and EU cities.

However, this transition results in loss of jobs and income for the area, which also affects the loss of population, evident during the latest national census of 2021 (more than 10% population decline during the last decade). Facing this challenge, Kozani declares determined to take advantage of the move towards a greener future, creating new and greener jobs and offering

new opportunities for the city and more generally for the Region of Western Macedonia. It will thus aim to promote local economy, bring economic benefits in terms of new jobs, savings and business opportunities and more generally, improve citizens' well-being.

The city's transition to a climate neutrality by 2030 is a major challenge that can be turned into a huge opportunity for the city and its citizens, as it will strengthen and promote its economic development, offer new and more job opportunities, thus enhancing the area's demographic development, and improve air quality and therefore quality of life.

The Municipality of Kozani (MoK) has the potential and the ambition to accelerate the transition of the city to climate neutrality by 2030. In this framework, Kozani made itself another bold decision: the Mayor and the Municipal Council, fully aligned with the goals of the Mission, have declared the commitment of Kozani to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 (Kozani's Declaration on Climate Neutrality 2021, Municipal Council Decision No. 216/2021). In this framework, the Municipality has responded to the relevant Expression of Interest with a high-quality proposal which eventually resulted into its selection among the first 100 climate-neutral and smart cities!

Kozani has now developed its present climate city contract (CCC), but in the meantime it has already taken steps towards climate neutrality:

The Municipality of Kozani has already taken steps towards climate neutrality:

First of all, in the past it had set the target to reduce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions by $21\%$ in year 2020, as compared to the baseline year of 2010 (SEAP 2012, Municipal Decision No. 534/2013). The target was achieved and in fact it exceeded the initial target by reaching approximately $33,3\%$.
In addition, the Mayor of Kozani declared climate emergency on July 2021 aiming to make the Municipality climate neutral by 2030. To this end, Kozani adjusted the existing SECAP from an initial $50\%$ reduction target towards the new goal for climate neutrality aiming a $100\%$ reduction by 2030 (new SECAP 2021, officially adopted by the Municipal Council with the decision No. 6/2022).
Besides, the Municipality of Kozani (MoK) works closely with citizens and local stakeholders (i.e. the Cluster of Bioeconomy and Environment of Western Macedonia - CluBE, the University of Western Macedonia - UoWM, the Municipal Enterprise for Water Supply and Sewage - DEYAK, etc) in implementing a number of smart cities and digitalization projects with a direct effect in the Municipality of Kozani,
MoK has also retrofitted the majority of municipal buildings, installed photovoltaics on their rooftops, optimized the municipal lighting system, while the energy community of the municipality is investing in local energy production, since the study for the construction of a 7MW photovoltaic park, covering $100\%$ of its electricity needs, has been already approved.

Furthermore, the Municipality of Kozani participates in several networks about climate neutrality, such as the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, the Green City Accord, the CIVITAS, CLIMATTICA, ICLEI, crAFt and Intelligent Cities Challenge 2023-2025 Edition.
It has also established a network with the city of Limassol (Cyprus) and the six Greek municipalities, which participate in the Mission, under the name "Climanet" and has been awarded several awards in contests, among others the European Mobility Week Awards for 2020, 2021, 2022 and Oikopolis.

Since the very beginning of the announcement of the EU Mission on November 2021, the Municipality of Kozani has realized the pivotal role that the local society, including the local stakeholders and the citizens, will play in the successful mission's implementation for Kozani.

The implementation of this unique mission requires bold changes and could only be successful, if the local society as a whole is included in the co-design process and owns a share of the overall problem and therefore its solution. A city with the citizens, for the citizens and by the citizens is being developed, since the Municipality has adopted a bottom-up approach to climate change policies that requires the engagement of all stakeholders, among others municipal enterprises, ministries, public authorities, SMEs, and citizens.

Stakeholders' and citizens' engagements are based on long-term, honest relationships and require a very careful approach to facilitate their involvement, make them active members of the co-design process and finally partners in the project. The Municipality of Kozani decided to cover this part together with the Cluster of Bioeconomy and Environment-CluBE, an organization with extensive experience on similar tasks, having been responsible for the successful proposal's submission, in the 1st phase of the Mission on January 2022 and coordinating the project management office team, preparing Kozani's climate city contract.

Numerous events with the citizens have been organized since November 2021 to transfer the message to the citizens, promote the scopes of the Mission and engage them with the project (1st phase of the Mission). Other than this extensive awareness-raising campaign, 3 workshops with relevant stakeholders on different topics related to climate neutrality and 1 workshop with citizens took place in the 1st phase of the Mission, prior to the submission of Kozani's answer to the Expression of Interest in late January 2022, taking into consideration their opinion, facilitating decision making and paving the way for the new required governance model. A report covering in detail the actions of the 1st phase of the Mission with citizens and stakeholders is uploaded in the platform (PDF file:1st Phase CCC - Stakeholders' Workshops and CCB Summary Report)

In the 2nd phase of the Mission, after Kozani's selection, as one of the 100 cities of the EU Mission of "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030", the municipal authority has undertaken additional actions to deepen its cooperation with local stakeholders and upgraded the role of the citizens in the Mission.

The Municipality of Kozani in collaboration with CluBE identified, mapped the key local stakeholders and proceeded with 2 rounds of 1-on-1 meetings with each of them to capture their requirements and later on proposed concrete engineering and investment solutions aligned with the goals of the Mission and managed to receive their commitments. Moreover, a dedicated workshop on Mobility has been organized to inform enterprises related to the sector. A report covering thoroughly the abovementioned actions is also uploaded in the platform (PDF file: 2nd Phase CCC - Stakeholders' Engagement Report)

Large scale innovations and radical changes, as those initiated by the Mission, could only turn into reality if citizens' majority participate in decision making and co-design the "future city" according to their needs. According to Kozani's approach, the citizen is placed in the center of the Mission and is inextricably linked with every single decision related to it. New interactive tools such as mentimeter are used to facilitate citizens' participation in decision making and e-democracy in general, supporting the Mission's concept. Moreover, the existing citizens' committee has now an upgraded role and will be a key actor in the management scheme of this emblematic project. Citizens' engagement actions of the 2nd phase of the Mission can be analytically found in the uploaded report (PDF File: 2nd Phase CCC - Citizens' Engagement Report).

More specifically, citizens will play a pivotal role in driving systemic transformation towards climate neutrality in a participatory process as users, producers, consumers, owners or political actors, together with local stakeholders from academia, the energy sector, mobility, buildings, ICT, agriculture, and forestry. The citizen's committee will evolve to act as Living Labs or Citizen Labs and incorporate regulatory sandbox processes that facilitate experimentation, social entrepreneurship, prioritization and decision-making and make the co-creation approach the new normal.

To support the aforementioned approach, a compelling communication campaign has already been established, having its own website "https://climateneutral2030.cityofkozani.gov.gr/en/", its own logo as shown in Figure 1, based on the slogan "Kozani is making a leap into the future", and surrounded by many initiatives, among others:

Awareness-raising campaign and events, dedicated to pupils and students
Establishment of a permanent information spot in Kozani's central square

Summarizing all the above, the Municipality of Kozani has an ambitious vision towards climate neutrality accompanied by a very well-structured climate city contract and a communication campaign related to it, enabling the city to turn its vision into reality.

The well-structured climate city contract sets not only the overall ambition of the Municipality, but also the further commitments, principles and processes, which Kozani adopts, follows and commits to, in order to deliver its Mission.

Kozani's climate city contract is based on the co-design approach with many stakeholders and citizens and the cross-sectoral approach, trying to create synergies between them and
ΔΗΜΟΣ ΚΟΖΑΝΗΣ Municipality of Kozani

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

#

focusing on the actual needs of the city and its citizens. More than a commitment, Kozani's CCC is a process that builds trust between different stakeholders based on a new governance model.

It also provides all stakeholders with the opportunity to engage in this cause by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (PDF file: Commitments_Appendix I), a Declaration of Cooperation (PDF file: Commitments_Appendix II) and/or a Letter of Commitment (PDF file: Commitments_Appendix III) depending on the level of their engagement and their activities related to MoK's goals.

The city of Kozani will act as an open Living Lab itself, providing the ground for experimentation and innovation. In this way, it will also become an example for many other EU cities, especially the EU's highly carbon-dependent regions to meet their climate goals.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Articulate your 2030 climate neutrality ambition, as expressed and defined in your Cities Mission Expression of Interest (EoI). This should include your ambition and commitment to a 2030 horizon as a whole city, as well as describe any exclusion areas and summarise how these areas would be addressed beyond 2030. (A more detailed plan for exclusion areas should be included in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.) Your 2030 ambition should be supported at a minimum by a Council decision, and it is recommended that it is also supported by a wider stakeholder group. We also recommend you to list other co-benefits you aim to achieve when working towards the climate neutrality goal, like well-being, health, equity, justice, financial savings.

The city's vision for climate neutrality is explicitly stated in Kozani's Declaration on Climate Neutrality 2021, joining that way the rapidly growing global community that has recognized the planet's climate emergency. Kozani's existing SECAP has been already adjusted: the initial reduction target was decided at  $50\%$ , whereas the new goal for climate neutrality is even more ambitious setting an emissions' reduction target of  $100\%$  by 2030, according to SECAP 2021, (Municipal Council Decision No. 6/2022). The newly developed climate city contract of Kozani, officially adopted by the Municipal Council with the decision No. 383/2023 (uploaded in the platform with the PDF file: Municipal Council Decision No. 383.2023), applies to the whole Municipality of Kozani without any exclusion areas, analyses in detail the sustainable implementation of the specified actions, in terms of engineering and finance, and concludes to the final goal of  $80.3\%$  emissions' reduction by 2030 and to a total investment of 858.071 million Euros.

There is also a detailed plan to offset the remaining emissions. More specifically, as part of the Life Terra initiative 250.000 trees will be planted in the region, capturing 5.000-10.000 tonnes of CO2 annually. Furthermore, there is a plan to develop a detailed inventory of existing trees and other types of vegetation and a model that estimates the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  mitigated by them.

Taking into consideration the abovementioned offset actions and calculations, an accurate quantification of the requirements for new planting trees will take place to eliminate emissions. At the same time, the co-creation process of the CAP will engage citizens in the process of making their own individual contribution by 'greening' their privately owned land and/or participating voluntarily in the actions of the Municipality.

While this goal refers to the existing inventory, focusing on the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions, other pollutants, currently unaccounted, will be accurately quantified, assessed, and addressed with appropriate actions through the dynamic implementation of the Climate Action Plan. The more significant GHGs that are going to be quantified and assessed are Methane  $(\mathrm{CH}_4)$  and Nitrous Oxide  $(\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O})$ . Hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, Sulphur hexafluoride  $(\mathrm{SF}_6)$  and Nitrogen trifluoride  $(\mathrm{NF}_3)$ , also known as the F-gases, despite their high global warming potential, are expected to have a significantly smaller contribution to the GHG emissions in Kozani and will be included when appropriate studies will be conducted during the implementation of the Climate Action Plan. The thorough inventory will be developed as a priority action and monitoring and assessment will be included in future progress reports during the implementation of this plan.

Kozani's ambition to become a climate neutral and smart city keeps also pace with IPCC's objectives. According to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), there are multiple sectors of vital importance that are primarily affected by the climate change and so, the reduction of GHG emissions emerges as a dire need.

Taking into consideration its Emission Inventory, presented also in SECAP 2021, and the relevance of the required actions to achieve its climate neutrality, the Municipality of Kozani has divided the emblematic project into five fields of action as shown in Figure 2, each of them containing portfolios of actions and many actions respectively, described in detail in chapter 3 below, to facilitate its implementation and monitoring.

These co-benefits are in line with all the necessary steps that the Municipality of Kozani will take to promote a three-folded action on the basis of sustainable development and sustainable development goals (SDGs, 2015) and can be grouped as follows:

Economic: invest in new and smart technologies, smart energy consumption, energy production, green mobility, circular economy and bioeconomy, savings for the stakeholders and the citizens, test bed for attracting foreign investments.
Social: support the local community and citizens, ensure social justice and a socially just transition, promote digital governance, build social partnerships and participatory decision-making.
Environmental: improve the environmental conditions and the well-being of the citizens, enhance environmental resiliency, build a zero-greenhouse gas development model.

The citizens' well-being and health will obviously improve, as new job opportunities will be created and negative impacts on environment and health will be minimized. The participatory approach followed in this CCC will ensure all individuals are part of the climate neutrality process and "no-one is left behind", as the central, transformative promise of the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs declare. Equity and climate justice are central to the promotion of sustainable development and the local community will benefit from this whole process towards climate neutrality.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

This is the core section of the Commitments document that should summarise at least 3 or 4 systemic strategic priorities that need to be implemented for your city to become climate neutral by 2030. These should be meaningful changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in your city, like decarbonising the heating system in the city or generating 100% energy from renewables. The individual commitments between your city and other stakeholders should address these key priorities and contribute to reaching them. The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan should describe the all interventions, including those to reach your priorities as well as all further actions, in detail and describe how your city plans to implement them.

# Your text

The transition to net-zero requires economies and societies to adjust their key priorities and strategic interventions, in order to proceed to meaningful changes. Kozani has identified the following 5 key strategic priorities or fields of actions, as illustrated in Figure 2 above:

Energy
Mobility and Transport
Waste and Circular Economy
Green Infrastructure
Smart City

Each of the above fields of actions is divided into portfolios to facilitate the project's breakdown structure, implementation and monitoring. These portfolios are further divided into specific actions or interventions as listed and described in detail in Table B2-1 of the climate action plan. Below an overview of the portfolios of each field of action and a summary of the actions follows:

) The Energy field of action is divided into four portfolios of actions, as shown in Figure 3:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 3: Portfolios of actions related to Energy
ΔΗΜΟΣ ΚΟΖΑΝΗΣ Municipality of Kozani

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

C

a. Renewable Energy Generation

Kozani will use its environmental and energy expertise to continue playing a pivotal role in the country's energy affairs by replacing the conventional power generation units with renewable ones. At a local level there is also a detailed plan focusing on:

The construction of a 7 MW Photovoltaic Park to cover 100% of Municipality's electricity needs (public lighting, buildings etc) through the virtual net metering scheme.
Energy upgrading of public lighting with the installation of LED lights and smart lighting system
Integrated RES to existing buildings (RES installation on the rooftops, including PV and solar thermal) and especially residences that account for 57% of CO₂ emissions.
The construction of RES systems, leading to a greener energy mix

b. 'Greening' of District Heating

The District Heating of Kozani is currently powered by heat produced in the lignite-fired power plant of Agios Dimitrios of PPC, while its peak energy demand is covered by oil burners, leading to a ratio of 0.347 kg CO₂ per kWh. The system is going to be completely redesigned to provide cleaner energy and effectively reduce GHG emissions to over 80%. In 2030, the supplied heat is expected to come from:

60% cogeneration of heat and electricity (CHP fired with natural gas) at the facilities of the former Kardia power plant
30% introduction of thermal energy production from a system of heat pumps, supplied with green electricity (probably via PPA)
6% solar thermal installation
4% electric boiler

This system is going to cover the total demand for District Heating for the city of Kozani and the communities of Nea Haravgi and ZEP, that is why it is deemed as the "green basis" for its energy supply for its District Heating.

However, the Municipality is keen on exploring even greener resources of District Heating energy, considering of course the stability and sustainability of the new paths and will adapt accordingly its Climate Neutrality Plan during the process.

c. Energy Efficient Buildings

Regarding the Energy Efficiency of Buildings, Kozani will implement deep energy retrofit with activities that will include insulation, electrification, double glazed windows, infrastructure, lighting systems, pumping stations etc. of the following building categories:
ΔΗΜΟΣ ΚΟΖΑΝΗΣ Municipality of Kozani

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

C

private residences
municipal buildings
school buildings
sport facilities
tertiary sector buildings

# d. Smart Energy Systems

Kozani will establish a Smart Energy Management System on 35 municipal buildings, contributing to energy consumption optimization and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions reduction. The specific system monitors and controls the functions of the building, allowing a smooth operation and efficient functioning of the building, through an innovating software combined with sensors and actuators. The software will consist of a web application as well as an application for smartphones and tablets.

) The Mobility and Transport field of action comprises the following portfolios of actions, as illustrated in Figure 4:

a. Introduction of alternative fuel technologies in transportation
b. Upgrade of public transportation system and urban logistics
c. Walking and cycling strategy
d. Introduction of IT technologies to mobility sector
e. Infrastructure enhancement
f. Incentives and citizen engagement

MoK intends to achieve a more efficient transportation of people and goods. Besides, it aims to secure driving conditions and save money by reducing the fuel needs. In order to do so several infrastructure upgrades will take place. These upgrades will help in the promotion of walking and cycling. MoK will implement several measures with the aim to provide motivation to citizen's and increase their engagement as well as to increase municipal revenues and decrease violations. Such measures include, but are not limited to, the following: financial incentives to businesses that are friendly to active travel, reduction of municipal fees for businesses that operate with the aim of protecting the environment, reduction of fees for public transport, discouraging the use of vehicles by the citizens.

Furthermore, a small number of conventional vehicles will be replaced by CNG or LNG-fuelled ones, while it is expected that EV mobility can reach 10% of the private vehicles of the city by 2030. Moreover, EVs are expected to replace the existing municipal passenger cars to 100%, and the municipal trucks and buses to 51%. EV mobility will also be promoted by the installation of EV charging stations and the creation of low-emissions and noise zones, prioritizing the use of electric vehicles.

) The Waste and Circular Economy field of action will focus on three main portfolios of actions, as depicted in Figure 5:

b. certification procedure and green procurements to train municipal employees on Green Public Contracts, contributing to the achievement of circular economy in the field of public contracts and procurement of the municipality and leading to the reduction of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions, the recovery of useful materials, the acquisition of green and circular economy certificates
c. awareness raising activities to encourage citizens' participation in the traits of Circular Economy

# 4) Green Infrastructure field of action

a. Green Infrastructure &amp; nature based solutions portfolio of actions comprises of the following actions:

the continuous training of farmers on new energy efficient agricultural machinery and irrigation techniques. A wider information campaign will also be implemented. A number of technical solutions, namely electronic water extraction system for irrigation with debit cards, installation of variable speed drives and soft starters on pump motors and the installation of a power factor correction system through compensation with a capacitor array will be implemented.
improve urban living, meet the modern needs of cities as well as understand citizens' behaviours and desires. The creation of smart parks, equipped with solar trees with smart benches as an energy-independent, urban, multi-functional rest station is a first priority. The robust 5-seater smart bench will offer citizens and visitors access to the

Internet through a wireless Wi-Fi connection and improve the public recreation facilities and will motivate citizens to visit local parks and squares by foot, thus avoiding using their cars and causing further CO₂ emissions. At the same time, its integrated sensors will offer the possibility of quantitative and qualitative evaluation of environmental data to strengthen the planning of actions to improve urban living.

) Smart City field of action

a. Smart City portfolio of actions:

As part of this portfolio, MoK will enable a series of organisational and governance interventions that include the development of:

a digital organization and management platform for workflows, processes, cases and documents as a solution to the problems arising from the management and archiving of large amount of information
a smart city guide for both residents and visitors, providing them with access to information related to local businesses. The app will help reduce the carbon footprint by eliminating physical marketing activities such as: printed leaflets, printed posters, etc.
an electronic appointment management system improving the municipality – citizens interaction, allowing online appointment booking, reducing waiting time and in person visits and thus minimizing commuting and reducing CO₂ emissions
a Smart city platform as the central point of collection, control and management of all the data that will be collected from the individual subsystems it has and that will be developed by the Municipality in the future. The offered Platform is an open, cloud-based platform that enables the interconnection and communication of individual smart city solutions and applications.

# 4 Principles and process

Highlight the key principles that will guide your city as it implements its Climate City Contract, like accountability, transparency, or an open attitude to new approaches. The process should encompass principles like co-creation, innovation, multi-actor and citizen engagement, and should be systemic and demand-driven in nature. It should also be based on monitoring and joint learning. The Commitments Guidance document provides more specific guidance on how integrate these principles into your own process.

## Your text

Kozani is one of the 100 cities, selected under the EU Mission of "100 climate neutral and smart cities by 2030" to deliver concrete results towards climate neutrality by promoting research and innovation and introducing new forms of governance and collaboration. Engaging citizens for addressing the challenges and facilitating the city's co-design with citizens, for the citizens and by the citizens is the sole and only way to achieve these goals and are pivotal to EU Missions. The necessary adjustments towards net zero cities can be promoted through coordinated action engaging local communities in collaboration schemes with local governments.

To this end, Kozani's climate city contract consists of a cross-sectoral plan, including the thematic fields of energy, mobility and transport, waste and circular economy, green infrastructure and smart city, which involves citizens, the private sector, the public sector, municipal enterprises, research organizations and other stakeholders in the process.

The Municipality of Kozani participates in many EU and national projects, namely STARDUST, TIPS4PED, REFORMERS, EHHUR, ProLight, JUST STREETS, NEUTRON, SYMBI, In2UCO, NOMAD, LIFE-IP CEI-GREECE and SYMBIOSIS, analytically described in the climate action plan. Kozani works also closely with other Mission Cities establishing cooperation schemes and exchanging views and ideas. In particular, Kozani is part of the following cooperation schemes and networks:

a) Climanet, a network of the Greek cities, participating in the Mission, and the city of Limassol, Cyprus,
b) Cooperation and exchange of best practices with other EU cities participating in the Mission, such as Cluj-Napoca and Tampere.
c) City to city sessions in the NZC platform

## I. Principles

The Municipality of Kozani refines its core principles to deliver best results and accelerate transition by 2030. The core principles include:

### Participatory bottom-up approach

All relevant stakeholders, the local community, representatives from local unions, private enterprises, NGOs and others, will be involved in the decision-making. Multiple stages of participation will be available, including face-to-face meetings, online consultations etc. A multi-party bottom-up approach will be promoted at all stages and levels of cooperation. This has been clearly demonstrated during the proposal preparation phases 1 and 2, when various multistakeholder engagement processes have been put in motion, such as the Committee of
ΔΗΜΟΣ ΚΟΖΑΝΗΣ Municipality of Kozani

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

8

Citizens, workshops with actors, open consultations with citizens, student engagement events and many other similar organised to motivate and mobilise citizens and stakeholders to actively contribute to the Climate Action Plan development. An additional factor is the fact that MoK engaged the Cluster of Bioeconomy and Environment of Western Macedonia as the main proposal development coordinator, aiming to emphasize the multi-actor approach significance and importance for the entire Climate Action Contract!

## Innovation – new approaches

Kozani aims to boost the development of innovation and for this, it is going to continue working closely with the main innovation poles of the Region, i.e. the University of Western Macedonia (UoWM), the Cluster of Bioeconomy and Environment of Western Macedonia (CluBE) and the Centre for Technology and Research Hellas (CERTH). Together with the above, but also other stakeholders, Kozani is implementing or has implemented a number of EU projects that help introduce innovation to a number of fields and operations of the city, including the District Heating, Production of RES, Mobility, Digital operations, New Bauhaus, etc. This, on one hand demonstrates the commitment of Kozani towards Innovation, while on the other it highlights its openness to new approaches: Kozani dares to act like a test bed, aiming at incorporating the pilot or demo tests, once successful, to the rest of the city.

## Co-creation and joint-learning

Even beyond the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, the Municipality of Kozani was already positive towards involving actors and stakeholders in certain decision-making processes. However, it was during the preparation of the proposal for the Mission that Kozani applied co-creation extensively, mainly through workshops organised on thematic levels, in order to gain knowledge on specific topics and co-develop the solutions for tomorrow. Having witnessed the effectiveness and positive impacts of such procedures, the Municipality plans to integrate it within the implementation phase of its Climate City Contract and, eventually, extend it to even more domains and municipal operations. At the same time, the Municipality and the key stakeholders believe that this process is a two-way learning method for everyone involved: the stakeholders and the society will learn what the Municipality is planning and heading for and, on the other hand, the Municipality will get a much better grasp of what the society is looking for, bringing both sides even closer that where they currently are.

## Access to information

The Municipality of Kozani will ensure that all stakeholders have access to information about respective projects. Citizens will be able to submit their written complaints, ask for information via telephone or e-mail communication. For this purpose, MoK has already developed Kozani's 2030 website, a dedicated website to this emblematic project the main Kozani 2030, which already contains a lot of information and is planned to host the majority of public information available to the society.

## Inclusion

|  **ΔΗΜΟΣ ΚΟΖΑΝΗΣ**
**Municipality of Kozani** | 2030 Climate-Neutrality
Commitments |   |
| --- | --- | --- |

The Municipality of Kozani will ensure equal access for all, especially people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized, because of physical or intellectual disabilities and will put special effort in engaging members of minority groups. The Municipality of Kozani will also include vulnerable groups, women, young professionals etc. All procedures undertaken for turning Kozani to a neutral city will be culturally appropriate.

## Accountability

Accountability is the cornerstone of the principles declared hereby. It underlines the duty of the Municipality to take responsibility for its actions and provide explanations when necessary. The proposed Monitoring Mechanism will offer the means to apply this principle.

## Transparency

Transparency is a core value of good governance and sustainable development, too. It directly relates with accountability and participation. The Municipality of Kozani is committed to transparency and will ensure it in all its activities and actions. Besides, the Municipality of Kozani will be releasing all respective documents for consultation and will hold regular meetings with the public. For this purpose, the main website it has already established to promote the Mission in Kozani will also serve as the tool to expose every aspect and decision making process to the wider public, in order to raise awareness and involve the society to the maximum possible.

## Precautionary Principle

The Municipality of Kozani will follow the precautionary principle in all the projects that will be implemented towards climate neutrality. The precautionary principle prevents causing harm when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter is lacking and lies at the heart of sustainable development.

## II. Processes

The Municipality of Kozani refines adopts certain critical processes to deliver best results and accelerate transition by 2030. The core processes include:

### Building support among stakeholders towards the neutrality goal

Raising awareness is extremely important for building support inside the local community. Apart from the private sector, unions and citizens groups, individual citizens will also be included in the process. The Committee of Citizens, already established in the first phase of the proposal, is a good example, other cases, more neighborhood focused, will be set in motion by the Municipality as well as by stakeholders and end users in the city.

### Mainstreaming ownership

Citizen engagement is a prerequisite for achieving the Mission. Thus, the citizens will play a major role in implementing and taking the ownership of the transition. This is envisaged both in the co-creation process of the entire Contract, as well as during the constant review of the activities to be implemented. Such an ambitious target will be achieved through the Committee
ΔΗΜΟΣ ΚΟΖΑΝΗΣ Municipality of Kozani

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

C

of Citizens, as well as numerous other participatory processes that the core team will set in motion once the whole procedure kicks off officially.

## Reporting back to the community

The Municipality will provide regular feedback to relevant stakeholders to clarify issues and concerns related to its Mission. It will present results and invite the local community to be part of the process.

## III. Multi - Governance Collaboration Mechanism

The current climate governance model of the Municipality of Kozani involves its Directorate for the Environment, the Programming Office, the Technical Services Directorate and the Energy Efficiency Office, all coordinated directly by the Mayor.

To achieve its goals towards climate neutrality, the Municipality of Kozani undertakes all necessary steps to establish a new, efficient and innovative governance mechanism with all stakeholders on board. The new governance model, presented in Figure 6 and called the Transition Team, will embrace an inclusive and participatory approach towards climate neutrality, help overcome existing barriers, enable organizational recruitment flexibility and develop accountable mechanisms.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

ΔΗΜΟΣ ΚΟΖΑΝΗΣ Municipality of Kozani

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

1

In specific, the Municipality of Kozani establishes the Kozani's Development Organization, which will be responsible for the implementation of the climate city contract and all related projects, acting under the guidance and reporting to the Municipality of Kozani and the Municipal Council.

The Kozani's Development Organization (hereinafter KDO) will be organized as follows:

## A. Board of Directors

The members of the Board of Directors are elected by the General Assembly of shareholders, according to the provisions of Law 4548/2018.

## B. Mission Manager

The Mission Manager is a non-executive member of the KDO, who coordinates the Development Organization and the city's actions to fulfil its Mission. The Mission Manager lies at the cornerstone of the necessary new governance model, which links different plans and projects into an overarching environmental portfolio.

He/she ensures the coordination of related projects and funds and monitors the sound implementation of the respective activities.

Both the executive members of the Board of Directors, as defined in the relevant statutes, and the Mission Manager have proven work experience in the planning, execution and implementation of development programs and the sustainable development of local societies

## C. KDO's Secretariat

The Secretariat supports the Mission Manager in his/her daily workload and is responsible for communication, dissemination, coordination and all administrative activities, which facilitate the operation of the KDO.

## D. CCC signatories' committee

The organizations, signed the climate city contract, will operate closely to the Mission Manager and support his operation by covering thematic fields and areas of their respective expertise. This scheme, although not internal organisation of the Municipality, will play an important role in the project's implementation.

The KDO is directly connected and interacts with a number of external schemes that play a pivotal role in shaping the program and its activities towards Climate Neutrality and Smartness.

More specifically:

## E. Advisory Board

The Advisory Board will include high profile experts from academia and business to provide scientific and market steering and ensure continued political support to the process.
ΔΗΜΟΣ ΚΟΖΑΝΗΣ Municipality of Kozani

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

#

## F. Citizens' committee

During the 1st phase of the Mission, the Municipality of Kozani has developed a Citizens' Committee, with the aim to provide consultation on actions and priorities that should be included within the proposal. The success of this endeavour led the Municipality to continue working with this Committee for the climate city contract preparation. The Municipality now intends to officially establish this Committee as a legal form, which will then acquire its independence and act as a constant interlocutor and reviewer of the suggested actions, while playing an active role in the regular updates of the Climate City Contract.

## G. Stakeholders

Since the very beginning of the announcement of the EU Mission on November 2021, the Municipality of Kozani has realized the pivotal role that the local stakeholders should play in the development of the Vision and the Action Plan for Kozani.

In this framework, MoK adopted a bottom-up approach to climate change policies and mobilised and engaged many local and regional stakeholders, including among others municipal enterprises, ministries, public authorities. SMEs, associations, etc.

A number of workshops during the 1st phase of the Mission and dedicated meetings with an important number of key stakeholders for the 2nd phase of the Mission proved to be very effective and paced the way for its plan to involved many stakeholders during the implementation of its Climate City Contract: these stakeholders (and many more to be later identified) will be in constant communication and cooperation with the KDO, in order to improve the implementation of the planned interventions, but also to constantly provide the floor for new ideas and innovations to be incorporated within the continuously updated Climate Action Plan.

## H. Citizens

Citizens are placed in the heart of the co-design process and the extensive ongoing awareness-raising campaign, that accompanies the Municipality since 2021.

Citizens will be a crucial part of the transition team and will interactively communicate with the citizens' committee to provide it with useful insights regarding the project's implementation.

## I. Monitoring and Review Mechanism

Monitoring and review mechanisms are very important for environmental and development projects. The Municipality of Kozani will establish a Monitoring and Review Mechanism in order to address any community concerns, to reduce any possible risks and to resolve concerns linked to the city's transition to a neutral city.

The Monitoring and Review Mechanism will:

a. Check annually the follow up of the projects related to the Mission and report back to the Community.
ΔΗΜΟΣ ΚΟΖΑΝΗΣ Municipality of Kozani

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

b. Scientifically review Kozani's overall Climate and Energy Strategy, policies and projects on a regular basis and proceed to changes and adjustments when necessary. More specifically, the climate city contract will be officially reviewed based on the following timeline:

: 1st official review of the CCC
: 2nd official review of CCC
: final review of CCC and recommendations

c. Serve as a transparent and credible process of evaluating the impacts and results of the implemented projects and activities

The reports will be prepared on an annual basis by the Mission Manager, and/or persons appointed by the KDO in cooperation with the Mission Manager. The preparation of the report will follow a participatory approach, where the Citizens' Committee and the local stakeholders shall contribute substantially in it in cooperation with the authors. Their contribution may be facilitated by regular meetings with the authors and/or by offering data and information throughout the preparation process.

The Monitoring and Review Mechanism will follow specific principles and processes in order to be effective and legitimate, such as:

Accessibility: all stakeholders will be aware of the mechanism and will have access to it. Further care will be provided in case of particular groups of people, which face access barriers.
Equity: fair and informed terms of the process for all
Transparency: sufficient information will be provided at all stages of the process

Its reliable structure will build trust between all stakeholders of the community.

IV. Barriers

Kozani starts its Mission with the establishment of a new governance model introducing Kozani's Development Organization (KDO) and the position of the Mission Manager. However, this will be a dynamic process and necessary adjustments will be enforced in the future if required.

Currently the most important barriers could be summarized as follows:

Fragmentation of responsibilities, i.e. the degree of involvement of each stakeholder
Discrepancies between the strategy and its implementation, due to the complexity of the whole project and implementation's timeline
Resources/ cost of investments

The necessary adjustments to overcome barriers are:
ΔΗΜΟΣ ΚΟΖΑΝΗΣ Municipality of Kozani

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

C

a. Regulatory/institutional:
Need for an enabling regulatory framework at the national level
Incentives

b. Socioeconomic – financial:
Ensure that significant Public and Private Funding will be available for over a long period of time
Use innovative financing tools
Engage the private sector
Re-skilling
Scaling up staff capacity
Vulnerable groups

c. Structural/technical:
Systemic approach, which ensures that all actors are involved
Deepen cooperation between Mission cities
Enhance dialogue with industry

The Climate Action Plan has demonstrated the systemic barriers to climate neutrality, highlighting the role of several stakeholders in the process (such as DIADYMA and DEYAK). Cooperation schemes established by the Municipality of Kozani with respective stakeholders will support the necessary adjustments, especially regarding the role of each stakeholder towards the Mission.

Apart from the cooperation and network schemes, that are necessary for the Mission to be successful, there is a greater need for an enabling regulatory framework at the national level, which will offer more incentives to all relevant stakeholders.

In addition, it is of utmost importance to ensure that funding, both public and private, will be available and the Municipality of Kozani has already undertaken actions to engage the private sector in the process and use new financing tools.

Citizens’ awareness is a top priority of the Municipality and projects for re-skilling are necessary as well. The Municipality of Kozani involves all citizens in the process and cooperates with other cities to exchange good practices. By establishing the Monitoring and Review Mechanism the Municipality of Kozani will be able to regular review its actions and policies and make all necessary adjustments to overcome any barriers and fulfil the Mission.
