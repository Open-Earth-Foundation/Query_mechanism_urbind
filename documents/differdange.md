# 1 Summary

This first iteration of our dynamic and living Action Plan, designed to grow over time is the product of an extensive consultation process with a wide range of stakeholders from within municipal government, as well as external partners. The city supported the drafting of it in collaboration with EVERARD Consulting &amp; Communications.

The Action Plan is focused around 5 central components:

Preliminary estimates suggested that base emissions averaged 1,254,721 tons, mainly due to industrial processes, the municipal and citizens' base emissions average around 130,000 tons. Due to the sustainability goals of the city's stakeholders, an estimation of the gap of 20% of current emissions can be made. This leaves a gap of around 200,000 tons after offsetting emissions (say somewhere between 0% and ~20%) to account for reductions that are already in progress with current strategies, plus roughly 0–5 percent more.

Module B-1 provides a complete list of strategies to accomplish climate neutrality, shedding light on ways by which the emissions gap can be lessened. These strategies are expressed quantitatively in terms of the projected emissions impact of each action cluster and qualitatively through an articulation between interventions on a sequence from initial outcome to subsequent ones. These strategies compose basic action plan structure for Module B-2.

At its core, the Action Plan is a 152-action portfolio designed to dismantle systemic barriers and spur activity in alignment with strategies outlined in Module B-1. This first group of actions is expected to cut emissions by approximately 150,000 tons and could drive even more reductions as additional assessments are carried out. While these fell short of full climate neutrality — which is still the goal for all Amazon operations worldwide by 2040 under The Climate Pledge, there remains more to do through even further expansion. The portfolio also features 152 projects around exploring how to do this at scale along with an array of work.

152 enabling actions that support the portfolio enable strategies to be implemented. Elaborated in Modules C-1 and 2; these actions are related, but aimed primarily at local collaboration within the city boundaries (institutional governance innovations) seeking to catalyze just transitions (social innovation), while internal municipal policy is identified as a critical entry point for them.

The Action Plan will be implemented through a structured portfolio management process and refined overtime as we learn more from our work and the world around us. A biennial update of the Action Plan with monitor, record and detail progress.

# 2 Introduction

Demographically, Differdange was strongly influenced by the waves of Italian and Portuguese migration, which contributed to its predominantly French-speaking character. Geographically, located in the Paris Basin, the city has a mining heritage, characterized by underground and open-pit mining. Economically, the territory of Differdange is divided into three equal parts: natural areas, industrial areas and urbanised areas. Some of the natural areas are protected as nature reserves or Natura 2000 areas, and the city also benefits from drinking water sources. However, its past and current industrial activities have led to problems of air, soil and noise pollution. The urban area is characterized by a developed transport network, significant transit traffic and many buildings built in the 1950s to 1970s. In the face of a shortage of building space, urban densification is becoming a necessity.

The city's goal is to reach 100% net carbon neutrality by 2030. We will take the industry out of our calculations, as we do not have enough opportunities to influence private decision-makers, but we remain in constant contact with them to influence their development in a positive and productive way for the mission. Regular meetings and exchanges are scheduled. Our 2030 target covers the entire administrative territory of the city without exclusion zones. Exclusions (industry) will be addressed after 2030 through ongoing collaboration with Arcelor Mittal and their "Responsible Steel" approach. The market does not regulate itself, if the economic interest does not present itself to the industrial leaders. The city has figures from the three largest companies, because they participate in emissions trading, but for the rest of the industry, these figures do not exist.

The key stakeholders to be involved in achieving the 2030 climate neutrality objective are, for the industry side, Arcelor Mittal, Ceratizit and Ocsial. As regards the Luxembourg State, the Ministry of the Economy, the Ministry of the Environment and the Administration of Nature and Forests, and the Ministry of Spatial Planning. The most important stakeholders at local level are policy makers, citizens and traders and restaurateurs.

The formal procedures and planning frameworks to which the CCC action plan should align in the City of Differdange are the municipal law, the municipal code and the commodo/incommodo.

The CCC Action Plan integrates and complements Differdange's existing Climate Action Plan, including the Klimapakt approach, membership of the Klimabündnis and the creation of the City's Ecological Service.

Our city will use the CCC as an instrument to bring together all existing and future efforts towards climate neutrality by including measures from existing plans such as SUMPs (under development) or SECAPs (Climate View) in the portfolio of actions described in Module B-2, and we will then consider all associated emission reductions as part of the emissions gap as defined in the guidance document and in Module A-2 to be addressed by this plan. Other approaches that will be integrated are the waste management concept, the municipal bonus scheme, the Digital Twin approach (under development), participation in the Clima Borough, adherence to the Fairtrade and FSC approaches.

Additional information to be created or obtained for the CCC Action Plan that is not yet covered by existing plans or documents is the SUMP, which is in the creation phase, details on future integration of industry data and details on carbon sinks.

This first version of the CCC Action Plan covers the following objectives:

According to the request for expression of interest (EoI) submitted by the city of Differdange for the Mission of Cities, the city aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. This includes climate change adaptation, accessibility, healthcare and equity. To achieve this goal, Differdange plans to increase the use of renewable energy, promote sustainable mobility, improve the energy efficiency of buildings and reduce waste.

The city works closely with private actors, including large industries, even though it has designated them as exclusion sectors. These actors will not be able to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, but they are an integral part of the process. Differdange plans to work closely with all participants and engage in international collaboration to overcome challenges beyond 2030. This underlines the importance of a fair transition that includes everyone.

Differdange plans to put in place a comprehensive climate change adaptation strategy, identifying priority areas for intervention, such as renovation of residential buildings and improved waste management, while strengthening the city's capacity to deal with energy crises. Initiatives to make the city more accessible will also be put in place, including through the promotion of sustainable mobility, the development of green spaces and the improvement of public transport through a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP).

As regards health, the municipality plans to promote healthy lifestyle habits, such as reducing air pollution, promoting physical activity and improving access to green spaces.

Differdange has identified five systemic strategic priorities to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, including focusing on stationary energy and aiming to renovate 50% of buildings to improve their energy efficiency.

The objective is to achieve energy self-sufficiency by producing 100% energy from renewable sources, which implies a transition from fossil fuels to renewables. In addition, it is planned to reduce individual mileage by 20% to meet the mobility challenge, promoting active mobility and improving public transport services.

The recycling rate will be increased to 65% and the total amount of waste reduced by 40%, which will have a significant impact on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To offset CO2 emissions, 20% of the necessary offsets will be purchased in the form of certificates, and 50% of these offsets will be made on the city's land, potentially through the creation of carbon sinks.

These priorities, which focus on areas of municipal competence, will be key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving the objective of climate neutrality by 2030.

The next versions of the Action Plan will include the changes that materialise as a result of the CCC's iterative approach. Beyond these changes, LULUCF will be able to play a role in future versions. The LULUCF sector concerns carbon emissions and removals from land use, vegetation and soil organic matter. This sector replaced the former LULUCF category, which focused on land use, land change and forestry. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, human activities on managed land are considered sources of carbon emissions and removals, even if some processes are partially natural. Natural events influenced by human activity, such as fires and storms, are also taken into account.

The areas concerned mainly include forests, rich in carbon, stored in trees, soil and litter; agricultural land, where carbon is mainly stored in the soil; as well as wetlands and peatlands. Carbon flows are mainly affected by land use change, such as afforestation, deforestation, urbanisation and conversion of wetlands to arable land, or by changes in agricultural practices.

The objective of the inventory is to measure emissions and removals from different carbon pools, including living biomass, dead wood, litter and soil organic matter. This inventory takes into account all greenhouse gases associated with the sector, including CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). When the sector absorbs more CO2 than it emits, it is considered a carbon sink, thus generating negative emissions.

Another point that could be integrated is the IPPU, the "Industrial processes and use of products". The term 'Industrial Processes and Product Use' refers to industrial activities and practices that produce greenhouse gases, as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This

includes a variety of industrial processes such as the production of cement, lime, steel, adipic acid, nitric acid, aluminium, magnesium, as well as emissions of gases such as sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) from electrical equipment. It also includes emissions of perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and SF6 associated with the production of semiconductors and the use of substitutes for ozone-depleting substances.

Despite the existence of recommendations, good practices for these processes, some activities such as the use of limestone and dolomite, the production of sodium carbonate, ammonia, carbide, as well as the manufacture of various chemicals and metals, are not yet regulated by specific guidelines. The IPCC recommends the application of the general principles of its recommendations to these processes not specifically covered.

# 3 Work process

Differdange being quite a small city, the team that governed the mission was comprised of two aldermen and representatives of different city-services. The team was lead by M. Luc Arend and coordinated by M. David Everard of the external consultancy EVERARD Consulting &amp; Communication.

The team met weekly and discussed the different steps necessary to create a good action plan and develop overall mission strategy. The city council itself was involved in approving the plan.

EVERARD Consulting &amp; Communication conducted over a dozen internal workshops with the different department heads to elaborate the action plan as you can find it in this document as well as four city-wide civic participation workshops in which Differdange's citizens were called upon to give their point of view and ideas for the action plan at hand.

The financial plan was developed in close collaboration with Max Felten, the city manager and in house economist. This plan was brought to life in 6 internal meetings, led by EVERARD Consulting &amp; Communication in collaboration with M. Luc Arend. Mr. Felten also organized a big stakeholder meeting that brought together the economic sector of the city.

The climate team was briefed as well.

Representatives of the city as well as M. Everard were present at the summer school in Santander and at the spring school in Stockholm.

The work process was greatly hindered by the elections on the local level and on the national level in 2023. Unfortunately, Mr Fred Bertinelli, alderman and part of the CCC-team, passed away in the course of 2024 and had to be replaced in the middle of the works.

# Building broad support

The city used its own media channels to create a broad support for the mission by publishing articles in the monthly city journal and on the social media platforms. It also created a landing page dedicated to the mission, that will be turned into a full fledged website in the course of the months to come (www.netzero2030.lu). At a political level, the aldermen were available for interviews with the national press.

Civic participation workshops started in December 2023 and are continuing to this day. The next workshop is scheduled for November 2024 and has the theme of waste management. Other workshops were about living sustainably in Differdange, about energy consumption and mobility.

Representatives of the team also met twice with the municipality-syndicate Pro-Sud, regrouping 9 municipalities of the south of Luxembourg.

# Understanding the System

# Module A-1: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

The emissions inventory was defined through consultations with the mission team. It includes partial Scope 3 emissions, specifically waste and construction materials, with plans to comprehensively integrate Scope 3 emissions in subsequent versions of the CCC.
The emissions data were sourced from various origins, primarily the information collected in the ClimateView program.

# Module A-2: Current policies and strategies assessment

This involved compiling a detailed list and description of policies through desk research and contributions from city staff.
The assessment was developed with insights from experts and practitioners mainly within the city administration and included guidance from EVERARD Consulting &amp; Communication.

# Module A-3: Systemic barriers and opportunities to 2030 climate neutrality

The understanding of systemic barriers combines existing knowledge with new insights gained throughout the CCC process:
Insights were obtained from dialogues with practitioners and experts during the CCC process, shaping the portfolio of actions and enriching the systemic barriers overview presented in Module A-3.

# Module B-1: Climate neutrality scenarios and impact pathways

The initial step towards defining a pathway to climate neutrality involved mapping actions from existing plans, such as the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), the Cities' Energy Plan, the Pacte climat, the Plan national intégré en matière d'énergie et de climat (PNEC), the Plan national de Mobilité 2035 (PNM2035) and the Programme directeur d'aménagement du territoire (PDAT). Actions were organized into clusters within a unified framework, estimating the emissions reduction potential for each, which helped in assessing the necessary scale of reduction to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.
Alongside the quantitative analysis, an impact framework was developed by defining interventions and identifying changes levers along with early and late outcomes. This was achieved through close collaboration with the portfolio-design process and consultations with domain-specific experts and practitioners in close collaboration with EVERARD Consulting &amp; Communication. Suitable indicators were selected to accompany the identified outcomes and impacts, using both the set provided by NetZeroCities and independently defined indicators.

# Co-Designing a Portfolio

The development of the portfolio of actions constituted a significant portion of our efforts, given its pivotal role in the Differdange team's strategy.

We employed a dual-track approach:

Bottom-up track:

This involved cataloging ongoing activities within both the city's infrastructure and the broader ecosystem. For the city, this process included EVERARD gathering heads of services to assess current and planned initiatives. In the broader ecosystem, insights were sourced from heads of service and the citizens during civic participation events. This approach was strategically chosen to build on existing efforts, recognizing the value of current activities as a foundational step for endorsing more extensive, mission-aligned endeavours. The mission was framed not as an additional burden but as an integrative element that enhances ongoing efforts.

Top-down track:

From a strategic perspective, this track focused on outcome-oriented goals, using the established emissions reductions pathways as benchmarks for portfolio composition. This method allowed for an evaluation of potential actions against the required emissions reductions in each domain, helping to pinpoint existing gaps.

The interplay between these tracks gradually shaped the portfolio of actions detailed in Module B-2. Actions were assessed for their potential to initiate breakthroughs in overcoming systemic barriers. To be included in the portfolio, actions had to align with the impact pathways from Module B-1, suggesting a significant direct or indirect impact, while supplementing existing measures. Although adherence to these criteria was a priority, practical adjustments were occasionally made to foster stakeholder engagement and support.

At the portfolio level, our goal was to achieve a representative selection of actions. Our approach recognizes that many upcoming challenges will emerge through a continuous process of discovery and experimentation.

The concept of representativity was also applied in other dimensions of our portfolio, aiming to ensure a balance in terms of geographic coverage, ecosystem involvement, and the activation of systemic levers. These design principles not only shaped our current efforts but will also guide the ongoing management and evolution of the portfolio.

# Applying to the pilot cities call

At the outset of the Climate City Contract (CCC) process, Mr. Arend of the Service Écologique end Mr. Everard of EVERARD Consulting &amp; Communication were designated to formulate a proposal for the Call for Pilot Cities. The creation of this proposal reflected the broader dynamics of the CCC and enriched each of the three phases of the Climate Transition Map as outlined:

Building a strong mandate: The development of the proposal deepened our understanding of the Mission's core principles, such as focusing on systemic barriers and the logic of the impact framework. This experience affirms our ability to adapt these principles to meet our city's specific needs effectively.
Understanding the system: Crafting the proposal provided a detailed opportunity to identify and map out the obstacles to decarbonizing Differdange's energy systems, the reduction in waste production and the reduction of individual motorized traffic which was the focus of our proposal.
Co-designing a portfolio: The barrier analysis directly informed the design of pilot activities tailored to the energy systems domain, as well as broader activities applicable across multiple emissions domains. This process laid the groundwork for the preliminary content of our action portfolio, integrating domain-specific and wide-reaching interventions.

# 4.2 Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

|  A-2.1: List of Relevant Policies, Strategies and Regulations  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Name & title | Description & relevance  |
|  Climate Pact | The Climate Pact, supported by Luxembourg's Ministry for the Environment, Climate and Sustainable Development and managed by Klima-Agence, commits municipalities to adopting European Energy Award measures to promote a sustainable energy transition, with state funding for climate consultancy and rewards according to certification levels. Aiming for a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2005, and carbon neutrality by 2050, the pact involves initiatives in renewable energy, circular economy and air quality, reinforcing the municipal commitment to responsible energy management.  |
|  Waste legislation | The law of 21 March 2012 on waste management in Luxembourg, revised in 2022 to incorporate the principles of a circular economy, aims to reduce waste production by aligning national policies with European directives to promote reduction, reuse and recycling.

# A-2.2: Description and Assessment of Policies

## DESCRIPTION OF POLICIES

### Local Policy

Differdange's local policy is framed by an ambitious master plan, the LSAP-CSV coalition programme. This strategic document outlines the development of the municipality to meet the challenges of sustainable development and climate change. It aims to transform Differdange into a carbon-neutral community by 2030, aligned with targets that are far more aggressive than those of the European Green Deal.

The programme sets out a series of detailed actions across various key areas such as energy, mobility, housing, social cohesion, culture and more, with a particular focus on ecological sustainability. Key initiatives include increased energy efficiency, greater support for renewable energies, the promotion of soft mobility, and thoughtful urban planning that encourages green spaces and biodiversity.

The city has also introduced sectoral plans such as the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) to improve urban mobility and reduce transport-related emissions. An 'energy' concept has been developed to optimise the use and production of renewable energy, in particular through the installation of photovoltaic panels and the recovery of industrial heat.

In terms of town planning, amendments to the General Development Plan (PAG) and Specific Development Plan (PAP), as well as to the traffic regulations, are designed to strengthen the integration of sustainability principles into the physical development of the town. These measures are designed to encourage ecologically responsible construction and promote sustainable consumption practices among citizens.

The LSAP-CSV coalition programme for Differdange is therefore a detailed roadmap for a sustainable future, implementing innovative policies to improve the quality of life of all Differdange residents while protecting the environment for future generations.

### Regional Policy

During the official ceremony to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Syndicat PRO-SUD, which took place on Friday 21st of April 2023 at the Ariston in Esch-sur-Alzette, the members of the committee of the southern union signed a declaration of intent. This declaration aims to pool efforts to implement a net-zero biosphere reserve.

The member municipalities of PRO-SUD thus declare their intention to work together to define a regional "climate neutral" approach. The 11 municipalities (Bettembourg, Differdange, Dudelange, Esch-sur-Alzette, Käerjeng, Kayl, Mondercange, Pétange, Rumelange, Sanem and Schifflange) will work together with all actors (private and public), building on the tools, programs and initiatives already launched, while improving the quality of life of citizens.

"To achieve the energy transition, we cannot act alone, without support. Most of the carbon emissions, 40%, come from mobility problems, and you can't solve this type of problem by being a municipality alone. It is at least a regional problem, if not national and cross-border," said Georges Mischo, President of the Syndicat PRO-SUD, at the ceremony Friday evening.

Claude Turmes, Minister of Energy and Spatial Planning, emphasised that “close and concerted cooperation between the different levels of governance, in the sense of a multi-level and multi-sectoral territorial governance, is the guarantee of an effective integrated implementation of the objectives of the government’s climate and energy policy and the objectives of sustainable spatial planning.”

The municipalities wish to strengthen their strategic cooperation by committing themselves at the local and regional level to provide the necessary means to the Syndicat PRO-SUD to support the 11 municipalities in their efforts and according to their priority areas.

# National Policy

In Luxembourg, the national strategy to achieve carbon neutrality is built around several key plans and programmes, each addressing key aspects of sustainable development and environmental conservation.

The National Waste and Resource Management Plan (PNGDR), revised in 2018, is a central pillar of this policy. It aims to minimize the environmental impact of waste by promoting reuse, recycling and environmentally friendly disposal. The plan emphasises the need for careful resource management, in line with the principles of a circular economy, to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources.

At the same time, the Nature Pact, similar to the Climate Pact, encourages municipal initiatives to preserve and restore biodiversity. This pact covers a range of environments, from urban areas to aquatic environments, and promotes actions such as the creation of green zones and the restoration of natural habitats. The aim is to strengthen biodiversity and ensure the resilience of ecosystems in the face of climate change.

The National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (PNEC) sets ambitious targets for 2030, aiming for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and an increase in the share of renewable energies. The plan also guides the development of policies and projects to improve energy efficiency across the country.

On the mobility front, the National Mobility Plan 2035 (PNM 2035) envisages proactive management of future transport needs, based on collaboration between the State, municipalities and citizens. This plan aims to optimise the flow of people and modes of transport, thereby reducing congestion and promoting more sustainable mobility.

Finally, the Master Plan for Territorial Development (PDAT) provides a strategic framework for territorial development up to 2050. This programme focuses on the balanced management of spatial planning, the reduction of land artificialisation and cross-border cooperation. It incorporates far-reaching ecological considerations to ensure the best possible quality of life while meeting today's environmental challenges.

# ASSESSMENT OF POLICIES

Local Policy: Overall Assessment

Examining the local policy framework and the progression of climate initiatives in Differdange, it is evident that several critical points emerge. Initially, it is apparent that while emissions have declined, the rate of reduction is insufficient. Despite no increase in emissions amidst ongoing economic and demographic expansion, significant efforts are still required to alter the current trajectory.

A further observation highlights that although Differdange has ambitious environmental targets, actual progress has been slower than anticipated. This shortfall can be attributed to multiple factors. Primarily, the existing political climate has not been conducive enough to foster rapid advancements towards achieving net-zero emissions. In this regard, enhanced legislative and regulatory support from the national government could substantially benefit the city's environmental strategies. Additionally, resource limitations have impeded progress, as increases in scope and scale of environmental ambitions have not been met with corresponding improvements in staffing or financial investment—issues further aggravated by recent economic pressures such as inflation and the energy crisis. Political barriers also play a role in widening the gap between goals and their realization.

Finally, there is an increasing recognition of the necessity for enhanced collaboration across various sectors and departments within the city's governance framework and the broader community. To effectively address this implementation gap, it is essential to embed climate considerations across diverse policy areas comprehensively. This would involve a more integrated approach to climate action within all municipal departments, promoting robust inter-departmental cooperation. Such strategic alignment forms a key component of Differdange's participation in the Pilot Cities Programme.

Moreover, the need for a stronger alignment of efforts and the catalyzation of collective actions among all relevant stakeholders is clear. Although Differdange benefits from a robust governance model, exemplified by its established platform for structured cooperation aimed at expediting the net-zero transition, the urgency for stakeholders to shift from general promises to specific, actionable commitments has become more pronounced. The Climate Contract of the City of Differdange is designed as a pivotal measure in this context, marking the commencement of a phased strategy to enhance both ambition and accountability incrementally.

# Local policy: Assessment by emissions domain

## 1. Energy efficiency and decarbonization

Differdange's approach to energy efficiency and decarbonization is ambitious, leveraging renovations, heating system updates, and increased renewable energy production. The city's initiatives to retrofit existing buildings significantly contribute to reducing the overall energy demand, aligning with the sustainability goals outlined in the local policy framework. However, while efforts to decarbonize heating systems by shifting from fossil fuels to renewable sources like biomass and geothermal energy are in place, the pace of implementation has been affected by resource constraints and the need for enhanced regulatory support.

Expanding the production of renewable energies, particularly solar and wind, is a cornerstone of Differdange's strategy to replace fossil fuel-based electricity. This transition is crucial for the city's ambitious target to become carbon-neutral by 2030. Complementary energy-saving measures, such as the adoption of LED lighting and optimization of heating networks, though beneficial, require accelerated deployment and broader integration into the city's infrastructure to meet the set objectives.

The overarching challenge in this domain is ensuring that the high ambitions set forth in the policy documents translate into equally strong execution on the ground. Despite a robust policy framework, the actual reduction in emissions and energy consumption necessitates a more cohesive and supported effort across all sectors involved, highlighting the gap between policy aspirations and practical achievements.

## 2. Waste management and circular economy

In the realm of waste management and circular economy, Differdange has implemented strategies focusing on reducing food waste and enhancing recycling. The introduction of intelligent waste management systems and local food production initiatives significantly contributes to reducing methane emissions from landfills. Educational programs aim to raise public awareness and participation in waste reduction, which are vital in fostering a community-wide shift towards sustainability.

Efforts to improve recycling rates and reduce packaging waste are commendable and align with the broader objectives of minimizing waste and emissions inherent to the circular economy. However, the effectiveness of these initiatives often hinges on public engagement and the adequacy of resources allocated to these programs. Enhanced recycling infrastructure and more rigorous waste reduction policies could further propel Differdange towards its environmental targets.

Despite these efforts, there remains a need for a more integrated approach in the implementation of circular economy principles. This would involve not only improving waste management practices but also embedding sustainability into the lifecycle management of products and encouraging the use of environmentally friendly materials across all sectors of the economy.

## 3. Transportation and mobility

Differdange has made significant strides in enhancing public transport and promoting electric mobility, crucial steps towards reducing the city's transport-related emissions. Modernizing public transport and expanding electric vehicle use are central to the city's strategy, yet the full potential of these initiatives

Net Zero
Déifférdange 2030

C

is yet to be realized, primarily due to challenges in comprehensive adoption and support from all stakeholders.

Active mobility is another key area where Differdange aims to make substantial improvements. By promoting non-motorized forms of transport such as walking, cycling, and scooters, the city hopes to reduce reliance on private vehicles, thereby decreasing overall emissions. However, for these measures to be more effective, they must be supported by appropriate urban infrastructure, such as safe cycling paths and pedestrian-friendly zones.

Overall, while there are clear policies and actions in place to transform the mobility landscape in Differdange, the success of these measures largely depends on overcoming existing implementation gaps and ensuring that mobility management strategies like car-sharing and traffic reduction are embraced more widely by the community. This requires not only policy and infrastructure development but also a cultural shift towards sustainable mobility practices.

# 4. Urban planning and green spaces

In Differdange, urban planning and the development of green spaces are integral to achieving environmental sustainability and enhancing urban resilience. The strategic implementation of green roofs and facades, alongside other urban cooling measures, are commendable efforts towards adapting to climate change. These initiatives not only reduce urban heat island effects but also improve the overall urban ecosystem. Enhancing natural public spaces further supports carbon sequestration and boosts the quality of life for the city's residents. However, the scope and scale of these projects need to be expanded to meet the city's carbon neutrality goals comprehensively.

Encouraging sustainable private development is another critical aspect of Differdange's environmental strategy. By promoting green infrastructure and sustainable building practices, the city aims to embed long-term climate goals into its urban fabric. These measures are designed to ensure that new developments contribute positively to the city's environmental targets. However, aligning these ambitious plans with actual building practices requires robust regulatory frameworks and incentives to encourage developers to adopt sustainable practices.

The city faces challenges in fully realizing the potential of its green urban planning initiatives. Despite a strong policy framework, the actual implementation of these green measures across all development projects can be unven. Enhanced collaboration between the government, developers, and the community is essential to ensure that urban planning and green spaces contribute effectively to the city's climate resilience and sustainability goals.

# 5. Carbon offset and compensation

Differdange is actively pursuing carbon offset and compensation strategies to meet its climate targets. Local initiatives, such as the development of green facades and the expansion of urban forestry projects, play a vital role in offsetting carbon emissions locally. These efforts not only help mitigate the impact of remaining emissions but also enhance the urban landscape. Furthermore, the city is investing in regional and international carbon capture and storage projects to provide further offsetting capabilities, which are crucial for meeting the more stringent aspects of its climate commitments.

The effectiveness of these offset measures depends significantly on the scale and continuity of the projects. While local initiatives are impactful, the broader adoption and integration of international carbon offset projects could accelerate Differdange's progress towards its net-zero ambitions. However,
Ville de Differdange

Net Zero
Déifférdange 2030

C

these international efforts must be carefully chosen to ensure they align with global sustainability standards and deliver tangible benefits.

Challenges in carbon offset and compensation include ensuring that these initiatives are not seen merely as a quick fix but are part of a comprehensive strategy that includes significant reductions in actual emissions. Transparency in the selection and management of offset projects is crucial to maintaining public trust and ensuring that these efforts have genuine environmental benefits.

# 6. Citizen engagement and education

Differdange places a strong emphasis on citizen engagement and education as pivotal elements of its climate action strategy. Through workshops, surveys, and various communication channels, the city actively seeks to involve citizens in its climate initiatives, enhancing public awareness and fostering a collaborative approach to environmental challenges. This commitment is crucial for building a community that is knowledgeable and supportive of sustainability efforts.

However, while these educational initiatives are valuable, there is room for improvement in their reach and depth. Expanding these programs to encompass more of the community and integrating climate education into schools and businesses can further enhance public participation. Effective communication strategies that leverage modern media can play a pivotal role in keeping the community informed and engaged.

To bridge the gap between awareness and action, Differdange could benefit from more targeted engagement strategies that not only inform but also empower citizens to take concrete actions. This includes providing more opportunities for community-led projects and increasing accessibility to sustainability resources.

# 7. Innovation and research

In the realm of innovation and research, Differdange is exploring forward-thinking approaches like agroforestry and advanced carbon storage techniques to support its long-term carbon management strategy. These innovative practices are crucial for developing new methods of capturing and storing carbon, potentially revolutionizing how the city addresses its emission reduction targets.

While these research initiatives are promising, their success hinges on comprehensive implementation, sufficient funding, and robust stakeholder coordination. Continuous monitoring and evaluation are also critical to ensure these innovative projects deliver expected outcomes and contribute effectively to the city's climate goals.

Furthermore, alongside these mitigation efforts, Differdange recognizes the importance of adaptation strategies. Developing resilience against the already evident impacts of climate change is as crucial as mitigation. This dual approach ensures that the city not only reduces its carbon footprint but also protects its community and infrastructure from the adverse effects of climate change.

Each of these domains represents a critical area of focus for Differdange as it strives to meet its ambitious climate goals. While the city has laid a solid foundation with its current policies and initiatives, the true test will lie in its ability to enhance execution, expand collaborative efforts, and ensure that all sectors of the community are actively involved in the climate action framework.

# Global strategy that integrates various means of communication and engagement - Ways of achieving collective understanding

To achieve the ambitious objectives of the City of Differdange's coalition contract and the Net Zero Cities mission, it is essential to deploy a global strategy that integrates various means of communication and engagement. The use of all media channels, citizen participation, education, culture, clubs, events, as well as the application of taxes and the granting of subsidies, are all levers that can transform society and encourage sustainable changes in the areas of mobility, energy, waste management and urban planning.

# Using all media channels

The use of all media channels is crucial to raising awareness and mobilising the population around the challenges of sustainable development and the energy transition. Whether through information campaigns on social networks, educational television programmes, radio broadcasts or press articles, each platform can reach a different audience and complement awareness-raising efforts. This media strategy makes it possible to spread clear and engaging messages about the importance of reducing CO2 emissions, recycling waste, and promoting soft mobility and green urban planning.

# Citizen Participation

Citizen participation is fundamental to co-constructing public policies with residents, which increases their acceptability and effectiveness. Open forums, public consultations and participatory workshops enable residents to contribute directly to the decisions that affect their daily environment. This encourages the adoption of sustainable practices and strengthens community commitment to carbon neutrality objectives.

# Education, schools, Life Long Learning

Education is a cornerstone of social transformation. By integrating programmes on sustainable development, renewable energy and resource efficiency into school curricula and through lifelong learning initiatives, Differdange can cultivate a generation that is aware of and prepared to support the city's ambitions. These educational efforts must be accompanied by practical projects such as the creation of school gardens or student-led recycling programmes.

vision. These projects must be designed to maximize their environmental and social impact, and managed with total transparency to maintain public confidence.

In conclusion, the combination of these different means constitutes a holistic and integrated approach necessary to achieve Differdange's sustainability objectives. By acting simultaneously on several fronts, the city can accelerate its transition to a net-zero society, while ensuring the well-being of its residents and the protection of its natural environment. These efforts must be constantly evaluated and adjusted to ensure their effectiveness and relevance, with a view to creating a sustainable and inclusive future.

To fully achieve Differdange's objectives, it is essential that all the levers are not only activated but also harmonised. The role of governance is crucial in this process, as it ensures coherence and synergy between initiatives. For example, urban planning projects must be coordinated with mobility policies to ensure that new infrastructure supports sustainable modes of transport and that urban development promotes accessibility and the reduction of emissions.

Similarly, education and citizen participation initiatives must be aligned with concrete actions on the ground. This means providing citizens with the knowledge and skills they need to make an effective contribution to their city's environmental objectives. For example, informing residents about the benefits of renewable energy and involving them in the planning of urban green spaces will increase the chances of success of these initiatives.

Subsidies and tax incentives should be used strategically to encourage investment in green technologies and sustainable practices. These financial measures must be designed to be fair and equitable, ensuring that they do not place a disproportionate burden on the less well-off while encouraging businesses and industries to reduce their carbon footprint.

In addition, strengthening high-performance networks such as the internet and electricity can catalyze the adoption of intelligent, interconnected solutions, such as home automation to optimize energy use or intelligent waste management systems. These technologies can significantly increase the effectiveness of conservation and resource management measures, while offering citizens a better quality of life.

Community involvement is also vital. Projects must be designed with a strong consultation and participation component to ensure that they meet the real needs of citizens and enjoy broad popular support. This can include online platforms for feedback, regular public meetings and the creation of working groups involving residents in monitoring projects.

Finally, it is crucial that Differdange continues to take a proactive and preventative approach to managing environmental and social risks. This includes putting in place robust systems for monitoring, evaluating and continually adjusting the policies and actions in place. By being attentive to changes in the global environment and remaining flexible and responsive, Differdange can not only achieve its carbon neutrality objectives, but also serve as a model for other cities around the world.

So, by fully exploiting these opportunities, focusing on systemic levers, and implementing strategies based on an integrated and participatory approach, Differdange can realize its vision of a sustainable and resilient city for current and future generations.

# Monitoring

As part of Differdange's ambitious mission to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, as set out in the city's coalition contract and aligned with the objectives of the Net Zero Cities mission, a series of systematic monitoring strategies is essential to evaluate, adjust and optimize sustainable development efforts in the areas of mobility, energy, waste management and urban planning. These strategies will not only monitor progress but also ensure that the city makes effective progress towards its ambitious targets.

# Counting

Metering in the areas of transport, water and electricity are crucial tools for assessing the effectiveness of the policies put in place. By accurately measuring resource use and mobility flows, Differdange can optimize its infrastructure and services to reduce unnecessary consumption and improve sustainability. For example, data from transport counts can help to readjust public transport timetables and improve cycle path networks to better meet users' needs, thereby reducing CO2 emissions.

# Surveys and questionnaires

Surveys and questionnaires can be used to gather crucial data on people's attitudes and behaviour towards environmental initiatives. This form of feedback is essential for understanding the obstacles to public participation and adjusting awareness campaigns. For example, a study into the acceptability of renewable energy technologies may reveal cultural resistance that could then be addressed through targeted educational programs.

# Air and water quality measurements

Monitoring air and water quality provides essential data on the environmental impact of urban policies. These measurements help to identify sources of pollution and assess the effectiveness of existing regulations. For example, a measurable improvement in air quality following the installation of low-emission zones can justify the expansion of these zones.

# Citizen Participation

Citizen participation is fundamental to the success of environmental initiatives. By actively involving citizens in the monitoring and evaluation of projects, the city can not only strengthen transparency and trust, but also take advantage of local knowledge to improve urban management. Participatory workshops and online forums are effective ways of engaging citizens in the ongoing monitoring of sustainable development projects.

# Budget and Finance

Budget and finance monitoring helps to ensure that investments in infrastructure and green technologies are made in an efficient and responsible manner. It also helps to identify additional funding needs and adjust budget allocations to maximize the environmental impact of public spending.

Tracking the number of projects completed provides a quantifiable view of progress towards sustainable development goals. This not only allows us to celebrate successes but also to identify areas requiring further attention.

## Invoices and waste management

Analysis of waste-related invoices can provide insights into consumption and recycling trends. This data is crucial for adjusting waste management policies and promoting more sustainable consumption behaviour in the community.

## Using ClimateView software

The adoption of ClimateView software enables integrated visualisation and management of data relating to carbon emissions and reduction efforts. This tool can help Differdange centralizes its environmental monitoring data, making it easier to analyze and communicate progress towards carbon neutrality. By highlighting areas where progress is insufficient or where interventions are most effective, the tool supports strategic and targeted decision-making.

Together, these monitoring methods, in synergy with the systemic levers identified in the areas of mobility, energy, waste management and urban planning, create a robust framework for Differdange to achieve its ambitious targets. Each of these strategies contributes to building a solid data infrastructure, which is essential for steering sustainable development initiatives in an informed and responsive way.

In summary, the adoption of rigorous and diversified monitoring practices enables Differdange to:

**Optimise resources and infrastructure:** With a better understanding of traffic flows, energy consumption and waste production, the city can optimize the use of existing infrastructure and effectively plan new construction or renovations to maximize their sustainability and energy efficiency.

**Improving accountability and transparency:** By making the results of environmental measures public and regularly engaging the community in review and feedback processes, Differdange is strengthening the confidence of citizens and investors in its environmental approach, while stimulating a culture of collective responsibility.

**Encouraging innovation and adaptation:** Continuous monitoring of environmental trends and the results of initiatives enables the city to adapt quickly to changes and emerging challenges. This responsiveness is crucial in a context of rapid climate change and constant technological innovation.

Monitoring strategies are not just tools for measuring progress, but catalysts for continuous improvement. They allow gaps to be identified, successes to be highlighted, and resources to be strategically redirected to reinforce the positive impacts of environmental policies. As a result, Differdange, armed with these tools and approaches, is better equipped to transform its environmental challenges into opportunities for sustainable development, while moving resolutely towards achieving the objectives of its ambitious carbon neutrality plan.

|  Waste management and circular economy | WM 1. Reducing food waste | In Differdange, efforts to reduce food waste over the first couple of years have focused on enhancing citizen engagement and optimizing waste management with AI-enhanced smart bins. A local startup has shown that reducing kitchen waste by up to 50% is achievable through data-driven strategies. Additionally, the city has increased its commitment to local produce and organic farming, supplementing these efforts with educational initiatives to foster a community-wide commitment to sustainability. | Differdange aims to solidify food waste initiatives into lasting practices. An advisory council could formalize, enhancing the role of food systems in policy discussions and securing pilot projects as permanent strategies. Expected outcomes include a doubling of local food production and improved storage facilities, fostering longer-lasting, quality food supplies. Moreover, a shift towards "rescued food" is anticipated to alter public attitudes and behaviors, significantly increasing the use of seasonal vegetables in public dining facilities, reflecting a broader commitment to sustainable consumption. | The systemic approach to reducing food waste in Differdange has enabled substantial environmental improvements, achieving up to a 50% reduction in waste. By prioritizing local production, the city minimizes greenhouse gas emissions associated with imported goods and enhances local product preservation. Bulk purchasing and efficient energy use further decrease carbon footprints. These efforts result in significant reductions in organic waste and indirect emissions (scope 2), although the exact greenhouse gas reductions are not quantifiable. | As part of the reduction of food waste (WM 1.1.), Differdange encourages a holistic approach to achieve significant indirect impacts. Food advice stimulates policies for GHG reductions, strengthening commitment at all levels, from kitchen to policy. Increased awareness, coupled with improved nutrition through greater use of local and seasonal produce, boosts public health and saves citizens money. These combined efforts not only improve food quality, but also raise overall environmental awareness.  |

|  Waste management and circular economy | WM 2. Reducing the volume of waste | Early changes include a change in mentality as well as the implementation of offers and services helping citizens to repair and reuse items. A second approach will be the use of measures pushing the citizens and businesses to generate less waste, by imposing taxes or intelligent locks on bins. The city itself could profit by installing waste compressing wastebins on public places and sensors that inform on the level of waste contains in the bins. | In subsequent years, Differdange will adjust waste taxes to reflect the new standards, potentially by taxing previously untaxed waste. The quality and sorting of waste collected will improve, reducing undervalued construction waste for recycling. Initiatives will encourage longer-lasting products and greater social cohesion. Packaging waste will be significantly reduced through repeated reforms and logistical optimisation of collections, reducing costs and increasing savings for citizens and management services. These changes will bring about a change in mentality, favouring both the economy and the environment. | Direct changes include a significant reduction in the overall mass of waste and an improvement in the quality of waste processed at the recycling park. This will resulte in a corresponding reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with waste production and treatment. The reduction in the volume of waste will also make it possible to reduce the frequency of collections, thereby further reducing GHG emissions. The reduction in packaging waste will also contribute to these positive results. | Reductions in waste collection rounds could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from lorries, while posing a risk of littering if surveillance is inadequate. Better channelling of construction waste to specialist recycling centres is planned, improving the service for citizens while reducing professional waste. Education on product repair will promote social cohesion and reduce consumption. Finally, more accurate data on waste production will enable awareness campaigns to be targeted more effectively, and reducing the materials used during festivities and the mileage of collection lorries will also contribute to a more sustainable environment.  |

|  Waste management and circular economy | WM 3. Improving the efficiency of waste processing | Differdange plans to initiate various investments and feasibility studies to optimise waste management and the production of recyclable materials, while integrating new adapted machinery. A significant increase in the recycling rate for waste, particularly construction waste, is planned, with a particular focus on improving sorting in residential buildings. Redirected waste will benefit from a better quality of treatment. Efforts to raise awareness of recycling and reuse through education and the sharing of best practice are also envisaged, notably through targeted campaigns and the recovery of green waste to create areas of biodiversity, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and logistical costs. | In the near future, Differdange is moving towards a significant increase in the production of thermal and electrical energy, strengthening its position as a leader in the local energy transition. Politicians will actively promote this project, aiming for a significant increase in the rate of recycling of problematic waste. A review of the recycling system is planned to reduce the weight of packaging and redesign it.

Improving biogas and compost management will also be a priority, along with a strategy to reduce methane emissions.
A new local resale point for second-hand products will help to enrich the circular economy. The recycling park will evolve into an awareness centre, improving waste management through the adoption of environmentally friendly practices. | As part of its transition to more sustainable practices, the city will reduce its reliance on imported energy, encouraging the use of local renewable sources. This shift will lead to a significant drop in greenhouse gas emissions, mainly through reduced methane emissions and enhanced recycling efforts that will lower the carbon footprint. Moreover, reductions in packaging use and the optimization of logistics are expected to result in substantial savings in fuel and materials. The city will also increase its production of carbon-neutral energy and enhance the circularity of its resources, reducing the need for new materials and contributing to overall savings on transport and fossil fuels. | Differdange will focus on looking at greener alternatives on a national scale, while raising awareness of the importance of recycling and waste reduction, aiming for significant savings. Through these actions, the town will strengthen its reputation and stimulate local employment, notably by developing natural resources. It will also improve the quality of the Chier's water and extend its district heating system, reinforcing its commitment to an energy transition, including the use of hydrogen from Arcelor. Recycling will become less costly thanks to optimised channels, and the recycling park will evolve into a social hub for initiatives such as Repair Cafés.  |

|  Waste management and circular economy | MS 2. Decarbonisation | Currently, there are 361 single-family homes potentially convertible to heat pumps among new buildings, with projections for annual renovations impacting an additional 300 homes. This totals about 3,061 units, with an anticipated 17% (approximately 500 units) transitioning to heat pump technology. Additionally, the city plans to expand urban heating connections across five networks, totaling 275 units. Roughly 300 residences annually could see a 30% transition to heat pump technology, translating to 10-12 conversions per year. The first phase involves developing a geothermal energy concept for existing urban heating networks in Oberkorn. | As part of the decarbonisation approach, the City of Differdange anticipates a significant change in heating systems, affecting around 17% of the total, or 500 units, which will be equipped with heat pumps. In addition, around 90 units will be connected to district heating networks in five separate areas, while 10 to 12 homes will make the switch each year.

The second phase of the project will include the implementation of an energy concept designed to be economically viable, based on the results of the first phase. This will lead to the installation of advanced systems for the decarbonisation of the district heating network in Oberkorn. This phase will also include the actual installation of connections and the gradual replacement of maintenance equipment such as hedge trimmers, lawnmowers and | In Differdange, a major decarbonisation initiative aims to achieve a substantial reduction in gas consumption, with estimated savings of 2.6 million m3 annually for 50% of the 3,061 targeted residential units. In addition, the connection of 275 homes to district heating would save 350,000 m3 of gas each year. The heat pumps installed could reduce gas consumption by 500,000 m3 annually. Together, these measures would contribute to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, estimated at 1 million m3 of gas saved. In addition, the energy efficiency of the district heating network would be improved by reducing the use of biomass, and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would be achieved by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels. | The city of Differdange's decarbonization efforts are set to enhance residents' quality of life and foster a degree of independence from fossil fuels. Through innovative agreements with Sudenergie, the replacement of traditional heating systems with heat pumps will be facilitated without requiring individual investment, furthering the city's transition to sustainable energy sources. These measures not only promised a quieter urban environment but also significant reductions in energy consumption, aligning with broader environmental goals.  |

MT 4:

In Differdange, the focus on modernizing the city's transport system through electrification is integral to reducing carbon emissions and enhancing urban mobility. The initiative includes several key aspects. The municipal fleet is transitioning to cleaner, sustainable energy sources, with an emphasis on electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. This change also extends to two-wheeled transport options, providing city employees with electric bikes and scooters, which supports the adoption of green mobility practices within the urban core. For utility vehicles, efforts are being made to adopt lower-emission models as they become available, aligning with the overall goal of reducing the municipal operations' carbon footprint.

Furthermore, the city is reconfiguring vehicle flows to limit traffic into the center, aiming to create a more pedestrian-friendly environment. This strategy is complemented by the redevelopment of the city center, which is being redesigned to encourage the use of alternative transport methods, thereby improving urban living quality and diminishing reliance on individual motorized transport. Through these comprehensive measures, Differdange is committed to a broad modernization of its transport infrastructure, fostering a more sustainable and livable urban environment.

MT 5:

Differdange is dedicated to enhancing pedestrian mobility through several innovative strategies aimed at making the city more walkable and reducing reliance on motorized transport. To guide pedestrians more effectively, the city is implementing a pedestrian navigation system that direct foot traffic efficiently through urban spaces. Additionally, the 'Pedibus' initiative has been introduced to increase the number of children walking to school. This initiative promotes walking as a safe, environmentally friendly way to travel, reducing traffic congestion around schools and fostering early education on road safety and environmental awareness. The concept of 'Séchere Schoulwee' focuses on creating safe roads to schools to further ensure the security of children commuting on foot.

Moreover, Differdange is enhancing the infrastructure for pedestrians with improved lighting at pedestrian crossings, making it safer to navigate the city, especially during low-light conditions. Comprehensive urban planning measures are also being implemented to favour pedestrian mobility, thus making the cityscape more attractive to alternative modes of transport and subsequently elevating the quality of life for its residents by transforming public spaces into more pedestrian-friendly environments.

paths to ensure safe and efficient journeys for cyclists. In addition, the Vël'OK program provides self-service bicycles, increasing accessibility to environmentally-friendly transport options. Bike Boxes offer secure parking solutions for bicycles, facilitating the transition between different modes of transport and reducing the risk of theft.

The adaptation of the General Development Plan (PAG) includes measures to integrate dedicated bicycle storage spaces into new residential and commercial construction. This initiative ensures that the new urban infrastructure actively supports sustainable mobility. For those who prefer scooters, the city has introduced dedicated racks, making the use of scooters more practical and accessible.

SurvCoin, an innovative initiative, raises awareness of active mobility by rewarding citizens for their environmentally-friendly transport choices. The programme uses a digital currency that rewards behaviour that reduces the carbon footprint, encouraging greater community involvement in sustainable mobility.

In addition, European Mobility Week and various citizen workshops are organised to educate and engage residents on the benefits of soft mobility, reinforcing the culture of sustainable travel within the community of Differdange.

# MT 7:

Differdange aims to modernise its urban logistics by creating decentralised hubs at the city's entrances. This initiative involves working with major players such as Post and CFL to set up and manage these hubs. The main aim is to decarbonise last-mile logistics, by promoting solutions such as cargobikes and other eco-responsible transport alternatives. These hubs will serve as collection and distribution points to optimise transport flows and reduce associated emissions, as part of a wider vision of sustainable mobility and reducing the city's carbon footprint.

Differdange has implemented a comprehensive approach to addressing local food issues through the establishment of the Food Council, the first of its kind in Luxembourg. This council engages civil society representatives to focus specifically on reducing food waste. Key initiatives include the installation of smart bins in public kitchens, which help analyze and cut down on unnecessary waste.

Moreover, the city promotes food preservation and sharing through collaboration with a local cannery and the installation of shared underground refrigerators that help keep food fresh for longer periods. Complementing these practical measures are educational campaigns run in the local magazine, alongside workshops for children that teach them about the origins of food and the importance of respecting our food sources. Through these multifaceted efforts, Differdange is actively working towards a more sustainable and conscious approach to food consumption and waste.  |

| Action description | Summer workshops with children - Learning to respect production and food (150 children in 2023).

Differdange has implemented a comprehensive approach to addressing local food issues through the establishment of the Food Council, the first of its kind in Luxembourg. This council engages civil society representatives to focus specifically on reducing food waste. Key initiatives include the installation of smart bins in public kitchens, which help analyze and cut down on unnecessary waste. In tandem with these efforts, the local production and distribution of vegetables are being ramped up, with 3 tonnes distributed in 2023 and a target set to increase this to 4 tonnes by 2024, dedicating 20% of the produce to local schools.

Moreover, the city promotes food preservation and sharing through collaboration with a local cannery and the installation of shared underground refrigerators that help keep food fresh for longer periods. Complementing these practical measures are educational campaigns run in the local magazine, alongside workshops for children that teach them about the origins of food and the importance of respecting our food sources. Through these multifaceted efforts, Differdange is actively working towards a more sustainable and conscious approach to food consumption and waste. |

|  Action outline | Action name | Waste taxes WM 2.1.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | Typical action | Governance  |
|   | Action description | Waste taxation is a proactive and transparent approach to encouraging waste reduction in communities. This measure encourages citizens to adopt more environmentally-friendly behaviour by making them aware of the direct financial impact of waste production. The prior announcement of an increase in these taxes if waste volumes do not fall is intended to motivate a change in behaviour beforehand, by offering citizens the opportunity to change their clothes before the additional costs are applied. This pricing system encourages greater individual and collective responsibility, while increasing the transparency of waste management policy.

Differdange is taking significant steps to minimize environmental impact through economic and infrastructural strategies aimed at better waste management. The introduction of waste taxes is a key move designed to incentivize less polluting production practices among businesses and individuals alike. This economic measure is intended to reduce waste generation and encourages more sustainable consumption patterns across the community.

In parallel, the city is also adapting its recycling infrastructures to enhance the management of food waste specifically. Adjustments to recycling facilities are being made to ensure that they are well-equipped to handle and process food waste more efficiently. This not only helps in reducing the environmental footprint but also supports the broader goal of sustainable waste management within the city. Together, these measures represent a proactive approach to waste reduction and resource conservation in Differdange.  |

|  | Typical action | Infrastructure |
| Action description | Establishing a second-hand shop within Differdange’s recycling park could significantly contribute to waste reduction and support the city’s objectives under the 100 Net Zero Cities mission. By facilitating the reuse of items, the shop would directly decrease the volume of waste heading to landfills and incinerators, promoting a more circular economy. This initiative would not only extend the life cycle of products but also reduce the demand for new resources, lowering the overall carbon footprint associated with production, transport, and disposal.

Moreover, such a shop would raise community awareness about sustainable consumption practices. It could serve as an educational platform, illustrating the practical benefits of reuse and recycling. This aligns with the broader mission goals by fostering a local culture of sustainability and encouraging residents to make environmentally conscious choices. By reducing waste and promoting reuse, the second-hand shop would play a pivotal role in helping Differdange achieve its net-zero targets, making the city a model of sustainable urban development. |

| Action outline | Action name | MS 1.1. Zesumme Renovation Project |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Typical action | Infrastructure and awareness raising |
| Action description | This initiative focuses on the energy renovation of existing single-family homes. It is a collaborative effort with support from national ministries including Energy and Spatial Planning, Environment, Climate and Sustainable Development, Klima-Agence, and INPA. The project aims to encourage renovations that reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions, targeting a renovation rate increase in the most suitable neighborhoods. Differdange's participation in the European "NetZeroCities" project underpins these efforts, as the city aims for CO2 neutrality by 2030. The renovation of approximately 4,000 existing buildings in the city is key to achieving this ambitious goal, with intensive support provided to homeowners throughout the renovation process. |
| Reference to impact pathway | Field of action | Energy |
|  | Systemic lift | Renovations |
| Outcome (according to module B-1.1) | In Differdange, the home improvement program envisages partial or complete renovations for around 4,150 single-family homes. Annually, 6.6% of these units, or around 300 homes, could undergo renovations, reducing gas consumption by around 741 m3 per unit. Over two years, between 80 and 100 homes could benefit from these improvements. Of these homes, 227 are rated between A and D in terms of energy efficiency, and 910 require renovations. It is anticipated that 10 homes per year will undergo renovations, which would represent up to 70 homes renovated over an annual period, with a forecast of 20 units in the first two years. Potential of 300 units per year, so 600 units. Each renovation is directly dependent on state subsidies. For the residencies, Differdange aims for 20 buildings. |

| --- | --- | --- |
|  Reference to impact pathway | Typical action | Infrastructure  |
|   |  Action description | The town of Differdange, in collaboration with the Klima Agency, aims to obtain state subsidies to help single-family homes switch to less carbon-intensive heating systems. This initiative supports the transition to sustainable heating technologies by reducing dependence on fossil fuels.  |
|   |  Field of action | Energy  |
|  Substance | Systemic lift | Decarbonisation  |
|   |  Outcome (according to module B-1.1) | Currently, there are 361 single-family homes potentially convertible to heat pumps among new buildings, with projections for annual renovations impacting an additional 300 homes. This totals about 3,061 units, with an anticipated 17% (approximately 500 units) transitioning to heat pump technology. Additionally, the city plans to expand urban heating connections across five networks, totaling 275 units. Roughly 300 residences annually could see a 30% transition to heat pump technology, translating to 10-12 conversions per year. The first phase involves developing a geothermal energy concept for existing urban heating networks in Oberkorn. As part of the decarbonisation approach, the City of Differdange anticipates a significant change in heating systems, affecting around 17% of the total, or 500 units, which will be equipped with heat pumps. In addition, around 90 units will be connected to district heating networks in five separate areas, while 10 to 12 homes will make the switch each year.

The second phase of the project will include the implementation of an energy concept designed to be economically viable, based on the results of the first phase. This will lead to the installation of advanced systems for the decarbonisation of the district heating network in Oberkorn. This phase will also include the actual installation of connections and the gradual replacement of  |

|   |  Outcome (according to module B-1.1) | Currently, there are 361 single-family homes potentially convertible to heat pumps among new buildings, with projections for annual renovations impacting an additional 300 homes.
This totals about 3,061 units, with an anticipated 17% (approximately 500 units) transitioning to heat pump technology.
Additionally, the city plans to expand urban heating connections across five networks, totaling 275 units. Roughly 300 residences annually could see a 30% transition to heat pump technology, translating to 10-12 conversions per year. The first phase involves developing a geothermal energy concept for existing urban heating networks in Oberkorn. As part of the decarbonisation approach, the City of Differdange anticipates a significant change in heating systems, affecting around 17% of the total, or 500 units, which will be equipped with heat pumps. In addition, around 90 units will be connected to district heating networks in five separate areas, while 10 to 12 homes will make the switch each year.

The second phase of the project will include the implementation of an energy concept designed to be economically viable, based on the results of the first phase. This will lead to the installation of advanced systems for the decarbonisation of the district heating network in Oberkorn. This phase will also include the actual installation of connections and the gradual replacement of maintenance equipment such as hedge  |

# B-2.3. Summary strategy for residual emissions

In the context of Differdange's Climate City Contract and the overarching goal of achieving net-zero emissions, we recognize that while the bulk of emissions can be mitigated through direct reduction strategies, certain residual emissions will remain. To manage these residual emissions, our approach focuses on a combination of ambitious offsetting projects, structural urban changes, and cross-sector collaboration to close the gap towards net-zero.

## Offsetting through Nature-Based Solutions

One of the primary pillars of our offsetting strategy revolves around nature-based solutions (NBS). By enhancing urban green spaces and increasing the number of green facades, Differdange will actively sequester carbon while providing essential co-benefits such as improving air quality, enhancing biodiversity, and cooling urban areas through natural shade.

The early impacts of this strategy will be visible within 1 to 2 years, as initial projects such as reforestation efforts and urban greening campaigns start reducing emissions. Over the longer term, as we reach the 3-4 year mark, these efforts will mature, creating more permanent green infrastructure that contributes significantly to carbon sequestration. By that time, these green spaces will also have reduced the urban heat island effect, thereby minimizing the energy demand for cooling in public buildings.

The direct impact of these efforts includes the sequestration of CO2, while indirect benefits will extend to improvements in mental and physical health for residents, more cohesive communities, and enhanced resilience to extreme weather events.

## Technological Solutions for Residual Emissions

Alongside nature-based approaches, the adoption of innovative technological solutions will play a key role in addressing residual emissions. Urban spaces and public buildings will be revamped through energy-efficient technologies. For example, by retrofitting municipal buildings with advanced insulation and converting energy systems to low-carbon alternatives, the city can drastically reduce energy consumption.

Initial results over the first two years will focus on energy audits, pilot projects, and the replacement of outdated equipment, which will lead to measurable emission reductions. As these projects scale, especially in the 3-4 year timeframe, the focus will shift to more widespread implementation, covering both public and private buildings.

This technological pathway will directly reduce the city's carbon footprint by lowering energy consumption, while indirect impacts will include the creation of local green jobs, the stimulation of the green economy, and higher levels of energy independence for the municipality.

# Enhancing the Circular Economy

In conjunction with technological advancements and NBS, Differdange will strengthen its circular economy initiatives. The objective here is to reduce waste, promote recycling, and encourage the use of second-hand goods, all of which contribute to offsetting emissions that would otherwise be linked to waste production and landfill use.

Key systemic levers in this approach include the promotion of repair cafes, where residents can bring goods for refurbishment, and the creation of second-hand marketplaces. In the first two years, Differdange will witness an increased participation in these initiatives, which will reduce both waste and the carbon footprint associated with the production of new goods. As we move towards 3-4 years, these systems will evolve into a more ingrained part of the city's culture, with a shift in consumer behavior towards sustainable consumption.

The direct reduction in emissions will be achieved through decreased material consumption and reduced landfill use, while indirect benefits will manifest in greater community engagement, local job creation, and a shift towards a more sustainable economy.

# Leveraging Carbon Offsetting Partnerships

To fully address residual emissions, Differdange will also invest in verified carbon offset projects, including those beyond the city's boundaries. These may involve partnering with international projects focused on forest conservation, renewable energy, and clean water access.

In the initial stages, Differdange will carefully select projects that align with its climate neutrality goals. By year 3 or 4, the city will have fully integrated these offsets into its broader emissions strategy, ensuring that residual emissions are balanced through credible and measurable efforts. This approach ensures that even the hardest-to-abate emissions can be compensated, thus bringing the city closer to its net-zero target.

# Alignment with Climate Neutrality Commitments

The strategies outlined above ensure that Differdange remains firmly on track to meet its climate neutrality commitments. By prioritizing both immediate actions and long-term systemic changes, the city is addressing not only its current emissions but also the structural issues that have contributed to its carbon footprint.

# Internal city climate policy

|   | Intervention  |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | Description: The climate policy for Differdange requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that involves all city departments, including those directly connected to sustainability, mobility, and spatial planning, as well as those less traditionally linked to climate objectives, such as culture, sports, communication, and finance. For Differdange to effectively achieve its climate goals, cross-departmental collaboration is essential, leveraging the expertise and cooperation of all municipal sectors. The city has a history of such transversal cooperation through various strategic projects and area-specific initiatives, such as the Climate Action Plan and urban planning projects, which were designed with broad organizational input. The city's area coordinators and services are integral to these efforts, helping to bridge the gaps between different policy areas and ensuring that climate considerations are embedded in urban strategies. The introduction of innovative governance models from the city's executive office, focusing on more efficient services for residents, is well-suited to addressing climate challenges. A smart, integrated approach to climate must be adopted, ensuring that climate action is a key component of both operational and substantive processes. In this context, Differdange aims to make climate change a central concern in its internal operations, aligning all departments to contribute towards the shared goal of climate neutrality.  |   |
|   | Responsible organization/entity | Ecological service  |
|   | Contact | Luc Arend  |
|   | Stakeholders involved and role of each stakeholder | All departments of the city – exchange and coordination  |
|   | Commitments | The City of Differdange is committed to integrating climate objectives throughout its municipal policies. When it comes to decision-making, it's crucial to focus on and prioritize projects that benefit both climate goals and other policy areas, creating a "win-win" scenario. Differdange aims to  |

|   |  | implement impactful projects that inspire and accelerate progress, ensuring that those who can deliver significant emission reductions—either immediately or after being scaled up—are prioritized.

To support this effort, Differdange dedicates resources to seek funding opportunities, emphasizing the importance of financing climate projects. The city actively collaborates with both internal and external partners to identify grants and prepare project proposals, thus securing the necessary financial support to achieve ambitious climate targets.

Monitoring and evaluation play a central role in ensuring the city's climate commitments are met. Differdange will outline a clear path towards climate neutrality, detailing expected emission reductions for specific timeframes and defining the actions required to achieve these targets. Regular monitoring allows the city to adjust its strategies if necessary and ensure that its measures are effectively driving progress towards its climate objectives. This structured and results-driven approach ensures that Differdange stays on track to meet its climate commitments.  |

|   | improved planning accuracy and resource management.

The project's potential enabling impacts are vast, involving improved decision-making capabilities across multiple domains such as transport, energy, and waste management. Through simulations and predictive analytics, the Digital Twin will enable the city to anticipate urban needs, optimize responses to environmental challenges, and better manage its resources. This integration will likely lead to enhanced sustainability practices, reduced operational costs, and a more agile administrative framework that can dynamically adapt to both the city's and its residents' evolving needs.  |

The initiatives listed in Module C-2 of the CCC, which include the Food Council, communication and storytelling, civic participation, and the development of a digital twin, align with many of the broader definitions of social innovation. These initiatives are designed to address systemic barriers by fostering community-led innovation, enhancing stakeholder engagement and empowerment, and creating favorable environments for bottom-up initiatives.

**Social Innovation Defined**: Social innovation typically involves new strategies, concepts, ideas, and organizations that meet social needs of all kinds—from working conditions and education to community development and health—and that extend and strengthen civil society.

**Food Council**: This initiative focuses on sustainable food practices and aims to transform a temporary project into a permanent community engagement platform, directly influencing local policy and community habits concerning food sustainability.
**Communication and Storytelling**: This method of engaging the community aims to influence public perception and behavior towards sustainability through media. It's a classic example of social innovation, using new communication strategies to tackle social issues like climate change and public participation in sustainability.
**Civic Participation**: By organizing workshops and events that involve the community in sustainability actions, this initiative directly supports social innovation by empowering residents to contribute to the city's environmental strategies and decisions.
**Digital Twin**: Although more technological in nature, this initiative can also be considered a form of social innovation as it involves creating new methods for community engagement and urban planning, integrating various data streams to improve city management and public involvement.

The social innovation approaches listed in the CCC, specifically the Food Council, Communication and Storytelling, Civic Participation, and the Digital Twin, can be directly linked to the systemic barriers identified in the areas of energy, waste management, mobility, and city planning. Here's how these social innovations address the systemic barriers:

**Energy Systems**:
**Barrier**: Lack of manpower, legislative hurdles, material shortages, and political conflicts.

Social Innovation Link: The Digital Twin can simulate energy consumption and potential improvements without the immediate need for extensive manpower. By providing data-driven insights, it could streamline legislative processes and planning for energy infrastructure. Civic Participation workshops could be used to align political interests and increase public support for energy initiatives.

Waste Management Systems:

Barrier: Siloing, lack of manpower, rigid regulations, and public-private partnership constraints.
Social Innovation Link: The Food Council's initiatives like Al-enabled waste bins can directly address manpower shortages by optimizing waste collection and management processes. Civic Participation can help break down silos by involving various stakeholders in collaborative workshops, fostering a more integrated approach to waste management.

Mobility Systems:

Barrier: Election delays, lack of skilled labor, restrictive legislation, and resistance to change.
Social Innovation Link: Communication and storytelling can play a critical role in changing public perception and increasing acceptance of new mobility solutions. It can also be instrumental in lobbying for faster legislative processes. The Digital Twin could be used to plan and simulate new mobility infrastructures, providing a persuasive tool for overcoming resistance and expediting decision-making.

City Planning Systems:

Barrier: Delays due to elections, siloing in planning departments, restrictive regulations, and challenges with integrating green infrastructure in old buildings.
Social Innovation Link: Civic Participation initiatives can enhance community involvement in urban planning, ensuring that new projects like green infrastructures are more widely accepted and integrated. The Digital Twin can offer innovative solutions for blending new developments with old structures, facilitating more dynamic and flexible city planning.

Each of these social innovation strategies not only addresses specific systemic barriers but also enhances the overall capacity of Differdange to implement its climate strategies effectively. These innovations foster a more engaged community, facilitate data-driven decision-making, and encourage a more integrated and agile approach to urban management. This comprehensive linking of social innovations to systemic barriers will illustrate to reviewers the practical and transformative impacts these strategies can have, aligning them more closely with the city's long-term climate neutrality goals.

Several more actions from the action plan can be considered as "Social Innovation" based on their focus on engaging the community, introducing new social practices, or creating systemic changes in social behaviors and governance:

Repair Cafés and Sharing Platforms - These actions encourage the reuse of items and promote a circular economy by providing spaces for community members to engage in sustainability practices directly. They facilitate social interaction and reduce waste, linking community behaviour to broader environmental goals.
Second-hand Shop in the Recycling Park - Encourages reuse and recycling, providing a tangible space for community members to engage in sustainable consumption practices. This

initiative also serves as an educational platform about the benefits of waste reduction and recycling.

Dedicated Environmental Platforms - These digital platforms are intended to keep the community informed and engaged, making them part of the ongoing sustainability dialogues and actions, enhancing transparency, and encouraging active participation.

Each of these initiatives addresses one or more systemic barriers by promoting new forms of social practices, enhancing public engagement, and integrating community insights into municipal decision-making processes. They aim to shift collective mindsets, improve coordination among various sectors, and directly engage with the systemic challenges listed in your barriers, such as siloing, legislative complexities, and cultural resistance to change.

# 7 Outlook and Next Steps

As Differdange moves forward with its Climate City Contract, the focus will pivot towards the effective implementation of the strategies outlined in the plan. Here's an overview of the next steps and key areas of activity that Differdange will prioritize:

Portfolio Management and Execution: Differdange will set up a process to transition its portfolio of climate actions from planning to execution. This framework will facilitate various activities, such as stakeholder engagement, creation of synergies, and continuous learning, while catering to a diverse range of projects, if they are early-stage or mature, city-led or ecosystem-led. In Differdange, the meticulous implementation of the City Climate Contract, as mandated by the European Commission, involves a well-defined strategy to shift the city's climate action portfolio from planning to execution. At the core of this strategy is the establishment of a transition team that meets weekly, supported by EVERARD Consulting &amp; Communication. This team is essential for monitoring the progression of various climate actions, ensuring they align with the city's strategic objectives.

To enhance transparency and public involvement, a comprehensive website will be launched in the first half of the year. This platform will serve as the informational hub for all climate actions, offering citizens detailed insights into the planning and execution phases, the stakeholders involved, and regular updates on each project's status.

A significant aspect of the city's strategy involves a major stakeholder engagement event aimed at encouraging stakeholders to pledge active participation in implementing the climate actions. This event is designed to facilitate networking, build partnerships, and foster a collaborative atmosphere among all parties involved.

Moreover, Differdange is committed to harnessing local expertise by collaborating with various associations, clubs, and commissions. This approach aims to integrate community insights into the execution of climate strategies, thus ensuring that the actions are relevant and impactful. Engaging local entities not only strengthens community ties but also promotes a collective effort towards achieving the city's ambitious environmental goals.

The transition framework also incorporates mechanisms for continuous learning and adaptation, allowing the city to evaluate the effectiveness of the actions implemented and make necessary adjustments based on stakeholder and community feedback. This adaptive management process is vital for addressing evolving environmental challenges and ensuring the sustainability of the initiatives.

Through these comprehensive steps, Differdange is demonstrating a proactive and structured approach to environmental stewardship, actively involving its citizens in the transformation process, and setting a robust foundation for achieving its goal of carbon neutrality by 2030. This strategic framework highlights Differdange's commitment to effective management practices and its dedication to leading by example in sustainable urban development.

Catalyzing Investment: To back the implementation effectively, Differdange plans to deepen its engagement with the financial sector and the national government to unlock necessary investments. This may include developing new financial tools or infrastructures like a city fund, enhancing skills in climate finance, building robust business cases, and fostering collaborations with other cities to exchange best practices.

To effectively back the implementation of its climate actions, the city of Differdange is focusing on catalyzing investment by deepening its engagement with both the financial sector and the national government. The city is poised to unlock the necessary investments through a series of strategic initiatives, which may include developing new financial tools or infrastructures like a dedicated city fund tailored to support environmental initiatives. These efforts aim to enhance the city's capabilities in climate finance and involve constructing robust business cases to attract further funding.

A key strategy involves fixed meetings with prominent government officials, including the minister for the environment and the minister for the economy, alongside engagements with other governmental institutions throughout 2025. These discussions are crucial for aligning municipal climate goals with national priorities and resources. Moreover, Differdange has appointed a specialist skilled in navigating European funding calls. This expert's role is pivotal in leveraging European funds that align perfectly with the city's climate initiatives, ensuring that Differdange is a competitive participant in relevant EU consortium calls.

Additionally, the city is exploring innovative financing options like issuing local CO2 Bonds. These bonds are designed to attract investment by offering a financial return while simultaneously funding local climate actions. The proceeds from these bonds will directly support the city's sustainability projects, demonstrating a practical approach to local investment in climate solutions.

Collaborations are being strengthened not only locally with the multi-municipality syndicate Pro-Sud but also across borders with the TNT syndicate, enhancing regional cooperation on environmental initiatives. Furthermore, when the conditions are favorable, Differdange plans to engage with the "Bankers without Boundaries" initiative to explore additional funding opportunities that could span several years.

These comprehensive measures illustrate Differdange's proactive approach to securing the financial support necessary for the successful execution of its ambitious climate action plan. By building partnerships, enhancing financial acumen, and innovating in municipal financing, Differdange is setting a strong foundation for achieving its target of becoming a carbon-neutral city by 2030.

Governance and Capacity Building: Alongside portfolio management and investment strategies, Differdange will strengthen its governance structures related to the Mission. This might involve forming a hybrid team combining city and ecosystem capacities and expanding resources to support the Climate City Contract's objectives.

C

To strengthen its governance and capacity building in alignment with the Climate City Contract, the city of Differdange is undertaking a comprehensive review of its internal organizational structures. This review is aimed at optimizing the implementation of climate actions, ensuring that administrative processes are streamlined and free from departmental frictions and bottlenecks. Given the small size of Differdange's administration, which operates with a limited number of staff, the smooth functioning of workflows is particularly crucial.

To facilitate this optimization, Differdange has engaged an external consultancy firm to conduct an in-depth analysis of the city's organigram and hierarchies. This external perspective is intended to identify inefficiencies and propose a more effective organizational structure that can support the ambitious goals of the Net Zero Cities Mission without overwhelming the existing administrative capacity.

In parallel with these structural adjustments, Differdange is expanding its team dedicated to managing EU projects, reflecting a proactive approach to harnessing European funding opportunities and expertise. This team will play a pivotal role in navigating the complexities of EU grant applications and managing funded projects effectively.

Furthermore, the city is actively reaching out to various community groups, including different diasporas and local commissions, to ensure broad community engagement and input into the climate action plans. By involving diverse stakeholders, Differdange aims to foster a more inclusive and committed approach to its sustainability goals.

Once the analysis by the external firm is complete and the internal adjustments are made, the city will be in a better position to determine the need for and the structure of a hybrid team. This team would ideally combine the strengths and capacities of both the city's administration and external ecosystem partners to enhance the governance of climate actions, ensuring that Differdange can meet its objectives efficiently and effectively.

This comprehensive approach to governance and capacity building is critical as it not only aligns with the strategic needs of the Climate City Contract but also ensures that Differdange can sustainably manage and execute its climate initiatives, ultimately transforming the challenges of climate change into opportunities for urban development and community resilience.

Monitoring Commitments: Differdange intends to establish mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability in tracking the commitments made under the Climate City Contract. Plans include setting up a public inventory of commitments, a reporting system, and a forum for peer accountability, supported by social and digital tools.

These mechanisms will be defined in the course of 2025 within the team that pilots the mission in Differdange.

Outreach to Citizens: A public campaign will be launched to raise awareness about the Climate City Contract, aiming to reach a broader demographic. This will complement ongoing civic engagement efforts that involve citizens in various actions within the portfolio.

Differdange is advancing its outreach to citizens by launching a comprehensive public campaign aimed at raising awareness about the Climate City Contract and its significance. This campaign is designed to engage a broader demographic, enriching the city's ongoing efforts to involve the community in various sustainability actions outlined in the portfolio.

The campaign kicked off with an innovative initiative called the "Musée du déchet" created in collaboration with a third party. This museum serves as an educational platform where citizens and school groups can learn about the impacts of waste firsthand, making the consequences of everyday consumption more tangible and immediate.

In addition to this educational exhibit, Differdange has scheduled five significant dates for civic participation workshops throughout 2025, each focusing on different aspects of sustainability:

April 26th, 2025, will concentrate on energy-related topics.
June 8th, 2025, will address issues related to mobility.
November 15th, 2025, will be dedicated to waste management. Furthermore, during the "Festival des cultures" on May 17th and 18th, 2025, a broader, culturally enriched workshop will take place, integrating diverse community insights into sustainability discussions.

The city is also planning to collaborate with the Center for Ecological Learning Luxembourg (CELL) to implement the concept of the "Assises du climat," a large-scale workshop-based procedure designed to deepen community involvement and commitment to the climate goals. The dates for these significant events are yet to be determined.

The Media Department of Differdange is intimately involved in these processes, strategically planning the best methods to communicate the mission's objectives and progress. This department's involvement ensures that the outreach efforts are not only informative but also resonate with the community, encouraging active participation and fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility towards the city's environmental goals.

Overall, these initiatives reflect Differdange's proactive and inclusive approach to governance and community engagement, crucial for meeting the ambitious targets set by the Climate City Contract. By integrating educational programs, collaborative workshops, and strategic communication, Differdange is effectively mobilizing its citizens to transform environmental challenges into opportunities for sustainable development.

In essence, these steps are designed to build and sustain support for the Mission, ensuring that Differdange not only meets its climate goals but also fosters a resilient, inclusive, and sustainable urban environment. Future iterations of the Climate City Contract will evolve as the city gains new insights from the implementation phases and as more stakeholders join the initiative.

# 1 Part A – Current State of Climate Investment

Part A ‘Current State of Climate Investment’ is the **structural element** of the climate neutrality investment plan, putting the basis for the development of the plan through a detailed-oriented evaluation and assessment of the city’s existing financial policies and funding/financing activities.

## 1.1 Module IP-A1: Existing Climate Action Funding and Financing

This section represents the initial step of the 2030 Climate City Investment Plan and will require an evaluation and assessment of previous and existing funding and financing for climate activities by field of action. The purpose of this task is to assess the city’s history of climate actions to date – including past failures and successes – to establish the baseline for climate actions in the future. These past actions should be broken down to the project level where possible and grouped as per the fields of action identified in the Action Plan. A full breakdown of historic climate initiatives and their financing is recommended, including historic budget data for the past 3–5 years.

**Task Goals:** This task will help the city to collate all historical climate actions and initiatives – assessing previous successes and any issues that arose. By establishing a baseline for climate action, the city can then track their future development and the implementation of their Climate Action and Investment Plans.

### Model IP-A1

**Guiding questions:**

Have you already engaged in climate budgeting and – if so – what is the city’s historical track record with climate actions and projects?
Do you have sufficient data on each field of action and is data collection carried out internally within the finance department?
Has the city engaged in any PPPs or has there been any significant private sector engagement in recent years, and what is the current status of these projects? If not, why not – is this a political or regulatory hurdle?

### A-1.1: Textual Element

Historically, Differdange has embarked on multiple climate initiatives, though it lacked a designated climate budget until the establishment of the ‘Service écologique.’ Prior to this, climate-related actions were incorporated into the broader activities of other departments such as Energy, Urban Planning, and Mobility, reflecting a growing recognition of the need for directed climate adaptation and neutrality efforts. The centralization of climate action within the ‘Service écologique’ marked a pivotal shift towards more structured and focused climate budgeting and project implementation.

Regarding data availability and financial tracking, the city admits to gaps in its historical data collection. This shortfall is primarily attributed to a lack of manpower within the finance department, coupled with the absence of established procedures and tools for thorough data collection and analysis. While some data has been gathered and will be incorporated into the financial plan, ongoing efforts are needed to enhance data management capabilities to support more effective climate action planning and monitoring.

In terms of public-private partnerships (PPPs) and private sector engagement, Differdange has initiated several projects with varying degrees of success. The city’s political and regulatory environment is generally conducive to such partnerships, indicating a readiness to support and expand these collaborations. Recent engagements in PPPs demonstrate a proactive stance in leveraging private sector capabilities and resources to advance climate goals, reflecting a strategic approach to fulfilling the city’s climate commitments.

The current status of these projects varies, with some advancing towards implementation and others in the planning stages. Each project under these partnerships is being closely monitored to ensure alignment with the broader objectives of Differdange’s climate action plan. The city remains committed to refining its approach to PPPs, learning from experiences to optimize future collaborations.

Overall, Differdange is actively working to strengthen its climate action framework by enhancing financial policies, improving data collection and management, and fostering private sector involvement. By addressing these

## 1.2 Module IP-A2: Strategic Funding and Financing Evaluation

This section requires an evaluation of the city's existing financial policies to understand how they are currently managing the capital allocation towards climate neutrality. This will include strategies in place and what the city has at its disposal to facilitate the transition. The form of capital it has access to and which are specific to their climate neutrality targets should be identified, and the current debt level of the city and any legislative requirements for new debt issuance should be outlined

**Task Goals:** By identifying the existing income and capital sources to the city – as well as potential for future capital sources – the city can start to identify ways to fund the climate actions and initiatives identified within the Climate Action Plan.

Do you have a clear overview of public sources of capital as well as private funding and financing sources? If yes, how detailed and accurate is it?
To which aspects of this module does the municipality have the internal capacity to delve into detail on? Given some of these sources of finance may be combined to deliver on actions and priorities defined in the Action Plan.

# A-2.1: Textual Element

Regarding public and private sources of capital, Differdange has a robust understanding of its own budgeting practices and the evolution of its fiscal resources. The city confidently navigates state subsidies, which, although requiring initial capital outlay from the municipal coffers, are reimbursed subsequently, providing a predictable flow of capital back into the city's finances. This familiarity extends to European Union project financing, where the parameters are well-defined, enabling the city to participate actively in new calls with a clear expectation of financial management.

However, when it comes to engaging private sector financing, the city acknowledges a gap in detailed and actionable knowledge. The strategic decision has been thus to prioritize projects within the municipal budgetary constraints, focusing predominantly on operational expenditures that do not necessitate additional outlays beyond the salaries already accounted for in the regular city budget. This approach ensures that many of the climate action initiatives can proceed without necessitating additional funding, minimizing financial risk and dependency on external capital sources.

As for the internal capacity to delve into detailed financial analysis and planning, Differdange faces challenges primarily due to limited manpower and the breadth of data required to fully leverage all potential sources of finance, particularly in combining different financing streams to support defined actions in the Climate Action Plan. Currently, the city does not have a comprehensive system in place to thoroughly track and analyse this level of detailed financial data across various funding sources. This limitation is recognized as a developmental area, and efforts are planned to enhance financial data collection and analysis capabilities in future iterations of the financial plan.

In summary, while Differdange has a good grasp on managing its public financing and navigating known funding mechanisms, it acknowledges the need for improved internal capabilities and data availability to better integrate and leverage both public and private financing for its climate initiatives. This ongoing development will be crucial as the city seeks to expand its actions under the Climate Action Plan and ensure sustainable funding and financing mechanisms are in place to support these initiatives over the long term.

## 1.3 Module IP-A3: Barriers to Climate Investment

This section requires evaluation and identification of the range of structural, policy, economic, and financial barriers for capital deployment in support of climate action.

**Task Goals:** By listing the current barriers to climate investment, cities can start to identify solutions to overcome these barriers and facilitate further capital flows. This could involve collaborating to enact new policy, or identifying external stakeholders that can help to overcome structural and financial barriers.

### Model IP-A3

**Guiding questions:**
How is internal capacity considered to be a barrier? Are barriers able to be overcome and if so, what solutions are available?
For which of the identified barriers, do you need support from the Mission Platform?
For which of the identified barriers can other stakeholders provide support?

### A-3.1: Textual element

The City of Differdange acknowledges the challenges in evaluating and identifying the structural, policy, economic, and financial barriers for capital deployment in support of our climate action initiatives. At this stage,
Ville de Differdange

Climate Neutrality Investment Plan

we face significant constraints due to limited internal capacity and the absence of comprehensive data necessary to fully articulate these barriers.

Differdange, being a smaller municipality, does not currently possess the extensive manpower required to produce detailed analyses or develop extensive financial data that might illuminate the pathways to overcoming these investment barriers. This limitation is largely structural, stemming from the city's modest administrative scale and resource allocation, which prioritizes immediate operational demands over expansive strategic planning.

Moreover, the process of engaging with external stakeholders and formalizing their involvement is scheduled for 2025. Until these collaborations are officially underway, the city lacks the broad-based stakeholder input that could potentially identify and address specific investment obstacles. The anticipated cooperation with these external entities is expected to enhance our understanding and capacity to dismantle these barriers.

In light of these circumstances, Differdange seeks understanding and patience from the Mission Platform. We are committed to progressing in our climate action efforts and will integrate the identification and analysis of investment barriers in future iterations of our financial plan. For the present, our main challenge remains the scarcity of manpower, which affects mostly this aspect of our climate mission and not the broader spectrum of activities required to achieve our environmental objectives. After all, most of the actions will be financed by the city itself and many others will be implemented with the help of the national government that offers fixed subsidies for specific actions. These state participations have been taken into account by the city during the planning phase of the action plan, as you could see in the original document. Few actions are depending on third parties, such as stakeholders, but even here, the city is confident to find the funds.

Despite these challenges, the commitment within our municipal departments and political leadership to the climate mission is unwavering. The city is actively exploring solutions to bolster our internal capacities, potentially through partnerships or by securing external support that could provide the necessary expertise and resources. We anticipate that future collaborations, as part of the Mission Platform and with other stakeholders, will enable us to overcome these barriers and facilitate the capital flows essential for our climate initiatives.

Table 5 Guidelines: Please provide an exhaustive list of all barriers to climate investment and any potential solutions (including the stakeholders involved) to overcome these barriers.

|  Financial Barriers to achieving Climate Neutrality | Typology of Barrier | Description | Sector and stakeholders involved  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Internal Capacity Limitations | Structural/Financial | Limited financial resources for hiring and training personnel with expertise in climate finance, project management, and technical implementation hinder the ability to secure and manage climate investments effectively.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Risk Aversion in Private Investment | Economic/Financial | Climate projects often require long-term capital investments with uncertain returns, making them less attractive to traditional investors. The perceived risk associated with innovative solutions, regulatory changes, and evolving market conditions leads to reluctance from financial institutions and private investors. A lack of financial instruments such as risk guarantees, blended finance, or concessional loans further discourages private sector involvement. | Private investors, financial institutions, municipal and national governments, development banks, Mission Platform for investment de-risking mechanisms.  |
|  Fragmentation of Climate Funding Sources | Financial/Structural | Climate investment relies on multiple funding streams from municipal budgets, national programs, EU funds, and private investments, which are often uncoordinated.

Given this context, Differdange currently lacks the detailed budgetary framework that would allow for comprehensive long-term cost projections as required in Table 6 of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan. Specifically, the city does not employ a standardized costing methodology, nor does it engage in macroeconomic forecasting or detailed capital expenditure planning (capex) on a project-by-project basis that could provide the level of detail expected for implementation costs or operational expenditures over a multi-year timeline.

Moreover, the municipal team, while highly motivated and committed to achieving the city's climate objectives, does not include specialists in complex financial modelling or cost-effectiveness analysis. As a result, Differdange is not equipped to calculate the direct impacts on CO2e reduction per annum or to monetize the co-benefits of the proposed climate actions through the period up to 2030.

In recognizing these challenges, Differdange is actively seeking support from external partners and the Mission Platform to enhance its capacity in this area. The city welcomes guidance and collaboration that can help bridge the gap between its current financial planning capabilities and the detailed requirements of the Investment Plan. This collaboration could include assistance in developing a suitable costing methodology, training for staff on economic forecasting, and strategic advice on integrating more detailed financial planning into the city's budgetary processes.

As we move forward, Differdange remains committed to transparency and responsible fiscal management. We intend to refine our budgeting approach to include more detailed financial planning as our capacity develops, ensuring that we continue to advance towards our climate neutrality goals responsibly and effectively.

Table 6 Guidelines: Please provide a breakdown of all the anticipated costs of the climate actions identified in the Action Plan – it is encouraged that this covers the period from the present day to 2030. In each instance, please provide the absolute capex and operational costs. Implementation Costs/Capital Expenditure is the cost to develop and implement the project. Operational Expenditure is the expected annual running costs of the project once completed or operational (include annual costs and any cost savings from the project). Direct Impacts is, in this case, the CO2e reduction per annum forecasted by the project, and the indirect impacts are ideally the monetized co-benefits (or a qualitative assessment).

To support the analysis below, please provide a methodology and all assumptions for your workings as an annexe. This should include unit costs benchmarking, a baseline year for cost estimates and the methodology for both direct and indirect benefits of GHG reduction.

Table 6: Sectorial Costing

Differdange's situation is that the territorial proportions are 1/3 industry, 1/3 AFOLU and 1/3 city. 95% of emissions are created by the industry, where we do not have a hand on – and we do not have the full data concerning those emissions. The utilization of the NetZeroPlanner was therefore no option for the city since the data requested to allow for the calculations are yet to be compiled and are not available at this point. This renders the calculations requested in table 6 impossible. Nevertheless, we calculated to the best of our capacities.

|  68 | Rearranging urban spaces |  | Urban development | Significant reduction of CO2 through several direct initiatives. The increase in vegetated areas helps to capture atmospheric CO2, thus improving urban air quality. Expansion of pedestrian spaces and cycling infrastructure reduces reliance on motor vehicles, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the reduction of heat islands through smart urban planning reduces the need for air conditioning, which also contributes to lower energy consumption and CO2 emissions. These improvements, in synergy with the city's sustainability policies, form an effective framework to mitigate climate impacts and improve the well-being of residents. |  | Enrich community interaction through better public spaces, thereby strengthening social cohesion. This urban regeneration is also likely to boost the local economy by attracting businesses and tourists, while the increased greenery and reduced pollution promise significant health benefits.

|   | until 2030, underscoring the city's commitment to continuous improvement in its urban landscape.

**Key Actions:**
**Revitalizing Public Spaces:** Redesigning the squares to incorporate climate-resilient features such as permeable paving materials that help manage stormwater and reduce urban heat islands.
**Green Infrastructure:** Introducing more green elements like trees, shrubs, and grassy areas to increase shade, improve air quality, and provide natural cooling effects.
**Enhanced Accessibility and Safety:** Redesigning the squares to be more accessible and safer for pedestrians, encouraging more people to use these public spaces for recreation and social gatherings.
**Integration of Modern Amenities:** Equipping the squares with modern, eco-friendly amenities that cater to the needs of all age groups, making these areas more inviting and functional.
**Benefits of the Project:**
**Climate Resilience:** The adapted squares will help mitigate the effects of climate change locally by improving air quality and reducing heat.
**Social Cohesion:** Revitalized public spaces encourage community interactions and social activities, fostering a sense of belonging and community spirit.
**Economic Boost:** Attractive and functional public squares can draw more visitors and boost local businesses.
**Environmental Benefits:** Increased greenery and sustainable design contribute to biodiversity and offer habitats for urban wildlife.
**Challenges:**
**Ongoing Maintenance:** Ensuring that the new features and plantings are maintained appropriately can require significant ongoing investment and resources.
**Public Engagement:** Successfully engaging the community in the redesign process to ensure that the changes meet their needs and expectations.
**Balancing Aesthetics and Functionality:** Designing spaces that are both beautiful and functional, especially under the constraints of climate adaptation measures.
**Long-term Vision:** Through this project, Differdange is setting a standard for urban climate resilience and quality of life improvements. By transforming its public squares into vibrant, green, and climate-resilient hubs, the city is not only addressing the immediate needs of its citizens but also preparing its urban environment for future challenges associated with climate change. This initiative reflects Differdange’s holistic approach to urban planning, which prioritizes sustainability, community well-being, and environmental stewardship.  |

## 2.2 Module IP-B2: Capital Planning for Climate Neutrality

This section will include a definition of the city's capital goals and how to achieve them. As the implementation of its programme starts, the below sources of capital can be laid out as a starting point. These should be aligned with the city's goals and relevant to the actions selected. Ideally, this will be a target and the city will optimize towards.

**Task Goals:** This exercise forces cities to identify the funding and financing gaps within their Investment Plans so as to begin the process of securing additional and (in most cases) external funding and financing for climate actions. This exercise encourages cities to begin the process of identifying potential capital solutions on the project level.

# Model IP-B2

## Guiding questions:
What are the existing resources already available for each action or project (e.g. public contributions, existing funding or investments secured)?
How much of the budget is available for climate investment, and is the municipality operating at a surplus or deficit?
How can you optimize use of both public funding and private investment capital to ensure capital deployment for all costs identified to reach the climate neutrality goal?
Do you have experience on creating a pipeline of projects with the involvement of the private sector?

## Textual element

As the City of Differdange strides towards achieving its ambitious goal of climate neutrality, articulated under the NetZeroCities framework, the financial architecture supporting this vision is being meticulously sculpted to bridge ambition with practicality. Differdange's proactive approach involves a strategic blend of fiscal prudence and aggressive capital allocation to environmental projects, which is reflected in the comprehensive financial documentation provided in table 6. These tables are a testament to the city's commitment to transparency, detailing existing public contributions, secured investments for each climate action, and the project currently underway.

## Financial Resources and Strategic Allocation

Differdange has carefully catalogued all available resources for each climate initiative, ensuring a robust foundation for each project's financial needs. There is a clear trajectory of increasing budget allocation towards climate investments, reflecting a growth from 5.97% of the budget in 2023 to a projected 7.35% by 2025. This progression underscores the city's increasing commitment to its environmental targets, translating to a budget increase from €788,767 to €3,680,000. While managing these fiscal commitments, the city carefully navigates to avoid deficits, showcasing a balanced approach between ambitious environmental action and prudent financial management.

## Optimizing Capital Deployment

The primary strategy for funding these climate actions hinges on a mix of direct city budget allocations and generous state subsidies, ensuring substantial coverage of associated costs. The city is poised to begin an active engagement with stakeholders in 2025, which is expected to unlock additional funding avenues and further solidify the financial base for forthcoming initiatives. Differdange is particularly focused on leveraging both public and private capital to fulfil the financial demands of achieving climate neutrality, with detailed plans for stakeholder investments meticulously noted for current and future reference in the city's financial plans.

## Engaging the Private Sector

Despite Differdange's current limited experience in fostering a project pipeline with robust private sector involvement, the city is eager to adapt and evolve. Recognizing the necessity for private investment to meet the scale of its climate ambitions, Differdange is committed to cultivating partnerships that can offer financial and innovative support. The city acknowledges this as a growth area and is actively seeking expertise and partnerships that can facilitate these developments.

## Commitment to Sustainable Financial Planning

Differdange's approach to financial planning for climate action is both dynamic and forward thinking. The city understands the critical need for sustainable financial strategies that not only support immediate climate action goals but also ensure long-term fiscal health. This involves rigorous planning, ongoing assessments of financial flows, and a keen openness to adapting strategies as needed to meet both current and emergent environmental challenges.

The city's journey toward a sustainable future is framed by a clear vision and a strategic approach to financial management. With each step forward, Differdange demonstrates a commitment to not just meeting but exceeding its climate goals, supported by a financial strategy that is both robust and responsive to the city's evolving needs. This strategic financial management ensures that Differdange remains a model of sustainable urban development, committed to achieving its objectives with precision and proactive governance.

## 2.3 Module IP-B3: Economic and Financial Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

A range of financial policies need to be considered to execute the actions laid out in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan. The city's financial policies should align with their current process and capital allocation. This will depend on the actions selected and be drawn from possible financial tools to assist the transition.

**Task Goals:** A strong and robust monitoring, evaluation and learning framework is crucial for internal monitoring of the implementation of climate actions, as well as a requirement for securing external capital where any private actor would require the ability to monitor the project implementation and progress towards benchmarks and targets. By developing this framework now, cities can fully track their progress through the NetZeroCities Mission.

|  Model IP-B3  |

|  Guiding questions:  |
|  • Do you have a monitoring system in place that evaluates the impact of green investments?  |
|  • Do you have a system to estimate emission reduction (following recognized methodologies) or co-benefits to measure the impact of investments?  |
|  • Do you have a monitoring and evaluation system for capital investment planning process-mapping deviation?  |
|  • Which indicators are most aligned with the work done in the Action Plan?  |
|  • Is the required data for the calculation of selected indicators available, or do you need to involve additional stakeholders?  |

|  Differdange's approach to monitoring and evaluating its climate initiatives is structured around a developing framework that emphasizes transparency, accountability, and continual improvement. While the city is committed to establishing this framework, it is currently in the process of integrating all necessary components to capture both the progress and the lessons learned from various innovative practices and experiments conducted under the city's climate action plan.

As part of this developing system, Differdange is focusing on setting up regular reporting mechanisms for the status of all its climate-related projects. Future reports are intended to detail advances in initiatives such  |

as agroforestry and advanced carbon storage techniques, assessing both their effectiveness and their contribution towards the city's overall emission reduction targets. These reports will employ quantitative metrics, such as the amount of carbon captured or the reduction in emissions compared to baseline levels, alongside qualitative assessments of the implementation process.

In addition, Differdange plans to implement a dynamic feedback mechanism that will continuously incorporate data from ongoing projects to refine strategies and tactics. This mechanism will be supported by a robust data management system designed to gather comprehensive data from all relevant stakeholders and projects, facilitating real-time monitoring and enabling thorough evaluations of each initiative's impact once fully operational.

To foster a culture of learning and adaptation, Differdange intends to host regular review sessions involving city planners, project managers, and external experts. These sessions will focus on discussing outcomes, sharing best practices, and integrating new insights into existing and future projects, ensuring that Differdange remains at the forefront of climate action innovation.

The city also recognizes the critical role of community involvement in achieving its climate goals. It plans to engage citizens and local organizations through workshops and public forums to gather feedback and encourage community-driven climate actions. This participatory approach is designed to enhance public awareness of Differdange's climate policies and ensure that community needs and suggestions are considered in policy formulation and project execution.

Through the gradual implementation of these comprehensive monitoring and evaluation practices, Differdange aims to not only track the effectiveness of its climate strategies but also create an adaptive and responsive framework that supports sustained climate action. This systematic approach will assist the city in refining its strategies continually, ensuring that Differdange can meet its ambitious climate goals while fostering a resilient and sustainable urban environment.

Table 10 Guidelines: Please develop some project- and sector-level economic indicators as well as some cross-cutting indicators to monitor the implementation of the Investment Plan and identified projects. If you are having trouble conceptualizing these indicators, please utilize the Indicators Guidebook which can be found on the NetZeroCities portal.

# 3 Part C – Enabling Financial Conditions for Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part C ‘Enabling Conditions for Climate Neutrality by 2030’ is the third section of the Investment Plan and is intended to identify other enabling factors the city needs to consider in the implementation of the Investment Plan.

## 3.1 Module IP-C1: Climate Policies for Capital Formation and Deployment

The allocation of capital will need to be optimized between both public and private sources across the portfolio outlined in the Action Plan to meet the cost of the actions identified for reaching climate neutrality over time.

**Task Goals:** Tied to A3, this exercise is an opportunity for cities to identify existing and potential policies to help facilitate capital flows towards climate actions. This could be focused on high-level municipal actions such as the ability to issue green municipal bonds, through to increasing parking fares in the city centre to raise funds for climate actions. If including EU-wide and national policies, please explain the direct impact for the city of these actions. Although linked to the Action Plan exercise, please use this as an opportunity to identify climate policies that specifically support capital formation and deployment.

### Model IP-C1

**Guiding questions:**
Does your city have an existing process for policy formulation (tool method, transversal team, procurement and innovative contracting, etc.) that supports financing or funding innovative areas and climate action?
What process is in place for your Transition Team to input on financial/funding policy, so that they do not operate in a silo for the 2030 ambition?

### C-1.1: Textual element

Differdange’s approach to climate finance is characterized by an integrated and proactive strategy, focusing on the optimization of capital allocation between public and private sources. This strategic alignment is vital to meet the costs associated with the extensive set of actions identified in the Climate Action Plan aimed at achieving climate neutrality.

#### Strategic Framework and Policy Formulation

The policy formulation process in Differdange is streamlined due to its relatively small administrative structure, facilitating swift decision-making processes. Climate-related policies are primarily formulated by the mayor and aldermen, reflecting a direct and effective governance model. This approach is supported by the establishment of the ‘Service écologique,’ which centralizes climate-relevant actions and ensures that departments like Energy, Urban Planning, and Mobility are aligned with the city’s climate neutrality objectives.

The Transition Team, which includes department chiefs and an external consultant from EVERARD Consulting &amp; Communication, plays a pivotal role in integrating cross-departmental insights into financial and funding policies. This team structure prevents operational silos and ensures that the city’s climate ambitions are cohesively pursued across all municipal activities.

#### Existing Policies Supporting Climate Initiatives

Differdange has adopted several strategic policies and initiatives that support its climate action goals. Just to name a few:
#

Ville de Differdange

Climate Neutrality Investment Plan

#

Climate Pact: Supported by Luxembourg's Ministry for the Environment and managed by Klima-Agence, this pact involves municipalities in sustainable energy transition initiatives, backed by state funding for climate consultancy.
Waste Legislation and National Waste and Resource Management Plan: These legislative frameworks promote reduction, reuse, and recycling, aligning with European directives to enhance waste management efficiency.
Naturpakt: Focused on biodiversity and natural resource management, this strategy involves financial support and expertise to municipalities for adopting sustainable environmental measures.
National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (NECP): Guides Luxembourg's energy and climate strategy, aiming for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

These policies not only facilitate the efficient allocation of resources but also ensure that Differdange is aligned with national and European environmental standards, enhancing its capability to attract and manage funds necessary for its climate initiatives.

# Challenges and Future Directions

While Differdange has established a solid foundation for policy-driven climate action, several challenges remain, particularly in enhancing private sector engagement and expanding innovative financing mechanisms like green bonds or special environmental taxes. The city acknowledges the need for a more detailed and systematic approach to capital formation, especially in terms of engaging with European partners to leverage additional funding opportunities.

In conclusion, Differdange's strategic policy framework and its commitment to integrated and sustainable climate action set a strong foundation for achieving climate neutrality. The ongoing development of financial strategies and the enhancement of collaborative policy frameworks are essential to ensure the successful implementation of the city's ambitious climate goals by 2030.

Table 12 Guidelines: Please identify and describe any potential policies to support capital facilitation and deployment in the city, describing the policy, its current status or stage of development, and the intended outcome (e.g. increased parking fares to deter driving but also raising capital for additional climate actions). For city-level policies, please include some quantifiable range as to the amount of capital raised by intended policies.

## 3.2 Module IP-C2: Identification and Mitigation of Risks

The risks relevant to the implementation of an Investment Plan should be considered, which may impact the ambition to achieve climate neutrality, mitigation techniques should be identified where necessary and where possible, these should align with the financial policies selected.
Ville de Differdange

Climate Neutrality Investment Plan

Task Goals: All projects identified in the Climate Action Plan will have potential risks regarding funding and financing – for example, a project overshooting cost estimates. By establishing a risk management framework and developing risk mitigation at both the sector and project level, cities can ensure they are equipped to identify any problems quickly, and sufficiently deal with these problems once they arise.

## Model IP-C2

**Guiding questions:**
Does risk analysis feature in your decision-making investment process?
How do you regularly identify and measure risk related to financing actions?
What is your understanding of risk mitigation and quantification methods?
How have you devised your risk management framework and how frequently – and via what process – will it be reviewed?

## C-2.1: Textual element

Differdange recognizes the critical need for a comprehensive risk management framework to navigate the complexities of achieving climate neutrality by 2030. As the city progresses with its Climate Action Plan, there is a growing understanding that the existing measures, while prudent, may not fully meet the extensive requirements set by the EU Commission for systematic risk management. This acknowledgment is shaping the city's approach to risk analysis and mitigation in its investment processes.

## Current Approach to Risk Management

Currently, Differdange employs a 'prudent man' approach to investment decision-making, which relies heavily on expert advice and external consultancy to assess and manage risks. This method ensures that each project is evaluated thoroughly, focusing on sustainability and financial viability before any commitments are made. However, this approach is primarily reactive rather than proactive, and it operates within the limitations of available expertise and resources.

The city's departments, supported by professional consultants, monitor projects closely, yet the process lacks the depth of a fully integrated risk management system that the EU guidelines envision. This system would require a more detailed and frequent analysis of potential financial and operational risks and a strategic response plan tailored to each sector and project.

## Need for Enhanced Risk Management

Acknowledging these gaps, Differdange is keen to develop a more robust framework that includes comprehensive risk quantification and mitigation strategies. The city is in the initial stages of exploring how to integrate advanced risk assessment tools that can provide more detailed insights into the financial and operational aspects of climate-related projects.

## Seeking Guidance and Support

To move towards a more advanced risk management system, Differdange is actively seeking support and coaching from the NetZeroCities mission. Assistance from experienced professionals in this field would be invaluable in helping the city to establish a systematic approach that aligns with EU standards. This support would enable Differdange to not only understand the broader spectrum of potential risks but also to implement effective strategies to mitigate them preemptively.

## Future Development of Risk Management Practices

The city plans to develop its risk management framework by incorporating detailed regular reviews and updates that adapt to new challenges and opportunities as they arise. This will involve training for internal teams and possibly expanding the role of external consultants to ensure continuous improvement in risk management practices. The goal is to create a dynamic, responsive framework capable of supporting Differdange's ambitious climate goals effectively.

While Differdange currently relies on a conservative and somewhat fragmented approach to risk management, there is a clear directive to enhance these practices. By establishing a more structured and comprehensive system with the support of the NetZeroCities mission, Differdange aims to safeguard its investments and

ensure the successful implementation of its climate action initiatives. This strategic shift will not only address the immediate needs for risk management but also set a sustainable foundation for future climate actions.

Table 13 Guidelines: Please identify potential risks, routes to monitoring these risks, and a mitigation plan to prevent risk escalation. This should be completed for the project- and sector-level as well as city-wide risks. Instead of simply listing risks, this is an opportunity for cities to outline a risk management framework (including identifying high, medium and low priority risks), the likelihood of all risks and any residual risks following mitigation actions.

# 3.3 Module IP-C3: Capacity Building and Stakeholder Engagement for Capital and Investment Planning

Internal capacity and capabilities should be assessed and developed, working with both internal and external stakeholders to accelerate the transition to climate neutrality by 2030. This stakeholder mapping and identification of engagement pathways are tied to the Action Plan exercise but should focus on financial and investment-focused stakeholders including (but not limited to) municipal banks, private sector companies that must invest to decarbonize their assets and all private capital providers or funding organizations. For non-financial stakeholders, provide a breakdown of costs for any stakeholder incentive schemes such as transport subsidies or funding for retrofitting of residential properties.

**Task Goals:** The first element of this task is an opportunity for cities to assess internal capacity and identify any knowledge or resource gaps within the Transition Team. This should be clearly outlined in the text as well as any plans to overcome these gaps.

For the stakeholder engagement exercise, cities should use this exercise to identify any potential stakeholders that can support the financing and development of their Climate Action Plan. As has been documented, the local authority accounts for a small proportion of emissions within the city and private stakeholders must also invest to decarbonize their emitting assets. By identifying these stakeholders early, cities can facilitate engagement optimally. Cities can take the same approach to this task as the similar task within the Climate Action Plan, but focus on financial actors (i.e. any stakeholder that can deploy funds for proposed climate investments – whether to public projects or their own corporate actions) or the costs associated with interacting with the non-financial actors (e.g. incentive schemes for citizen behavioural shift).

## Model IP-C3

**Guiding questions:**
Is your Transition Team well resourced and does it have the necessary skillsets to develop a robust Investment Plan?
Have you identified the capacity gaps (both knowledge and personnel) in your Transition Team to develop and implement the Plan?
Have you identified relevant stakeholders to develop an Investment Plan in your city?
Do you have a clear engagement strategy for relevant stakeholders?

## C-3.1: Textual element

In the development of the Investment Plan for Differdange, the city faces considerable challenges in terms of internal capacity and stakeholder engagement, necessary for transitioning to climate neutrality by 2030. The city's Transition Team, which is central to this effort, has encountered significant limitations in both resources and expertise, as outlined in your comprehensive feedback.

Firstly, the Transition Team's experience in completing this Investment Plan has starkly highlighted the existing capacity gaps. The team, pushed to its limits, struggled with the absence of necessary data, which had never been collected due to any prior requirement. Furthermore, the intricate level of financial detail required by the Investment Plan exceeded the granularity of Differdange's usual budgetary practices. Clearly, the city's current resource allocation and the skill set of the Transition Team are inadequate for the demands of such detailed financial planning. Recognizing these deficiencies, Differdange has embarked on an internal analysis conducted by Deloitte to better organize departmental responsibilities and missions. Additionally, the city has made a strategic move by hiring a new staff member specialized in managing EU projects, indicating a step towards enhancing its administrative capacity for climate-related projects.

Regarding stakeholder engagement, Differdange has successfully identified key financial and non-financial stakeholders crucial for the climate mission. The planned onboarding of these stakeholders in 2025 is pivotal. It is expected that by then, the administrative groundwork of the mission will be set, allowing for effective engagement. The city aims to host major events to not only present the mission and its associated projects but also to actively involve stakeholders in areas pertinent to them. This strategy, however, is hampered by the

persistent issue of limited manpower, a significant challenge for a small city like Differdange. Nevertheless, the commitment to overcoming these obstacles is evident, as the city pledges to utilize all available resources to ensure the successful implementation of its climate strategies.

Differdange's approach to stakeholder engagement is expected to evolve as the city enhances its internal capabilities. The ongoing efforts to increase staffing and improve organizational structures are steps towards developing a robust framework capable of supporting ambitious climate actions. By addressing these internal and external challenges head-on, Differdange is laying the groundwork for a sustainable and inclusive approach to achieving climate neutrality, demonstrating resilience and proactive governance in the face of substantial obstacles.

# 1 Introduction

Explain your city's motivation to join the EU mission "100 smart and climate-neutral cities by 2030" and highlight your city's current climate action commitments. You can also include the objectives of this document.

# Text of the City of Differdange:

The city of Differdange in Luxembourg has committed to the European mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" in order to fight climate change and ensure a sustainable future. In doing so, the city hopes to increase the attractiveness of its territory, among other things in the areas of the circular economy and the fight against energy poverty.

One of the key motivations for this commitment is the willingness to engage in scientific exchanges in the field of energy transition at European level. By collaborating with other cities and sharing knowledge, the city of Differdange will develop innovative solutions to the challenges of climate change. This exchange of ideas will also improve the local knowledge of city employees and empower them to contribute to the transition to a sustainable future.

Another motivation for the city's engagement in the EU mission is the net-zero 2030 target, which, given the data available at present, is much more necessary than the overall 2050 target. This objective gives the city of Differdange a head start in achieving carbon neutrality, thereby increasing its resilience to a possible energy and climate shock. The city aims to achieve this through a range of measures, including improving the energy efficiency of buildings, promoting sustainable mobility, supporting renewable energy and reducing waste.

Overall, the city of Differdange is committed to taking bold action to combat climate change and ensure a sustainable future for its citizens. The city's participation in the EU mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" will enable it to collaborate with other cities and share best practices, ultimately leading to a more sustainable and resilient future. The mission aims to help European cities achieve carbon neutrality and develop innovative climate solutions.

Differdange is committed to achieving this goal by implementing various sustainable development policies and promoting sustainable initiatives. To demonstrate its commitment to climate action, the city of Differdange was able to show its involvement in several initiatives, including Klimapakt, Climaborough, CIPU, Klimabündnis, and FUSILLI. Klimapakt is a platform that brings together municipalities and other stakeholders in Luxembourg to work on climate change mitigation and adaptation. Climaborough is a project that focuses on developing citizen participation in the financing of energy production facilities and on cooperation with industry. CIPU is the national platform for urban policy and planning that functions as an information platform with the aim of increasing awareness of spatial planning in Luxembourg at the international level. With nearly 2,000 members from 27 European countries, Klimabündnis is the world's largest network of cities dedicated to climate protection. FUSILLI is a project that aims to promote the transformation of the urban food system through the implementation of an innovative living laboratory. The project aims to address the challenges of the transition to sustainable food systems in nearby urban, peri-urban and rural areas by creating a knowledge-sharing and learning network between 12 cities.

This "Climate City Contract" (CCC) is a document that describes the commitments of the city of Differdange in terms of climate action. The CCC aims to build a partnership between the city and its citizens to work together towards a carbon-neutral and climate-resilient future. The document includes measures such as improving the energy efficiency of buildings, promoting sustainable mobility, supporting renewable energy and reducing waste.

Through this contract, the city of Differdange aims to achieve its goal of becoming a climate-neutral and smart city by 2030.

# 2 Objective: Climate neutrality by 2030

Articulate your ambition of climate neutrality by 2030, as expressed and defined in your expression of interest (Mdi) of the Cities Mission. This should include your ambition and commitment to 2030 for the whole city, as well as a description of any exclusion zones and a summary of how these zones will be treated beyond 2030. (A more detailed plan for exclusion zones should be included in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan). Your ambition for 2030 must be supported at least by a Council decision, and it is recommended that it is also supported by a broader stakeholder group. We also recommend listing other co-benefits you would like to achieve by working towards the goal of climate neutrality, such as well-being, health, equity, justice and financial savings.

# Text of the City of Differdange:

According to the Cities Mission's Expression of Interest (EOI) submitted by the city of Differdange, the city's ambition and commitment to 2030 as a whole city includes achieving climate neutrality by 2030, with a focus on climate change adaptation, accessibility, healthcare and equity. The city plans to achieve this ambition through a combination of measures, including increasing the use of renewable energy, promoting sustainable mobility, improving the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing waste.

The city has not identified any exclusion zones. Private stakeholders, such as large industrial players, who are beyond the influence and decisions of the municipality, are unlikely to be able to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The city will nevertheless keep them informed and consider them an integral part of the process. The city plans to work closely with all stakeholders and engages in international collaboration to address challenges beyond 2030. The city also recognises the need for a just transition, ensuring that no one is left behind, as it strives to achieve its 2030 climate neutrality ambition.

In terms of adaptation to climate change, the city of Differdange plans to develop a comprehensive adaptation strategy, which includes identifying priority areas for action such as the renovation of entire buildings and taking a position on waste management, as well as measures to improve the city's resilience to energy crises. The city also plans to implement measures to improve accessibility, such as promoting sustainable mobility, developing green spaces and improving public transport infrastructure through the development of a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP).

Regarding health care, the city plans to promote healthy lifestyles. This includes measures to reduce air pollution, promote active lifestyles and improve access to green spaces.

Overall, the city of Differdange is committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2030, while addressing the challenges of climate change adaptation, accessibility, healthcare and equity. The city recognises the need for collaboration and stakeholder engagement, especially in the areas of exclusion, and is committed to a just transition through deep civic participation.

## 3 Key Priorities and Strategic Interventions

This is the central section of the commitment document that should summarise at least 3-4 systemic strategic priorities that need to be implemented for your city to become climate neutral by 2030. These must be significant changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in your city, such as decarbonizing the city's heating system or producing 100% energy from renewable sources. Individual commitments made by your city and other stakeholders must address these key priorities and help achieve them. The attached 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan should describe in detail all interventions, including those aimed at achieving your priorities as well as all other actions, and describe how your city plans to implement them.

## Text of the City of Differdange:

The city of Differdange has identified 5 systemic strategic priorities that are necessary for the city to achieve climate neutrality by 2030*.

The first of these priorities is to focus on stationary energy by setting a 50% renovation target. This means that half of the city's buildings will have to be renovated to improve their energy efficiency.

The second priority is to aim for 100% self-sufficient renewable energy production. This will require moving away from fossil fuels and investing more in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, biomass and geothermal.

The third priority is to reduce individual mileage by 20% in order to solve the mobility problem. This will be achieved by promoting active mobility options such as cycling and walking, improving public transport services and encouraging carpooling. (Development of a SUMP)

The fourth priority is to increase the recycling quota to 65% and reduce the total amount of waste by at least 40%, which is a significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Finally, the city of Differdange aims to compensate the tonnage of CO2 with only 20% of the compensation by the purchase of CO2 certificates. In addition, 50% of the compensation must be carried out on the city's land, which could require the construction of carbon sinks.

These systemic strategic priorities will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in the city and will be key to achieving the goal of climate neutrality by 2030.

*These priorities focus only on the sectors that fall within the municipality's decision-making sphere.

## 4 Principles and processes

Highlight key principles that will guide your city in implementing its climate city contract, such as accountability, transparency, or openness to new approaches. The process must encompass principles such as co-creation, innovation, multi-stakeholder and citizen engagement, and must be systemic and demand-driven in nature. It must also be based on monitoring and common learning. The Commitments Guidance Document provides more specific guidance on how to incorporate these principles into your own process.

The City of Differdange's Climate City Contract (CCC) is guided by several key principles that are essential to the successful implementation of this ambitious plan. These principles include accountability, transparency and openness to new approaches, ensuring that the actions undertaken by the city to achieve climate neutrality are visible and accessible to all stakeholders.

The CCC implementation process is based on principles such as cc-creation, innovation and multi-stakeholder and citizen engagement. This approach ensures that the city's efforts towards climate neutrality are systemic and demand-driven, taking into account the needs and perspectives of all stakeholders. The process will also be based on monitoring and common learning, which will make it possible to continuously improve and adapt the plan if necessary.

To ensure inclusiveness, the city plans to publish an annual report on broadcasts, regularly offer civic participation workshops and make all documents available digitally in different languages, as well as in plain language. This will allow citizens to understand and engage in the process, thereby promoting transparency and accountability.

As a model for its citizens and its region, the city of Differdange is committed to ensuring transparency in the collaboration between municipal services. This will facilitate a coordinated approach to achieving climate neutrality, ensuring that all actions are aligned and contribute to the overall goal.

In summary, the principles and process that guide the CCC of the city of Differdange are based on inclusion, transparency and cc-creation, ensuring that all stakeholders are engaged in the journey towards climate neutrality. By adopting a systemic and demand-driven approach, the city aims to become a model for other cities in the region and the nation.
