# Introduction

At a crucial moment in the global response to climate-related emergencies, the EU is committed to leading climate action and has set the targets and legislation to achieve this. Thus, the EU must reduce its emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and achieve climate neutrality by mid-century. In this context, cities have a key role to play, both to accelerate the decarbonisation process and to ensure a fair and equitable transformation that contributes to the well-being of society as a whole.

Cities, despite occupying only around 3% of the earth's surface, generate more than 70% of greenhouse gas emissions and consume more than 65% of global energy. And it is important that they act as centres of experimentation and innovation in the transition to climate neutrality.

The EU Mission "100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" aims to support the transformation of cities to accelerate the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and to be both a catalyst and driver for the implementation of the European Green Deal, and a demonstrator that it is possible to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

In Spain, on 8 September 2021, the Government of Spain and the City Councils of Barcelona, Madrid, Seville and Valencia signed the Declaration "Climate Neutral Cities in 2030" (annexed to this document), as a boost to the commitments and initiatives of the signatory cities and as government support for the transformation of these cities to achieve climate neutrality and improve their resilience. Following the path opened, the City Councils of Soria, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza adhered to the Declaration on 13 December.

In addition, on 15 September 2021, the Plenary of the Senate approved a motion urging the Government to push for climate neutrality of cities in the framework of the European Cities Mission. The motion recognises the fundamental role of cities in the response to the climate emergency and highlights the opportunity to accelerate the necessary and cross-cutting changes to make cities climate neutral by 2030. It also values that the different territorial administrations promote and facilitate the climate neutrality of Spanish cities through their incorporation into the Mission of Cities and through the development of transformation projects.

Climate City Contract - Madrid 4
Climate City Contract - Madrid 5

In this regard, on 25 November 2021, the Cities Mission launched a call for expression of interest addressed to European cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants interested in participating. Of the 377 that applied, 100 were selected from the EU-27, including the Spanish cities of Barcelona, Madrid, Seville, Valencia, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza.

The Mission Implementation Plan foresees that each of the 100 selected cities will develop a City Climate Neutral Contract adapted to its own reality, through a process of co-creation and in close collaboration with the whole of civil society and citizens, detailing the strategy for the deployment and monitoring of innovative and digital solutions to achieve climate neutrality; and enabling other cities to follow their example by 2050. This document thus constitutes a clear political commitment, not only to the European Commission and national, regional and local authorities, but also to the public, and includes a comprehensive climate action plan in the different sectors, such as energy, buildings, waste management and transport, together with corresponding investment plans.

In this way, this document responds to the requirements of the European Cities Mission. It has been prepared by the city, with the participation of other public and private actors, and sets out plans to achieve climate neutrality.

In particular, it recognises that the Mission cannot succeed without being firmly anchored in the local community and garnering broad support. It therefore involves civil society, youth groups, cultural institutions and creative sectors, foundations, local media, small and medium-sized enterprises, private industry, trade unions, academia and research, and the public sector, among others, in their respective roles as decision-makers, users, consumers, producers and owners.

Furthermore, it integrates the city's own qualities and heritage, which guarantee the local dimension of the transition to climate neutrality, but also its inclusive character, in line with the values of the New European Bauhaus (art/culture, sustainability, society). It fosters a sense of ownership and ownership by the city's inhabitants and professional actors, showing that their unique contribution is relevant and that the fulfilment of this Climate City Contract will result in a better quality of life and a better environment for all.

On the other hand, it is configured in the framework of an iterative process, as a document that will be subject to monitoring and updating, both through the signing of
Climate City Contract - Madrid 6

addenda and other accession documents, thus bringing together other actors necessary for the city to achieve the established goal of climate neutrality. In particular, the commitments contained therein may be expanded or updated to effectively contribute to the achievement of climate neutrality in the city.

The document is divided into several parts: one concerning the cities' commitment to achieve climate neutrality in the city; another concerning the institutional support and coordination of the different public administrations; another part concerning its monitoring and updating; and a final part comprising the annexes corresponding to the Climate Action Plan, the City Climate Investment Plan and the City Stakeholders and Commitments, which follow the models elaborated by NetZeroCities¹.

# Commitment of the city of Madrid to climate neutrality

## Introduction

Madrid has shown its commitment and involvement in international initiatives of collaboration and leadership of cities in the fight against Climate Change since the first meetings that gave rise to the creation of C40 network, in October 2005 in London, developing since then and continuously developing activity in the prevention and fight against climate change. It is worth mentioning some milestones such as the approval by the Municipal Plenary of the adhesion to the Covenant of Mayors (Covenant of Mayors²), in November 2008, obliging it to exceed the target set by the European Union (EU) to reduce GHG emissions by 20% by 2020. Subsequently, in July 2014, the Plenary agreed to approve the adhesion of Madrid City Council to the Mayors Adapt initiative (Mayors Adapt³). In September 2014, the Compact of Mayors initiative⁴ was presented at the United Nations Climate Summit, to which the city of Madrid adhered, with the aim of committing cities to reduce their GHG emissions, making public their plans and objectives for mitigation and adaptation to climate change, as well as their annual monitoring, using a common methodology for the inventory of emissions at the urban scale. Subsequently, in 2018, Madrid City Council adheres to the 'Deadline 2020⁵' commitment promoted by the Cities Climate Change Leadership Network - C40, by which it commits to develop an action plan.

In this last legislature, climate action has been intensified to respond to the urgent need to face this global challenge and to align municipal strategies with the context of European policies in this area. Among various commitments made by Madrid City Council, we highlight the adoption, by the Plenary in September 2019, of the Declaration of Climate Emergency and the active involvement of our city as the venue for COP25. Also in 2019, the city of Madrid presented the Environmental Sustainability

Climate City Contract - Madrid 7
Climate City Contract - Madrid 8

Strategy Madrid 360⁶, drawn up with the aim of combating climate change and complying with the air quality limits established by European Union legislation and the recommendations of the World Health Organisation, a target achieved by 2022. The Strategy is comprehensive in nature, covering all emission sources and all districts of the city, improving air quality through three pillars of transformation: the city, mobility and government. In 2020, the Municipal Plenary approved membership of the Climate-KIC community of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, which incorporates the systemic vision and the need to establish a multi-actor collaboration in Madrid as a demonstrator city of the Deep Demo programme "Healthy, clean cities", principles that will later be reflected in the concept of the Mission of Cities. In Acuerdos de la Villa, approved unanimously by all political parties of the municipal corporation and aimed at reactivating Madrid after the effects of the pandemic, the need to develop a climate action roadmap is included. As a result of this unanimous agreement and within the framework of the Madrid 360 Strategy, the 'Roadmap to climate neutrality by 2050' was drawn up⁷, which was officially presented by the Mayor in March 2021.

The Roadmap to Climate Neutrality is a technical analysis to support political commitment to action on Climate Change. The Roadmap aligns municipal policies with national and European policies, and raises the ambition required for cities that want to be at the forefront of this global movement. The Roadmap sets the goal of reducing Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) by 65% by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels), and achieving climate neutrality by 2050, as well as increasing city resilience to climate risks. This complex challenge cannot be addressed by acting on emission sources alone. It requires a social transformation and a paradigm shift in the way we build, govern and inhabit a city. Incorporating collaboration between administrations and internal interdepartmental coordination through a "Clima group", as well as establishing the basis for collaborative and social participation of multiple actors, are key factors in unlocking a true and profound transformation.

In this sense, the European Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission represents a unique opportunity for the city of Madrid in its objective to accelerate its decarbonisation, identifying three main motivations:

Climate City Contract - Madrid 9

The concept of "Mission" provides an inspirational cohesive force towards transformational change that can be adopted by public bodies, large corporations and SMEs alike, academia, as well as each and every citizen.
The Mission constitutes a larger framework than the usual local project cycles in terms of time and scale, necessary to address complex challenges involving systemic change in a large city.
The Mission provides innovative tools such as climate city contracts, financing schemes and communication elements, offering a whole set of resources to articulate a new way of doing things for climate policy development.

These three factors - commitment, joint learning and new planning and implementation tools - will form a solid basis for increasing climate ambition towards neutrality by 2030 on an honest and credible pathway.

Finally, it is important to highlight that the City of Madrid is working to combine existing assets to put in place a strategic process, guided by the ambitious objectives of the Roadmap to Climate Neutrality, in conjunction with the other policies, strategies and regulations that can be found in the climate action plan of this Climate City Contract, reflected in table A-2.1 of Annex I.

Also noteworthy is the city's participation in the National Platform of Spanish cities for climate neutrality CitiES2030, a project promoted by the Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge through the Biodiversity Foundation, as well as in the European network NetZeroCities (NZC) and the work on a portfolio of transformative projects connected to climate mitigation and adaptation actions.

This Climate City Contract is a living and evolving document that seeks to establish the main objectives, priorities and key principles for achieving climate neutrality in the city of Madrid. In this way, it maintains the city's commitment to continue working and improving the plans and actions already underway.
Climate neutrality target for 2030

The targets committed by Madrid City Council in the Roadmap towards climate neutrality are to reduce Greenhouse Gases (GHG) by 65% by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels), and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Being chosen as a "Mission" city by the European Commission is an important boost to accelerate the transformation process and achieve these goals ahead of the time initially set for the city as a whole, through the creation of areas and environments where climate neutrality will be a reality by 2030. In addition, the Roadmap to Climate Neutrality envisages an even more ambitious "extended scenario" in its reduction targets for 2030 whose technical, economic and social feasibility would only be possible with a Climate City Contract that puts in place innovative transformative tools and mechanisms. This Climate City Contract initiates avenues to explore how such an 'extended scenario' could be developed, so that the city can set more ambitious targets on the decarbonisation of its systems.

Madrid's vision towards climate neutrality in the context of the Mission focuses on the social dimension as the main driver of change, creating large areas with specific geographical boundaries where all sectors and systems have been transformed and where neutrality can be perceived as a lived experience. In this sense, the Mission provides the necessary systemic approach of actions coming together at one level and strengthens the character of equity and social inclusion by prioritising the concept of achieving the goals of neutrality by and for citizens.

The city of Madrid has a surface area of 60,445.5 hectares and 3,286,662 inhabitants (as of 1 January 2022), which is equivalent to an average density of 54 inhabitants per hectare, making it the most populated city of all the cities participating in this European initiative. Due to the size and complexity of our city, the Mission is approached at three levels of intervention with specific actions on environments that, although they have a delimited geographical scope, have special characteristics that extend their potential impact to the whole of the municipality:

+ New climate-neutral urban developments. A new way of making the city of the future by integrating climate innovation into urban design and management.

Climate City Contract - Madrid 10
↑

+ Generation of a new culture of citizens of the future through intervention in educational centres and zero-emission university campuses, which will attract talent and enable progress towards a society with greater knowledge and commitment in the face of this global challenge.

+ A network of facilities and public space that act as climate-neutral nodes for the transformation and regeneration of the consolidated city, promoting a shift towards a more natural, more cohesive city with a higher quality of life.

Annually, Madrid City Council publishes the 'Inventory of greenhouse gas emissions'⁸ which allows monitoring the evolution of emissions on the path towards neutrality. Although the trend in recent years is clearly downward, it is necessary to accelerate the pace of emissions abatement to meet the targets set by the city and to complement the strategies in place with innovative approaches to the development of climate action.

Climate impacts are becoming increasingly complex due to the interaction and cascading effects of multiple extreme events. Accelerating climate change mitigation and adaptation plans and measures in the city of Madrid will ensure the health of citizens, as well as the transition to more sustainable lifestyles, improving living conditions while strengthening economic activity.

The path towards neutrality implies an evolution of many of the current urban models and a social and economic transformation. In this process, the importance of co-benefits associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation actions should be highlighted. In addition to the reduction of climate impacts, there are the multiple benefits they provide, from the improvement of air quality, the protection of ecosystems and urban biodiversity, the functionality of public spaces, the stimulation of local economies and green employment, as well as benefits associated with a reduction of costs in the management of water, energy, waste, risk insurance, among a host of other effects.

# Strategic priorities and interventions

The City of Madrid approaches the Mission with a systemic vision of the whole city and with three priority strategic interventions:

+ New climate-neutral city developments - The main exponent already underway is the Madrid Nuevo Norte area, with the vision of becoming the largest urban development with an electrified energy model (zero emissions) in Europe, and whose experience is transferable to other urban areas and nodes of economic activity. This urban regeneration project (3.3 km²) proposes a new form of urban planning that integrates climate innovation in terms of technology and nature-based solutions from the design phase and within a strong public-private partnership. With the Mission's support, the experience could be extended to other urban projects.

+ New culture for the citizens of the future, through the intervention in university campuses and schools transformed into climate-neutral environments. Students are the ones who will shape cities as future prescribers, and the generation of talent and research capacity in the key aspects of the energy transition towards neutral models constitutes a strategic intervention of the first order. Madrid is home to the largest university population in Spain and is home to three large campuses (6.5 km²) whose transformation has a significant direct impact. Strengthening the city-university binomial to foster new mindsets in all disciplines is a major driver of transformation in Mission Madrid.

+ The transformation and regeneration of the consolidated city with facilities, public space and other public facilities, acting as nodes of neutrality in which the action of the administration connects with other urban actors on the territory through actions such as energy communities, participatory design of environments, shared modes of mobility, etc., also integrating private partners in business districts and taking advantage of the momentum created by the Mission. A catalysed intervention from the City Council with multiple accelerated transformation centres spread across the city will drive neighbourhood regeneration and decarbonisation.

Climate City Contract - Madrid 12
Climate City Contract - Madrid 13

These strategic interventions are coherent with and integrated into the local climate action policy defined by the Madrid 360 Environmental Sustainability Strategy and the technical document of the Roadmap towards climate neutrality of the city of Madrid that derives from it. Furthermore, the whole of the Madrid Mission towards climate neutrality and, in particular, these interventions in which close collaboration between administrations is essential, have the backing of the Community of Madrid through the Decarbonisation and Environmental Care Plan and the forthcoming Energy, Climate and Air Strategy Horizon 2030. Mission Madrid cannot be understood in isolation from the regional context.

Systemic intervention in these areas of climate neutrality implies a paradigm shift in the way actions are addressed, moving away from the traditional sectoral approach and tackling current models holistically, focusing on changing patterns of use to reduce emissions at source. In this way, interventions are analysed with an 'Avoid-Change-Improve' philosophy:

+ Avoiding emissions: proximity urban planning, creation of low-emission areas of special protection, rehabilitation and energy efficiency, reduction of forced travel, waste minimisation, among others.
+ Shifting to less polluting options and solutions: such as electrification of energy demand in different sectors, boosting active mobility by expanding the cycling and pedestrian network, or promoting the use of zero-emission public transport.
+ Improve through technological development to minimise the impact of the solutions adopted: decarbonisation of the electricity system through renewable sources distributed within the municipality or improving and electrifying the vehicle fleet.

This perspective is embodied in transformative projects that cut across different sectors and levers of change. These projects, which are integrated into the climate neutrality action plan, connect usually isolated visions and disciplines, catalysing a transformation of the entire field.
Climate City Contract - Madrid 14

This requires an unprecedented effort to work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders to connect the interests and motivators of citizens, the private sector, academia and administrations in the city of Madrid.

## Principles and process

The city of Madrid has established key principles that guide its Roadmap towards climate neutrality and reinforce its role as a model of experimentation and innovation:

+ Climate governance. On the basis of a solid political mandate that makes climate neutrality a priority "city project" and transversal to all municipal actions, a process of revision and updating of regulations and administrative tools (urban planning regulations, tax ordinances, environmental ordinances, price tables, contracting instructions, etc.) has been initiated to create a regulatory environment favourable to the achievement of the objectives of neutrality and adaptation. Thus, for example, the new Air Quality and Sustainability Ordinance (2021) creates the figure of Climate Action Demonstration Areas, in which measures will be intensified to advance climate neutrality objectives, with the environments selected by the Madrid Mission (Madrid Nuevo Norte and University Campuses) being the first targets. The appropriate coordination of climate action in the set of municipal policies is structured through an interdepartmental "Climate" Knowledge Community, composed of senior officials from different areas of the city government, such as Culture, Urban Planning, Economy and Innovation, Internationalisation, Finance and Human Resources, led by the Environment and Mobility Area, in which there is a specific unit (SG Energy and Climate Change) with dedicated technical staff. This knowledge community, supported by a specific programme of the Municipal Training School, provides not only a space for collaboration, but also for reflection and learning.

+ Innovative monitoring and transparency. Madrid is developing the 'e-Mission' tool for advanced diagnosis, simulation and evaluation of GHG emission source scenarios in the city. This platform complements the emissions inventory by providing information on GHG emissions with greater territorial granularity (scale of the 131 neighbourhoods into which the municipality of Madrid is
Climate City Contract - Madrid 15

divided) and over time (quarterly updates) from the main sources of emissions in the city (mobility, residential sector and services). This facilitates the evaluation and simulation of the impact of municipal actions with a greater degree of detail and the comparative territorial analysis of emission trends. It is an innovative tool with an open interface for citizens to monitor Madrid's Mission towards climate neutrality. In addition, for the Climate Action Demonstrator Areas, "digital twins" will be generated in collaboration with the Digital Office of the City Council and private actors, with the aim of digitising the main energy flows and generating new avenues of collaboration in the development of citizen science initiatives associated with the real experience of neutral environments.

+ Participation and social dimension. Madrid faces the challenge of climate neutrality as an eminently social challenge, as it is not technology but people with their actions and decisions that can bring about a transformation with the scale and urgency required. An exclusively technological vision can increase social and territorial inequalities, generating a "climate divide" that prevents certain social sectors from accessing low-emission urban solutions and systems. To guarantee the equity and inclusiveness of climate action, the Mission Madrid process incorporates a work scheme based on processes of approaching and listening to the social reality through joint work with the districts, channels of participation for the different projects driving neutrality and collaboration with entities specialised in social action (Red Cross, Oxfam, Porticus, EAPN, Cáritas). On the other hand, and with regard to the variable of adaptation to the effects of climate change, which is closely linked to the Mission of neutrality, the consideration of groups with special vulnerability to, for example, increased temperatures and heat waves, plays an important role in the risk assessment measures and action plans.

+ Talent. The city of Madrid has the ambition to become a knowledge and learning hub for climate action and has already gained valuable experience, generating a university-city binomial through collaborations with the Academy (Climate-KIC Deep DEMO). As activation tools, Madrid has proposed priority intervention on zero-emission university campuses, to generate environments where climate neutrality can be experienced first-hand, and a programme for the creation of Climate Innovation Mission Chairs to accompany this process towards campus neutrality. The role of the university is not limited to scientific-
Climate City Contract - Madrid 16

technical innovation, but also includes social innovation actions in which the student community, in their role as citizens-prescribers of the future, connect and activate the processes of communication, awareness and citizen involvement.

+ Networking. The city of Madrid has always made clear its conviction that it is essential to learn from each other if we want to go far and go fast as circumstances demand. Based on existing alliances, agreements and public-private collaboration spaces that link companies, public institutions and society (e.g. Madrid Futuro, energy companies, Foro de Empresas por Madrid, etc.), the creation of a Local Climate Action Platform with companies, social agents and other relevant urban actors is proposed in order to bring together commitments and projects that generate synergies in the city in a rigorous and verifiable way. Furthermore, the global and complex dimension of the climate crisis requires that this networking should not be limited to the local sphere, and it is essential to connect with other cities to share knowledge and experience. In this sense, Madrid is part of the "Collaboration Platform for the Climate Neutrality of Spanish Cities" (citiES 2030) promoted by the Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, and has extensive experience in international initiatives such as the C40 Cities Leadership Group, the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy or the Eurocities network, as well as participation in European research, technological development, demonstration and innovation projects.

# Government of Spain's support for climate neutrality in Mission cities

Through the Declaration signed by the Third Vice-President of the Government and Minister for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, which is annexed to this document, the Government of Spain expresses its commitment to the transformation process of the city selected by the European Commission on 28 April 2022 to participate in the European Cities Mission.

# Support of the Autonomous Community of Madrid for the climate neutrality of the city of Madrid

For its part, the Government of the Autonomous Community of Madrid, as a key player in the multilevel governance necessary to achieve the goal of a climate neutral, inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable city, has demonstrated its ambition in the transition towards climate neutrality in the region through the Decarbonisation and Environmental Care Plan and the forthcoming Energy, Climate and Air Strategy Horizon 2030.

Mission Madrid cannot be understood in isolation from the regional context. The support and specific commitments of the Autonomous Community towards the climate neutrality of the city of Madrid is reflected in the joint action on the portfolio of transformative projects that require this multi-level coordination, such as Madrid Nuevo Norte, as an example of urban development with zero direct emissions, urban-peri-urban mobility strategies or the generation of green infrastructure to bring nature closer to citizens by connecting Regional Parks and other natural spaces to the urban core to promote, conserve and protect biodiversity.
Climate City Contract - Madrid 18

# Monitoring, updating and amending the Climate City Contract and its Annexes

This document and its Annexes, which form an integral part of it, are configured in the framework of an iterative process, as a dynamic and flexible document that will be subject to monitoring, updating and modification in order to review and adjust the commitments, actions and/or investments necessary to achieve the City's climate neutrality objectives.

The signatories undertake to monitor, at least every two years, the progress of the commitments undertaken in this Climate City Contract and its Annexes and to update them accordingly.

# Supporting statement of National Government for the climate neutrality of Spanish Mission Cities

I hereby place on record the Spanish Government's commitment to support the climate city contracts presented by the cities, which were selected by the European Commission on 28 April 2022 to participate in the European Cities Mission: Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, Valencia, Zaragoza, Valladolid and Vitoria-Gasteiz.

This support contributes to the ecological and energy transformation of cities and to a greater climate and social resilience, which is materialised in the Spanish State's framework of competences, among others, in the following aspects:

The impulse of a regulatory framework aligned with the systemic innovation and public-private collaboration required by the European Mission of Cities. In this context, it highlights:

+ The Spanish Urban Agenda, approved in February 2019, which highlights the need to achieve sustainability in urban development policies. It is constituted as a working method and a process for all the actors involved in cities that aspire to an equitable, fair and sustainable development from the different fields of action. This strategy is developed around 30 specific objectives and 291 action lines, which includes all villages and cities regardless of size and population, and it addresses economic, social and environmental sustainability.

+ Law 7/2021, of 20 May, on climate change and energy transition. This institutional framework guarantees, through its various measures, the coordination of sectoral policies, ensures coherence between them and synergies to achieve the objective of climate neutrality, and increases our capacity to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.
↑

The work commitment on the regulatory developments of the Law is clear. Due to the implications for the European Mission Cities, the following stand out: (i) in the energy field, work is being done to establish a framework to deploy energy efficiency in industries and buildings, and renewable energies as vectors towards decarbonisation, (ii) in terms of emission-free mobility, the mandate for cities to adopt sustainable urban mobility plans with mitigation measures, such as low-emission zones, is included, iii) in the area of green procurement, we are working to establish measures to integrate the fight against climate change in public procurement procedures, such as the inclusion of emission reduction and carbon footprint criteria specifically aimed at the fight against climate change as specific technical requirements in procurement specifications.

The launch of the Multi-stakeholder Collaboration Platform for the Climate Neutrality of Spanish Cities (citiES 2030), a tool created ad hoc and already in operation to facilitate the implementation of the Cities Mission.

With the implementation of this platform, the Government of Spain not only fulfils one of the initial activities of the Mission, but also becomes a reference for the other countries and cities in the programme.

This platform is a multi-stakeholder innovation and collaboration infrastructure to support and accelerate the transformation of Spanish cities towards climate neutrality.

The platform's main beneficiaries are city councils of Spanish cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants or provincial capitals that want to achieve full or partial climate neutrality by 2030, as well as cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants that want to initiate this process.

The platform offers cities a range of services, including:

+ Training, learning and skills enhancement
↑

+ The support for the development of local systemic innovation platforms for the design of transformative project portfolios;
+ The assistance in drafting and monitoring climate city contracts and the design of roadmaps in a multi-stakeholder environment;
+ The connection with related processes in other European cities; the incubation of multi-city projects; the citizen participation and activation;
+ The assistance to cities to structure transformation financing schemes, involving financial actors;
+ The strategic communication.

The Platform's governance is multi-stakeholder and multi-level, with the aim of facilitating, ordering and guaranteeing directionality and stability in these collaborations. In this way, it relies on the participation of the actors of the quintuple helix:

+ The public sector (administrations and public agencies).
+ The private sector (companies, financial sector, urban infrastructure sector and professional associations).
+ The academia (universities and research centres).
+ The civil society (NGOs and neighbourhood associations).
+ The media.
4

The support to mobilisation of green investments. A good example is the deployment of the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan through the mobilisation of an unprecedented volume of investment that prioritises not only mitigating the effects of the crisis, but also the transformation of our country towards a sustainable and inclusive economy.

The Recovery Plan recognises the fundamental role of cities in economic and social transformation, due to their capacity to generate short-term activity with a pull effect on industry and key sectors, and their importance in terms of the climate emergency. Thus, it includes initiatives aimed at essential aspects for the climate neutrality of cities, such as:

+ The improvement of sustainable mobility, with the promotion of electric and fuel cell vehicles and the extension of recharging infrastructures, through the different MOVES programmes.
+ The promotion of the renovation of urban residential environments, housing, buildings and neighbourhoods, with the priority objective of decreasing energy consumption and promoting decarbonisation in the household stock.
+ The development of energy communities that promote social innovation and citizen participation in renewables, energy efficiency and electric mobility, thereby contributing to fair and inclusive decarbonisation in urban areas.
+ The promotion of self-consumption for the energy use of urban roofs and decks, storage behind the meter and renewable HVAC in homes.
+ The development of transformative strategies and initiatives for urban renaturalisation, helping to increase green infrastructure and biodiversity in Spanish cities and favouring Nature-Based Solutions to respond to their socio-environmental challenges.
+ The support for the implementation of waste regulation, in collaboration with the autonomous communities and cities, with investments in
5

digitalisation for environmental management, through the Recovery Plan.

+ The deployment of calls for grants to municipalities and local entities for the implementation of low-emission zones in cities and the sustainable and digital transformation of urban transport.

The monitoring of the progress of the seven cities through the information processed in the citiES 2030 Platform, with the aim of integrating the urban transformation roadmap into the country's decarbonisation process.

As part of the iterative process of the European Cities Mission, the Spanish Government will participate in the monitoring and updating of the commitments made in the climate neutrality agreements of the cities of Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza, supporting the recognition and dissemination of the progress achieved.

# ANNEX 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan
MADRID

Introduction

The introduction should describe the local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and describe the gaps it addresses in general terms.

Madrid has shown its commitment and involvement in international initiatives of collaboration and leadership of cities in the policies of Climate Change since the first meetings that gave rise to the creation of C40 network, in October 2005 in London, since then continuously developing activity in the prevention and fight against climate change. It is worth mentioning some milestones such as the approval by the Municipal Plenary of the adhesion to the Covenant of Mayors in November 2008, obliging it to exceed the target set by the European Union (EU) to reduce GHG emissions by 20% by 2020. Subsequently, in July 2014, the Plenary agreed to approve the adhesion of Madrid City Council to the "Mayors Adapt" initiative. In September 2014, the Compact of Mayors initiative was presented at the United Nations Climate Summit, to which the city of Madrid adhered, with the aim of committing cities to reduce their GHG emissions, making public their plans and targets for mitigation and adaptation to climate change, as well as their annual monitoring, using a common methodology for an inventory of GHG emissions at urban scale. Subsequently, in 2018, Madrid City Council adheres to the 'Deadline 2020' commitment promoted by the Climate Change Leadership Network - C40, by which it commits to develop an action plan.

In this last legislature, climate action has been intensified to respond to the urgent need to face this global challenge and to align municipal strategies with the context of European policies in this area. Among various commitments made by Madrid City Council, we highlight the adoption, by the Plenary in September 2019, of the Declaration of Climate Emergency and the active involvement of our city as the venue for COP25. Also in 2019, the city of Madrid presented the Environmental Sustainability Strategy Madrid 360¹, drawn up with the aim of combating climate change and complying with the air quality limits established by European Union legislation and the recommendations of the World Health Organisation, a target achieved by 2022. The Strategy is comprehensive in nature, covering all sources of emissions and all districts of the city, improving air quality through three pillars of transformation: the city, mobility and government. In 2020, the Municipal Plenary approved membership of the Climate-KIC community of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, which incorporates the systemic vision and the need to establish a multi-actor collaboration in Madrid as a demonstrator city of the Deep Demo programme "Healthy, clean cities", principles that will later be reflected in the concept of the 'Mission'. In the Acuerdos de la Villa, approved unanimously by all political parties of the municipal corporation and aimed at reactivating Madrid after the effects of the pandemic, the need to develop a climate action roadmap is included. As a result of this unanimous agreement and within the framework of the Madrid 360 Strategy, the 'Roadmap to climate neutrality by 2050'² was drawn up and officially presented by the Mayor in March 2021.

MADRID

The Roadmap to Climate Neutrality is a technical analysis to support political commitment to action on Climate Change. The Roadmap aligns municipal policies with national and European policies, and raises the ambition required for cities that want to be at the forefront of this global movement. The Roadmap sets a target of reducing Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) by 65% by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels), and achieving climate neutrality by 2050, as well as increasing the city's resilience to climate risks. This complex challenge cannot be addressed by acting on emission sources alone. It requires a social transformation and a paradigm shift in the way we build, govern and inhabit a city.

In addition, the Roadmap to Climate Neutrality envisages a more ambitious "extended scenario" in its reduction targets for 2030 which, with a Climate City Contract that puts in place innovative transformative tools and mechanisms, would enable its technical, economic and social feasibility. This Climate City Contract initiates avenues to explore how such an 'extended scenario' could be developed, so that the city can set more ambitious targets on the decarbonisation of its systems, relying on a distributed leadership from all city stakeholder, with a particular engagement of citizens, as a key actor for the urban transformation.

Some of the key factors for unlocking deep transformation are the incorporation of inter-administration collaboration and internal interdepartmental coordination through working groups, as well as the establishment of the basis for collaborative and social multi-stakeholder participation, with specific focus on citizen engagement and assuring a just transition (including vulnerable communities and leaving no one behind).

In terms of meeting emissions targets, Madrid has limited powers to manage and implement improvement actions at the city's airports, and technological advances to reduce emissions in aviation are slower than in other areas. Therefore, although we will maintain the calculation of emissions from SNAP 0805 (Non-Road Transport - Air Transport Sector) in our annual Emission Inventory, we will exclude all emissions from this sector from the outset.

However, we are already working with IBERIA, the main airline operating out of Madrid airport and other airport operators, to work on reducing emissions and implementing new policies. The airline has already shown support for the city of Madrid in its expression of interest in joining the Mission and in this Climate City Contract reiterates that support with a letter of support.

The path towards neutrality implies an evolution of many of the current urban models and a social and economic transformation. In this process, the importance of co-benefits associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation actions should be highlighted. In addition to the reduction of climate impacts, there are multiple benefits they provide, from the improvement of air quality, the protection of ecosystems and urban biodiversity, the functionality of public spaces, the stimulation of local economies, as well as benefits associated with a reduction of costs in the management of water, energy, waste, risk insurance, among a host of other effects.

This Climate City Contract must be a living and evolving document, so that key priorities and principles can be shaped by trend analysis to ensure climate neutrality in the city. Madrid faces the challenge of climate neutrality as an eminently social challenge as it is not technology but people with their actions and decisions that can bring about a transformation with the scale and
MADRID

urgency required. An exclusively technological vision can increase social and territorial inequalities, generating a "climate divide" that prevents certain social sectors from accessing low-emission urban solutions and systems. To guarantee the equity and inclusiveness of climate action, Mission Madrid process incorporates a work scheme based on processes of approaching and listening to the social reality working with the districts, also with channels of participation for the different projects driving neutrality and through collaboration with entities specialised in social action (Red Cross, Oxfam, Porticus, EAPN, Caritas, among others) that need to be promoted.

# Work process

This section should list the actions undertaken or planned, as well as outline the timetable and milestones for future iterations for the continued development of the Action Plan.

The City of Madrid approaches the Mission with a systemic vision of the whole city and with three priority strategic interventions:

New climate-neutral city developments - The main exponent already underway is Madrid Nuevo Norte area, with the vision of becoming the largest urban development with an electrified energy model (zero emissions) in Europe, and whose experience is transferable to other urban areas and nodes of economic activity. This urban regeneration project (3.3 km2) proposes a new form of urban planning that integrates climate innovation in terms of technology and nature-based solutions from the design phase and within a strong public-private partnership. With the Mission's support, the experience could be extended to other urban projects.
New culture for the citizens of the future through the intervention in university campuses and schools transformed into climate-neutral environments. Students are the ones who will shape cities as future prescribers and the generation of talent and research capacity in the key aspects of the energy transition towards neutral models constitutes a strategic intervention of the first order. Madrid is home to the largest university population in Spain and has three large campuses (6.5 km2) within its municipal boundaries, the transformation of which has a significant direct impact. Strengthening the city-university binomial to foster new mindsets in all disciplines is a major driver of transformation in Mission Madrid.

To this end, Madrid is already working on a pilot project around Campus Sur of the Technical University of Madrid (UPM) on the promotion of a new mobility model focused on active mobility, cycling and pedestrian network, as the beginning of the transformation of a zero-emissions campus. In this way, the project will work with the educational community, faculty and students to learn about their vision and enrich the project with their experiences as users of the campus. In addition, there is a secondary school and a special education centre in the area, which will also be included in the participation process.

The transformation and regeneration of the consolidated city with facilities, public space, and other public facilities acting as nodes of neutrality in which the action of the
MADRID

administration connects with other urban actors on the territory through actions such as energy communities, participatory design of environments, shared modes of mobility, etc., also integrating private partners in business districts and taking advantage of the momentum created by the Mission. An intervention catalysed by the City Council with multiple accelerated transformation centres spread across the city will drive neighbourhood regeneration and decarbonisation.

These strategic interventions are coherent with and integrated into the local climate action policy defined by the Madrid 360 Environmental Sustainability Strategy and the technical document of the Roadmap towards climate neutrality for the city of Madrid that derives from it.

After signing this Climate City Contract, it is expected that the city will be able to work on establishing a local platform that involves all the actors present in the city (academia, private sector, citizens and other public administrations) through which synergies and collaborative projects can be found to work on the decarbonisation of the city. With the progress of this platform it will be possible to complete the first iteration of this document in a way that adjusts and aligns the levers and measures established here.

In addition, we have recently noticed about the selection of the project 'Multi-stakeholder innovative &amp; systemic solutions for urban regeneration: Spain' in which Madrid participates within the Mission's Pilots call. This project consolidates the framework to initiate in 2023 the lines of work related to new energy and regeneration models through a collaborative model between the seven Spanish cities participating in the Mission.

Apart from that, in April 2022 the update of the 'Roadmap towards climate neutrality in the city of Madrid' was published, which established, among other things, the definition of a series of indicators that will allow us to track and monitor the levers and measures. An analysis of these indicators is carried out annually and a report is produced showing the results and trends. Based on these results, it is expected that the actions and measures established can be adapted to ensure their effectiveness.

In the course of this first iteration of the Climate City Contract, it is also expected that this 'Roadmap' can be updated in a way that seeks to integrate the social character in each lever and measure with the aim of ensuring equity and inclusiveness. A working group has been set up with the participation of social organisations such as Oxfam, Save the Children, Porticus, EAPN, Fuhem, among others, with the aim of reviewing the Roadmap from a social perspective, learning from their experience and work and connecting initiatives that multiply the inclusive transformation of the city. This group will work for a year to address the review but will have continuity through specific projects to ensure a just transition.

PART A - CURRENT STATE OF CLIMATE ACTION
MADRID

This module contains the city's starting point towards climate neutrality and informs subsequent modules and outlined pathways to accelerate climate action.

# MODULE A-1

## Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

Detail and describe the latest GHG inventory of the city to establish the baseline emissions and to establish the emissions gap towards climate neutrality in 2030 (according to the inventory format established by the Mission Briefing Kit and the process described in the Action Plan Guidance).

Since 1999, Madrid City Council has been carrying out an annual inventory of pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, following the EMEP/CORINAIR methodology, a project coordinated by the European Environment Agency, which integrates the inventories of practically all European countries, and which meets the requirements established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Working Group on Atmospheric Emission Inventories and Projections of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.

This inventory is a fundamental instrument for the definition and monitoring of municipal policies and plans relating to climate change and air quality, as it establishes the basis for the cost-benefit analysis of emission reduction measures and the definition of measures to minimise pollution load.

Also, as part of the EIT Climate-KIC Deep Demonstration programme carried out in Madrid in 2020 as a demonstration city, an economic model was developed to identify the most profitable decarbonisation strategies for the city. This model developed by Material Economics has served as the basis for the development of a common tool for the seven cities of the Spanish Platform for Climate Neutrality, citiES2030. Adapted in order to be used to complete different tables of the Climate Climate City Contract, this model uses a life-cycle approach to assess the economic viability of different decarbonisation strategies. This means that not only upfront costs are taken into account, but also the recurring costs and benefits of each option over its entire lifetime. In addition, the model takes into account the various costs associated with decarbonisation, such as the cost of renewable energy deployment, the cost of energy efficiency measures and the cost of changes in transport systems, among others.

The economic model for decarbonising cities is a useful tool for cities to develop strategies to reduce their emissions. By combining the emissions inventory with the costs and benefits provided by the Economic Model associated with different decarbonisation actions and strategies, the city can develop a comprehensive understanding of its emissions profile and identify the most cost-effective and efficient ways to reduce its carbon footprint.

Both the economic model and the emissions inventory aim to provide the information to develop effective strategies and actions to reduce GHG emissions and improve energy efficiency. While they
MADRID

use different approaches for calculating emissions, both tools are useful for making the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future.

Thus, although both instruments share certain similarities, the Economic Model and the emissions inventory estimate GHG emissions differently. These different approaches in calculating emissions result in a different quantification of the city's emissions between the two calculation methodologies. Although the final results are similar, the different approaches of the two methodologies result in two different emission inventories.

The Economic Model uses a "systems" approach to account for GHG emissions in cities. It looks at the entire urban system, including Buildings and Heating and Cooling, transport, electricity and waste, and identifies emission sources and pathways. The model takes into account not only Scope 1 emissions (such as from combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles, etc.), but also Scope 2 emissions (i.e. emissions from the generation of electricity purchased and consumed) and some Scope 3 emissions (from waste management, where this takes place outside the boundaries of the municipality).

Another difference between the two approaches is the level of detail. The Economic Model provides a complete picture of the urban system and how emissions are generated and flow through it. The Emission Inventory focuses more on specific sectors and follows a standardised format, which makes it easier to compare emissions between cities.

The Economic Model uses a Business as Usual 2030 scenario (BAU 2030) as a reference to estimate the potential emission reductions that can be achieved through different decarbonisation strategies and actions. This scenario represents a projection of what the city's emissions trajectory would look like if no additional decarbonisation measures beyond those already planned or underway were implemented. The BAU 2030 scenario provides a baseline against which to compare the cost-effectiveness of different decarbonisation strategies and actions. By comparing the costs and benefits of different decarbonisation pathways with the BAU 2030 scenario, the model can estimate the potential ROI (Return on Investment) of each strategy and action.

By considering the potential ROI of different decarbonisation strategies and actions, the Economic Model can help identify the most cost-effective pathways to achieve its emission reduction targets by ensuring that limited resources are allocated to strategies and actions that provide maximum value for the city and its residents.

In order to develop a comprehensive understanding of the city's emissions profile and identify the most cost-effective and efficient ways to reduce GHG emissions, Madrid Climate City Contract makes extensive use of the emissions data provided by the Economic Model, so that the investments, costs and benefits presented in the model are consistent with the emissions resulting from the model. Furthermore, and given that the emissions inventory represents the starting point for the emissions calculation of the economic model, it has been considered appropriate to include the first three tables of Annex I (Climate Action Plan) to present the emissions inventory data of the Madrid City Council. These are: A-1.1, A-1.2 and A-1.3.
MADRID

In addition, table A-1.4 is used to present the emissions resulting from the two calculation methodologies used, the emission inventory calculation methodology and the methodology used by the Economic Model. The rest of the quantitative tables of the model from table A-2.3 present data provided by the Economic Model.

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of the baseline GHG inventory → GHG Inventory 2019

The figure shows the evolution of total direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions over the entire inventory period 1999-2019, with a marked downward trend since 2005.

The second figure illustrates the evolution of the relevance of each compound in the direct emissions of the city of Madrid. As can be seen, carbon dioxide continues to be the most relevant pollutant, with an average contribution of 82% between 1999 and 2019. Methane and hydrofluorocarbons have seen their contribution decrease from values of 11-14% at their historical peaks to values of 4-6% in 2019.

The sectoral contribution to direct and indirect emissions can be seen in figures 3 and 4. In the case of direct emissions, the most significant differences are found in the road transport sector, whose contribution decreases from 40% in 1999 to 32% in 2019. On the other hand, the residential, commercial and institutional sector remains the sector with the highest contribution to indirect emissions.

Further details on the evolution of greenhouse gas emissions can be found in the inventory published annually on the Madrid City Council website: [GHG Emission Inventory](GHG Emission Inventory).

|  A-2.2: Description and evaluation of policies  |   |   |   |   |   |
|  At the local level, the Roadmap to Climate Neutrality for the City of Madrid in 2050 is the technical analysis to support the political commitment to action on Climate Change, published in March 2021. The Roadmap aligns municipal policies with national and European policies, and raises the ambition required for cities that want to be at the forefront of this global movement, because the objective of this Roadmap is to reduce Greenhouse Gases (GHG) by 65% by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels), and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, as well as to increase resilience to climate risks. The roadmap reflects a clear political commitment that provides the framework on which to develop the full range of transformative projects.

In the course of this first iteration of the Climate City Contract, the ambition is increased and it is also expected that the 'Roadmap' will be updated in a way that seeks to integrate the social character in each lever and measure with the aim of ensuring equity and inclusiveness. A working group has been set up with the participation of social organisations such as Oxfam, Save the Children, Porticus, EAPN, Fuhem, among others, to review the Roadmap from a social perspective, learning from their experience and work and connecting initiatives that multiply the inclusive  |   |   |   |   |   |
MADRID

transformation of the city. This group will work for a year to address the review but will have continuity through specific projects to ensure a just transition.

The Roadmap is supported by the city's strategic framework: Madrid 360: Environmental Sustainability Strategy. Madrid 360 operates as a strategy from 2019 with the aim of combating climate change and meeting the air quality limits set by EU legislation and the WHO. It covers all emission sources and all districts of the city, and will improve air quality through three pillars of transformation: the city, mobility and administration.

At the national level, the Spanish Urban Agenda, in accordance with the criteria established by the United Nations 2030 Agenda and the Urban Agenda for the European Union, establishes the strategic framework of the Madrid Urban Agenda that gives coherence to all areas of government and public policies of the city.

The National Strategy for Green Infrastructure and Connectivity and Ecological Restoration establishes a harmonised administrative and technical framework for the whole of Spain.

The National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan and the Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2021-2030 (PNAAC) are the basic planning instruments to promote coordinated action against climate change and its effects in Spain. They establish emission reduction targets, growth of renewable energies and main actions to build a more resilient economy and society.

Spain's Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan is part of the national plans to join the NextGenerationEU Recovery Plan for Europe. This plan will increase productivity and potential growth, moving towards a green, digital, inclusive Spain, with greater social and territorial cohesion and without gender gaps.

The Plan for the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience of the city of Madrid includes 105 transformative investments in key areas of urban action such as mobility, renewable and distributed energy generation, digital transformation of municipal services and businesses, increasing green areas and improving their conservation and ecological connectivity, neighbourhood regeneration and housing, without forgetting social cohesion, territorial rebalancing, attention to children and gender equality. With this Plan, the city is positioning itself for the opportunities offered by the European Next Generation EU Funding Framework.

Furthermore, at the regional level, the Autonomous Community of Madrid is preparing the 'Energy, Climate and Air Strategy Horizon 2030' in which it again shows ambition in the transition towards climate neutrality and will complement local and national plans.
MADRID

In addition to the Roadmap, two other important milestones that reflect the strength of the commitment to climate action are:

Declaration of climate emergency 2019: approved in plenary session of the city council.

Declaring a climate emergency showed the need of delivering real and binding political commitments, much more ambitious than the current ones, with a consequent much more ambitious than the current ones, consequent with the allocation of resources to address this crisis. A binding roadmap capable of guaranteeing the necessary annual greenhouse gas reductions, the abandonment of fossil fuels, the commitment to 100% renewable energy and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as a matter of urgency and priority.

Signing of the pre-Climate City Contract in 2021 with the Spanish government and the Mayor of the city, as a declaration of commitment to accelerate the city's climate neutrality and which seeks to have a tractor effect to accelerate its sustainable transition, an objective with which the European Commission aims to accelerate compliance with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda, and to become a catalyst element of the European Green Pact.

Some of the gaps that were identified during 2022 was that the 'Roadmap' needed to be review from a social perspective to integrate the social character in each lever and measure with the aim of ensuring equity and inclusiveness. That's why a working group was launched to set up with the participation of social organisations such as Oxfam, Save the Children, Porticus, EAPN, Fuhem, among others, to learn from their experience and work and connecting initiatives that multiply the inclusive transformation of the city.

Spain's energy sector is constantly evolving and requires an agile response from cities to adapt to these changes. Working on local regulations that reflect these changes and allow for progress in new consumption models, such as energy communities, seems essential on the road to decabonisation. The City Council has created the Sustainability Office that will work strategically to study a plan for the deployment of distributed energy in all the city and with the support of public-private collaboration (Madrid Solar) for the promotion of individuals. In addition, they will analyze the barriers and opportunities to carry it out and may need regulatory support and definition of new strategies to achieve the objectives.

There are some barriers expressed in A3-2 section that would prevent the implementation of the transformation projects. The city will work in the coming months on the following issues:

Analyze regulatory barriers to the development of transformative projects in the city. What is needed? what problems do we encounter in carrying them out around the initiatives and projects included in the Action Plan? (This involves identifying and defining in detail the different actions, initiatives and projects that form part of the Action Plan, with the aim of ensuring their financing and adequate implementation)
MADRID

In this line, the Madrid City Council has been working since 2019, with the support of the Technical University of Madrid (UPM), citiES 2030 and EIT Climate-KIC, on new ways to innovate in the administration through new tools such as the Regulatory Sandbox. A sandbox (also called a controlled testing space or experimentation area) incorporates new ideas through innovation, experiments and collaborative evaluations of regulatory options that make it possible to unlock and update regulatory frameworks at municipal, regional and state level to accelerate decarbonisation and other strategic objectives in the short and medium term. So a Sandbox is: (1) a space for collaborative learning, where a diversity of public, private, scientific and civic professionals think, speculate and test what the carbon neutral, healthier, smarter and more prosperous city of the future will look like; (2) a space for innovation that can lead to changes in regulatory frameworks applicable at city, regional and state level, with international learning. Regulatory changes that favour the city's strategic objectives and plans are applicable beyond the temporal or geographical boundaries of the sandbox.

For this work, we have relied on the interdepartmental "Clima" group, together with the wide network of collaborators in the Madrid ecosystem. An analysis of policy barriers has been developed for the development of action plans to address them. Within this framework, we will develop contributions to the current process of modifying the Madrid City Council's Urban Development Regulations, led by the Urban Development Area. This has carried out a first iteration generating a series of modification proposals, which can be strengthened with new approaches and multidisciplinary perspectives. The regulatory sandbox team has selected some of them to facilitate an open process curated by experts in each field. The selected proposals. Among the main lines of work, we have identified the following:

MOBILITY: Transitional Destination of Plots of Land to impact on the aspects related to surface parking and the provision of spaces to facilitate the circular economy, in particular during construction works; Provision of Parking Services to impact on the decarbonisation of the city, promote sustainable and active mobility.
BUILDING: Built-up area per floor and overhangs and façade overhangs to influence the decarbonisation of the entire life cycle of buildings and promote sustainability.
GREEN SPACES: Green Factor and Open Space Development to maximise the contribution of open spaces to urban biodiversity, climate change adaptation and to improve rainfall management and microclimatic conditions; Endowment use of green spaces and urban gardens with a focus on green infrastructure, connectivity, biodiversity, natural water cycle and urban decarbonisation.
PUBLIC SPACE AND FACILITIES: Endowment Uses Collective Services and Infrastructure Services to impact on aspects related to the circular economy, distributed generation of renewable energy and zero emissions, self-consumption models and other emerging uses linked to sustainable lifestyles and consumption;
MADRID

Review in the definition, localised linkage in Equipments (any category), design conditions (greater naturalization of spaces, generating conditions to strengthen social life in general and the well-being of the most vulnerable groups, furniture and singularisation, etc), categories by surface or pavement width.

Analyse transformative projects weak points regarding regulatory issues in order to develop regulations and strategies that can strengthen those weaknesses.

For this task, broaden interdepartmental collaboration to advance the implementation of the Climate Investment Plan would help identifying some weaknesses. (Promotion of the interdepartmental Clima Group.)

In this line, the Madrid City Council has been working since 2019, with the support of the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, citiES 2030 and EIT Climate-KIC, on new ways to innovate in the administration through new tools such as the Regulatory Sandbox. In the following document (link) the team has made an extensive analysis of the sectoral work streams: water cycle, circular economy, biodiversity and maturation, energy and mobility; as well as cross-cutting levers of change: regulation, governance and management, technology and financing. In all these lines of action, it has been identified who has the municipal competence, what opportunities are foreseen in the short and medium term, and how these actions have synergies with Madrid's Climate Neutral Roadmap

See more information in the tool shown in this link.

As indicated at the beginning of Module A1, information has been taken from the following analyses for the completion of this document:

Greenhouse gas emissions inventory of the city of Madrid
Roadmap to climate neutrality for the city of Madrid
Study of the economic model for implementing the measures set out in the city's climate action plan (Roadmap to climate neutrality).

To fill in the following table showing the emissions gap, data from the study carried out on the Economic Model of the city of Madrid have been used.

As indicated in the expression of interest to be part of the Mission, due to the complexity and size of the city of Madrid, work will be done to accelerate the climate action plan published in 2021, which establishes a reduction of $65.3\%$ of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 values, which represents a $61\%$ reduction in the volume of tonnes compared to 2015. This offers residual emissions of 4.5 MKton $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$ (values indicated in 'Roadmap to climate neutrality for the city of Madrid' not included in the table as they are not part of the economic model).

The Roadmap towards climate neutrality contemplates a more ambitious "extended scenario" in its reduction targets for 2030, with residual emissions in 2030 of 3.4 MKton $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$. This
MADRID

scenario assumes a 75% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 values which, with a Climate City Contract that puts in place innovative transformative tools and mechanisms, would make it technically, economically and socially feasible.

Residual emissions will need to be addressed in subsequent iterations of the Climate City Contract and can be reduced, for example, by offsetting emissions through forest sinks, such as the municipal public-private partnership programme 'Madrid Compensa'³.

Residual emissions are emissions that cannot be reduced through climate action and are offset. Residual emissions can amount to a maximum of 20%, as indicated in the Mission Info Kit.
the target for emission reductions in the "Others" sector is assumed to be the same as in the other 4 sectors.

Thanks to the 'Economic Model' we are able to simulate a 75% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 values for the 'extended case'. In this way, by channelling the efforts of the Mission and putting in place transformative tools and mechanisms, the city should

## Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

Develop the results of the mapping of the climate action stakeholder ecosystem and the identification of systemic barriers and opportunities.

Barriers: understanding and mapping the main elements (infrastructure, capacities, processes, partnerships, funds) that could hinder the transition to climate neutrality.
Opportunities: understanding and mapping the main elements (infrastructure, capacities, processes, partnerships, funds) that could contribute to the transition to climate neutrality.
Create a participatory model for city climate neutrality (local platforms): stakeholder ecosystem, partnerships with stakeholders, with other areas of government, with the private sector, with citizens, with other cities, with academic or research and innovation institutions; stakeholder involvement and contribution to the development and implementation of the city's climate policy, etc.
Detect the existing connections and links with the actors that make up the system (all urban actors) and the main interests around which they collaborate.
Compare opportunities and barriers with your strategic objectives to understand how to establish the most favourable conditions (i.e. prepare the local system) for the implementation of the transition to climate neutrality.

# A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers

The Spanish regulatory framework, often considered excessively prescriptive and rigid, could be a barrier to the necessary innovation in the process of transition to reach neutrality. The lack of agility in the regulatory and administrative process prevents the incorporation of innovations of various kinds. Regulations are not easily and quickly adapted to the requirements of climate innovation, often becoming rapidly obsolete and preventing actions that could have a positive impact. Furthermore, it is necessary to strengthen the regulatory framework and its application in order to intensify the fight against the climate crisis.
MADRID

The public-private collaboration that is essential for the joint construction of new urban models and imaginaries is not sufficiently developed. There are few mechanisms that explore formulas for collaboration beyond contracting and sponsorship. There is a lack of formulas that allow for a systemic and continuous participation of all the agents involved in the areas of action. In terms of urban management procedures, the conventional formulas of sponsorship and patronage, combined with the limitations of public procurement, do not allow for the flexible public-private management of investments required for the transition to carbon neutrality.

The lack of financial mechanisms for the implementation of high-impact climate neutrality projects that combine private and municipal public funds can also be a constraint.

Citizen engagement is also critical for the fulfilment of the Mission. Progress must be made in mechanisms for citizen participation in climate policies, plans and actions. An example could be the need to disseminate climate objectives to society in non-expert language. In order to reduce the barrier of participation of marginalized group a working group was launched with the participation of social organisations such as Oxfam, Save the Children, Porticus, EAPN, Fuhem, among others, to learn from their experience and working together on emission reduction policies to ensure that all segments of the population are taken into account (leaving no one behind). It is a project finance by Porticus and in collaboration with itdUPM.

With regard to municipal management, the current centralised model is a barrier, where the processes of planning, design, execution and maintenance are not adequately coordinated, nor are they implemented in a transversal manner in the organisation. The inertia of working in silos and the compartmentalised distribution of competences is an impediment to the development of integral actions necessary in the processes of urban transformation towards neutrality.

Some opportunities of the city to support the planning for climate action plan are as follows:

There is an active interdepartmental and collaborative working group (Clima group) formed since 2020 that serves as a connection, communication between the different areas but also as a space for collaboration for new projects.
Thanks to our work in different European projects, we have established working methodologies that can be replicated as well as design criteria. We also have examples of public-private partnerships that work, so it is a matter of replicating examples already developed in the city, not reinventing the wheel (example: Madrid Nuevo Norte, Madrid Compensa, Madrid solar...etc).

As example of transformative european project, in 2019 the city joined the EIT Climate-KIC community's Deep Demonstration project with the commitment of the city to increase efforts to reach the inflection point towards climate neutrality. A first objective of this initiative has already been achieved, with the creation of the Clima Group, a multi-stakeholder forum involving a wide range of City technical officers that works on climate action from various fields.

The stakeholders involved in the Madrid Deep Demonstration are aware that accelerating climate innovation and action must have an important cultural dimension, rooted in the identity of Madrid as a dynamic, open city, with high life expectancy and quality of life and strong economic dynamism. The fight against climate change must be based on these characteristics.
MADRID

During these years, a set of strategic areas of action has been selected that make up a portfolio of experimentation in the city on which to work in the coming months. The execution of an experimentation portfolio requires connecting various projects and initiatives that, together, multiply their individual potential and have greater impact than they would on their own.

An intense work had been developed focused on:

Identification and mapping of the City's climate policies and strategic plans.
Connection with existing strategies and initiatives managed by collaborating partners: companies, local social organisations, other Madrid and national public administrations, universities and research centres, citizens, and other interest groups.
Alignment of the strategic experimentation portfolio with the current COVID-19 context.
Strategic work with various areas and departments of the Madrid City Council for the planning of the work and the forecast of financing.

The multi-stakeholder ecosystem in Madrid is active and willing to collaborate in new initiatives under the Mission.

# B-1.2: Description of the impact pathways

The city of Madrid in its 'Roadmap to climate neutrality' as impact pathways proposes measures for 5 sectors with 6 main axes. The systemic intervention in these areas of climate neutrality represents a paradigm shift in the way of approaching actions, which abandon the traditional sectoral approach, and comprehensively address the current models, focusing on changing patterns of use to reduce emissions at source. In this way, interventions are analysed with an 'Avoid-Change-Improve' philosophy:

Avoiding emissions: proximity urban planning, creation of low-emission and special protection zones, rehabilitation and energy efficiency, reduction of obligatory travel, waste minimisation, among others.
Shifting to less polluting options and solutions: such as electrification of energy demand in different sectors, boosting active mobility by expanding the cycling and pedestrian network or boosting the use of zero-emission public transport.
Improve through technological development to minimise the impact of the solutions adopted: decarbonisation of the electricity system through distributed generation from renewable sources, improving and electrifying the vehicle fleet.

In this case, in order to comply with table B-1.1 on impact pathways, the model of the economic case of the city of Madrid has been used, which is developed in 5 sectors and 14 subsectors or levers on which an estimate is made of the emissions to be abated and the investment necessary to develop it is quantified.
MADRID

According to the model, almost
%
of the emissions to be abated in 2030 correspond to three main sectors: Buildings and Heating/Cooling, transport and electricity, and specifically to 4 levers. If the city is able to work systemically in these three main sectors, it will succeed in transforming the city not only from a climate point of view but also from a social perspective.

# MODULE B-2

## Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

This section must contain a description of the project for each intervention envisaged, according to template B-2.1. Details of each action may be included in section B-2.2.

This section presents the projects that are considered transformative to be developed in the field of the Mission and that have a cross-cutting impact on different sectors and levers of change. They are proposed as projects that demonstrate a systemic transformation that connect visions and disciplines that are usually isolated, catalysing a transformation of the field as a whole by involving the different actors and stakeholders in these projects. They are co-creation projects related to climate action and serve as examples, not only to be scaled up to other levels of the city but also to replicate their models.

Each action is framed within a sector and the impact of each contributes to the success of the overall sector as detailed in the impact column in module C3.

|   |  Description of the action | Madrid Nuevo Norte is an urban intervention of unique magnitude that will transform a 5.6 km long strip of land and regenerate more than 2.3 million m².
The project arose from the need to integrate Chamartín station and all the railway facilities that depart from it into the city. For more than 50 years these infrastructures have created an enormous gap that has split the north of Madrid in two, causing many inconveniences for millions of citizens. This urban regeneration action will not only close this wound, solving problems of mobility, safety and lack of public services, but will also place Madrid among the group of cities that will be better able to face the great economic and social changes of the coming decades.  |
MADRID

|   |  | Madrid Nuevo Norte creates a new city model, based on the best practices of sustainable urban planning.
A dense, compact city that focuses on people, public space and sustainable mobility, where housing, offices, shops, green spaces and facilities blend and complement each other, creating the best environment for living, working and enjoying. Respecting the essence that makes our city so attractive, while enhancing its innovative and cosmopolitan character.
A city model that thinks of everyone, which has been designed in participatory processes that have allowed us to listen to the citizens to find out their different needs and the different uses that each one makes of their city.
The project is organised into 4 differentiated areas that will be developed through the compensation system with a particular urban sustainability regulation that makes it a benchmark in terms of sustainability, estimating that this regulation allows it to reduce by 20% the emissions expected by the new neighbourhood in 2030, with buildings that go beyond the concept of almost zero consumption buildings and with a mobility policy to promote sustainable mobility.
In addition, within this area one of the areas will be declared a **Climate Action Demonstration Area**, for which an Action Plan will be approved with the aim of developing a climate-neutral neighbourhood.  |

|   | Description of the action | The European Life-PACT project (2022-2025) provides an ideal framework for experimentation and exchange of experiences between the City of Madrid and the cities of Leuven and Krakow.

Through this project, the Madrid City Council, in collaboration with the Polytechnic University of Madrid and the Democratic Society, is exploring methodologies for the participation of school and neighbourhood communities in the co-design of naturalised school playgrounds and environments. This project contributes to the implementation of the Municipal Strategy for ‘intervention in school environments from the point of view of mitigation and adaptation to climate change’.

Specifically, two pilot projects are being developed in two nursery and primary schools in the neighbourhood of San Cristóbal de los Ángeles (Villaverde District). The selection of this location responds to several reasons: the high vulnerability to climate change and in particular to heat waves, drought and loss of biodiversity; the socio-economic profile of its neighbours, which makes them more susceptible to the impact of climate change and, specifically, of summer energy poverty; a fairly cohesive social fabric committed to the development and welfare of their environment. In the first year of the project, a social and climate diagnosis of the neighbourhood was carried out, led by Gea21, Surcos Urbanos and the ABIO research group of the Polytechnic University of Madrid. In addition, several workshops have been carried out with school communities, particularly with primary school students, using micro-interventions and creative writing methodologies. The aim was to gain in-depth knowledge of the dynamics of use of the space and to imagine a future scenario of a naturalised courtyard open to the community. This process was facilitated by three actors: Democratic Society, Basurama and the Children’s Assembly of the Mutant Institute for Environmental Narratives. This participatory  |
MADRID

|   |  | diagnosis and the resulting proposals have given rise to two preliminary projects. In 2023, two architectural and engineering firms are developing the pre-projects into implementation projects. They are also exploring the incorporation of more permeable materials with a lower carbon footprint. The works are planned for 2023 (demolition of perimeter walls and construction of more visually permeable fencing) and 2024 (naturalisation). As the spaces are expected to be open outside school hours, a sustainable plan for the use and maintenance of the spaces is being designed with the school and neighbourhood communities. To this end, co-management models between public administration and residents are being explored. This project is an important source of learning for the City Council from various points of view: strengthening interdepartmental and district work; closer contact with neighbours; experimenting with new methodologies and more creative solutions. From the point of view of citizenship, this project is helping to raise awareness among primary school children about climate change and its consequences, and making them agents of change in their own built environment. From a climate change mitigation and adaptation point of view, a more naturalised environment will contribute to reducing the heat island effect and sequestering more carbon.  |

|   | Description of the action | Funded by the Laudes Foundation since the beginning of 2021, the project aims to research and prototype solutions that reduce emissions in the construction sector. In particular, the project focuses on promoting circularity and the use of natural and low-carbon materials. This project is based on collaboration between representatives of the entire value chain of the construction sector and adopts a systemic approach to co-create and pilot a portfolio of interconnected multi-stakeholder projects. In particular, the initiative relies on two large local developments in Madrid and Milan as a testing ground to identify supply and demand barriers. The working methodology has adopted a collaborative approach, involving the different actors of the value chain in conversations for collective interpretation and co-creation of solutions. The ultimate goal of the project is to position cities as market makers for natural and circular sourced construction. The results of the first phase of this project include the following documents: 1. Report 'Mass Timber - An Option to Reduce Embodied Carbon in Buildings' by Material Economics, which sets out the reasons why building is a significant contributor to climate change and strategies (in terms of design choices and material selection) that could reduce the embodied carbon of buildings. In addition, the report proposes the use of wood as a cost-effective way to reduce emissions, analysing potential barriers and financial opportunities. Emission abatement cost model for buildings, developed by Material Economics. Aimed at a technical audience, the model includes 16 levers to estimate the cost of each tonne of carbon that can be avoided in a building project by adopting strategies linked to circularity and the use of naturally sourced materials. This tool can be useful for dialogue with banks, clients and investors by making visible the additional benefits of this type of construction compared to standard methods based on steel and concrete. 3. Analysis of financing instruments, prepared by Bankers without Boundaries. 4. Study of the Spanish demand for wood, prepared by Arup. 5. Analysis of the market for low-carbon materials and analysis of the end-of-life market, prepared by Arup for the Spanish case.  |

Analysis of the economic and environmental impact of construction with materials of natural origin, prepared by Dark Matter Labs, which presents structured data on the state of Spanish and EU forests and proposes scenarios of the socio-economic impact of increasing the production and use of wood from sustainable forests. It also presents examples of how to incorporate procurement clauses that encourage the use of wood in construction. The report, although addressed to a general audience, aims to influence national and European policies and regulations.

|  Action plan | Name of the action | Climate commitment  |
|   |  Type of action | Annual citizen involvement event  |
|   |  Description of the action | Climate Commitment is an annual event organised by the Madrid City Council in collaboration with the Casa Encendida de Fundación Montemadrid, The Democratic Society and the Centre for Innovation in Technology for Human Development of the Polytechnic University of Madrid.
This event already has two editions held in hybrid format: Madrid Zero Emissions (2021) and Mission Madrid (2022).

Madrid Zero Emissions (2021) was a first contact with the radical climate commitment initiatives already underway in Madrid. These encompassed proposals coming from organised citizens and the City Council. All of them shared the objective of building new climate narratives and cultivating new hopes for the climatic, economic and social future of the city of Madrid. The session made it possible to disseminate their objectives, strategies and forms of organisation. In addition, it also provided information on the city's solutions to emit less CO2, mitigate heat waves or water shortages, and the root changes that we must promote in the way we  |
|   |  |   |
|  |   |   |
MADRID

|   |  | educate about the environment or coexist with plants, animals or bacteria.

**Madrid Mission (2022)** reinforced the objective of the previous event, but framed the initiatives presented as part of the path towards achieving the Mission "100 climate neutral cities by 2030", for which Madrid has been selected. In contrast to the previous year, the concept of "micro-missions" was introduced: citizens and institutions that have come together to achieve the Mission on a smaller scale and contribute to climate transformation projects in industrial estates, public facilities or schools, where nature, play and coexistence predominate.

For this year's 2023 edition, the main ambition is to **amplify the reach of the event** and **reach out to neighbourhoods** through satellite events (held in so-called "climate shelters") and milestones in between during the year, to consolidate a community of people committed to climate neutrality in the city.  |

# B-2.3: Summary of the residual emissions strategy

In terms of direct GHG emissions, the management and treatment of bio-waste is of particular relevance at municipal level, which is why progress will continue to be made in optimising processes to reduce methane emissions at the Valdemingomez technological complex (PTV). To this end, the treatment of organic matter by means of biomethanisation (anaerobic digestion) and the use of biogas for transformation into biomethane injectable into the natural gas network will be promoted.

Considering the high importance of minimising food waste, its correct separation and the selective collection of the organic fraction, it is proposed to raise awareness and provide environmental education to citizens in order to improve the waste management process.

The generation of biomethane and electricity from renewable sources, from the waste produced by citizens and treated in the PTV or in wastewater treatment plants, also contributes to the reduction of fossil fuel consumption in the automotive, residential, industrial and service sectors in general, which is why we will continue to make progress in these renewable energy sources and in the application of the best available techniques to reduce atmospheric emissions.

The minimisation of construction waste (with a significant embedded carbon content as a result of its production and transport) should be highlighted as another important action within the circular economy strategy.

The development of offsetting mechanisms, such as the creation of carbon sink forests, will substantially increase the presence of nature and biodiversity in the city with all the associated benefits that this entails.

Madrid Compensa is a voluntary programme for offsetting $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions and generating ecosystem services of the Madrid City Council. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions through this programme are offset by planting trees in the municipality of Madrid, which can be carried out either by the City Council or directly by the participating entities themselves, depending on the type of participation chosen. In addition, the programme also makes it possible to collaborate in the improvement of the city's green areas with financial contributions earmarked directly for these actions, or through direct intervention by the organisation.

Within the scope of Madrid Nuevo Norte (largest urban development with zero emissions) it is estimated that the annual absorption capacity of the green infrastructures of Madrid Nuevo Norte is 500 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ per year, taking into account its green infrastructures in roads, parks and gardens and landscaped areas in private plots. In addition, it is proposed to investigate the proposed regulation for certification in the European Union for carbon elimination.

In addition, the European Commission recently announced a proposal for the first voluntary EU-wide framework to reliably certify high quality $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ removals. The proposal will boost innovative $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ removal technologies and sustainable carbon dioxide capture solutions. Madrid is working on projects to boost biomaterials in the city that can also help to account for neutralising residual carbon

MODULE B-3

# Monitoring, evaluation and learning indicators

It should contain a selection of indicators taken from the Comprehensive Indicator Sets developed by NetZeroCities. The following must be provided: an overview table listing the selected indicators by outcome and impact, including targets and assessment points (B-3.1); and a metadata table for each selected indicator as specified in the Comprehensive Indicator Sets (B-3.2).

The indicators detailed here were defined in the April 2022 update of the 'Roadmap to Climate Neutrality' and have been correlated with the sectors defined in the economic case. A first analysis of these indicators since 2020 has been reported, but it is necessary to progress in the development of the actions to observe trends and to be able to set target values for these indicators. Therefore, this column in table B-3.1 will remain pending for next iteration of this Climate City Contract.

|  Climate change is a cross-cutting priority of multi-level coherence in public policies (Madrid Urban Agenda, Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan, SDG Localisation Strategy). Climate and Air Quality policies are merged and coordinated from the Environment and Mobility Area, where there is a specific unit (SG Energy and Climate Change) with a dedicated technical staff of 10 people. For the development of the Roadmap towards Climate Neutrality, an interdepartmental "Clima Group" was created in 2019 with senior officials from 6 Government Areas of the City Council: Culture, Tourism and Sport; Urban Development; Economy, Innovation and Employment; Internationalisation and Cooperation; Finance and Personnel; and Environment and Mobility. This group seeks coordinated action from within the City Council to include the climate dimension in all projects promoted or in which it participates.  |   |   |   |   |   |
|  Being a Mission City implies a change in climate policy governance to mobilise such a large-scale transformation. The city of Madrid has always made clear its conviction that it is essential to learn from each other if we are to go far and go fast as circumstances demand. Building on existing alliances, agreements and public-private collaboration spaces that link businesses, public institutions and society (e.g. Madrid Futuro, energy companies, Foro de Empresas por Madrid...), the creation of a Local Climate Action Platform with businesses, social agents and other relevant urban actors is proposed in order to bring together commitments and synergic projects in the city in a rigorous and verifiable way. On the other hand, the global and complex dimension of the climate crisis requires that this networking should not be limited to the local sphere, and it is essential to connect with other cities to share knowledge and experience. In this sense, Madrid is part of the "Plataforma de Colaboración para la Neutralidad Climática de las Ciudades Españolas" (citiES 2030) promoted by the Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge and has extensive experience in international initiatives such as the C40 Cities Leadership Group, the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy or the EUROCITIES network, as well as in participating in European research, technological development, demonstration and innovation projects.  |   |   |   |   |   |

# C-1.2: Description of social and other innovation actions

Madrid City Studio is the scientific collaboration programme promoted by the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) and the Madrid City Council for the development of Master's and Bachelor's Degree Final Projects on real problems of the Roadmap to Climate Neutrality for the city of Madrid by 2050. The projects have been developed with the support of scholarships offered by the UPM, and each student had two tutors, one academic and one official from the City Council, expert in the need or challenge identified by the city.

For the proposal of topics, first the needs of the city were identified and then the connection was made with research groups and students of the UfM. The main objective was to support those departments that needed scientific development on a specific topic, and to strengthen municipal teams that needed to include scientific analysis in their projects and strategies.
MADRID

The added value of this project lies in the ability to scale solutions connected to actions already underway in the city and to extend the scientific rigour of the analysis and decision-making. The working methodology of City Studio is prepared to allow the participation of other actors, the keys are in designing the programme and managing interdisciplinary relationships and knowledge. Among the topics addressed in the Programme developed from May 2021 to January 2022 between UPM and Madrid City Council are: regeneration, energy, mobility, circular economy, resilience, adaptation to climate change (support to the Metropolitan Forest and design of new green infrastructures from an artistic perspective - "cyborg" garden).

# Introducción

En el momento crucial de la respuesta mundial a las emergencias relacionadas con el clima, la Unión Europea se ha comprometido a liderar la acción climática y ha establecido los objetivos y la legislación para poder lograrlo. Así, la Unión Europea debe reducir sus emisiones en, al menos, un 55% para el año 2030 y alcanzar la neutralidad climática a mediados de siglo. En este contexto, las ciudades están llamadas a desempeñar un papel fundamental, tanto para acelerar el proceso de descarbonización como para asegurar una transformación justa y equitativa, que contribuya al bienestar del conjunto de la sociedad.

No en vano, las ciudades, pese a ocupar solamente en torno al 3% de la superficie terrestre, generan más del 70% de las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero y consumen más del 65% de la energía en el ámbito global. Y es importante que actúen como centros de experimentación e innovación en la transición hacia la neutralidad climática.

La Misión de la Unión Europea "100 ciudades climáticamente neutras e inteligentes antes de 2030" pretende apoyar la transformación de las ciudades para acelerar el cumplimiento del Acuerdo de París, y constituirse tanto en un elemento catalizador e impulsor de la implementación del Pacto Verde Europeo, como en un demostrador de que es posible alcanzar la neutralidad climática antes de 2050.

En España, el 8 de septiembre de 2021 el Gobierno de España y los Ayuntamientos de Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla y Valencia firmaron la Declaración "Ciudades climáticamente neutrales en 2030" (anexa a este Acuerdo), como un impulso a los compromisos e iniciativas de las ciudades firmantes y un apoyo del Gobierno a la transformación de estas ciudades para lograr la neutralidad climática y mejorar su resiliencia. Siguiendo la senda abierta, el 13 de diciembre se adhirieron a la Declaración los Ayuntamientos de Soria, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz y Zaragoza.

Además, el 15 de septiembre de 2021 el Pleno del Senado aprobó una moción por la que se insta al Gobierno a impulsar la neutralidad climática de las ciudades en el marco de la Misión Europea de Ciudades. La moción reconoce el papel fundamental de las ciudades en la respuesta a la emergencia climática y destaca la oportunidad de acelerar los cambios necesarios y transversales para que las ciudades sean

5

climáticamente neutras en 2030. También valora que las distintas Administraciones territoriales impulsen y faciliten la neutralidad climática de las ciudades españolas a través de su incorporación a la Misión de Ciudades y mediante el desarrollo de proyectos de transformación.

En este sentido, el 25 de noviembre de 2021 la Misión de Ciudades lanzó una convocatoria de expresión de interés dirigida a las ciudades europeas de más de 50.000 habitantes interesadas en participar. De las 377 que se presentaron, se seleccionaron 100 de la UE-27, entre las que figuran las ciudades españolas de Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz y Zaragoza.

El Plan de implementación de la Misión prevé que cada una de las 100 ciudades seleccionadas elabore un Acuerdo de Neutralidad Climática de la Ciudad adaptado a su propia realidad, mediante un proceso de creación conjunta y en estrecha colaboración con el conjunto de la sociedad civil y con la ciudadanía, que detalle la estrategia de despliegue y seguimiento de soluciones innovadoras y digitales para alcanzar la neutralidad climática; y que permita a otras ciudades seguir su ejemplo antes de 2050. Así, este documento constituye un compromiso político claro, no solo ante la Comisión Europea y las autoridades nacionales, regionales y locales, sino también ante la ciudadanía e incluye un plan general de acción climática en los distintos sectores, como la energía, los edificios, la gestión de residuos y el transporte, junto con los correspondientes planes de inversión.

De esta manera, el presente documento responde a las exigencias de la Misión Europea de Ciudades. Ha sido elaborado por la ciudad, con la participación de otros actores públicos y privados, y establece planes para lograr la neutralidad climática. En particular, reconoce que la Misión no puede tener éxito sin estar sólidamente anclada en la comunidad local y concitar un amplio apoyo. Por ello, involucra a la sociedad civil, grupos de jóvenes, instituciones culturales y sectores creativos, fundaciones, medios de comunicación locales, pequeñas y medianas empresas, industria privada, sindicatos, academia e investigación, y sector público, entre otros, en sus correspondientes funciones como decisores, usuarios, consumidores, productores y propietarios.

Además, integra las cualidades y el patrimonio propio de la ciudad, que garantizan la dimensión local de la transición hacia la neutralidad climática, pero, también, su carácter inclusivo, conforme a los valores de la Nueva Bauhaus Europea (arte/cultura,
f

sostenibilidad, sociedad). Fomenta el sentido de pertenencia y apropiación por parte de los habitantes de la ciudad y de los actores profesionales, poniendo de manifiesto que su contribución singular es relevante y que el cumplimiento de este Acuerdo redundará en una mejor calidad de vida y un mejor medio ambiente para todos. Por otra parte, se configura en el marco de un proceso iterativo, como un documento que estará sujeto a seguimiento y actualización, tanto a través de la firma de adendas como de otros documentos de adhesión, aglutinando así a otros actores necesarios para que la ciudad alcance el objetivo de neutralidad climática establecido. En particular, los compromisos que se recogen podrán ser ampliados o actualizados para que contribuyan efectivamente a la consecución de la neutralidad climática en la ciudad.

El documento se divide en varias partes: una relativa al compromiso de las ciudades para alcanzar la neutralidad climática de la ciudad; otra relativa al apoyo y coordinación institucional de las distintas administraciones públicas; otra parte referente a su seguimiento y actualización; y una última que comprende los anexos correspondientes al Plan de Acción Climática, al Plan de Inversión Climática de la Ciudad y al de Actores de la Ciudad y compromisos asumidos, que siguen los modelos elaborados por NetZeroCities¹.

¹ El proyecto NetZeroCities forma parte del Programa de Investigación e Innovación Horizonte 2020 y proporciona la asistencia técnica, reglamentaria y financiera necesaria a las ciudades de la Misión Europea de Ciudades (https://netzerocities.eu/the-nzc-project/).

# Compromiso de la ciudad de Madrid hacia la neutralidad climática

## Introducción

Madrid ha mostrado su compromiso e implicación en iniciativas internacionales de colaboración y liderazgo de las ciudades frente al Cambio Climático desde las primeras reuniones que dieron origen a la creación de la red C40, en octubre de 2005 en Londres, desarrollando desde entonces y de forma continuada la actividad en materia de prevención y lucha contra el cambio climático. Cabe mencionar algunos hitos como la aprobación por el Pleno Municipal de la adhesión al “Pacto de los Alcaldes” (Covenant of Mayors²), en noviembre de 2008, obligándose a superar el objetivo fijado por la Unión Europea (UE) de reducir en un 20% las emisiones de GEI antes de 2020. Posteriormente, en julio de 2014 el Pleno acordó aprobar la adhesión del Ayuntamiento de Madrid a la iniciativa “Alcaldes por la Adaptación” (Mayors Adapt³). En septiembre de 2014 se presentó en la Cumbre sobre el Clima organizada por Naciones Unidas la iniciativa Compact of Mayors⁴, a la que se adhirió la ciudad de Madrid, con el objetivo de que las ciudades se comprometan a reducir sus emisiones de GEI, haciendo públicos sus planes y objetivos de mitigación y adaptación al cambio climático, así como su seguimiento anual, utilizando una metodología común de inventario de emisiones a escala urbana. Posteriormente, en 2018 el Ayuntamiento de Madrid se adhiere al compromiso ‘Deadline 2020⁵’ impulsado por la red de Liderazgo de ciudades frente al Cambio Climático - C40, por el que se compromete a elaborar un plan de acción.

En esta última legislatura se ha intensificado la acción climática para dar respuesta a la urgente necesidad de enfrentar este desafío global y alinear las estrategias municipales al contexto de políticas europeas en esta materia. Entre los diferentes compromisos asumidos por el Ayuntamiento de Madrid destacamos la adopción, por

el Pleno en septiembre de 2019, de la Declaración de Emergencia Climática y la activa implicación de nuestra ciudad como sede de la COP25. También en 2019 la ciudad de Madrid presenta la Estrategia de Sostenibilidad Ambiental Madrid 360⁶, elaborada con el objetivo de luchar contra el cambio climático y cumplir con los límites de calidad del aire establecidos por la legislación de la Unión Europea y las recomendaciones de la Organización Mundial de Salud, objetivo alcanzado en el año 2022. La Estrategia tiene un carácter amplio, ya que abarca todas las fuentes de emisión y todos los distritos de la ciudad, mejorando la calidad del aire a través de tres pilares de transformación: la ciudad, la movilidad y el gobierno. En 2020 se produce la aprobación en el Pleno municipal de la adhesión a la comunidad Climate-KIC del Instituto Europeo de Innovación y Tecnología, que incorpora la visión sistémica y la necesidad de establecer una colaboración multi-actor en Madrid como ciudad demostradora del programa Deep Demo “Healthy, clean cities”, principios que se reflejarán posteriormente en el concepto de la Misión de ciudades. En los Acuerdos de la Villa, aprobados por unanimidad de todos los partidos políticos de la corporación municipal y cuyo objeto es reactivar Madrid tras los efectos de la pandemia, se incluye la necesidad de elaborar una hoja de ruta de acción climática. Como resultado de este acuerdo unánime y en el marco de la Estrategia Madrid 360, se elaboró la ‘Hoja de ruta hacia la neutralidad climática para 2050⁷, que oficialmente fue presentada por el Alcalde en marzo de 2021.

La Hoja de Ruta hacia la neutralidad climática es un análisis técnico para apoyar el compromiso político de acción contra el Cambio Climático. La Hoja de Ruta alinea las políticas municipales con las nacionales y europeas, y eleva la ambición requerida para las ciudades que quieren estar a la vanguardia de este movimiento global. La Hoja de Ruta establece como objetivo reducir los Gases de Efecto Invernadero (GEI) en un 65% para 2030 (en comparación con los niveles de 1990), y alcanzar la neutralidad climática en 2050, así como aumentar la resiliencia de la ciudad frente a los riesgos climáticos. Este complejo desafío no puede ser abordado actuando exclusivamente sobre las fuentes de emisión. Requiere una transformación social y un cambio de paradigma en la forma en que construimos, gobernamos y habitamos una ciudad. Incorporar la colaboración entre administraciones y la coordinación interna

interdepartamental mediante un grupo “Clima”, así como establecer las bases para la participación colaborativa y social de múltiples actores, constituyen factores clave para desbloquear una verdadera y profunda transformación.

En este sentido, la **Misión Europea de Ciudades Climáticamente Neutras e Inteligentes**, representa una oportunidad única para la ciudad de Madrid en su objetivo de acelerar su descarbonización, identificando tres motivaciones principales:

El concepto de "Misión" proporciona una fuerza de cohesión inspiradora hacia un cambio transformador que pueden adoptar por igual los organismos públicos, las grandes corporaciones y las PYME, la academia, así como todos y cada uno de los ciudadanos.
La Misión constituye un marco más amplio que los ciclos habituales de proyectos locales en términos de tiempo y escala, necesario para abordar retos complejos que implican un cambio sistémico en una gran ciudad.
La Misión proporciona herramientas innovadoras como los "acuerdos climáticos" (climate city contracts), los planes de financiación y los elementos de comunicación ofreciendo todo un conjunto de recursos para articular una nueva forma de hacer las cosas de cara al desarrollo de políticas climáticas.

Estos tres factores -compromiso interno, aprendizaje conjunto y nuevas herramientas de planificación y aplicación- constituirán una base sólida para aumentar la ambición climática hacia la neutralidad para 2030 en una vía honesta y creíble.

Finalmente, es importante destacar que la ciudad de Madrid está trabajando para combinar los activos existentes a fin de poner en marcha un proceso estratégico, guiado por los ambiciosos objetivos de la Hoja de Ruta hacia la Neutralidad Climática, en conjunto con el resto de las políticas, estrategias y normativas que se pueden encontrar en el plan de acción climática de este Acuerdo, reflejado en la tabla A-2.1 del Anexo I.

Destacar también la participación de la ciudad en la **Plataforma Nacional de ciudades españolas para la neutralidad climática CitiES2030**, proyecto impulsado por el Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico a través de la Fundación Biodiversidad, así como en la red europea NetZeroCities (NZC) y el trabajo en una cartera de proyectos transformadores conectados con acciones de mitigación y adaptación climática.

El presente Acuerdo Climático es un documento vivo y en continua evolución, que busca establecer los principales objetivos, prioridades y principios clave para lograr la neutralidad climática en la ciudad de Madrid. De esta forma se mantiene el compromiso de la ciudad para continuar trabajando y mejorando los planes y acciones que ya están en marcha.

# Objetivo de neutralidad climática para 2030

Los objetivos comprometidos por el Ayuntamiento de Madrid en la Hoja de Ruta hacia la neutralidad climática pasan por reducir los Gases de Efecto Invernadero (GEI) en un 65% para 2030 (en comparación con los niveles de 1990), y alcanzar la neutralidad climática en 2050. Ser elegida ciudad "Misión" por la Comisión Europea supone un importante impulso para acelerar el proceso de transformación y alcanzar estos objetivos antes del tiempo marcado inicialmente para el conjunto de la ciudad, a través de la creación de zonas y entornos donde esta neutralidad climática sea una realidad en 2030. Además, la Hoja de Ruta hacia la neutralidad climática contempla un "escenario extendido" aún más ambicioso en sus objetivos de reducción para 2030 cuya viabilidad técnica, económica y social solo sería posible con un Acuerdo Climático que ponga en marcha innovadoras herramientas y mecanismos transformadores. Este Acuerdo inicia las vías para poder explorar cómo se podría desarrollar dicho 'escenario extendido', de forma que la ciudad pueda establecer objetivos más ambiciosos sobre la descarbonización de sus sistemas.

La visión de Madrid hacia la neutralidad climática en el contexto de la Misión se centra en la dimensión social como principal motor del cambio, creando grandes áreas con límites geográficos específicos en las que todos los sectores y sistemas se hayan transformado y donde la neutralidad pueda percibirse como una experiencia vivida. En este sentido, la Misión ofrece el necesario enfoque sistémico de acciones que confluyen en un ámbito y fortalece el carácter de equidad e inclusión social al priorizar el concepto de alcanzar los objetivos de neutralidad por y para los ciudadanos.

La ciudad de Madrid tiene una superficie de 60.445,5 hectáreas y 3.286.662 habitantes (a fecha 1 de enero de 2022), lo que equivale a una densidad media de 54 habitantes por hectárea, siendo la ciudad más poblada del conjunto de ciudades participantes en esta iniciativa europea. Debido al tamaño y la complejidad de nuestra ciudad, se aborda la Misión en tres niveles de intervención con acciones concretas sobre entornos que, si bien tienen un ámbito geográfico delimitado, presentan unas características especiales que extienden su potencial de impacto al conjunto del municipio:

+ Nuevos desarrollos urbanísticos climáticamente neutros. Una nueva forma de hacer la ciudad del futuro integrando la innovación climática en el diseño urbanístico y su gestión.

+ Generación de una nueva cultura de los ciudadanos del futuro mediante la intervención en centros educativos y campus universitarios cero emisiones, que permita atraer el talento y avanzar hacia una sociedad con mayor conocimiento y compromiso frente a este desafío global.

+ Una red de equipamientos y espacio público que actúen como nodos de neutralidad climática para la transformación y regeneración de la ciudad consolidada, promoviendo el cambio hacia una ciudad más natural, más cohesionada y con una mayor calidad de vida.

Anualmente el Ayuntamiento de Madrid publica el 'Inventario de emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero'⁸ que permite hacer un seguimiento de la evolución de las emisiones en el camino hacia la neutralidad. Aunque la tendencia en estos años es claramente decreciente, resulta necesario acelerar el ritmo de abatimiento de emisiones para cumplir los objetivos planteados por la ciudad y complementar las estrategias en marcha con enfoques innovadores para el desarrollo de la acción climática.

Los impactos climáticos se están haciendo cada vez más complejos debido a la interacción y efectos en cascada de múltiples episodios extremos. Acelerar los planes y medidas de mitigación y adaptación al cambio climático en la ciudad de Madrid

garantizará la salud de ciudadanía, así como la transición hacia modos de vida más sostenible, mejorando las condiciones de habitabilidad al mismo tiempo que la actividad económica se fortalece.

El camino hacia la neutralidad implica una evolución de muchos de los modelos urbanos actuales y una transformación social y económica. En este proceso, debe destacarse la importancia de los cobeneficios que van a producirse de manera asociada a las acciones de mitigación y adaptación al cambio climático. A la reducción de los impactos climáticos se añaden los múltiples beneficios que proporcionan, desde la mejora de la calidad del aire, la protección de los ecosistemas y biodiversidad urbana, la funcionalidad de los espacios públicos, el estímulo de economías locales y empleo verde, así como beneficios asociados a una reducción de costes en la gestión del agua, la energía, los residuos, los seguros de riesgos, entre un sinfín de otros efectos.

## Prioridades e intervenciones estratégicas

La ciudad de Madrid aborda la Misión con una visión sistémica de toda la ciudad y con tres intervenciones estratégicas prioritarias:

+ **Nuevos desarrollos de ciudad climáticamente neutros** - El principal exponente ya en marcha es el ámbito Madrid Nuevo Norte, con la visión de convertirse en el mayor desarrollo urbanístico con un modelo energético electrificado (emisiones cero) de Europa, y cuya experiencia es transferible a otros ámbitos y nodos urbanos de actividad económica. Este proyecto de regeneración urbana (3,3 km²) plantea una nueva forma de planificación urbana que integra la innovación climática en términos de tecnología y soluciones basadas en la naturaleza desde la fase de diseño y dentro de una fuerte colaboración público-privada. Con el apoyo de la Misión, la experiencia podría extenderse a otros proyectos urbanísticos.

+ **Nueva cultura para los ciudadanos del futuro**, a través de la intervención en campus universitarios y escuelas transformadas en entornos climáticamente neutros. Los estudiantes son los que darán forma a las ciudades como futuros

Acuerdo Climático - Madrid
f

prescriptores, y la generación de talento y capacidad investigadora en los aspectos claves de la transición energética hacia modelos de neutralidad constituye una intervención estratégica de primer orden. Madrid alberga la mayor población universitaria de España y en su término municipal se encuentran tres grandes campus (6,5 km²) cuya transformación tiene un impacto directo significativo. Fortalecer el binomio ciudad-universidad para propiciar nuevas mentalidades en todas las disciplinas es un motor principal de transformación en la Misión Madrid.

+ La transformación y regeneración de la ciudad consolidada con los equipamientos, el espacio público y otras instalaciones públicas, actuando como nodos de neutralidad en los que la acción de la administración se conecte con otros actores urbanos sobre el territorio a través de acciones como comunidades energéticas, diseño participado de entornos, modos de movilidad compartidos, etc., integrando también a socios privados en los distritos empresariales y aprovechando el impulso creado por la Misión. Una intervención catalizada desde el Ayuntamiento con múltiples centros de transformación acelerada repartidos por toda la ciudad impulsará la regeneración de los barrios y la descarbonización.

Estas intervenciones estratégicas son coherentes y se integran en la política local de acción climática definida por la Estrategia de Sostenibilidad Ambiental Madrid 360 y el documento técnico de la Hoja de Ruta hacia la neutralidad climática de la ciudad de Madrid que deriva de ella. Además, el conjunto de la Misión Madrid hacia la neutralidad climática y, en particular, estas intervenciones en las que se hace imprescindible una estrecha colaboración entre administraciones cuentan con el respaldo de la Comunidad de Madrid a través del Plan de Descarbonización y Cuidado del Medio Ambiente y de la próxima Estrategia de Energía, Clima y Aire Horizonte 2030. No cabe entender la Misión Madrid de forma aislada al contexto regional.

La intervención sistémica en estos ámbitos de neutralidad climática supone un cambio de paradigma en la forma de abordar las acciones, que abandonan el enfoque sectorial tradicional y afrontan de forma integral los modelos actuales, poniendo el foco en modificar patrones de uso para reducir emisiones en origen. De esta forma se analizan las intervenciones con una filosofía centrada en 'Evitar-Cambiar-Mejorar':

+ **Evitar emisiones**: urbanismo de proximidad, creación de zonas de bajas emisiones de especial protección, rehabilitación y eficiencia energética, reducción de viajes obligados, minimización de residuos, entre otras.

+ **Cambiar el modo a opciones y soluciones menos contaminantes**: como la electrificación de la demanda energética en los distintos sectores, el impulso de la movilidad activa ampliando la red ciclista y peatonal, o el impulso del uso del transporte público cero emisiones.

+ **Mejorar a través del desarrollo tecnológico que permita minimizar el impacto de las soluciones adoptadas**: descarbonización del sistema eléctrico mediante la generación distribuida de origen renovable o mejorar y electrificar el parque circulante.

Esta perspectiva se concreta en proyectos transformadores que inciden de forma transversal en distintos sectores y palancas de cambio. Estos proyectos que se integran en el plan de acción para la neutralidad climática conectan visiones y disciplinas habitualmente aisladas, catalizando una transformación del conjunto del ámbito.

Todo ello exige un esfuerzo sin precedentes para trabajar de forma colaborativa con múltiples partes interesadas, para conectar los intereses y motivadores de los ciudadanos, sector privado, academia y administraciones presentes en la ciudad de Madrid.

## Principios y proceso

La ciudad de Madrid ha establecido unos principios clave que guían su Hoja de Ruta hacia la neutralidad climática y refuerzan su papel como modelo de experimentación e innovación:

+ **Gobernanza climática**. Sobre la base de un sólido mandato político que hace de la neutralidad climática un “proyecto ciudad” prioritario y transversal al conjunto de acciones municipales, se ha iniciado un proceso de revisión y actualización de normas y herramientas administrativas (normas urbanísticas, ordenanzas fiscales, ordenanzas ambientales, cuadro de precios, instrucciones

Acuerdo Climático - Madrid

de contratación...etc.) para crear un entorno regulatorio favorable a la consecución de los objetivos de neutralidad y adaptación. Así, por ejemplo, la nueva Ordenanza de Calidad del Aire y Sostenibilidad (2021) crea la figura de Áreas Demostradoras de Acción Climática, en las que se intensificarán medidas que permitan avanzar en los objetivos de neutralidad climática, siendo los entornos seleccionados por la Misión Madrid (Madrid Nuevo Norte y Campus universitarios) los primeros objetivos. La adecuada coordinación de la acción climática en el conjunto de políticas municipales se estructura mediante una Comunidad de Conocimiento “Clima” de carácter interdepartamental, compuesta por altos responsables de diferentes Áreas de Gobierno de la ciudad, tales como Cultura, Urbanismo, Economía e Innovación, Internacionalización, Hacienda y RRHH, liderada por el Área de Medio Ambiente y Movilidad, en la que existe una unidad específica (SG Energía y Cambio Climático) con personal técnico dedicado. Esta comunidad de conocimiento, apoyada por un programa específico de la Escuela de Formación Municipal, brinda no solo un espacio de colaboración, sino también de reflexión y aprendizaje.

+ Seguimiento innovador y transparencia. Madrid está desarrollando el sistema e-Misión para el diagnóstico avanzado, simulación y evaluación de escenarios de fuentes emisoras de GEIs en la ciudad. Esta plataforma complementa el inventario de emisiones, al permitir conocer las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero con una mayor granularidad territorial (escala de los 131 barrios en los que se divide el municipio de Madrid) y temporal (actualizaciones trimestrales) procedentes de las principales fuentes emisoras de la ciudad (movilidad, sector residencial y servicios). De esta forma se facilita la evaluación y simulación del impacto de las acciones municipales con mayor grado de detalle y el análisis territorial comparado de las tendencias en emisiones. Constituye una herramienta innovadora y con una interfaz abierta al ciudadano para el seguimiento de la Misión hacia la neutralidad climática de Madrid. Además, para las Áreas de Demostradoras de Acción Climática se generarán “gemelos digitales” en colaboración con la Oficina Digital del Ayuntamiento y actores privados, con el objetivo de digitalizar los principales flujos de energía y generar nuevas vías de colaboración en el desarrollo de iniciativas de ciencia ciudadana asociados a la experiencia real de entornos neutros.

Acuerdo Climático - Madrid
F

+ Participación y dimensión social. Madrid afronta el reto de la neutralidad climática como un desafío eminentemente social, ya que no es la tecnología sino las personas con sus acciones y decisiones las que pueden dar lugar a una transformación con la escala y urgencia que se precisa. Una visión exclusivamente tecnológica puede incrementar las desigualdades sociales y territoriales, generando una “brecha climática” que impida el acceso de determinados sectores sociales a soluciones y sistemas urbanos de bajas emisiones. Para garantizar la equidad y la inclusividad de la acción climática el proceso de la Misión Madrid incorpora un esquema de trabajo basado en procesos de acercamiento y escucha a la realidad social mediante un trabajo conjunto con los distritos, canales de participación para los distintos proyectos tractores de la neutralidad y colaboración con entidades especializadas en la acción social (Cruz Roja, Oxfam, Porticus, EAPN, Cáritas). Por otra parte, y en lo que respecta a la variable de adaptación frente a los efectos del cambio climático que está íntimamente ligada a la Misión de neutralidad, la consideración de grupos con especial vulnerabilidad a, por ejemplo, incremento de temperaturas y olas de calor, tiene un relevante protagonismo en las medidas de evaluación de riesgos y planes de acción.

+ Talento. La ciudad de Madrid tiene la ambición de convertirse en un polo de conocimiento y aprendizaje en materia de acción climática y ya ha adquirido una valiosa experiencia, generando un binomio universidad-ciudad a través de colaboraciones con la Academia (Climate-KIC Deep DEMO). Como herramientas de activación Madrid ha planteado la intervención prioritaria en campus universitarios cero emisiones, para generar entornos donde experimentar en primera persona la neutralidad climática y un programa de creación de Cátedras Misión de innovación climática que acompañen este proceso hacia la neutralidad de los campus. El papel universitario no se limita a la innovación científico-técnica, sino que recoge también acciones de innovación social en los que la comunidad estudiantil, en su papel de ciudadanos-prescriptores del futuro, conecten y activen los procesos de comunicación, sensibilización e implicación ciudadana.

+ Trabajo en red. La ciudad de Madrid ha dejado siempre patente su convicción de que es esencial aprender unos de otros si se quiere llegar lejos y hacerlo rápido como exigen las circunstancias. A partir de alianzas, convenios y espacios de colaboración público-privada ya existentes que vinculan a las

empresas, las instituciones públicas y la sociedad (por ejemplo, Madrid Futuro, empresas energéticas, Foro de Empresas por Madrid, etc.) se plantea la creación de una Plataforma Local de Acción Climática con empresas, agentes sociales y otros actores urbanos relevantes en la que aunar compromisos y proyectos que generen sinergias en la ciudad de forma rigurosa y verificable. Por otra parte, la dimensión global y compleja de la crisis climática requiere que este trabajo en red no se limite a la esfera local, resultando fundamental la conexión con otras ciudades para compartir conocimiento y experiencia. En este sentido, Madrid forma parte de la "Plataforma de Colaboración para la Neutralidad Climática de las Ciudades Españolas" (citiES 2030) promovida por el Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico, y atesora una amplia experiencia en iniciativas internacionales como la del Grupo de Liderazgo de Ciudades C40, el Pacto de Alcaldes por el Clima y la Energía o la red EUROCITIES, así como participación en proyectos europeos de investigación, desarrollo tecnológico, demostración e innovación.

# Apoyo del Gobierno a la neutralidad climática de las ciudades Misión

A través de la Declaración suscrita por la Vicepresidenta Tercera del Gobierno y Ministra para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico, que figura como anexo al presente documento, el Gobierno de España expresa su compromiso con el proceso de transformación de la ciudad seleccionada por la Comisión Europea el 28 de abril de 2022 para participar en la Misión Europea de Ciudades.

# Apoyo de la Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid a la neutralidad climática de la ciudad de Madrid

Por su parte, el Gobierno de la Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid, como actor clave en la gobernanza multinivel necesaria para la consecución del objetivo de una ciudad climáticamente neutra, inclusiva, segura, resiliente y sostenible, ha demostrado su ambición en la transición hacia la neutralidad climática de la región a través del Plan de Descarbonización y Cuidado del Medio Ambiente y de la próxima Estrategia de Energía, Clima y Aire Horizonte 2030.

No cabe entender la Misión Madrid de forma aislada al contexto regional. El apoyo y los compromisos específicos de la Comunidad Autónoma hacia la neutralidad climática de la ciudad de Madrid se refleja en la acción conjunta sobre la cartera de proyectos transformadores que exigen esta coordinación multinivel, tales como Madrid Nuevo Norte, como ejemplo de desarrollo urbanístico con cero emisiones directas, las estrategias de movilidad urbana-periurbana o la generación de infraestructuras verdes para acercar la naturaleza a los ciudadanos conectando los Parques Regionales y otros espacios naturales al núcleo urbano para favorecer, conservar y proteger la biodiversidad.
