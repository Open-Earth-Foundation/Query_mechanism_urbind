# Introduction

At a crucial moment in the global response to climate-related emergencies, the EU is committed to leading climate action and has set the targets and legislation to achieve this. Thus, the EU must reduce its emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and achieve climate neutrality by mid-century. In this context, cities have a key role to play, both to accelerate the decarbonisation process and to ensure a fair and equitable transformation that contributes to the well-being of society as a whole.

Cities, despite occupying only about 3% of the earth's surface, generate more than 70% of greenhouse gas emissions and consume more than 65% of global energy. And it is important that they act as centres of experimentation and innovation in the transition to climate neutrality.

The EU Mission "100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" aims to support the transformation of cities to accelerate the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and to be both a catalyst and driver for the implementation of the European Green Deal, and a demonstrator that it is possible to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

In Spain, on 8 September 2021, the Government of Spain and the City Councils of Barcelona, Madrid, Seville and Valencia signed the Declaration "Climate Neutral Cities in 2030" (annexed to this Agreement), as a boost to the commitments and initiatives of the signatory cities and as government support for the transformation of these cities to achieve climate neutrality and improve their resilience. Following the path opened, the City Councils of Soria, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza adhered to the Declaration on 13 December.

In addition, on 15 September 2021, the Plenary of the Senate approved a motion urging the Government to push for climate neutrality of cities in the framework of the European Cities Mission. The motion recognises the fundamental role of cities in the response to the climate emergency and highlights the opportunity to accelerate the necessary and cross-cutting changes to make cities climate neutral by 2030. It also values that the different territorial administrations promote and facilitate the climate neutrality of Spanish cities through their incorporation into the Mission of Cities and through the development of transformation projects.

Viceministerio de Salud Pública

In this regard, on 25 November 2021, the Cities Mission launched a call for expression of interest addressed to European cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants interested in participating. Of the 377 that applied, 100 were selected from the EU-27, including the Spanish cities of Barcelona, Madrid, Seville, Valencia, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza.

The Mission Implementation Plan foresees that each of the 100 selected cities will develop a City Climate Neutral Contract adapted to its own reality, through a process of co-creation and in close collaboration with the whole of civil society and citizens, detailing the strategy for the deployment and monitoring of innovative and digital solutions to achieve climate neutrality; and enabling other cities to follow their example by 2050. This document thus constitutes a clear political commitment, not only to the European Commission and national, regional and local authorities, but also to the public, and includes a comprehensive climate action plan in the different sectors, such as energy, buildings, waste management and transport, together with corresponding investment plans.

In this way, this document responds to the requirements of the European Cities Mission. It has been developed by the city, with the participation of other public and private actors, and sets out plans to achieve climate neutrality.

In particular, it recognises that the Mission cannot succeed without being firmly anchored in the local community and garnering broad support. It therefore involves civil society, youth groups, cultural institutions and creative sectors, foundations, local media, small and medium-sized enterprises, private industry, trade unions, academia and research, and the public sector, among others, in their respective roles as decision-makers, users, consumers, producers and owners.

Furthermore, it integrates the city's own qualities and heritage, which guarantee the local dimension of the transition to climate neutrality, but also its inclusive character, in line with the values of the New European Bauhaus (art/culture, sustainability, society). It fosters a sense of ownership and ownership by the city's inhabitants and professional actors, showing that their unique contribution is relevant and that the fulfilment of this Contract will result in a better quality of life and a better environment for all.

On the other hand, it is configured in the framework of an iterative process, as a document that will be subject to monitoring and updating, both through the signing of addenda and other documents of adhesion, thus bringing together other actors necessary for the city to achieve the established goal of climate neutrality. In particular,

the commitments contained therein may be expanded or updated to effectively contribute to the achievement of climate neutrality in the city.

The document is divided into several parts: one concerning the cities' commitment to achieve climate neutrality in the city; another concerning the institutional support and coordination of the different public administrations; another part concerning its monitoring and updating; and a final part comprising the annexes corresponding to the Climate Action Plan, the City Climate Investment Plan and the City Stakeholders and Commitments, which follow the models elaborated by NetZeroCities¹.

# Commitment of the city of Valladolid to climate neutrality

## Introduction

The Mission 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030 in a context of triple crisis

Local authorities must take the lead in urban climate change mitigation and adaptation actions, promoting sustainable policies and investing in innovative ideas aimed at reducing the carbon footprint. Cities have a key role to play in the fight against climate change, but this requires a change in the urban model, which must necessarily go hand in hand with a transformation in the way people live. "Cities are the engine of the changes Europe needs to make the transition to climate neutrality," says Frans Timmermans, Vice-President of the European Commission and one of the main leaders of the Green Deal.

Against this backdrop, Valladolid is committed to being a benchmark city on a European scale in its innovative and inclusive bid to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, by making a banner of the broadest possible understanding of the Green Deal, under which we must attend to the concept of "Green", but without forgetting the concept of the Social Pact/Contract.

The current context makes it necessary to overcome the climate, energy and economic crisis without losing sight of the need for solidarity, which means leaving no one behind in this green transition.

## Valladolid Mission: Our commitment and motivation for the Climate Mission

The European Union has focused on innovation as a key lever to make cities smart, resilient and sustainable urban spaces. Valladolid has been working for years in the framework of the different European innovation programmes through numerous projects, many of which fall under the concept of "lighthouse" or "demonstrator" projects.

Valladolid has always had a strong sense of European integration, and is particularly motivated to achieve its goal of climate neutrality by 2030. The following key factors

f

represent with great significance the commitment and motivation for this Climate Mission:

It is in the city's DNA to build and collaborate with others. The city of Valladolid participates in numerous networks and initiatives aimed at combating climate change on a transnational scale: Covenant of Mayors, Green City Accord, Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, EUROCITIES, etc. are just a representative example of this. This active membership stems from the commitment to create confluences with different actors, both public and private in an exercise of co-governance, and inspired by the opportunity to reflect on common challenges, set objectives, develop shared strategies and influence the creation of regulations. In this sense, the Climate Mission will consolidate these dynamics, spaces and methodologies for joint work and knowledge transfer, learning from each other.

Valladolid is committed to being a reference of inspiration, knowledge and multi-level innovation, as it has launched numerous innovative collaborative projects that can be used as tangible and practical examples of how to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by acting as innovative beacons for other European cities to follow. Our experience in large demonstration projects such as REMOURBAN and Urban GreenUP are a first letter of introduction. The city has also signed specific collaboration agreements in the field of the Mission with Portuguese, Greek and Spanish cities, as well as a broader commitment with the region of Castilla y León.

Public-private collaboration is more essential than ever, as it is not possible to achieve climate neutrality without the agreement of all. Although over the years Valladolid has established numerous agreements with different types of public and private actors, the Climate Mission will allow this type of collaboration to be taken to its maximum exponent.

Through the "Social Dialogue Council of the city of Valladolid", in the agreement of 10 October 2022, the objectives of the Valladolid Climate Mission have already been assumed as their own by all the signatory parties (trade unions, employers and City Council) and the collaboration and cooperation relations with the main stakeholders for the Valladolid Climate Mission have already been activated.

Valladolid's Climate Mission should strengthen the public sector as an example of leadership for the rest of the agents when facing challenges of this magnitude. This leadership position is assumed by Valladolid City Council, however, with the utmost humility, insofar as we consider that the Climate Mission must be a factor for the transformation into the 21st Century Administration that society demands and deserves: internal training, the generation of new profiles, which do not currently exist, public procurement, the generation of new work and coordination dynamics are just some of the elements of internal progress that the City Council intends to achieve thanks to the Climate Mission.

As a paradigmatic example of these points 3 and 4, it is necessary to expressly mention our Local Mission Platform, as the space that brings together all the city's agents that will work towards the city's climate neutrality.

# Conclusion

Valladolid's Climate Mission is a great opportunity for the city due to its impact on people's well-being, sustainability, ecological transition, adaptation to climate change, attracting investment, boosting carbon-neutral economic initiatives, creating jobs and boosting research and innovation from its entire innovative ecosystem, positioning the city as a driver for attracting funding and investment and promoting public-private collaboration processes.

This Climate Mission is a major milestone for Valladolid, reinforcing, with a qualitative leap, its positioning in Europe and in international networks, which will achieve a transformation of the city with an impact on the quality of life as never seen before.

# Climate neutrality target for 2030

## Goal: complete neutrality by 2030

This objective was established by the highest political body of the City Council, the Plenary, which, in its session of 30 November 2021, agreed by a broad political consensus on the Roadmap for the implementation of the "Mission 100 on Smart and Climate Neutral Cities", expressly highlighting the ambition and commitment to achieve the city's goal of climate neutrality by 2030.

Specifically, the plenary agreed:

+ Approve the Roadmap for the implementation of the European Mission 100 Smart and Climate Neutral Cities, demonstrating the ambition, commitment and political commitment of the city of Valladolid to achieve the city's goal of climate neutrality by 2030.

+ Carry out the appropriate actions for the adhesion of the city of Valladolid to the National Platform of Climate Neutral Cities (citiES 2030).

+ To convey to the Regional Government, the Spanish Government and the European Commission the commitment made by Valladolid through the approval of the motion and to promote and articulate multilevel governance processes for institutional support.

+ To make an institutional call to all civil society actors, to the world of academia and research, to the economic sectors of the city and its surroundings and to the rest of the public institutions to join the roadmap of the city of Valladolid by redirecting their efforts and their R&amp;D&amp;I processes so that together they work towards its success.

All of this with two fundamental objectives: to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 and to act as a centre of experimentation and innovation for other cities. He also said that Valladolid will contribute to meeting the international objectives of the COP21 Paris Agreement, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the European Union's Urban Agenda and the European Green Deal.

# Valladolid's climate neutrality, an ambitious goal that starts from a long way off

In addition to this climate neutrality commitment for 2030 agreed by the Municipal Plenary, a series of other climate neutrality commitments have been subscribed to, which are summarised as follows:

## Covenant of Mayors

Valladolid signed the Covenant of Mayors in 2011, committing to a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020 through the use of renewable energy and progress in energy efficiency, a target exceeded after achieving a 24% reduction in GHGs. The commitments are amplified through the new Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) for alignment with the Climate Mission.

## Commitment Net Carbon Emission Buildings

Valladolid joined the Net Zero Carbon Buildings initiative in December 2019, promoted by the World Green Building Council (WorldGBC). The initiative seeks to inspire and promote advanced climate leadership, focused on achieving net zero operational carbon emissions at the level of individual buildings and on a mass scale in companies and public administrations. Valladolid thus became the first Spanish city to sign up to this commitment, following 26 other cities around the world such as Copenhagen, Los Angeles, Melbourne, New York, Paris and London.

## European Green Cities Accord

With the aim of making cities greener, cleaner and healthier, the European Commission launched in 2020, this initiative aimed at consolidating collaboration between cities and the European Commission, and to redouble efforts to address urban environmental challenges. Valladolid City Council, through a Plenary Motion, approved in April 2021 its adherence to this commitment, with which it redoubled its commitment to an urban future that allows citizens to breathe clean air, enjoy clean water, have access to parks and green spaces and reduce their exposure to environmental noise by 2030. This vision also envisions the circular economy becoming a reality, waste becoming a resource and recycling becoming the norm.

Other commitments:

Valladolid

Since 2005, Valladolid has been an active member of the Spanish Network of Cities for Climate, the FEMP Section formed by Local Governments that are integrating climate change mitigation and adaptation into their policies and which arose from the need detected among City Councils to coordinate their efforts in the fight against climate change.

In 2017, Valladolid City Council agreed to subscribe, in a Motion supported by all the municipal political groups, to the so-called Seville Declaration, i.e. the commitment of cities to the Circular Economy. Since 2017, the City Council has been developing an active policy in the field of circular economy. In 2021, under the leadership of Valladolid City Council, this declaration was updated and renamed the Valladolid Declaration, being a new reaffirmation of the local commitment to the circular economy and materialised, specifically, in 16 commitments.

Valladolid is part of the "Marketplace of the European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities" (EIP-SCC) through its lighthouse projects R2CITIES, REMOURBAN and URBAN GreenUP.

The city of Valladolid has also committed itself to being part of transnational initiatives that allow it to share knowledge and experiences to promote initiatives and solutions specifically in the field of sustainable mobility, highlighting CiViNET, as a project to create five networks in seven Member States to promote the integrated approach of CIVITAS on sustainable mobility. In the same line, Valladolid is also part of the UITP - International Association of Public Transport and participates in large European consortia of Horizon Europe for sustainable mobility (AEROSOLFD, URBANE and SPINE projects, the latter of the HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02 call (Research and Innovation actions to support the implementation of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission). In the field of energy renovation of buildings it is important to highlight the project LEGOFIT - (Horizon CL5-2022-D4-01-02) "Adaptable technological solutions based on early design actions for the construction and renovation of Energy Positive Homes".

On 15 December 2022, Valladolid made a commitment to achieve climate resilience by 2030 by joining the "European Mission Charter - Mission Adaptation

to Climate Change" (signatory of the Mission Charter - Mission Adaptation to Climate Change).

Valladolid is part of the EUROCITIES network, with Valladolid holding the vice-presidency of the Economic Development Forum, as well as actively participating in the forums on sustainable mobility, environment, knowledge society and culture. It has also joined various European initiatives such as "Big Buyers for Climate and Environment", the European start-up accelerator for climate neutrality "Clean Cities ClimAccelerator", or the "Circular Cities Declaration", among others.

Through its membership of the European consortium "PROSPECTplus", Valladolid mentors other European cities and regions to assist them in the implementation of their own Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans, facilitating the search for investment through innovative financing models.

# Valladolid's climate neutrality by 2030 - Closing the gap

The path towards climate neutrality in 2030 involves defining an ambitious action plan that incorporates the actions defined in the current strategic planning, strengthening the actions already planned, but above all highlighting those new actions that will make it possible to achieve a reduction of 939 kTCO2equiv by 2030.

The Valladolid Climate City Contract establishes that the investment needed to reach climate neutrality is 1,534 million euros, achieving an 85% emission reduction scenario and offsetting the remaining 15% of residual emissions.

The Climate City Contract highlights innovative and ambitious actions to act on the most relevant levers to achieve scenarios that allow, for example, a reduction in the need for motorised transport of 30%, an annual building renovation rate of 2% and a 40% of new buildings to be built to the highest energy efficiency standards, as well as a 65% share for low-emission heat generation.

# The benefits of the Valladolid Climate Mission

The climate investment plan shows encouraging figures for return on investment of 43%. It identifies €1,617 million of operational cost savings, and €594 million identified as co-benefits.

For a city like Valladolid, this Climate City Contract represents a clear opportunity for urban transformation with direct benefits mainly linked to energy savings, but with wide-ranging social and economic benefits.

The co-benefits of mitigating carbon emissions emphasise positive outcomes in other areas such as air quality and health, economic prosperity, resource efficiency or asset appreciation. In addition to its relevance for increasing equality and social justice, the Valladolid Climate Mission presents a great opportunity to modernise, facilitate innovation and improve the competitiveness of our economy, while generating quality jobs.

With an average household income of €33,294, an ecosystem of 19,170 registered companies distributed in the service sectors (52%), commerce, transport and hospitality (34.1%), construction (9.6%) and industry (4.3%), and with a high percentage of self-employed workers (10.8% of the 149.418 workers registered with the Social Security), the city of Valladolid must face a more sustainable productive model that is socially beneficial, creating decent employment opportunities, increasing resource efficiency and building sustainable societies with low carbon emissions.

Employment in the emerging renewable energy industry and the spill-over effects on the whole economy can become important contributors to achieving the social agenda. Not only in terms of estimating possible employment opportunities, but also in better understanding the skill requirements of this emerging industry and the expected demand for training.

It must also ensure that women can take advantage of the opportunities presented by this transformation, as well as securing, retaining and attracting talent for a competitive labour market in its transition to a green economy.

Climate City Contract - Valladolid
Ajuntamento de Valladolid

Specifically, in the energy sector, the social and economic co-benefits of the transition include secure and accessible energy for all; mitigating conflicts over scarce resources, such as water; promoting local business economies and employment; increasing people's health and well-being; relieving budgetary burdens on administrations; and empowering citizens.

In relation to all this, in order to promote these changes, it is necessary to accompany the economic sectors in their necessary transformation, supporting R&amp;D&amp;I and the adaptation of companies to new advances in disruptive innovation such as robotics or artificial intelligence. In this way, both elements, technological progress and environmental protection, feed back on each other, producing mutual benefits.

Valladolid has an ageing population, with a negative vegetative balance, in which the population over 65 years of age represents 26.7% of the total, with an average age of 47.3 years. Hence, all the benefits linked to the reduction of health risks in an ageing population that is more exposed to the problems of air pollution require this clear commitment to climate neutrality in the city.

# Strategic priorities and interventions

Various strategies - both sectoral and global - of Valladolid City Council represent a firm commitment to the development of the concept of sustainability in the municipality and, therefore, with a direct link to the Climate Mission, although there are six main ones that mark the strategic priorities of our Climate Mission:

+ The General Urban Development Plan approved in 2020, in which environmental sustainability and the fight against climate change have played a central role.
+ Valladolid Climate Change Strategy.
+ Valladolid Urban Agenda 2030 (AUVA 2030).
+ Integrated, sustainable and safe urban mobility plan for Valladolid.
+ Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP).
+ Circular Economy Action Plan.

The role of innovation as a transformative and systemic lever is given concrete form in the Innovation and Smart City Plan: SmartVa!

Through these strategic priorities the Valladolid Climate Mission deploys 5 key systemic changes.

# 1 - Sustainable refurbishment and comprehensive energy efficiency measures

Lead the implementation of climate neutral districts, encouraging at least one district in the city to become energy positive. Deployment of the sustainable district heating in the city in collaboration with the regional government to reach 65% decarbonisation of heating. Encouragement at all levels of the renovation of the private building stock to achieve an annual renovation rate of 2%, also acting on new construction to reach 40% of new buildings with nearly zero energy consumption.

In addition, the necessary interventions will be carried out to achieve the "Zero Carbon" designation in all existing municipal buildings, as well as in future buildings under municipal supervision. Local Energy Communities will also be established, together with a package of measures aimed at promoting energy efficiency in private buildings. The initiative "Valladolid Climate Neutral University of Valladolid" in collaboration with the University of Valladolid, as well as the Positive District - already in drafting - will be the first demonstration examples to act as catalysts in this respect.

# 2 - Sustainable and safe urban and metropolitan mobility

Promote public transport, the decarbonisation of municipal fleets and the incentivisation of sustainable business fleets through public-private partnership mechanisms, which have proven successful in recent years. The Action Plan develops actions to achieve a 30% reduction in the need for motorised transport and a 20% modal shift (to public and non-motorised transport). Measures aimed at a modal shift towards more sustainable modes of transport, including infrastructure, with an emphasis on the digitalisation of services, shared transport and optimisation of logistics. Electrification of both heavy goods vehicles and business and private fleets. The Valladolid intermodal logistics platform is also a model initiative that will enable the transfer to rail of tonnes of transport that are currently carried out by road.

# 3 - Circular economy for sustainable consumption and production

Integrate this concept into urban water, waste, mobility and energy policies. In addition, actions to support the productive sector and citizens will be carried out, from economic and technical incentives to the creation of a designated space for the co-creation and acceleration of projects. The circular economy will also have an impact on transforming the way food is produced and consumed, encouraging local trade, with strong support for local producers. The Innovation and Sustainability Hub has been set up as a pilot project in this regard.

# 4 - Renaturalising the city

Planting more urban trees, increasing the forest area, creating urban carbon sinks, implementing urban renaturalisation measures through nature-based solutions for CO2 fixation and offsetting the local carbon footprint, achieving a 15% offset of residual emissions.

Valladolid was one of the first European cities to pursue the goal of greener urban spaces. In this context, the next step will be to adopt new initiatives and projects through nature-based solutions and other types of green and blue infrastructure, building on previous experience and ambitious projects already underway, such as "Urban GreenUP", "INDNatur" and "Urban Water Buffer". Another example to highlight is the project "Valladolid: Urban Biodiversity Pathways" which has sixteen concrete actions to improve urban biodiversity, create carbon sinks and address the environmental restoration of degraded areas.

Climate City Contract - Valladolid
Ajuntamento de Valladolid

# 5 - Governance for Climate Neutrality

Through a process of internal and external transformation (initiated by an internal adaptation for the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan), new forms of management and distributed leadership have been established, while open innovation and creativity procedures for urban policy development will be enabled. The Innovation and Sustainability Hub will be particularly relevant for the co-creation, acceleration and knowledge transfer of innovative projects, with an impact on climate neutrality under public-private collaboration. Valladolid in December 2022 has published an innovative municipal ordinance to enable the city to be a regulated urban test scenario ("regulatory sandbox") as a demonstration city for innovative and climate-neutral projects. Other regulatory, fiscal, organisational and economic policies and instruments will be further developed and implemented: among others, socially efficient and climate-neutral public procurement, the implementation of the SmartVa! Innovation and Smart City Plan, and economic incentives for the decarbonisation of the city.

# Principles and process

## 1 - Just transition, "no-one left behind"

A fundamental pillar of the understanding of this Climate City Contract is the firm conviction that this Climate Mission is made for and with the people who live in our city. Our entire city model is based on the faithful conviction of placing people at the centre, as the beginning and end of all sustainable development processes that the city undergoes. People are the ones who live and interact in Valladolid and, therefore, the ones who create the city. Consequently, and in a context of such a pressing crisis, it is on people and their needs and expectations that the city model must move forward. And this is framed under the firm conviction that we cannot leave anyone behind in this green transition which, in the context of the climate, energy and social crisis we are experiencing, makes it even more essential to create resilient and climate-neutral cities, and we want Valladolid to be a faithful representation of the Green Deal, especially with regard to the protection of the most vulnerable groups. The Climate Investment Plan reflects this principle by allocating 12% of the total investment needed to climate justice.

## 2 - Beyond a short-sighted and partisan agreement

It is clear to us, and indeed we have intensified our efforts in this direction in recent years, that this green transformation must be the result of public policies that:

+ They are, above all, irrevocable public policies in terms of their contribution to the city model that we have built and agreed upon together. They are not the public policies of a specific political party or ideology, but rather the public policies that the city has chosen as its own in order to advance its sustainable development.

+ They are also public policies that are not afraid to take risks, to break with long-established status quo and, in short, to innovate. With them we want to anticipate future European strategies and global trends and thus achieve a competitive advantage when it comes to attracting resources and investment to the city.

+ And be public policies with a multilevel character, since not only the local government influences the city. Consequently, multilevel governance is an asset to be strengthened in order to articulate regional, state and European public policies that have a greater impact and prominence for the city.

Climate City Contract - Valladolid
- Co-creation with the ecosystem

The ambition and complexity of this green movement requires the involvement of all possible agents in the process. Multi-stakeholder involvement is key in this urban transformation, which also allows the actions and plans to be of greater benefit to the citizens as a whole.

The Valladolid Climate Mission has already been presented to the main entities, institutions and associations that represent the ecosystem participation model (public sector, private sector, academia, civil society). Thus, business associations, neighbourhood associations, professional associations, groups, foundations, workers' associations, trade unions, industrial clusters, technology centres and consumer groups have adhered to this Climate City Contract, all of them expressing their commitment to climate neutrality in Valladolid.

The local platform in Valladolid is therefore up and running and has already secured its mechanisms for participation, co-creation and dissemination of the Mission.

Climate City Contract - Valladolid

### 4 - Cooperation at regional, state and cross-border level

This Climate City Contract has to reinforce our membership and active role in city networks and collaborative projects, both at national, European and even international level.

Our membership of the national platform for climate-neutral cities citiES 2030, together with the European platform NetZeroCities, will be the main pivots of this cooperation at all levels. In particular, cooperation and collaboration with the regional level will be strengthened, also deepening climate neutrality with Portugal, through the CENCYL VERDE network, where a large cross-border meeting with Portuguese cities is already planned to take place in Valladolid in April 2023. The next Ibero-American Congress of Intermunicipal Cooperation to be held in Valladolid in the first half of 2023 will empower climate neutrality, a high-impact event organised by the Ibero-American Organisation of Intermunicipal Cooperation (OICI) of which Valladolid holds the vice-presidency.

### 5 - Strengthening our regulatory capacities and our financial and institutional framework

As a city, we are working on strengthening our regulatory capacities and the financial and institutional framework and continue to develop a culture of collaboration, through
2

Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

the development of collaborative spaces. In the coming years we want to further develop the potential of public-private-people-planet collaborations. Currently the Next Generation EU recovery funds are helping Valladolid to accelerate a digital, green and inclusive recovery in our city, focused on implementing real changes in the city, on our way to 2030 based on tractor projects. The new Ordinance for the regulation of the use of municipal goods and services of the Valladolid City Council as a test scenario for entrepreneurial innovation projects will be a good example of this strengthening.

## 6- A learning journey

It is clear that all cities embarked on this process of climate neutrality are in a situation of great uncertainty about what and how to do in order to reach such a milestone. Consequently, we want our Climate City Contract to be seen as a learning element that we will have to iterate on over the coming years to adapt, modify or refine as the city transforms towards climate neutrality. In this regard, close collaboration with the European Commission through NetZeroCities will be of vital importance in this learning journey concept.

# Supporting statement of National Government for the climate neutrality of Spanish Mission Cities

I hereby place on record the Spanish Government's commitment to support the climate city contracts presented by the cities, which were selected by the European Commission on 28 April 2022 to participate in the European Cities Mission: Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, Valencia, Zaragoza, Valladolid and Vitoria-Gasteiz.

This support contributes to the ecological and energy transformation of cities and to a greater climate and social resilience, which is materialised in the Spanish State's framework of competences, among others, in the following aspects:

The impulse of a regulatory framework aligned with the systemic innovation and public-private collaboration required by the European Mission of Cities. In this context, it highlights:

+ The Spanish Urban Agenda, approved in February 2019, which highlights the need to achieve sustainability in urban development policies. It is constituted as a working method and a process for all the actors involved in cities that aspire to an equitable, fair and sustainable development from the different fields of action. This strategy is developed around 30 specific objectives and 291 action lines, which includes all villages and cities regardless of size and population, and it addresses economic, social and environmental sustainability.

+ Law 7/2021, of 20 May, on climate change and energy transition. This institutional framework guarantees, through its various measures, the coordination of sectoral policies, ensures coherence between them and synergies to achieve the objective of climate neutrality, and increases our capacity to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.
↑

The work commitment on the regulatory developments of the Law is clear. Due to the implications for the European Mission Cities, the following stand out: (i) in the energy field, work is being done to establish a framework to deploy energy efficiency in industries and buildings, and renewable energies as vectors towards decarbonisation, (ii) in terms of emission-free mobility, the mandate for cities to adopt sustainable urban mobility plans with mitigation measures, such as low-emission zones, is included, iii) in the area of green procurement, we are working to establish measures to integrate the fight against climate change in public procurement procedures, such as the inclusion of emission reduction and carbon footprint criteria specifically aimed at the fight against climate change as specific technical requirements in procurement specifications.

The launch of the Multi-stakeholder Collaboration Platform for the Climate Neutrality of Spanish Cities (citiES 2030), a tool created ad hoc and already in operation to facilitate the implementation of the Cities Mission.

With the implementation of this platform, the Government of Spain not only fulfils one of the initial activities of the Mission, but also becomes a reference for the other countries and cities in the programme.

This platform is a multi-stakeholder innovation and collaboration infrastructure to support and accelerate the transformation of Spanish cities towards climate neutrality.

The platform's main beneficiaries are city councils of Spanish cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants or provincial capitals that want to achieve full or partial climate neutrality by 2030, as well as cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants that want to initiate this process.

The platform offers cities a range of services, including:

+ Training, learning and skills enhancement
3

+ The support for the development of local systemic innovation platforms for the design of transformative project portfolios;
+ The assistance in drafting and monitoring climate city contracts and the design of roadmaps in a multi-stakeholder environment;
+ The connection with related processes in other European cities; the incubation of multi-city projects; the citizen participation and activation;
+ The assistance to cities to structure transformation financing schemes, involving financial actors;
+ The strategic communication.

The Platform's governance is multi-stakeholder and multi-level, with the aim of facilitating, ordering and guaranteeing directionality and stability in these collaborations. In this way, it relies on the participation of the actors of the quintuple helix:

+ The public sector (administrations and public agencies).
+ The private sector (companies, financial sector, urban infrastructure sector and professional associations).
+ The academia (universities and research centres).
+ The civil society (NGOs and neighbourhood associations).
+ The media.
4

The support to mobilisation of green investments. A good example is the deployment of the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan through the mobilisation of an unprecedented volume of investment that prioritises not only mitigating the effects of the crisis, but also the transformation of our country towards a sustainable and inclusive economy.

The Recovery Plan recognises the fundamental role of cities in economic and social transformation, due to their capacity to generate short-term activity with a pull effect on industry and key sectors, and their importance in terms of the climate emergency. Thus, it includes initiatives aimed at essential aspects for the climate neutrality of cities, such as:

+ The improvement of sustainable mobility, with the promotion of electric and fuel cell vehicles and the extension of recharging infrastructures, through the different MOVES programmes.
+ The promotion of the renovation of urban residential environments, housing, buildings and neighbourhoods, with the priority objective of decreasing energy consumption and promoting decarbonisation in the household stock.
+ The development of energy communities that promote social innovation and citizen participation in renewables, energy efficiency and electric mobility, thereby contributing to fair and inclusive decarbonisation in urban areas.
+ The promotion of self-consumption for the energy use of urban roofs and decks, storage behind the meter and renewable HVAC in homes.
+ The development of transformative strategies and initiatives for urban renaturalisation, helping to increase green infrastructure and biodiversity in Spanish cities and favouring Nature-Based Solutions to respond to their socio-environmental challenges.
+ The support for the implementation of waste regulation, in collaboration with the autonomous communities and cities, with investments in
5

digitalisation for environmental management, through the Recovery Plan.

+ The deployment of calls for grants to municipalities and local entities for the implementation of low-emission zones in cities and the sustainable and digital transformation of urban transport.

The monitoring of the progress of the seven cities through the information processed in the citiES 2030 Platform, with the aim of integrating the urban transformation roadmap into the country's decarbonisation process.

As part of the iterative process of the European Cities Mission, the Spanish Government will participate in the monitoring and updating of the commitments made in the climate neutrality agreements of the cities of Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza, supporting the recognition and dissemination of the progress achieved.

# ANNEX 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan
Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

# Introduction

The Valladolid Climate Action Plan is developed as a unifying document, which provides a common, holistic and integrated vision of the measures needed to adapt to climate change, so that the Valladolid City Council's Climate Action is positioned and in line with the different European and state policies to facilitate the promotion of public actions that seek sustainable development.

Valladolid is a city of proximity and neighbourhoods, fully rooted in its environment and territorially integrated, with nearly three hundred thousand inhabitants. In this sense, it is a European city, committed to building a greener, healthier, more inclusive and resilient Europe.

From a policy context perspective, it is worth highlighting the city government's explicit commitment to innovation as a key lever to make cities smart, resilient and sustainable. Valladolid has developed the necessary capacities to be one of the pilot cities leading the way towards climate neutrality. Moreover, being part of this Mission will allow the city to further develop the innovative ecosystem in sectors as cross-cutting as mobility, energy, construction and waste, making use of a new governance model characterised by intense collaboration between actors.

Thanks to the European Smart and Climate Neutral Cities Mission 2030, the city of Valladolid reinforces its commitment to remain at the forefront of European action to mitigate the climate emergency and promote mission-oriented innovation that improves people's lives, as well as ensuring the sustainability over time of the political commitment.

# The Valladolid Climate Action Plan, the result of strategic planning already oriented towards the green transition.

Valladolid City Council has been working for many years on the definition and deployment of multiple strategies (both sectoral and global) that represent a firm commitment to the development of the concept of sustainability in the municipality and, therefore, with a direct link to the Climate Mission:

# 5. Circular Economy Action Plan

The role of innovation as a transformative and systemic lever is specified in the **Innovation and Smart City Plan: SmartVa!** where public innovation and smart city policies are integrated, putting the focus on the development of the local economy, and identifying innovation as a key factor of urban transformation and sustainable urban growth.

NOTE: all the strategic planning of Valladolid City Council is available at: https://www.valladolid.es/transparencia/es/transparencia-activa-organizacion/planes-programas-anuales-plurianuales

## 1. Urban Agenda 2030: global umbrella for the sustainable city model

The Urban Agenda 2030 of Valladolid (AUVA 2030) has been defined as a participatory and strategic document that proposes the development of a series of priorities together with strategic and specific objectives, interrelated with each other and with the different lines of action.

AUVA 2030 promotes improvements in the areas of planning, financing, knowledge, governance and transparency, as well as participation and its regulation. To this end, it proposes working on a model of multi-sectoral coordination between the public administration and the rest of the agents involved in urban policies and projects, thus becoming an opportunity to address economic and social development in a comprehensive manner.

In short, the Urban Agenda is conceived as an indispensable element to make Valladolid the inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable city that its citizens need.

AUVA 2030 is largely based on the urban planning instrument par excellence: the **General Urban Development Plan** approved in 2020, in which environmental sustainability and the fight against climate change play a central role. As this is a long-term strategic process, work has been underway since 2015 on the objective criteria and regulatory objectives that can respond to the complete regeneration of the city on the pillar of sustainability, in order to achieve the fundamental objectives of reducing emissions and combating and adapting to climate change.

Annex 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan – Valladolid
Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

From the Mission's perspective, it is key to have a recently approved urban planning tool, as the fight against climate change takes on a priority role. Thus, for example, the PGOU carries out an analysis of the current environmental situation of the municipality and the existing environmental problems, studying the impact of climate change and assessing the carbon footprint associated with the revision of this urban planning. It also includes several proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in areas as diverse as mobility, housing and the renaturalisation of the city.

Through a collaborative process, in which the different areas of the City Council, various agents of the city and the citizens themselves have participated, the set of plans, lines and proposed actions that define the 10 major Strategic Priorities, including the cross-cutting and comprehensive approach of the AUVA 2030, have been created.

In addition, within these strategic priorities, a broad set of objectives, keys, approaches, lines of action and implementation instruments are included that allow the roadmap for the sustainable urban development of Valladolid 2030 to be drawn up:

Sustainable urban planning. Prevent and reduce climate change impacts and increase resilience through urban planning.
Health and well-being. Promote a healthy city, which responds to the security, social and personal wellbeing needs of its citizens, in a context of demographic change.
Sustainable and resilient Valladolid. To place Valladolid at the forefront of the transition towards sustainability and emission neutrality.
Responsible management of resources. Promote the circular economy, positioning Valladolid as a benchmark in the sustainable management of resources and zero waste.
Sustainable mobility and transport. Redesigning the urban mobility system towards sustainable, low-emission mobility.

Annex 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan – Valladolid
/ 137
Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

Diverse and inclusive Valladolid. To consolidate Valladolid as a diverse and socially cohesive city.

Economic development and employment. To consolidate Valladolid as a dynamic city, capable of generating employment and well-being for its citizens.

Housing and basic facilities. To promote the exercise of the right to decent, affordable and accessible housing for all.

Innovative Valladolid. To promote the innovative dimension of Valladolid as a recognisable ecosystem of creativity and social, cultural, economic and environmental dynamism.

Multi-level and cross-cutting governance to achieve the AUVA 2030 goals. Establish governance as an interlinked and fully cross-cutting pillar with the other pillars of the Agenda.

In short, Valladolid's Urban Agenda 2030 represents the city's main strategic plan in its quest for transformation in terms of the necessary green transition, digital and social cohesion, always from a cross-cutting and inclusive perspective.

The Climate Action Plan draws with particular emphasis on the strategic lines of action and transformative projects defined in the Urban Agenda.

## 2. Climate Change Strategy: leverage to achieve climate neutrality.

On 18 March 2022, in response to the commitment acquired within the scope of the INTERREG - POCTEP Green Cities CENCYL project, the Climate Change

Annex 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan – Valladolid
Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

Strategy was approved, an essential step towards the objective of achieving climate neutrality in the city of Valladolid.

The Climate Change Strategy is an essential contribution to the adherence to the Mission 100 Smart and Climate Neutral Cities for 2030, and reinforces the already existing adaptation and mitigation lines of the current municipal plans. In this way, it embodies collective action to address the unavoidable impacts of climate change for the health and well-being of people in all its aspects under the principles of: measurement, transparency, prevention, mitigation, participation, governance and social justice.

The objective of the strategy is the reduction of 100% of greenhouse gas effects by 2030, as well as increasing the city's resilience to climate change, through digitisation, data management and integration of information and innovation, which are used as the basis and levers to achieve climate neutrality and to address, in a more efficient way, the risks associated with the impacts of climate change, with citizens as a key element in this process.

The Strategy includes 150 lines of action for adaptation and mitigation. The lines of action include citizen participation, the co-creation of innovative projects under a public-private collaboration model and promoting public awareness of the impacts of climate change and the measures necessary for adaptation.

These 150 lines of action are based on a multi-level governance approach and the identification of four key levels of action.

At the first level, 18 action lines are based on solid knowledge and guidance provided by the EU missions on climate neutral cities and communities of adaptation.
The second level, 36 action lines, are based on national commitments and objectives based on the vision of the EU missions, including the measures listed in the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030 (PNIEC) and the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change 2021-2030 (PNACC).
At the third level, 61 lines of action emerge from existing plans and current commitments through the mapping of existing commitments and objectives in 17 local plans.

Annex 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan – Valladolid
/ 137
Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

The fourth group, 35 lines of action, is based on direct engagement with stakeholders and different municipal areas in a participatory process and directly addresses the challenges of climate change.

# 3. Valladolid Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP).

Valladolid City Council joined the Covenant of Mayors in April 2011. The commitments signed include the development of a Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP_VA). Valladolid's SEAP originated in June 2012 and was accepted by the European Commission in April 2013.

Firstly, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Inventory was carried out with data from 2010 as a starting point. Since 2018, this inventory has been updated and reviewed on an annual basis.

In parallel to the PAES_VA, since 2012, Valladolid City Council calculates the carbon footprint of municipal assets (buildings, facilities, equipment) and thanks to this commitment, in 2015, Valladolid City Council was the first Spanish municipality to obtain the three labels from the Spanish Ministry for Ecological Transition: Calculate, Reduce and Offset labels. Again, in 2020, all three labels were obtained.

It should be noted that this process has been developed with citizen participation. Specifically, the SEAP_VA was drawn up within the framework of the 4th Action Plan of the Valladolid Local Agenda 21 (LA21), through the forum of the LA21 Commission, a consultative body made up of representatives of local stakeholders.

Currently, the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan 2030 (PACES_VA) includes both climate mitigation and adaptation aspects to support and achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2030.

The measures of the SECAP are grouped according to the different sectors on which action is to be taken. For each sector, both the vision and the long-term objectives to be achieved by implementing a list of actions are included. The SECAP itself incorporates verification and communication mechanisms to monitor the evolution of the process.

Annex 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan – Valladolid

Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

# 4. Integrated, sustainable and safe urban mobility plan for Valladolid.

The Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan is a strategic planning tool and an awareness-raising and sensitisation instrument for citizens, public administrations and other mobility stakeholders.

The Integral Plan for Urban, Sustainable and Safe Mobility in the City of Valladolid (PIMUSSVA) is based on a holistic approach, with the principle of safety as one of the key elements. It describes a series of measures to achieve more sustainable and safer ways of travelling, modes of transport that make economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection compatible, thus guaranteeing a better quality of life for the citizens of Valladolid.

After an intense participatory process, the Valladolid City Council Plenary approved its Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan in 2021, which reaffirms the City Council's commitment to act in those areas with the greatest potential to reduce emissions. It is an instrument of great importance to promote a new model of sustainable and safe metropolitan urban mobility that leads to a greener city. To this end, it is committed to activating the following transformational levers:

Promote non-motorised modes of transport.
Promote public transport.
Improving urban burden sharing.
Achieve improvements in road and parking solutions.
Commitment to green vehicles.
Improve road safety.
Put in place instruments to support sustainable mobility policy.

# 5. Valladolid Circular Economy Plan.

The Circular Economy Action Plan (PAEC) of the city of Valladolid brings together in a single document the approach and action measures of the City Council related to the circular economy for the three-year period 2021-2023. The aim is to promote the circular economy as a paradigm of a new model with economic, environmental and social benefits, leading, by example, the development of urban policies, generating the conditions for development in the

Annex 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan – Valladolid
/ 137
Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

productive fabric and in the responsible consumption of citizens, and facilitating synergies between actors.

In the roadmap towards the objective of Valladolid as a climate neutral city in 2030, the Circular Economy Plan is presented as one of the transformative projects, aligning Valladolid's action with the European framework (the EU Circular Economy Action Plan - European Green Deal), which considers the circular economy a prerequisite for climate neutrality, and with the National Plan for Recovery, Transformation and Resilience, which presents the circular economy as a transformative lever, key in the process of recovery and modernisation of the economy, while accelerating progress towards climate neutrality.

To this end, the Plan is articulated around 3 Strategic Objectives, 12 Programmes and 47 projects.

Incorporate the circularity dimension into local urban policies.
a. Programme 1.1 - Urban water cycle.
b. Programme 1.2 - Reduction of waste and promotion of recycling.
c. Programme 1.3 - Promotion of the materials cycle.
d. Programme 1.4 - Circular Public Procurement.
e. Programme 1.5 - Positioning Valladolid in circular economy policies.

b. Programme 2.2 - Training and Capacity Building.
c. Programme 2.3 - Technical and financial support.
d. Programme 2.4 - Information, knowledge and networking.

Promoting the role of citizens as agents of change
a. Programme 3.1 - Informed Consumers.
b. Programme 3.2 - Responsible consumption.
c. Programme 3.3 - Consumer and user associations.

# CLIMATE ACTION PLAN. KEY SYSTEMIC CHANGES

Having identified in the previous section the main strategies and plans that have an impact on climate neutrality, this Climate Action Plan - aware that with the

Annex 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan – Valladolid
/ 137
Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

strategic planning done until 2022 it is not possible to achieve climate neutrality - sets ambitious strategic priorities by deploying key systemic changes:

# 1. Sustainable renovations and comprehensive energy efficiency measures

Lead the implementation of climate neutral districts, encouraging at least one district in the city to become energy positive. Deployment of the city's sustainable district heating network in collaboration with the regional government to reach 65% decarbonisation of heating. Encouragement at all levels of the renovation of the private building stock to achieve an annual renovation rate of 2%, also acting on new construction to achieve 40% of new buildings with nearly zero energy consumption.

In addition, the necessary interventions will be carried out to achieve the "Zero Carbon" designation in all existing municipal buildings, as well as in future buildings under municipal supervision. Local Energy Communities will also be established, together with a package of measures aimed at promoting energy efficiency in private buildings. The initiative "Valladolid Climate Neutral University of Valladolid" in collaboration with the University of Valladolid, as well as the Positive District - already in drafting - will be the first demonstration examples to act as catalysts in this respect.

# 2. Sustainable and Safe Urban and Metropolitan Mobility

Promote public transport, the decarbonisation of municipal fleets and the incentivisation of sustainable business fleets through public-private partnership mechanisms, which have proven successful in recent years. The Action Plan develops actions to achieve a 30% reduction in the need for motorised transport and a 20% modal shift (to public and non-motorised transport). Measures aimed at a modal shift towards more sustainable modes of transport, including infrastructure, with an emphasis on the digitalisation of services, shared transport and optimisation of logistics. Electrification of both heavy goods vehicles and business and private fleets. The Valladolid intermodal logistics platform is also a model initiative that will enable the transfer to rail of tonnes of transport that are currently carried out by road.

# 3. Circular Economy for Sustainable Consumption and Production

Annex 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan – Valladolid
/ 137
Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

Putting an end to the overexploitation of resources involves a process of redesigning the production and consumption model. In this way, the concept of circular economy has been integrated into the new urban water, waste, mobility and energy policies. Furthermore, thanks to the planning of actions focused on the productive sector and citizens, ranging from economic and technical incentives to the creation of a designated space for the co-creation and acceleration of projects, the aim is to increase the role of the local productive fabric and citizens in the whole process. Likewise, the circular economy must also have an impact on the objective of transforming the way food is produced and consumed, promoting local trade with clear support for local producers.

## 4. Renaturalising the city - waste emissions

Planting more urban trees, increasing the forest area, creating urban carbon sinks, implementing urban renaturalisation measures through nature-based solutions for CO2 fixation and offsetting the local carbon footprint, achieving a 15% offset of residual emissions.

Valladolid was one of the first European cities to pursue the goal of greener urban spaces. In this context, the next step will be to adopt new initiatives and projects through nature-based solutions and other types of green and blue infrastructure, building on previous experience and ambitious projects already underway, such as "Urban GreenUP", "INDNatur" and "Urban Water Buffer". Another example to highlight is the project "Valladolid: Urban Biodiversity Pathways" which has sixteen concrete actions to improve urban biodiversity, create carbon sinks and address the environmental restoration of degraded areas.

## 5. Governance for climate neutrality

Through a process of internal and external transformation (initiated by an internal adaptation for the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan), new forms of management and distributed leadership have been established, while open procedures for innovation and creativity will be enabled for urban policy development.

The co-creation, acceleration and knowledge transfer of innovative projects with an impact on climate neutrality under public-private partnership models will be the subject of work in the Innovation and Sustainability Hub.

Annex 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan – Valladolid
/ 137
Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

The development of the Valladolid Climate Action Plan, in addition to defining different transformative actions, establishes three cross-cutting pillars:

Adaptive and demonstrative capacity. In order to move towards carbon neutrality, it is necessary to know the state of the current situation, to know possible future scenarios and, based on this, to strengthen the capacity to adapt to environmental events in order to ensure the best possible response to the challenges faced. Representative examples of this pillar are:

a. Ordinance Valladolid demonstrating city
b. Incentives for decarbonisation

INNOVATION, Integration and Digitalisation. The city has a series of elements that allow it to rely on digitisation, data management and innovation as a fundamental pillar, both to achieve climate neutrality and to manage the risks associated with the impacts of climate change. Digitisation and innovation will allow fostering the local economy, the use of technologies and the involvement of citizens in the digital era in an inclusive way while reducing the digital divide. Innovation is also essential to develop new products, services and models that are more sustainable:

a. Agency for Innovation and Economic Development
b. Climate-neutral local public procurement

Citizenship as a key element. Climate action must involve the largest possible number of actors in society, with citizens being the main driver of change. To this end, the Action Plan for Climate Neutrality 2030 envisages the creation of specific measures against climate change co-created through a process of careful participation and ecosystem stakeholders. In this way, Valladolid demonstrates a reciprocal commitment, from the city's representatives and institutions to the citizens and vice versa. The productive fabric and civil society drive policies towards a transformative change of the production and consumption model and, ultimately, the way of working, moving and living in the city and its surroundings. The representative example for co-creation with citizens is:

## THE CLIMATE CITY CONTRACT AND ITS FUTURE ITERATIONS

This Valladolid Climate City Contract has its first iteration in March 2023.

Given that the Climate City Contract is a process of implementation of the Mission that will last until 2030, priority should be given to short-, medium- and long-term actions, with the Climate City Contract being a first planning tool. In any case, this planning will have to be in line with the milestones and priorities set by the European Mission itself, which will be established with special relevance:

Implementation of the action plans associated with the transformational strategies (Climate Change Strategy, Valladolid Urban Agenda 2030, etc.), which are highly ambitious in their objectives aimed at climate neutrality. They are also living strategies that already have active governance and participation instruments.

Implementation of the tools available to the Climate City Contract, in order to be able to continue to evolve and grow new initiatives. Special emphasis on the Mission's Local Platform, to work under a multi-city project scheme to overcome common barriers, increase impact and ensure the scalability of actions.

Internal reorganisation as a City Council, in order to implement new spaces, methodologies and work dynamics capable of offering comprehensive and agile responses to the challenge of climate neutrality. This internal reorganisation has its origin in the Mayor's Decree no. 2020/9115, dated 22 December, regarding the functional adaptation of Valladolid City Council for the implementation of the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan. It is of particular relevance that this internal reorganisation will come to a head after the local elections in May 2023.

Centre of inspiration towards others: deployment of the collaboration agreements reached with the regional environment to help Castilla y León to meet its strategic priority of a fully circular and climate neutral region

by 2030. In the same vein continue the work initiated with the cities of Ionanina, the Portuguese cities for their support to the Climate Neutral Portugal Mission and the enhancement of the use of the City Council's international networks for the dissemination and inspiration of Europe's climate neutrality.

Multi-level governance with the National and European Platforms - citiES2030 and NetZeroCities - acting as true enablers and catalysts for climate neutrality in Valladolid: a common framework for monitoring, reporting and verification; support for the deployment of the climate investment plan, innovative governance models and citizen engagement. Furthermore, thanks to the platforms, multi-city scale demonstrators can be accessed to test the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of energy efficient and flexible urban areas in a real environment.

Large-scale R&amp;D demonstrators. Continue to strengthen innovation demonstrators through Horizon Europe, taking advantage of opportunities to create synergies with other EU projects. Building on the large-scale Valladolid demonstrator projects of the previous H2020 innovation programme (REMOURBAN, URBAN GREENUP, PROSPECT PLUS) develop transformative actions linked to HEUROPE projects already under implementation (SPINE, URBANE, AEROSOLFD or LEGOFIT) and seek new consortia for climate neutrality. Also, continue to strengthen territorial cooperation focused on Climate Action, either with INTERREG Europe, INTERREG POCTEP and/or INTERREG SUDOE programmes.

Alignment and update of the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (PACES_VA): Given that the methodology followed for the emissions inventory and economic calculations in this Action Plan based on the Business Case is not fully comparable to the methodology of the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans, it is necessary to update the current SECAP of Valladolid to reflect the ambition of climate neutrality on the one hand and to align it with the methodology followed in this Action Plan on the other hand.

In addition to the content to be worked on in future iterations identified by the national platform, Valladolid City Council has defined the following sections which, in future iterations, should be further defined and specified:

Annex 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan – Valladolid
/ 137
Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

Redefinition and adjustments resulting from the co-creation and participation with the Local Mission Platform, and where appropriate, updating of the Governance Plan.
Indicators linked to the European Mission 100 climate neutral cities by 2030.
Indirect Scope 3 emissions: Adjustments derived from the Self-Assessment Checklist of influence of actions on Scope 3 emissions.
New transformative actions
Redefining and adjusting the Climate Investment Plan, with a particular focus on improving climate policies for capital raising and deployment. All this on the basis of the first results of the established economic indicators.
Data collection from other sectors not covered in the model and associated transformative actions.
Updating capital planning to achieve climate neutrality
Update of cross-cutting, non-sectoral costs associated with the implementation of actions.

At the end of ANNEX I, in the section on perspectives and next steps, the main milestones in the iteration process of the Contract are indicated in more detail. A biannual review criterion will be followed, but Valladolid City Council will carry out an internal review one year after the entry into force of the Climate City Contract (estimated date of first review: March 2024).

# INDIRECT EMISSIONS OF SCOPE 3

It is important to note that this first iteration of the Valladolid Climate City Contract does not work with Scope 3 emissions scenarios, although specific actions are proposed for these indirect emissions, as well as medium and long-term planning.

Scope 3 indirect emissions are of particular relevance as they relate to "other indirect emissions" related to the procurement of necessary materials or services by manufacturers and transporters (e.g. aggregates, water, fuels, etc.), and/or products and services that are expected to need to be purchased or contracted for the works or operation of a particular activity, plan or project.

The assessment of scope 3 is very relevant to minimise among others the potential risk that measures adopted in the Climate Action Plan could negatively

Annex 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan – Valladolid
/ 137
Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

affect scope 3. Thus, the Climate Action Plan makes special reference to the decarbonisation of heating through sustainable district heating networks, mainly biomass heat networks. Emissions due to the use of biomass as fuel are very particular scope 1 emissions, as they count as zero emissions. They will be considered as no net CO2 emissions because they participate in the short carbon cycle, returning the CO2 captured by photosynthesis to the atmosphere to produce that biomass. However, in order to produce and transport biomass-based fuels, emissions are generated which, if they are to be taken into account, would be Scope 3 emissions.

Therefore, in addition to the emphasis of this Climate Action Plan on circularity, sustainable agri-food production and the use of building materials, the following actions are proposed.

Self-assessment of the influence of actions on Scope 3 emissions: Preparation and execution of a checklist where the impacts on Scope 3 emissions of the measures that are intended to be carried out with this action plan for Climate Neutrality 2030 will be assessed. The output from these self-assessments will feed back and redefine the Action Plan in its implementation and in each of its iterations.
Scope 3 emissions Action Plan: It is planned to be implemented in 2025, taking into account the evaluation and monitoring of actions according to the previous section, but with special emphasis on the implementation of actions to limit Scope 3 emissions. The target year for achieving climate neutrality in Scope 3 will be set, establishing a first iteration that sets the scenario in the year 2042.

# PART A – Current state of climate action

This module contains the city's starting point towards climate neutrality and informs subsequent modules and outlined pathways to accelerate climate action.

# MODULE A-1

Baseline inventory of greenhouse gas emissions

*To establish the emissions gap, following the criteria set out in the Mission framework, Scope 1 and 2 emissions are considered, and Scope 3 emissions only those associated with waste disposal/management. A preliminary analysis of the influence on Scope 3 of the actions included in this action plan has been carried out and a 2025-2030 plan is established for the evaluation and monitoring of the actions carried out and their impact on Scope 3 emissions. As a complement, in future iterations a list of checkpoints will be prepared for each action, where the impact of each of them on Scope 3 emissions will be evaluated.

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of the Baseline GHG Inventory

Valladolid has been a signatory to the Covenant of Mayors since 2011. The Covenant of Mayors is a European initiative that promotes the commitment of cities to reduce their carbon emissions and improve their resilience to the effects of climate change. Covenant of Mayors signatories are required to develop and submit a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP).

The SECAP is a key element of the Covenant of Mayors commitment, as it describes a city's strategies and actions to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improve its energy efficiency. As a first step in developing this SECAP, Valladolid developed an emissions inventory that provides a baseline for understanding the sources and magnitude of the city's GHG emissions. Valladolid's inventory includes emissions data from key sectors (buildings, transport, and industrial processes). The SECAP relies on the emissions inventory to set targets and develop emission reduction strategies in these key sectors over time.

In addition, as part of the EIT Climate-KIC Deep Demonstration programme carried out in Madrid in 2020, an economic model was developed to identify the most cost-effective decarbonisation strategies for the city. This model developed by Material Economics has served as the basis for the development of a common tool for the 7 cities of the Spanish Platform for Climate Neutrality, citiES2030. Adapted in order to be used to complete different tables of the Climate City Contract, this model uses a life-cycle approach to assess the economic viability of different decarbonisation strategies. This means that not only upfront costs are taken into account, but also the recurring costs and benefits of each option over its entire lifetime. In addition, the model takes into account the various costs associated with decarbonisation, such as the cost of renewable energy deployment, the cost of energy efficiency measures and the cost of changes in transport systems, among others.

The Economic Model for the decarbonisation of cities is a useful tool for cities to develop strategies to reduce their emissions. By combining the emissions inventory conducted under the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) with the costs and benefits provided by the Economic Model associated with different decarbonisation actions and strategies, cities can develop a comprehensive understanding of their emissions profile and identify the most cost-effective and efficient ways to reduce their carbon footprint.

Annex 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan – Valladolid

Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

Both the economic model and the SECAP emissions inventory aim to provide cities with the information they need to develop effective strategies and actions to reduce GHG emissions and improve energy efficiency. While they use different approaches to calculating emissions, both tools are useful for cities to make the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future.

Thus, although both instruments share certain similarities, the Economic Model and the emissions inventory developed under the SECAP estimate GHG emissions differently. These different approaches in the calculation of emissions result in a different quantification of the city's emissions between the two calculation methodologies. Although the final results are similar, the different approaches of the 2 methodologies result in two different emission inventories.

The Economic Model uses a "systems" approach to account for GHG emissions in cities. It looks at the entire urban system, including buildings and heating, transport, electricity and waste, and identifies emission sources and pathways. The model takes into account not only Scope 1 emissions (such as from combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles, etc.), but also Scope 2 emissions (i.e. emissions from the generation of electricity purchased and consumed) and some Scope 3 emissions (from waste management, where this takes place outside the boundaries of the municipality).

In contrast, the SECAP emissions inventory focuses on quantifying direct emissions from specific sectors, such as buildings, transport and waste. It follows established protocols and methodologies, such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (WRI/WBCSD), to ensure consistency and comparability across cities.

Another difference between the two approaches is the level of detail. The Economic Model is more detailed and granular, providing a complete picture of the urban system and how emissions are generated and flow through it. The PACES emissions inventory focuses more on specific sectors and follows a standardised format, making it easier to compare emissions between cities.

The Economic Model uses a BAU 2030 Business as Usual 2030 scenario as a reference to estimate the potential emission reductions that can be achieved through different decarbonisation strategies and actions. This scenario represents a projection of what the city's emissions trajectory would look like if no additional decarbonisation measures beyond those already planned or underway were implemented. The BAU 2030 scenario provides a baseline against which to compare the cost-effectiveness of different decarbonisation strategies and actions. By comparing the costs and benefits of different decarbonisation pathways with the BAU 2030 scenario, the model can estimate the potential ROI (Return on Investment) of each strategy and action.

The results of the BAU 2030 scenario for the city of Valladolid indicate that the electricity, buildings and heating and transport sectors account for  $65\%$  of emissions in this scenario. In the other sector, emissions from the industrial sector are included, with a special relevance in the city of Valladolid, representing  $36\%$  of global emissions. By considering the potential ROI of different decarbonisation strategies and actions, the Economic Model can help cities identify the most cost-effective ways to achieve their emission reduction targets by ensuring that limited resources are allocated to strategies and actions that provide maximum value for the city and its residents.

In order to develop a comprehensive understanding of the city's emissions profile and to identify the most cost-effective and efficient ways to reduce GHG emissions, the Climate City Contract makes extensive use of the emissions data provided by the Economic Model, so that the investments, costs and benefits presented in the model are consistent with the emissions resulting from the model. Furthermore, and given that the SECAP emissions inventory represents the starting point for the economic model emissions calculation, it has been considered appropriate to include the first 3 tables of Annex I (Climate Action Plan) to present the SECAP emissions inventory data. These are: A-1.1, A-1.2 and A-1.3. In addition, table A-1.4 is used to present the emissions resulting from the two calculation methodologies used, the SECAP emissions inventory calculation methodology and the methodology used by the Economic Model. The remaining quantitative tables of the model from table A-2.3 present the data provided by the Economic Model.

|  Strategy / Action Plan | Local | Integrated, Sustainable and Safe Urban Mobility Plan for Valladolid | The Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan is a strategic planning tool and an awareness-raising and sensitisation instrument for citizens, public administrations and other mobility stakeholders. It outlines a series of measures to achieve more sustainable and safer modes of travel, modes of transport that make economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection compatible, thus ensuring a better quality of life for the citizens of Valladolid. | The technical studies carried out under the low emission zone scenario proposed in the PIMUSSVA Plan show results in the reduction of Greenhouse Gases and pollutant gases of between -30% and -40% compared to the initial situation. Given the fact that we are currently working on a more ambitious LEZ proposal, we could be talking about an impact on emission reductions in the LEZ of close to double what was initially foreseen. | Development of a green economic and employment model based on knowledge and innovation.  |
|  Strategy / Action Plan | Local | Valladolid Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SECAP) | Valladolid City Council joined the Covenant of Mayors in April 2011. Among the commitments signed was to develop a Sustainable Energy and Sustainable Climate Action Plan (SEAP). Valladolid's SEAP was born in June 2012 and accepted by the European Commission in April 2013. In June 2016, the Covenant of Mayors chose to join forces with the Covenant of Mayors Coalition, resulting in the "Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy". The Covenant Signatories share a common vision for 2050: to accelerate the decarbonisation of their territories, strengthen their capacity to adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change and ensure that their citizens enjoy access to secure, sustainable and affordable energy. To translate their political commitment into practical measures and projects, Covenant signatories commit to present, within two years of the date of their local council decision, a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) outlining the key actions they intend to undertake. | Valladolid's Climate and Sustainable Energy Action Plan [PACES_VA] is aligned with the objectives of the 100 Smart and Climate Neutral Cities 2030 Mission, as in the Covenant of Mayors the signatory cities committed to support the achievement of the EU target of a 40% reduction of greenhouse gases by 2030 and the adoption of a joint approach to address climate change mitigation and adaptation. The local plan [PACES_VA] focuses on making the city climate neutral and generating an innovative ecosystem through a holistic, demand-driven approach based on the identified needs of the city. We highlight the alignment of the following projects with the European Mission, closely related to energy saving, energy diversification and the use of biomass as an alternative fuel: | Development of a green economic and employment model based on knowledge and innovation.  |

|  Strategy / Action Plan | Local | Valladolid Circular Economy Plan | The Circular Economy Action Plan (PAEC) of the city of Valladolid aims to bring together in a single document the approach and action measures of the City Council related to the circular economy for the three-year period 2021-2023. Its aim is to promote the circular economy as a paradigm of a new model with economic, environmental and social benefits, leading by example the development of urban policies, generating the conditions for its development in the productive fabric and in the responsible consumption of citizens, and facilitating synergies between actors. | Through the implementation of the Plan's actions, a target has been set to achieve a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 25% of total inventoried emissions by 2021. Taking into account that the implementation of this first plan only covers the period up to 2023, the percentage of emission reductions by 2030 will be close to 50%, in line with the most widespread forecasts of the scientific community, which assign to the circular economy a potential reduction of around 50% of total emissions. The plan incorporates actions that directly impact on emissions reduction: - Prevention and minimisation of waste generation - Waste recovery - both municipal solid waste and wastewater treatment waste - for use as energy or secondary materials - Applying proximity criteria for resource and energy supply | Encouraging citizen participation Developing a green economic and employment model based on knowledge and innovation  |

|  Strategy / Action Plan | Local | Valladolid Food Strategy | Throughout 2017 and 2018, the city of Valladolid and its surrounding area developed a process of reflection on the local agri-food system. The current local and international political context has opened a window of opportunity that has allowed Valladolid and its metropolitan area (the CUVA or Urban Community of Valladolid) to launch a participatory process for the drafting of its own food strategy. | Organic agriculture has proved to be an effective tool as an alternative to conventional agriculture, as a response to eliminate the impacts generated by the latter, in terms of the use of agrochemicals and pesticides that are harmful to the health of the environment and people, the overexploitation and depletion of soils, the use of GMOs, based on the maintenance of the structure and productive capacity of the soil, the use of crop rotations, the respect of biotic cycles, the closing of material cycles, thus reducing the generation of waste and emissions, thus being a tool for the fight against climate change. |   |
|  Strategy / Action Plan | Local | Local Agenda 21 - V Action Plan of Local Agenda 21 | Subsumed in the new Valladolid Urban Agenda 2030 (AUVA 2030) | The Climate Mission promotes the active role that citizens must play in its design and deployment. And, under this philosophy, it is especially relevant to involve the youngest groups in this process, promoting values of respect and care for the environment, since only through significant changes in our lifestyles can we aspire to climate neutrality. Local Action Plans 21 have been an exceptional tool for co-creation, participation and definition of urban planning. AUVA 2030 takes up the lessons learned and the co-creation and participation groups of the Local Agenda 21 Action Plans. | It proposes a more efficient public management model that translates into improved municipal financing capacity and improved delivery of innovative public services.  |
|  Strategy / Action Plan | National | National Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2021-2030 | The National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (PNACC) 2021-2030 is the basic planning instrument to promote coordinated action against the effects of climate change in Spain. Its main objective is to avoid or reduce present and future damages derived from climate change and to build a more resilient economy and society.The PNACC 2021-2030 has been the result of a collective process of analysis, reflection and public participation. | Integration - Strengthening governance for local transformation. The Valladolid Climate Change Strategy is broken down into four levels of governance. On the one hand, it is based on the priorities of the European Missions on Climate Neutral Cities and Adapting Communities (what we have called the institutional governance level Type A: Europe), complemented at the next level by plans and measures at national level that are foreseen as necessary at local level in the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change 2021-2023 (PNACC) and the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (PNIEC) (Type B: National).

|  Strategy / Action Plan | National | National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (PNIEC) 2021-2030 | The PNIEC aims for a 23% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to 1990. This reduction target implies eliminating one out of every three tonnes of greenhouse gases currently emitted. This effort is consistent with an increase in ambition at European level by 2030, as well as with the Paris Agreement. The text sent coincides with the one currently included in the public consultation phase of the Strategic Environmental Study (SEA) of the plan and which was already sent to Brussels last January, as an updated draft. With this new communication to the European Commission, Spain complies with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. | Integration - Strengthening governance for local transformation.

Annex 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan – Valladolid
A-2.2: Description and evaluation of policies

From the list of policies, strategies and regulations in the table above it is important to highlight:

Comprehensive local strategic planning aligned with key regional, national and European regulations
Climate Action Commitments and Agreements in which Valladolid City Council sets ambitious climate action targets.
Strengthening international, European and national networks to maximise synergies, co-creation and participation with other cities in a common goal: the European Green Deal.
Climate justice as a cross-cutting policy in all local strategic pillars identified in the table above. Climate justice refers to the idea that all people have the right to a safe and healthy environment, regardless of their geographic location, ethnicity, gender, age or socio-economic status. It is also defined as an ethical and political issue, as far as global warming is concerned, since its effects include concepts of justice (environmental justice and social justice), equality, human and collective rights, and historical responsibility. This concept is intended to protect the most vulnerable communities, which are often the most affected by the impacts of climate change, as they have fewer resources to adapt and recover from these impacts. In addition, it also recognises the historical responsibility of industrialised countries in the emission of greenhouse gases that have contributed to climate change, and advocates for an equitable approach to reducing emissions and adopting renewable energy technologies and policies to ensure a more sustainable future for all.

Against this background, the EU calls for an integrated and equitable approach to combating climate change, taking into account human rights, gender equality, social inclusion and solidarity between countries and communities.

And it is precisely this approach that Valladolid City Council has adopted to shape the Climate Action Plan, in which all the transformative actions included in it are carried out for and with the people who live in our city, with a special focus on the most vulnerable groups from a socio-economic perspective, but also from an environmental perspective: groups suffering from energy poverty, groups living in urban and environmentally degraded areas, groups experiencing the digital divide, etc.

And, in the same way, the conception of the Climate Action Plan under the principles of climate justice also responds to the concept of co-responsibility. Consequently, it is considered essential that historically polluting sectors, such as those linked to industry in the city, actively engage in this transformation.

This is reflected in the fact that the Climate Investment Plan will allocate 12% of the total investment needed to climate justice. The portfolio of transformative actions presented below has been developed under the logic that the Valladolid Climate City Contract is based on the concept of climate justice advocated by the European Union as an essential element of the required green transformation.

# A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers

One of the main barriers lies in the availability and capacity of the resources available to the City Council. It is necessary to adapt the roles and profiles of the work teams, with a more transversal vision. It is also necessary to implement innovative schemes that contribute to overcoming the difficulties inherent to the difficulty of the administrative process.

The following systemic barriers and the approach to overcome them are highlighted:

Insufficient administrative and/or operational capacity and lack of internal human resources. It is necessary to define new functions and profiles with a broader cross-cutting vision.
Need for a "refocusing of public work that leads us to think in terms of climate neutrality: how many CO2 emissions are avoided with this project, this tender, this procedure, this regulation, etc.?
Regulatory red tape: overly complicated procedures with bureaucracy. A balance is needed between security/transparency and efficiency.
Fragmentation of responsibilities: Complex solutions require innovative schemes, not fragmented policies, levels of government, siloed department...
Difficulties in building public-private partnerships: a well-established legal framework. A different perspective on expectations is needed.
Very high investment costs: new technological solutions linked to climate actions involve very significant costs.
Lack of funding/financing schemes: new thinking beyond subsidies with the introduction of innovative funding mechanisms.

# A-3.3: Description or visualisation of the city's participatory model for climate neutrality

Valladolid City Council aims to involve the entire innovation and economic development ecosystem of the city within a broad strategy of inclusion and participation of all key entities to achieve the goal of climate neutrality in the city.

In the current context of cooperation and collaboration with the main driving and dynamising agents, Valladolid City Council recognises and supports this involvement, interest and participation through the creation of the Local Mission Platform, as the space that brings together all the city's agents who will work in favour of the city's climate neutrality.

This Local Mission Platform seeks to facilitate and enhance:

The leaderships distributed in the 4 helices of the ecosystem with the capacity and willingness to adhere to the Valladolid Climate City Contract
A new multi-level governance model in which clear climate commitments are defined by the different administrative levels;
Multi-agent involvement: individuals, families, schools, universities, associations, businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises, large corporations, etc. with a climate justice perspective.

All of this with generating a space and process of collective intelligence and action capable of transforming the city and accelerating the ecological transition from the decisions, areas of influence, sectors, activities and knowledge of each of the agents included in this Local Mission Platform. In the work process of this Local Mission Platform, it is necessary to highlight the exemplary role assumed by Valladolid City Council itself, which, under a dual approach that addresses both the political and technical layers, will assume responsibility for the dynamisation of the Local Platform.

The signing of this contract has already led to the adhesion of numerous agents with a great impact on the city and the territory, such as for example (the list of adhered corporations is developed in more detail in appendix III):

Public Company of Infrastructures and Environment of Castilla y León.
The Natural Heritage Foundation of Castilla y León.
The Institute for Business Competitiveness.
Ente Regional para la Energia de Castilla y León.
The Spanish Association of Biomass Energy Recovery (AVEBIOM).
The Consumers' Union of Castilla y León.
The CEOE Valladolid...

# B-1.2: Description of the impact pathways

Taking the sectors and sub-sectors from the Material Economics economic model, the interventions and actions that have a direct impact on the reduction of CO2 emissions have been identified for each of them.

Within mobility and freight transport, the actions indicated reflect an impact on the different objectives set for 2030 in subsectors such as the reduction of the need for motorised transport or the modal shift in city travel, increasing the use of public transport and non-motorised systems. The electrification of public transport also has a corresponding impact on the sector's overall climate neutrality objective. It is important to mention at this point that demonstration projects such as Ciudades Conectadas aim to increase the use of public transport among the population, and is also a collaborative project with other Spanish cities.

One of the main ways of impacting the electrification of freight distribution in the city is the implementation of the intermodal logistics platform, which will enable rail freight transport to be promoted as the backbone of multimodal logistics chains. This platform will allow Valladolid, within its position in the Atlantic Corridor of the European TEN-T network, to establish itself as a strategic intermodal node in the country. The Atlantic Corridor is the multimodal connection that connects Portugal, Spain, France, Germany and Ireland and provides services for people and goods, and is therefore key to logistics development and the connection between urban nodes.

The decarbonisation of heating in the city is one of the main impact pathways to be developed within the framework of the Mission in the city of Valladolid. Previous experience in the development of district heating networks will be the basis to promote these solutions on a massive scale in the city, including neighbourhood participation, and with demonstration projects that manage to bring positive energy districts forward. A close collaboration with the University of Valladolid and the Regional Government will allow an acceleration of these solutions in different neighbourhoods. Neighbourhood participation and citizen engagement is also a key aspect for the activation of energy communities that serve as a pathway to impact.

One of the sectors of particular importance in the city of Valladolid is the industrial sector, due to the concentration of several energy-intensive factories within the city centre. The decarbonisation of the sector is also essential to achieve the objectives of the Mission. To achieve this, the sector must adhere to the Mission's commitments, integrating the private and business sector into the Mission's Local Platform. The City Council is promoting actions, such as the decarbonisation aid plan, which serve to boost collaboration with the Mission's objectives among the productive business fabric. Increase in the number of trees planted.

Nature-based actions and solutions will create carbon sinks in the city to offset the city's residual emissions.

With the aim of favouring the city of proximity, actions are proposed to achieve an equitable distribution of public space and improve coexistence between all modes of transport, recovering the role of the pedestrian as opposed to the car. The reduction of traffic flow and modification of current internal mobility patterns will contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions in the sector with actions and projects such as the implementation of the low emission zone, incentives for the use of public transport (SPINE project), the AEROSOLFD project, or the Connected Cities project. Citizen participation and encouragement is a key factor, for which actions are developed through participatory processes to include citizens in decision-making. As an example of this, actions are developed such as: PE4Trans project, road education campaigns, "Mobility As a Service" solutions, incentives for electric mobility, Valladolid Urban Agenda 2030 and promotion of car sharing. The use of citizen incentive tools such as those developed in the Remourban project also contribute to the objectives of the mission. Actions such as the intermodal logistics platform or the optimisation of the urban distribution of goods with projects such as Transforming Transport or URBANE, will also make it possible to reduce emissions in the sector. The City Council is committed to the development of training and collaboration actions as shown by its participation in the CENYL network or projects such as Prospect Plus.  |
|  Buildings and heating (Urbanism) | ·Package of (technical and economic) measures for the promotion of energy-efficient renovation of private buildings. ·Rehabilitation Office as an assistance service for citizens and companies. ·Special Plan for the rehabilitation of vulnerable areas. | The energy renovation and rehabilitation of the building stock is one of the priorities to achieve the decarbonisation of the sector. To this end, different actions are proposed to boost the application of energy efficiency and renovation solutions, and to promote decision-making by the different agents involved: construction sector, citizens, public sector, etc. Projects such as LEGOFIT, or pilot projects  |

|   | · Development of measures for new buildings under high energy efficiency standards. · Incentives for the renovation of electrical equipment in dwellings · New district heating in the city. · Promotion of high-efficiency heat pump equipment installations · Sustainable tourism promotion plans | such as Multi-stakeholder Innovative & Systemic Solutions for Urban Regeneration: Spain, are a good representation of the type of actions that will be developed in the city. Boosting the role of the Local Municipal Energy Agency as a service to help citizens and businesses will enable the deployment of energy efficiency projects both in new buildings and in the refurbishment of private or municipally owned buildings. The other major area where the City Council is focusing its actions is the decarbonisation of residential heating systems through the implementation and development of district heating networks, which allow the elimination of fossil fuels through the use of centralised systems with biofuels. The extension of existing heat networks, together with the development of district heating that allow the replacement of individual boilers in households, are the major actions planned in the city with the support of the regional government.  |

It is committed to a circular economy vision for the energy use of solid waste and wastewater, including the installation of solar panels and prioritising locally sourced biomass. In terms of the challenges to be overcome in relation to adaptation, the importance of considering changes in energy demand in the face of events associated with climate change is highlighted.  |

Valladolid City Council has been carrying out various actions to promote the circular economy since 2017, following its adherence to the Seville Declaration of Spanish municipalities for the circular economy. The city has been a case study in the OECD's Circular Economy in Cities and Regions Programme, which analysed the potential of the circular economy in the city and laid the foundations for future action in this area, identifying the triple municipal role as promoter, facilitator and enabler. In this way, our mission in Valladolid is to promote the circular economy as a paradigm of a new model with economic, environmental and social benefits and to facilitate the conditions for its development. Our vision is to make Valladolid a benchmark city in circular economy, considering it as key to our goal of being a climate neutral city by 2030.  |

|  Action plan | Name of the action | Low Emission Zone (LEZ)  |
|   |  Type of action | Reduction of traffic flow and modification of current internal mobility patterns to reduce their CO2 emissions - Regulation  |
|   |  Description of the action | Low Emission Zone: The Climate Change Law determines the obligation of cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants to have low emission zones which, not only limit the entry of polluting vehicles, but must also facilitate healthy forms of travel for citizens, such as cycling or walking, or via public transport. Valladolid is immersed in this process which, following the approval of the Air Quality Improvement Plan, requires the processing and approval of a specific ordinance. Next4Mob Project: Aims to design new tools to measure the effects of mobility. Valladolid will provide the experimental approach where the intention is to implement a Low Emission Zone. The implementation of Next4Mob will be carried out by a multidisciplinary consortium that brings together three leading research institutes: the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC: lead applicant), the Centro de Investigacion en Transporte (TRANSyT) of the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, the Sum + Lab research group on Transport at the University of Cantabria and the Empresa de Transporte Publico de Valladolid (AUVASA). The main output of Next4Mob will be the quantitative tool developed, which provides policy makers and professional transport planners with an instrument to assess the environmental and social impact of transport policy actions, including the management of low probability, high impact events (e.g. pandemics). The total fundable budget of the project amounts to 322,070.90 euros.  |

|  Switching to public and non-motorised transport  |   |   |
|  Action plan | Name of the action | Modal shift in city mobility  |
|   |  Type of action | Promoting public transport, cycling mobility and non-motorised transport  |
|   |  Description of the action | Development and implementation of actions within the strategic framework of the Valladolid Urban Agenda 2030 to promote efficient and sustainable mobility and enable modal shift in the city towards non-motorised transport (pedestrianisation of cities, travel by public transport, cycling). All these actions will help to achieve the specific objective of favouring the city of proximity. Sustainable mobility and transport is one of the strategic priorities indicated in the Urban Agenda 2030, and its approach is based on the following main points: reducing the use of private vehicles by improving the integrated offer of sustainable mobility services, adapting urban and interurban transport infrastructures to new mobility modes, promoting universal urban accessibility, improving co-responsibility and the role of citizens in the management of safe, sustainable and efficient mobility, and integrating urban and territorial planning by establishing policies aimed at reducing the need for mobility. Public bicycle loan system: New public bicycle system with a coverage of 82% of the population with a station at 250 m, being the reference for access to the stations in less than 5 minutes on foot. Intermodality, performance and service to citizens will be improved. The system will have 97 stations, 1900 docking stations and 950 bicycles in service (239 electric). The service will be managed through an APP, which will be interoperable with other systems that may arise. Total cost: 7,571,554 €. Secure bicycle parking: Secure bicycle parking service with automatic and video-monitored covered parking modules with different capacities and two types: with pedestrian access door (more capacity) or those with a capacity of 10/20 bicycles. It will have secure access control via a free application with 24-hour assistance service. Total cost 889,641 SPINE Project: Development of innovative digital tools and simulation models that will allow the analysis of different solutions in the field of public mobility, considering mobility as a service. These tools will take into account inclusive transport or the development of applications for citizens to access different mobility services in real time. The objectives of the project are to increase the use of public transport by 30% and cycling by 10%, contributing to the reduction of emissions in the city. City Council budget: €240,000  |

|   |  | Vertical mobility: Promotion of pedestrian routes through improved accessibility and vertical mobility actions. The promotion of pedestrian mobility within the neighbourhood, accessible to all by means of lifting and transport facilities that overcome the unevenness of its orography, also encourages the use of public transport - especially for major sporting or cultural events - and discourages the use of private vehicles, thereby contributing to the reduction of polluting emissions and the commitment to sustainable urban mobility systems. Demonstrator projects: Actions in the San Isidro and Parquesol neighbourhoods. Total cost: 12.432.782 €, Grant: 6.805.418 Sustainable mobility to work: Actions carried out in urban centres to adapt mobility in a scenario of new requirements derived from the post-COVID-19 period (MOVES) Total cost: 18,634 €. PE4Trans: Participatory project for the improvement of public transport policies by including citizens in the process of designing and implementing sustainable transport strategies and plans with a view to changing people's mobility habits and routines by incorporating the results of behavioural science. P4Trans partners adopt the approach "for the people, by the people and with the people" as a guiding principle for possible policy improvements, which go in two directions: - Influencing behavioural change in citizens by using knowledge and best practices of environmental solutions based on advances in economics, sociology and psychology to stimulate people towards more sustainable routines and habits, - Launch in participating territories of transferable mechanisms for public participation in policy formulation processes. As a result, specific solutions will be developed in a participatory way in each of the partner territories, improving the use of sustainable mobility solutions and contributing to a substantial reduction of the carbon footprint, benefiting from the results both policy makers and inhabitants. Total cost: 1.430.658 € (208.312 € municipal budget) Connected Cities: Development and implementation of an open source, multi-city digital platform for the collection, processing and exploitation of mobility data in an integrated and interoperable way. It will provide different urban mobility and mobility management services in a coordinated way, including the joint management of money transfers with users. This platform will be unique and common for the cities of Valladolid, Valencia, Vitoria-Gasteiz, Logroño, Gijón and Fuenlabrada. Total cost: 27.704.479€. Control centre for the integrated management of sustainable mobility in public transport: Adaptation and modernisation of the control centre for the urban bus operation assistance and user information service. The control centre is the operational brain of the Valladolid city bus network and the place where the service quality parameters are monitored (punctuality, regularity, commercial speed, inclusion of reinforcement cars, incident resolution, etc.). In order to improve, optimise and provide a top-level service, a real-time connection is required, both with the mobility centre of the city of Valladolid, the police and emergency services and with the vehicles, weather parameters and passenger monitoring. Total cost: 1.635.821€.  |

|   |  Type of action | Development of Valladolid, within its position in the Atlantic Corridor of the European TEN-T network, as a strategic intermodal node within the network of intermodal and logistics terminals in the country, recognised by the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda (MITMA) in its document Mercancías 30, which aims to promote rail freight transport as the backbone of multimodal logistics chains, as a mechanism to achieve the objectives of decarbonisation and sustainability of transport. Likewise, the MITMA's Safe, Sustainable and Connected Mobility Strategy 2030, in its axis 6 "Intermodal and Intelligent Logistics Chains" foresees four lines of action related to: Increasing rail freight transport 2. Intermodality policy 3. Urban distribution of goods 4. Digitalisation of the logistics chain. The Atlantic Corridor is the multimodal connection that connects Portugal, Spain, France, Germany and Ireland and provides services for people and goods, making it key to logistical development and the connection between urban nodes. It is made up of the different modes of transport: road, rail, port, air, river and multimodal, and therefore, in addition to rail and road routes, it includes the most important ports, airports, intermodal stations and cities.  |
|   |  Description of the action | Use of the different current financing mechanisms, both European and national, to set up a first class intermodal logistics platform (PLIVA) in the city of Valladolid, taking advantage of the synergy of the New Railway Complex located in the eastern part of the city, the new freight terminal and the start-up by ADIF of the Valladolid East Freight Bypass. This is a highly complex process and requires special coordination in its overall planning from the railway, road, town planning and budgetary perspectives, as well as cooperation and collaboration between all the agents and logistics operators involved.  |

|   |  Description of the action | Supply of heating and hot water to residential and tertiary buildings, eliminating fossil fuel boilers. Packages of measures will be created to promote climate neutrality in the private building stock. Progress will be made in the creation of at least one Positive Energy District. Positive Energy Districts are urban areas with near-zero net CO2 emissions, aimed at producing annual surpluses of locally generated renewable energy. In other words, they are urban environments that generate more energy than they consume and share the energy surplus.
Implementation of sustainable district heating in the city of Valladolid, complementing those already planned or under implementation, to provide centralised urban renewable energy supply services. Interconnection of the buildings dependent on the City Council and the Junta de Castilla y León to these networks.
Action 2. PILOT PROJECT FOR THE REHABILITATION OF HOUSING BLOCKS AND INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGIES Demonstrative project for the rehabilitation of housing blocks and the integration of renewable energies to act in some 200 homes that currently have individual heating systems using fossil energies, which improves their thermal envelopes, adapts their interior installations to centralise heating and hot water services, incorporates solar photovoltaic installations for self-consumption and interconnects the buildings with the city's sustainable district heating, all with the aim of drastically reducing their CO2 emissions.

# B-2.3: Summary of residual emissions strategy

Valladolid City Council monitors emissions according to the Emissions Inventory developed within the framework of the Covenant of Mayors, with emission reduction targets defined in the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP 2030).

As developed in the previous sections of Annex I, with the ambition of achieving climate neutrality by 2030, the city has established a series of actions and interventions in the different sectors and levers defined:

Mobility and freight transport.
Consumption and emissions in the buildings sector
Renewable energy generation.
Waste and Wastewater Management
Decarbonisation of the industrial sector

Residual emissions from each of these sectors will be offset by carbon sinks in the city. To this end, the city's strategy is based on planting more urban trees, increasing the forest area, creating urban carbon sinks, implementing urban renaturation measures through nature-based solutions for CO2 fixation and offsetting the local carbon footprint.

The City Council's strategy called "Urban Biodiversity Pathways" includes actions for the renaturalisation of urban structures and the creation of "island forests" in the city that will contribute to the creation of carbon sinks. It is worth mentioning actions such as "El bosque de los Sueños" (Soto de la Medinilla).

# PART C - ACHIEVING CLIMATE NEUTRALITY BY 2030

## MODULE C-1
Organisational and governance innovation interventions

The complexity of the challenge of achieving climate neutrality by 2030 requires, first of all, that Public Administrations significantly modify the way they organise themselves internally, while at the same time generating new governance models both internally and externally. The innovative interventions in terms of organisation and governance presented below are a compendium of actions currently underway in the City Council and others that we want to activate in the near future, all of them following the logic of multi-actor collaboration, distributed leadership and multilevel governance.

The creation of the "Mission Team" is of particular interest, as it should bring together the different key people in the City Council and its instrumental bodies. Technical training both internally and in the local ecosystem of Valladolid must play an important role.

The Agency for Innovation and Economic Development already gathers a multidisciplinary team focused on innovation and sustainability, where even recently (January 2023) a senior technician with experience in the financial sector has joined, with expertise in project financing in the corporate sector, investment planning and fundraising for the management and implementation of projects with specific purposes in the field of ESG (Environmental Social Governance), and CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility).

*NOTE: the need for such a profile was already identified in the Expression of Interest to the 100 Cities Mission. Valladolid identified the importance of bringing together, from the outset, all the necessary skills to ensure the coordination of all the economic agents involved, hence the decision to have the resource integrated into the team and not to outsource it, in order to ensure financial support, opportunities for project implementation and value creation within the framework of the challenges of the Climate City Contract.

Elimination of administrative silos, effective and efficient management of resources associated with the municipal organisational structure.  |
|  Consolidation of the Climate Team (Mission Team) | In line with the above, consolidate and strengthen the Mission team that was first defined last summer in the UIMP Course and that has been reinforced with the implementation of this Climate City Contract. | City Hall | Municipal Areas/Secretary General/General Secretariat/Intervention General | A more prepared administration, a local administration for climate neutrality. | It proposes a more efficient public management model that translates into improved financing capacity and improved delivery of innovative public services.  |
|  Alignment with Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan implementation | In line with the internal reorganisation, the integrated political-technical coordination of the implementation of the RTR plan makes it possible to reinforce and align the objectives with the Climate Mission. | Mayor's Office/RTR Commission/RTR Technical Committee |  | Led by the Mayor, it will seek synergies for the effective management and coordination of the Climate Mission and Next Generation funds. | It proposes a more efficient public management model that translates into improved municipal financing capacity and improved delivery of innovative public services.  |

# C-1.2: Description of organisational and governance interventions

The challenge facing cities requires the creation of new forms of internal organisation and also new models of governance, both internal and external, that allow us to provide effective and environmentally sustainable responses to citizens. To this end, the City Council has decided to act on different levers which, although they have a vision of comprehensive improvement, have a direct impact on the short, medium and long-term development of this Climate City Contract.

**Internal reorganisation measures of Valladolid City Council:**

**Measures linked to better use, development and management of European projects/financing.**

The Next Generation EU Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan has meant a "cascade" of funding such as public administrations had probably not previously experienced. Beyond its logical benefits, this also presented major internal challenges in terms of the technical and managerial capacity of municipal teams. For this reason, as early as December 2020, various instruments were set up to strategically and operationally guide these funds: the Valladolid City Council's Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan Commission (PRTR) and the Technical Committee for Project Coordination. These instruments have made it possible to break down internal silos and provide the City Council with greater internal transversality between municipal areas. These lessons learned invite us to continue along this path also with a view to developing the Climate Action Plan which, as we have seen, is nourished by sectorially diverse actions and, therefore, dependent on different municipal areas. Thus, the possibility of creating cross-cutting teams is also being studied from the perspective of the Climate Mission.

**Instruments to support climate mission-oriented innovation**

This internal transformation must be accompanied by different types of instruments that allow the ecosystem to make available real capacities to decarbonise the city and transform the city model of Valladolid from the perspective of sustainability. Among them, it is worth highlighting:

New regulatory instruments to advance the sustainable transformation of the city. It is worth highlighting the new municipal ordinance to implement a regulatory Sandbox, as it has made us one of the first cities in Spain to implement this type of instrument to promote experimentation and innovative testing using public resources. Likewise, Instruction 1/2018, to promote socially efficient procurement: strategic, integral and sustainable in the City Council of Valladolid and the entities of its public sector, has made it possible to significantly improve public procurement processes, not only in relation to formal aspects (transparency, advertising, etc.), but, above all, giving more weight to procurement criteria of a social and environmental nature.
New instruments to boost the city's ecosystem to develop innovative projects aimed at Valladolid's Climate Mission. Here we highlight the first call for grants for innovative projects with climate decarbonisation objectives.
Enablers of climate neutrality: the Agency for Innovation and Economic Development being one of the main catalysts for the Mission to become the main actor supporting the internal organisation of the City Council and the local ecosystem of Valladolid.

New tools to harness the potential of data to advance the Valladolid Climate Mission. There is no doubt that the climate mission has a direct relationship with digital transformation, as the second pillar of the transformation pursued by Europe as a whole. Therefore, with initiatives such as the SMARTVA! Smart Platform, the data that is managed as a public administration is made available to the climate mission.

# C-2.2: Description of social and other innovation actions

Beyond existing instruments and spaces for deliberation and social co-creation such as the Social Council of the City or the AUVA2030 Urban Agenda Council, it is necessary to involve the entire innovation and economic development ecosystem of the city of Valladolid within a broad strategy of inclusion and participation of all key entities to achieve the goal of climate neutrality in the city. With this objective in mind, and with the Local Mission Platform as an umbrella that brings together the rest of the elements, a collective call to action is made which, under the logic of open innovation, allows specific joint work spaces to be built with:

Citizens, for which it is proposed to set up a Climate Assembly, in which the citizens themselves will be the driving force for change and the necessary transformations at neighbourhood level, but also at city level, to achieve climate neutrality.
Spaces for co-creation and involvement of agents for climate neutrality, extending the concept of citizen science and climate co-creation. Co-creation and participation with the innovative productive ecosystem, in which the Innovation and Sustainability Hub will be a space for networking between innovative productive agents in the field of sustainability oriented towards the deployment of projects for the decarbonisation of the city. The Innovation and Sustainability Hub is scheduled to open in July 2023.
And finally, the Academy, for which it is intended to strengthen the collaboration of the City Council with the University of Valladolid and the private University UEMC, shaping a long-term working space that, pivoting on the project "Valladolid Climate Neutral University of Valladolid", will generate new capacities, knowledge and spaces for University-City collaboration.

# ACTORS OF THE CITY OF VALLADOLID AND COMMITMENTS UNDERTAKEN

Valladolid City Council aims to involve the entire innovation and economic development ecosystem of the city of Valladolid within a broad strategy of inclusion and participation of all key entities to achieve the goal of climate neutrality in the city.

In the current context of cooperation and collaboration with the main drivers and promoters of climate neutrality, Valladolid City Council recognises and supports this involvement, interest and participation by inviting them to join the Climate City Contract.

In this way, the letter of adhesion to the Climate City Contract is received as a recognition of the support and interest shown, encouraging continuity and involvement in the commitment to achieve together the climate neutrality of Valladolid.

The response of these entities, associations, collectives, foundations and academic institutions has been very rapid, committed and with a clear ratification of their interest in working towards a broad-based climate neutrality.

Multi-stakeholder involvement is key to urban transformation, which also allows actions and plans to be of greater benefit to all citizens. Ecosystem actors include business associations, professional associations, business groups, neighbourhood associations, foundations, workers' associations, trade unions, industrial clusters, consumer groups and citizen participation support platforms.

The Government of the Autonomous Community of Castilla y León also wanted to be part of this Climate City Contract, identified as a key actor in the multilevel governance necessary to achieve the goal of a climate neutral, inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable city by 2030. This commitment has been reflected at the highest level with the accession of the two most involved ministries with competences aligned to the achievement of climate neutrality, such as the Ministry of Environment, Housing and Spatial Planning, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Furthermore, reflecting the executive and implementation character, the regional government's adhesions are also specified with the main instrumental entities of the regional government in this field, specifically: the

Annex 3: Individual Signatory Commitments – Valladolid
Ayuntamiento de Valladolid

Public Society for Infrastructures and Environment of Castilla y León; the Natural Heritage Foundation of Castilla y León; the Institute for Business Competitiveness and the Regional Entity for Energy of Castilla y León.

Likewise, the City Council of Valladolid, in the commitment acquired with the European Union, by participating in the European Mission of Climate Neutral Cities to serve as an inspiring city, is committed to continue seeking support, collaborations or other initiatives that join and can adhere to the Climate City Contract.

In this regard, the main commitments and adhesions obtained in this first stage of launching, promoting and developing the Climate City Contract, as well as the ratification and description of the commitments made by the entities, associations and different professional groups contacted, are detailed below:
