# Summary

## Textual element

In the Münster climate neutrality 2030 target scenario, CO₂ emissions fall by more than 95% compared to 1990. In 1990, annual emissions totalled 2,618,000 tonnes. A 95% reduction means reducing emissions by 2,487,000 tonnes annually in 2030 compared to 1990. Since this goal complies with the goal of reducing 82 percent of the 2021 baseline year GHG emissions calculated by the Economic Model, the Münster climate neutrality 2030 target meets the requirements of the "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" mission.

City Group Münster's action plan centres on a mix of technical fields of action with high CO₂ reduction potential and non-technical fields of action that are primarily centred around a cultural transformation of Münster society:

Energy production
Mobility
Building carbon reduction measures
Business and academia
Climate budget
Education and food

City Group Münster's action plan is not a rigid plan. Rather, the action plan is a flexible framework for action with which the City Group can react to changing framework conditions and requirements in future. A successful climate and energy transition requires that we start implementing, prioritising and developing change processes that have been developed in concepts and plans. To this end, Münster is focussing on the implementation of strategic projects that lie within the scope of action of the City Group and with which direct and indirect influence can be exerted on the implementation of climate protection measures. Direct influence means that City Group Münster can realise climate protection measures itself. Indirect influence means that City Group Münster sets the framework conditions, but that realisation of climate protection measures is highly dependent on the involvement of Münster society. For example, the City Group Münster exerts indirect influence on increasing the share of cycling from the current 47 per cent to 55 per cent of the modal split by improving the cycle infrastructure further in order to make cycling more attractive for its citizens.

Strategic City Group Münster projects bring about the realisation of climate protection-related projects and measures in City Group Münster and in Münster society by

making change possible
setting clear rules

Strategic projects therefore form the framework for implementation projects through which City Group Münster or Münster society ultimately realise the climate protection process and ensure its success.

When departments and specialised offices implement projects relevant to climate protection, they run a wide variety of citizen participation initiatives to enable citizens to help to shape these projects. With the message "Münster is becoming a climate city" and the climate city contract, a process has been launched that aims to bring together as many stakeholders in Münster society as possible, including the City Administration, City Group Münster, companies, associations, citizens, clubs and climate activists. The motto for this process is, "Because it takes all of us". The focus of the process is primarily on information, activation and motivation. Climate protection is not solely a municipal task. It can succeed only with the help of Münster society.

The goals set out in the Climate City Contract can only be achieved in close co-operation with Münster society and with the state, federal government and EU. The Climate City Contract is intended as an innovative instrument for bringing these groups together and deepening their cooperation in multiple areas. At the time of submission, the Climate City Contract of the City of Münster and the linked goal of climate neutrality for Münster are supported by around 70 commitments from individual citizens, civil society institutions, universities and businesses. This circle will be expanded over the course of the mission.

# 1 Introduction

The introduction should outline the local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and describe the gap it is addressing in broad terms.

Table 1 Introduction - textual element

|  Introduction - textual element  |

|  Münster climate neutrality 2030  |
|  In ratifying the Paris Climate Agreement, the Federal Republic of Germany has entered into a binding commitment under international law to meet the climate targets set out therein. These targets mandate limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The recommendation is that if possible this increase should not exceed 1.5 degrees. Although a binding transformation pathway for Germany and therefore local authorities has not yet been charted, it is clear that municipal climate protection targets need to be renegotiated and realigned.  |
|  On 11 December 2019, the City Council passed a resolution to strive for climate neutrality by 2030. Against the backdrop of the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, Münster City Council uses the following definition of climate neutrality:  |
|  • The City of Münster will no longer produce any energy-related greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  |
|  • The energy-related carbon budget needed to achieve the 1.5 degree target will be adhered to.  |
|  • The City of Münster is prioritising the avoidance and reduction of greenhouse gases in the city.  |
|  • Greenhouse gases will be offset where this is necessary to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 and will be informally considered during accounting.  |
|  • Offsetting will be carried out to the extent required first locally and then regionally.  |
|  The resolution relates to the urban area of Münster, an area of 303.3 square kilometres. As of 2022, Münster had 320,946 inhabitants. According to the City of Münster's energy and greenhouse gas inventory for 2021 (published in 2023), CO2 emissions break down as follows: Private households 28 per cent, commerce and miscellaneous 30 per cent, industry 11 per cent and transport 31 per cent.  |
|  In the Münster climate neutrality 2030 target scenario, CO2 emissions will fall by over 95% compared to 1990. In 1990, annual emissions amounted to 2,618,000 tonnes, so that a reduction of 95% means a reduction in annual emissions of 2,487,000 tonnes in 2030 compared to 1990. Since this goal complies with the goal of reducing 82 percent of the 2021 baseline year GHG emissions calculated by the Economic Model, the Münster climate neutrality 2030 target meets the requirements of the "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" mission.  |

Thanks to wide-ranging climate protection efforts over the last 30 years and a good decentralised energy supply, in 2020 carbon emission intensity, at 5.8 t/a per inhabitant, was well below the national average. Münster is therefore on the right track.

If we are to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, meeting percentage emissions reduction targets alone is not sufficient. To achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, it is also necessary to limit total greenhouse gas emissions in absolute terms. The term carbon budget is used to illustrate how much $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can be emitted per capita in order to limit global warming to $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. The German Advisory Council on the Environment (SRU) recommends setting a German carbon budget compatible with the Paris Climate Agreement and tightening climate targets accordingly. The carbon budget is intended as a broad-based assessment tool to help achieve these targets.

There are no binding methodological guidelines for calculating the carbon budget at municipal level. If the population principle recommended by the SRU is applied to the distribution within Germany, this results in a share of around 51 tonnes per person to meet the 1.5 degree target. The population principle also specifies an equal per capita emissions right for every person on earth.

The "Münster Climate Neutrality 2030" concept study calculated a carbon budget for Münster for the period 2020/2021 using the then applicable baseline data. This was based on the assumption that the 1.5 degree target would be met. At the time of the calculation, this meant that Münster, with a population of around 310,000 people, would have a budget of around 15,800,000 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by 2050.

In accordance with the territorial principle (BISKO standard), the City of Münster only accounts for energy-related greenhouse gases, including methane and nitrous oxide in the form of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalents. In applying the carbon budget to the budget limits for Münster, the following assumptions were therefore made: The National Inventory Report on the German Greenhouse Gas Inventory found that approximately $93\%$ of emissions ($\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, methane and nitrous oxide) are energy-related. Budget analysis was based on just 14,700,000 tonnes of the 15,800,000 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ described above. To generate a residual footprint, from this budget we deducted annual emissions for Münster in the form of the BISKO inventory. As soon as this total becomes negative, Münster's budget is used up and the municipality is considered to have failed to meet the 1.5 degree target. Since the BISKO inventory includes both $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalents, this represents a conservative approach.

The "Münster climate neutrality 2030" target scenario describes absolute changes in greenhouse gas emissions and changes over time needed to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 and compliance with the 1.5 degree target. The figure below highlights the need to accelerate reductions over time in that it also shows the change in GHG emissions since 1990.

# "Because it takes all of us" - Climate neutrality as a task for all stakeholders

Against the backdrop of the Council resolution to aim for climate neutrality as early as 2030, City Administration Münster commissioned the Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 study. The concept study describes a potential theoretical path to climate neutrality by 2030, associated challenges and areas where action can be taken. The study highlights challenges (e.g. a deep renovation rate of  $8\%$  by 2030) that, from today's perspective, appear unrealistic. At the same time, it is becoming apparent that some processes in our fields of action, such as a switch to electromobility by 2030 and construction of new buildings to the Plus Energy standard, have become much more likely. Until a few years ago, for example, it would have been considered unrealistic that commercial companies would choose to stop producing internal combustion engines by 2030. In this respect, when assessing "realistic" development pathways, the possibility of changes in the framework within which we operate must always be taken into account.

The concept study clearly shows that City of Münster does not have sufficient scope for action to realise the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 by itself. Additional measures needed include more favourable framework conditions, over which the City of Münster has little influence. These include, for example:

Adequate financial resources (e.g. for deep renovation, expansion of renewable energies, investment in electromobility) must be provided punctually through private investment and federal subsidies to eliminate economic efficiency gaps (e.g. in the area of "green district heating").
A legal framework consistent with an expansion in renewable energy generation needs to be created (federal government)
The human resources needed for building energy-efficiency improvements need to be available, particularly in the skilled building trades and building completion (commerce).
STADT MÜNSTER

Essential technical solutions (particularly in the area of sector coupling) must be available and mature (federal government, market participants).

Achieving Münster's target of climate neutrality by 2030 will require action by stakeholders in Münster society (companies, institutions, universities, homeowners, citizens) in addition to Münster City Council, the federal government, the State and the EU. With the help of the Climate City Contract, Münster society will be engaged in the climate protection process with much greater commitment than previously. The Münster City Administration needs to be constantly working to create the conditions needed for this to happen.

The implementation-based transformation strategy for Münster set out in this Climate City Contract is a suitable format for meeting the challenges because

By including non-technical fields of action it takes into account the need for a cultural transformation of the whole of Münster society.
The project is clearly prioritised within City Group Münster in that the climate protection process is managed by the Administrative Board.
By regularly reviewing the status of project implementation (quarterly by the Administrative Board) and reductions in emissions (annual energy and greenhouse gas inventory), it is possible to react flexibly to changes in the complex and dynamic environment (technical innovations, political framework conditions, etc.).

With regard to extending this transformation strategy to the whole of Münster society, City Administration Münster is able to draw on existing networks and structures, which are gaining in importance and being strengthened not least through the use of the Climate City Contract presented here (see modules A-3).

# Münster is becoming a climate city

The "Münster is becoming a climate city" process builds on a climate protection process that dates back to at least 1995, when the City Administration set up the Coordination Centre for Climate and Energy (KLENKO). The strategic basis for Münster City Council's climate protection process consists of the 100% Climate Protection Masterplan, adopted in 2017, and the Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study, drawn up in 2021.

Development of the 100% Climate Protection Masterplan involved a high level of participation by Münster society. Even then, the Council believed that, "A 100% climate protection masterplan can only be successful in the long term if the largest possible section of Münster society can be mobilised to actively participate in municipal climate protection. The citizens of Münster have for decades been dedicated and well-organised, offering the best possible conditions for achieving this. In Münster,

climate protection is defined not as a task for the City Council or the City Administration alone, but as a shared challenge for all of Münster society." (Masterplan 100 % Climate Protection, p. 20)

Against the backdrop of the resolution on climate neutrality by 2030, the Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study adapted the strategy set out in the 100% Climate Protection Masterplan – based on a target of climate neutrality by 2050 – to the new target. The Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study shows that implementation of the actions needed for climate protection and climate neutrality needs to be accelerated. The Council also passed a resolution adopting ad hoc measures, the Climate Protection 2030 action programme and the action programme from the concept study on climate-neutral City Administration. It has since became clear, however, that, in addition to measures taken by the City Administration Münster, achieving this goal will require action by the whole of Münster society, the EU, the federal government and the State - in line with the Climate City Contract within the context of the EU mission.

The above concepts and programmes of measures still represent the strategic basis for the City of Münster's climate protection process. Future strategy is therefore not about filling fundamental omissions, but rather about intensifying and persistently expanding the many existing courses of action
STADT MÜNSTER

and projects. In addition, new paths need to be carefully prioritised and innovative approaches piloted. The strategy for Münster is therefore not a rigid plan, but rather a flexible framework for action with which the City Group Münster can react to changing framework conditions and requirements in the future.

City Group Münster is now focussing primarily on moving from planning to action and acceleration. The guiding principle is the maxim "From project to principle", which emphasises the prioritisation of systemic change in our chosen fields of action over the implementation of individual projects. Alongside this, at a governance level, climate protection is becoming much more firmly established as a cross-cutting issue within the City Administration, and the Council has deemed it to be one of the most important future issues, meaning that all departments, offices, institutions and municipal subsidiaries must take whatever action they are able.

This process is managed by the Administrative Board. This means there is a person responsible for the process for each area of action at management level, who reports to the Administrative Board and is responsible for the implementation process. They are known as topic owners (Themenpaten). Technical responsibility and responsibility for project implementation remains with the departments. Topic coordinators (Themenkoordinatoren) form the link between departments and topic owners. This process is also supported by the Climate Office. Because achieving the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 requires both technical solutions and a cultural transformation, City Group Münster's efforts are centred on the following fields of action: energy production, building carbon reduction measures, mobility, business and academia, education and food, and climate budget. This addresses all sectors required by the Cities Mission.

# Build a strong mandate

On 11 December 2019, the Council voted to aim for climate neutrality by 2030. Against the backdrop of the Paris Climate Agreement, the City of Münster uses the following definition of climate neutrality:

By 2030, City of Münster will no longer produce any energy-related greenhouse gas emissions.
The energy-related carbon budget needed to achieve the 1.5 degree target will be adhered to.
The City of Münster is prioritising the avoidance and reduction of greenhouse gases in the city.
STADT MÜNSTER

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Greenhouse gases will be offset where this is necessary to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 and will be informally considered during accounting.
Offsetting will be carried out to the extent required first locally and then globally.

The resolution relates to the urban area of Münster, an area of 303.3 square kilometres. As of 2022, Münster had 320,946 inhabitants. The City of Münster's energy and greenhouse gas inventory for 2021 (published in 2023), CO₂ emissions break down as follows: Private households 28 per cent, commerce and miscellaneous 30 per cent, industry 11 per cent, transport 31 per cent.

In the Münster climate neutrality 2030 target scenario, emissions will fall by over 95% compared to 1990. In 1990 annual emissions amounted to 2,618,000 tonnes, so that a reduction of 95% means a reduction in annual emissions of 2,487,000 tonnes in 2030 compared to 1990. Since this goal complies with the goal of reducing 82 percent of the 2021 baseline year GHG emissions calculated by the Economic Model, the Münster climate neutrality 2030 target meets the requirements of the "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" mission.

Thanks to wide-ranging climate protection efforts over the last 30 years and a good decentralised energy supply, in 2020 carbon emission intensity, at 5.8 t/a per inhabitant, was well below the national average. Münster is therefore on the right track. This is also evident from national and international rankings:

The City of Münster has several times been honoured with the European Energy Award (EEA) Gold, the highest honour for municipal climate policy measures, for its wide-ranging climate policy measures. Following gold certifications in 2005 and 2009, in 2012, 2015, 2018 and 2022 the city achieved one of the highest scores of all gold-certified municipalities in Europe.

Nevertheless, we also know that reductions in CO₂ emissions are not sufficient - not even in Münster. The scientific community continues to sound the alarm – the next few years will be decisive, and speed is of the essence. We need to do more to stop climate change, do more to adapt to the consequences of climate change, which now appear unavoidable, and step up the pace of climate action! Unless we change direction on the climate, the future looks bleak. Society, through an unprecedented global movement, has shown that the majority are ready to make the changes needed to achieve climate justice. Since 2019, Münster too has been gearing up for action.

## Understand the System

In 2017, the City of Münster's 100% Climate Protection Masterplan outlined how and under what circumstances the City could become largely climate-neutral by 2050, and what strategic steps needed to be

taken to achieve this. At the time, the masterplan target was seen as a major challenge. Given the resolution to aim for climate neutrality as early as 2030, the Münster City Administration commissioned the Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 study. This concept study describes a potential theoretical path to climate neutrality by 2030, associated challenges and areas where action can be taken. Starting from the goal and working backwards means working out the steps and framework conditions needed to achieve that goal. It is therefore not about a rigid plan, but about formulating the framework needed to achieve this goal. In addition to the 100% Climate Protection Master Plan, the concept study was also based on the Climate Protection Action Programme 2030 and the city's annual energy and greenhouse gas inventory.

The Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study shows that the strategy adopted in 2017 as part of the Masterplan 100% Climate Protection is also valid in the light of the Council resolution on climate neutrality 2030 - albeit it requires associated measures to be implemented roughly seven times more quickly and ambitiously.

## Co-design a Portfolio

The strategic basis for all of the City of Münster's climate protection activities is the "100% Climate Protection Masterplan" and the "Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 Concept Study", which builds on the masterplan. The "100% Climate Protection Masterplan" was developed in 2017 with extensive participation from Münster society. A total of around 1,200 participants took part in the consultation.

The strategic premises of Münster's climate action are, in priority order:

saving as much energy as possible
utilising the energy we still require as efficiently as possible
generating the energy we still require from renewable resources
choosing resource and energy-saving behaviours with a consumer culture to match

This strategy guides our actions in our six areas of activity:

Energy production
Mobility
Building carbon reduction measures
Business and academia
Climate budget
Education and food

## City Administration and City Group

Based on these strategic guidelines and in response to a number of council resolutions, a wide range of climate protection measures are being implemented by the various organisational units within the City

Administration and City Group. In order to focus on and accelerate the implementation of climate protection measures, the Münster City Administration is treating climate protection as much more of a cross-cutting issue, meaning that all departments, offices, institutions and municipal subsidiaries have to take whatever action they are able. City Group Münster's climate protection process is managed by the Administrative Board. In concrete terms, this means that for each area of action one person from the City Group's senior management team is responsible and reports quarterly to the Administrative Board on the status of the various projects and plans.

City Group Münster, i.e. the core Administration plus its own companies and municipal subsidiaries, is aware of its special responsibility. At the same time, the Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study has shown that Münster cannot achieve its full CO₂ savings potential through the action of politicians and the Administration alone. With the message "Münster is becoming a climate city", the City Administration has therefore launched a process that calls on all stakeholders in Münster society to commit to the goal of making Münster climate-neutral using the levers available to them.

## Impact partners

In addition to the municipal corporation, other stakeholders in Münster have significant leverage when it comes to reducing CO₂ emissions. The term "impact partners" refers to any organisation - commercial enterprises, associations, universities, etc. - able to make a significant contribution to climate neutrality in Münster. Some impact partners in Münster have already made concrete plans to achieve climate neutrality, while others are implementing ambitious emissions reduction projects and measures. The Climate City Contract is intended to highlight this commitment and, by making it a matter of public record, strengthen signatories' commitment to it.

Münster benefits from its "Münster's Alliance for Climate Protection" network, founded in 2011, in which more than 100 companies support the city's climate protection goals and are involved in climate protection activities. In developing the Climate City Contract, the City Administration Münster created additional structures to boost stakeholder engagement. For example, it established a regular dialogue between the business community and the Administration with the aim of working together on the implementation of our "Münster climate-neutral 2030" vision.

## Innovators

Not every measure is amenable to calculating how much CO₂ it will save or what future effects it might have. Nevertheless, such measures are also important, because making Münster a climate-friendly city takes ideas, creativity, research, progress and the courage to try something new. If, for example, researchers at the University of Münster come up with innovative recycling methods, this knowledge will benefit not just Münster, but ultimately the whole world.

As a city of science, Münster can build on established networks such as the "Alliance for Science" and "Smart City Münster Alliance".

# Committed citizens

Every one of Münster's 320,000 inhabitants is part of our city society and affects the pathway to becoming a climate-friendly city. For many, this means reorienting their everyday decisions towards climate-friendly options. Some, however, have the opportunity to engage more profoundly, whether by supporting a repair café or by buying an electric car to share with neighbours.

The motto of the "Münster is becoming a climate city" process and associated Climate City Contract is "Because it takes all of us". The Climate City Contract will be continuously updated over the next few years, always with the aim of finding even more people to join in.

# Take Action

City Group Münster is moving beyond planning and is now focused on implementing measures. The focus here is on the implementation of strategic projects that lie within City Group Münster's capabilities and with which we are able to exert direct and indirect influence on the implementation of climate protection measures. Direct influence means that City Group Münster can realise climate protection measures itself. Indirect influence means that City Group Münster sets the framework conditions, but the realisation of climate protection measures is largely dependent on engagement by Münster society. For example, the City Group Münster exerts indirect influence on increasing the share of cycling from the current 47 per cent to 55 per cent of the modal split by improving the cycle infrastructure further in order to make cycling more attractive for its citizens.

Strategic projects of City Group Münster therefore bring about the realisation of climate-related projects in City Group Münster and in Münster society by

supporting and promoting
making change possible
setting clear rules

Strategic projects form the framework for implementation projects with which the municipal corporation or Münster society ultimately realise the climate protection process. Implementation of climate protection-related projects by departments and specialised offices involves a wide variety of citizen participation initiatives. The strategic projects are presented in Module B-2. The portfolio is continuously reviewed, adjusted and developed.

A new internal management structure has been established to accelerate the implementation of measures. The Administrative Board is responsible for managing the climate protection process at City Group Münster. In concrete terms, this means that for each area of action one person from the City Group's senior management team is responsible and reports quarterly to the Administrative Board on the status of the various projects and plans. This ensures that the climate protection process is closely monitored. A core instrument in this process is the 'climate project board', similarly in organisation to a Kanban board. The aim of the project board is to create an overview of all of the City Group's strategic climate

neutrality projects. Topic coordinators (Themenkoordinatoren) form the link between specialist departments and topic owners (Themenpaten). Topic coordinators collect information from specialist departments and identify interfaces between individual projects across all fields of action. The process is supported by the Climate Office (see also Module C-1).

The goals set out in this Climate City Contract can only be achieved through close cooperation with Münster society and with the State, federal government and EU. The Climate City Contract is intended to be an innovative instrument for bringing these groups together and deepening their cooperation in multiple areas. At the time of submission, Münster's Climate City Contract and the associated goal of climate neutrality for Münster is supported by around 70 commitments from individual citizens, civil society institutions, universities and business. This circle will be expanded over the course of the mission.

## Learn &amp; Reflect

From project to principle - this maxim underpins Münster's climate protection strategy and over the next few years City Group Münster will be extending it to the whole of Münster society. With the help of the Climate City Contract, city society will be engaged in the climate protection process with much greater commitment than previously. The Münster City Administration needs to be constantly working to create the conditions required for this to happen (see also Social Innovations, Module C-2). To this end, the Climate City Contract will be continuously updated and resubmitted to the European Commission for review every two years.

Prioritising implementation of climate protection strategies and measures is carried out by Münster City Council and the City Administration Administrative Board. Climate protection-related information is currently being developed for both bodies, such as a budget template and the climate protection overview board, intended to provide transparent support for the decision-making process.

The implementation status of climate protection strategies and measures is reviewed internally by the Administrative Board every three months through a reporting system. The city's annual energy and greenhouse gas inventory provides information on Münster's current position with regard to the 2030 climate neutrality target.

## 3.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

Table 3 A-1.0: Introduction GHG baseline inventory City of Muenster

### 3.1.1 Energy and greenhouse gas inventory City of Münster

The first energy and greenhouse gas inventory, for 1990, was published in the final report of the Advisory Board for Climate and Energy in 1995 and was regularly updated in a 5-year cycle until 2010. During the development of the Climate Protection Concept 2020, the system was revised and the $\mathrm{BiCO_2}$ balancing system (ifeu GmbH, Heidelberg) introduced. This system has been used for annual balancing since 2009. This involves recording and analysing the final energy consumption of all consumers in the city (transport, households, small consumers, industry, etc.). The balancing methodology and system is based on the BISKO standard (municipal balancing standard) developed by IFEU (Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, Heidelberg). This has been subject to ongoing development over the last few years and is regarded as the leading standard for municipal climate protection assessments in Germany. Based on the territorial principle¹, energy consumption is recorded for the entire municipal area and emissions determined from this. The area considered in calculating the energy and greenhouse gas inventory is therefore identical to the area on which the climate neutrality target is based. This was comprehensively revised in 2021, including the integration of a more sophisticated, Münster-specific transport model and the preparation of a balancing tool for documenting the coming decade.

Most of the data on static final energy consumption (excluding transport) is provided by Stadtwerke Münster GmbH and Stadtnetze Münster GmbH. These data largely reflect actual final energy consumption. Carbon emission intensity calculations take into account upstream emissions and equivalents and electricity and district heating factors in combined heat and power processes are calculated using the exergy method. The local electricity mix is taken into account in accordance with the territorial principle.

¹ Territorial principle means: "All consumption occurring in the territory under consideration is taken into account at the level of final energy (energy that is measured at the house meter, for example) and allocated to the various consumption sectors. The GHG emissions are then calculated using specific emission factors. Grey energy is not accounted for". (Source: IFEU (2019): BISKO. Municipal accounting system. Heidelberg. S. 8)

An important measure in the field of renewable energy is the use of regeneratively produced biomethane. Biomethane is used as a substitute for natural gas to produce electricity and heat in combined heat and power (CHP) plants or as a fuel for vehicles. Stadtwerke Münster GmbH has operated the majority of its CHP plants using biomethane since 2015. This biomethane generally comes from biogas plants that feed processed biomethane into the natural gas grid. Biomethane in Münster is supplied purely on a balance sheet basis, meaning it is not included directly in the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  and energy inventory, as required by the territorial approach. It is indirectly taken into account through the nationwide emission factor for natural gas, which improved from  $252\mathrm{g / kWh}$  in 2013 to  $250\mathrm{g / kWh}$  in 2017.

The City of Münster's energy and greenhouse gas inventory assigns energy consumption and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions to one of four categories: private households, trade, commerce and services, industry and mobility. For the AFOLU sector,  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions are recorded on the basis of a balancing tool that calculates region-specific emissions of the greenhouse gases N2O (nitrous oxide), CH4 (methane) and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  (carbon dioxide) based on relevant input/activity data. IPCC classifies relevant emissions from agriculture as CRF sector 4. These are sub-divided into the following three sub-sectors: Fermentation during digestion (4.A), Treatment of farm fertilisers (4.B), Agricultural (fertilised) soils (4.D).

The waste sector uses data from the City of Münster's waste management companies, which report under the German Sustainability Code framework: https://datenbank2.deutscher-nachhaltigkeitskodex.de/Profile/CompanyProfile/13986/de/2020/dnk In this report, awm reports emissions for scope 1 and scope 2. In scope 1, direct emission were 2,595,083 t  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  (related to vehicle transport in 2020). In scope 2, emissions were 189.565 t  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  (related to district heat consumption in 2020). In scope 3, emissions have not been reported yet: https://datenbank2.deutscher-nachhaltigkeitskodex.de/Profile/CompanyProfile/13986/de/2020/dnk

The City of Münster reports its GHG inventory via MyCovenant and CDP/ICLEI. The City of Münster's energy and greenhouse gas inventory fulfils the requirements of the Cities Mission.

# 3.1.2 Description and assessment of the 2021 energy and greenhouse gas inventory for City of Münster

The following is an initial overview of the energy and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  inventory for the City of Münster over time. 1990 is the baseline year to which our internal energy and climate protection targets refer. Data collected on an ongoing basis can be divided into three areas of use: heat, electricity and transport. Within these areas, final energy consumption can be broken down by energy source and user group (households, commerce, industry, transport), allowing a differentiated analysis and evaluation of the inventory results.

# 3.1.2.1 Core results

Annual  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions in Münster have fallen from 2,618 kt in 1990 to 1,816 kt in 2021. Compared to the baseline year 1990, this represents a reduction of approx.  $31\%$  or 802 kt  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . Compared to the previous year, this represents an increase of approx. 6,000 tonnes. The following figure shows the change in annual  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions in Münster in tonnes by sector.  $100\%$  corresponds to emissions in the baseline year 1990. The per capita reduction in emissions is shown on the right-hand vertical axis.

Figure 6 Annual  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions in Münster in tonnes by sector

Source: Municipal energy and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  inventory for 2021

The slight increase in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions from 2020 to 2021 is due in particular to high renewable energy yields in 2020, both in Münster and nationwide. As a result, the federal electricity emission factor, which plays a significant role in the city's GHG inventory and significantly affects the overall reduction in emissions, was particularly favourable. This factor was slightly worse in 2021, meaning that despite a slight reduction in energy consumption across all sectors and energy sources, total emissions rose slightly.

City-wide final energy consumption fell from 6,729 GWh in 1990 to 6,125 GWh in 2021 (see figure below). This corresponds to a reduction of  $9\%$  or 604 GWh compared to 1990 and a reduction of approx. 100 GWh compared to the previous year. The figure below shows changes in final energy consumption in Münster in GWh by sector.  $100\%$  corresponds to final energy consumption in the baseline year 1990.

Figure 7 Final energy consumption in Münster in GWh by sector

Source: Municipal energy and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  inventory for 2021

If we compare the reduction over time for  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  consumption and for final energy, we can clearly see that final energy consumption is falling much more slowly than  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions. This highlights the importance of increasing the reduction in energy consumption in order to accelerate the reduction in emissions. $^{2}$  Every KWh saved directly reduces emissions and, unlike additional energy consumed, does not require increased use of renewable energies. As a rapidly growing city, with the inevitable increase in energy consumption that this growth brings, Münster faces particular challenges.

The figure below shows  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  reductions over time broken down by area of use (heating, electricity, transport). The heating sector in particular is negatively affected by rapid population growth and the trend for ever larger flats and houses. In the electricity sector, however, the reduction in emissions is accelerating thanks to a steady expansion of renewable energy. In the transport sector, emissions are falling at a relatively slower rate.

# Urban growth, residual  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  budget and climate neutrality

The table below shows selected urban development figures that have a strong influence on the city's carbon inventory. These figures make clear the scale of the city's overall growth. Since 1990, the resident population has risen by around  $14\%$  to a good 314,000 inhabitants in 2021. In the same period, residential floor space has increased by a good  $47\%$  and the number of workers liable to pay social security contributions by  $56\%$ . In a continuously growing city like Münster, therefore, to obtain a better all-round view it is helpful to look at the change in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emission intensity per inhabitant.

We can see that the reduction in total  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emission intensity per inhabitant of around  $43\%$  represents a much sharper fall than the absolute reduction in emissions (see figs. 8 and 9). This illustrates and highlights the effect of population growth and overall city growth on  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions. Urban growth therefore captures some of this reduction, diluting the overall result.

In addition to the above figures, the two figures below show emissions and final energy consumption broken down by sector and energy source.

It is clear that, with the exception of the fuel mix for transport, electricity is the energy source responsible for the largest share of total urban emissions, followed by natural gas. Despite its relatively large share of total final energy demand, especially in the commercial sector, district heating accounts for a relatively small proportion of total emissions. This illustrates the climate-friendly nature of district heating. Future decarbonisation of district heating will make it even more climate-friendly.

Achieving climate neutrality for the entire city will, however, require far more than just decarbonising district heating – in itself already a mammoth long-term project. The biggest challenge lies in replacing all fossil fuels in the city's energy mix with renewable energy. That means, for example, that more than 60,000 oil and natural gas heating systems in the city's building stock need to be replaced by renewable alternatives. In 2021, fossil fuels were responsible for around 90% of total final energy consumption (electricity, heat &amp; fuels).

In the concept study "Münster Climate Neutrality 2030" (p.9 onwards), it was calculated that the residual emissions budget for achieving climate neutrality by 2030 based on the 1.5 degree target was around 14.7 million tonnes³ from 2020. This means that from 2020, total annual emissions need to be reduced by at least 180,000 tonnes per year. The average reduction in annual emissions over the last 5 years has been around 25,000 tonnes per year. This means that the City would need to accelerate its climate protection ambitions by a factor of roughly 7, and again highlights how comprehensive and far-reaching the social changes needed to achieve the target will need to be.

³ Of the 14.7 million tonnes of CO₂, around 11.1 million tonnes will remain after the balance years 2020 and 2021 Remaining budget.

## 3.1.2.2 Summary

Between 1990 and 2021, CO₂ emissions in Münster were reduced by 31%. Over the same period CO₂ emissions per inhabitant fell more sharply by around 43%.

For the City of Münster, achieving climate neutrality is a major challenge and requires a significant increase in the intensity and, above all, speed of activities, measures and processes by all stakeholders (City Administration, businesses, citizens). In view of the findings presented here from the City of Münster's Energy and Greenhouse Gas inventory, it is possible to draw the following conclusions for the impact pathways and strategic priorities: Building carbon reduction measures and mobility are the areas with the greatest energy saving potential in Münster. Münster's growing population means this potential will continue to grow in future. The energy production field of action takes an integrated, sector-independent view of generation, distribution and local, renewable energy. In addition to the expansion of renewable energy, the main challenges here are decarbonisation and expansion of district heating and decarbonisation of property-based individual heat supply. In addition to technical fields of action, a cultural transformation is also required. It is for this reason that the business and academia field of action offers strong local potential. As a dynamic science and business location, and with its innovative, highly networked companies and research institutions, Münster offers particular opportunities for accelerating already dynamic transformation processes and for deploying technical innovations. In addition, the City of Münster has long placed a strong emphasis on maintaining an intensive dialogue with civil society on climate protection, and will expand this further in future. The education and food field of action deals with climate-friendly lifestyles and sufficiency and is of particular importance. It focuses on promoting an eco-sufficient lifestyle which prioritises the conservation of resources and, in conjunction with technical measures, is essential for achieving our climate protection targets. The city has great potential for action through integrated, interdisciplinary cooperation, particularly important in the area of climate budget. The main focus here is on ensuring a close interlinkage between climate neutrality and budget planning. In addition to these issues, City Group Münster has long tackled climate protection and climate adaptation in tandem, with Münster aiming to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 and to adapt to the consequences of climate change.

If Münster is to be climate neutral by 2030, this requires as a minimum that both the federal government and the EU also commit to this goal and make maximum use of their scope for action by establishing a corresponding legal framework, funding programmes, etc. The City of Münster does not have sufficient scope for action to achieve this target alone. This is because, in addition to any influence exerted by the City of Münster, changes in greenhouse gas emissions in Münster are heavily dependent on the external political, legal, technical and social framework. The Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study showed that the City Group and city society together have scope to reduce emissions by only around 50 per cent. The energy and carbon inventory is therefore of only limited suitability for assessing the effectiveness of individual measures. It does, however, provide a good overview and highlight any trends in areas where the intensity of measures needs to be increased.

|  policy | EU | European Green Deal | The European Green Deal is aimed at making the 27 EU member states climate-neutral by 2050. As a first step, greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels by 2030. Achieving this goal will require the reorganisation of many areas of the economy and society. The "Fit for 55" package includes a series of proposals for revising and updating EU legislation. It also includes proposals for new initiatives to ensure that EU action is in line with the climate targets agreed by the Council and the European Parliament. | Medium relevance | See A-2.2: Description & assessment of policies  |
|  Promotion | national | Federal subsidy for efficient heating networks (BEW) | The BEW promotes the construction of new heating grids with a high proportion of renewable energies and the decarbonisation of existing grids. [...] The BEW creates incentives for heating network operators to invest in the construction of new heating networks with a high proportion of renewable energies and to decarbonise existing networks. Funding takes a systemic approach that focuses on the heating grid as a whole and aims to provide reliable support for the time-consuming conversion of existing grids to renewable energy and waste heat and the construction of new grids predominantly powered by renewable energy. For example, local authorities can receive subsidies for building local heating networks with a high proportion of renewable energy in new development areas or for converting existing district heating networks to renewable energy and waste heat.

|   |  |  | In addition, on 29 July 2022, the Act stipulated that renewable energies are in the overriding public interest and serve public safety. This is crucial for increasing the pace of expansion. As a result, they will take precedence over other interests when weighing up decisions in future. This enables a significant acceleration in planning and authorisation procedures. (Source: https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/schwerpunkte/klimaschutz/novelle-eeg-gesetz-2023-2023972) |  |   |

It primarily regulates when these systems can be installed under planning law, and is binding on federal states and local authorities. For example, the code allows zoning of areas where the construction of specific renewable energy plants, such as wind turbines, hydrogen plants and photovoltaic systems, can be prioritised.
To further accelerate/simplify expansion, from 1 January 2023, solar installations enjoy building law privileges within a specific framework (located in 200m strips along motorways and major railway lines, and agri PV installations which share space with agricultural, forestry or horticultural operations).

The State of North Rhine-Westphalia is taking a major step forward in that, from 1 January 2024, the simplified procedure only will apply to wind turbines, rather than the full building regulations procedure. In addition, developers will be able to request that the building inspection procedure and all other authorisation procedures are handled by a single body.
The draft Act also removes from building regulations the minimum distance between solar installations on house roofs/heat pumps and neighbouring properties. For heat pumps, however, building owners must continue to consider the noise impact on neighbours. This will enshrine in law a decree from December 2022 on these projects. From 1 January 2024, rooftop solar systems will not longer need to be installed with a gap to the boundary wall.
Installations for hydrogen production will be exempted from the procedure altogether, provided that the hydrogen produced is consumed within the buildings for which they are erected, and for certain installations for the production and use of hydrogen, including their enclosures and associated gas storage facilities with a storage capacity of up to 20 kilograms per appliance. |  |   |

In August 2020, the Council therefore passed a resolution to reduce the energy consumption of municipal buildings by 50% and CO2 emissions by 70% by 2030. Our building guidelines have therefore been fundamentally revised and adapted to the goal of climate neutrality by 2030. There are binding quality criteria and guidelines for everyone involved in the construction process for municipal buildings, both for new builds and for conversion and deep renovation measures. The building guidelines apply to all municipal buildings.

The energy utilisation plan will help match expected long-term energy demand in Münster to a renewable energy-based supply infrastructure. This give rise to further conclusions for concrete measures such as the expansion and continued decarbonisation of the district heating supply and support services for homeowners. This will create planning and investment certainty for all Münster stakeholders. |  |   |
|  Policy | local | Support programme for residential buildings | The City of Münster promotes a wide range of measures to optimise the energy efficiency of residential buildings in the city. From building insulation and heating system replacement to ecological insulation materials, there are many ways to make an important contribution to reducing CO2 emissions in Münster. In addition, green roofs improve the city's water budget and reduce the urban heat island effect, delivering improved living conditions and making the city a better place to spend time.

Since 1997, the City of Münster has been investing in building energy-efficiency improvements and has made a funding pot available to citizens.

At the end of 2022, there were already 38 Stadtwerke buses with electric drive systems on Münster's roads. By 2029, 100% of the 116 buses owned by the company and 60% of the roughly 100 buses rented from decentralised depots on the outskirts of the city will be electrified. The multimodal mobility system will integrate various modes of transport, including car sharing through Stadtwerke's holding in local car share provider Stadtteilauto. |  |   |

The focus is on striving to continue to improve the high quality of life in the city in future through binding targets and tailor-made measures.
The aim is to achieve extensive local climate neutrality in the mobility sector through increased traffic avoidance and modal shift from motorised private transport to eco-mobility. Local public transport powered by more climate-friendly technologies or running on dedicated tracks is a key pillar of mobility. The system is supplemented by the targeted reallocation of areas and the expansion of infrastructure for local mobility. Reapportioning road space in favour of eco-mobility also promotes better quality of life in public spaces, which can be enhanced by expanding green and open spaces. At the same time, the targeted expansion of charging infrastructures should also promote the drive system transition in private motorised transport. | Very relevant | See A-2.2: Description & assessment of policies  |

Description and assessment of climate protection-related policies

Description of local policies

Against the backdrop of the Council resolution to aim for climate neutrality as early as 2030, City Administration Münster commissioned the Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 study. The concept study describes a potential theoretical path to climate neutrality by 2030, associated challenges and areas where action can be taken. The Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study focussed on two challenges:

The target can only be achieved if the whole of Münster society works together
The extent to which the city itself can contribute to meeting this target is limited to at most 50 per cent. The rest requires action at state, federal government and EU level.

This means that to realise the ambitious goal of making Münster climate-neutral by 2030, Münster now needs to bring others on board – others within Münster society, but also the state, federal government and EU. It is not enough to secure the commitment of individual companies, initiatives, private individuals or the Administration. With the message "Münster is becoming a climate city", the City Administration is now launching a process that brings together all stakeholders in city society. All participants will be able to show what they are contributing to the goal of climate neutrality

Commit to implementing measures that make a difference
Initiate measures that require collaboration with other stakeholders
Receive support implementing measures and offer support to other stakeholders
take responsibility for a better tomorrow

For City Group Münster, this means it needs the participation of all departments, offices and municipal subsidiaries. First Mayor Markus Lewe has therefore initiated a much-needed strategic change. A new form of collaboration and a redistribution of responsibility are two important levers now being pulled in Münster. This will up the tempo, enabling faster, more dynamic decision-making for the future through wide-ranging cooperation. Münster is now treating the climate much more as an overarching cross-cutting task. The climate is no longer limited to a single department, but is the responsibility of all areas of the City Administration. City Group Münster is currently trialling and implementing new instruments and structures for managing and monitoring the climate protection process. As part of

this process, the local policies set out in the table above are being continuously developed and adapted.

Examples of climate-relevant policies with which City Group Münster is leading the way include

Münster's standard for climate-friendly construction: Münster City Council adopted "Münster's standard for climate-friendly construction" through a council resolution on 29 September 2021 (V/0434/2021), and extended it with a further resolution on 14 July 2022 (V/0319/2022). The standard is stipulated in all urban development contracts, land purchase contracts and leasehold contracts with the City of Münster. It includes requirements for the building energy standard and the use of solar energy in new builds. It currently applies to the construction of new residential and non-residential buildings. The aim is to reduce energy consumption in buildings, which currently accounts for around 30 per cent of CO₂ emissions nationwide. The measure will reduce emissions in new buildings to almost zero – extremely important for a growing city like Münster.

Climate-friendly urban development: The Climate-friendly urban land use planning guideline aims to firmly embed climate protection and climate adaptation in building land development and make taking them into account compulsory (both in residential and mixed-use areas with primarily residential construction, and in other area categories). This applies from site selection to urban and open space planning configuration through to planning regulations and contractual provisions. In future, this approach will also be extended to land allocation, structural realisation and subsequent demolition. This first guideline is intended to serve as a practical aid for urban land-use planning and to provide all employees of the Münster City Administration involved in the development of building land, project owners and commissioned planning offices with information for their role.

Building guidelines 2020: climate protection and sustainability. Münster's path to climate neutrality: Münster is aiming to become climate neutral by 2030. Achieving this goal means in particular targeting municipal buildings. Buildings account for 33% of the increase in CO₂ emissions. In August 2020, the Council passed a resolution to reduce the energy consumption of municipal buildings by 50% and CO₂ emissions by 70% by 2030.

There are binding quality criteria and guidelines for everyone involved in the construction process for municipal buildings, both for new builds and for conversion and deep renovation measures. The building guidelines apply to all municipal buildings. The goal is a building stock aligned with climate protection and sustainability.

Energy utilisation planning/municipal heating planning: To chart a course to climate neutrality by 2030, Münster City Group is drawing up an energy utilisation plan (ENP) as a long-term foundation for planning a sustainable heating supply. The plan will be updated regularly. This was approved by the Council at a June 2023 council meeting. Under the leadership of the Climate Office, the Administration is setting up an inter-departmental working group with the participation of Stadtwerke Münster and Stadtnetze Münster. Thanks to the integrated approach taken by the

energy utilisation plan, in addition to municipal heat planning includes topics such as electricity, green gases and cooling, the city is going beyond the expected statutory regulations.

100% renewable energy for private households: By 2030, Stadtwerke Münster wants to supply all households in Münster with self-produced wind and solar power and also enable citizen participation to enable local people to share in the financial success of renewable projects. The project was awarded the grade "Very good" by Ökotest magazine in its April 2022 issue on "Mein" with Stadtwerke Münster's green electricity option. According to the magazine, the tariff represents a genuine and comprehensible contribution to the energy transition. One cent per kilowatt hour of green electricity used is invested by Stadtwerke Münster in the expansion of renewable energy or energy-saving projects. Stadtwerke Münster's Mein Münster green electricity tariff is Green Electricity Label certified, which guarantees its now officially recognised contribution to the energy transition. Stadtwerke also uses funds from the green electricity cents for its own expansion projects.

## Evaluation of policies at national and regional level

Table A-2.1 lists the most important policies at national level. In principle, we share the assessment made in the Federal Environment Agency's 2022 report "Climate protection potential in municipalities. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of greenhouse gas reduction potential in municipalities"⁴ (p. 62/63):

Not enough consideration is given to climate protection in sectoral legislation aimed at local authorities or which is implemented locally by local authorities. Almost all climate action is based on voluntary local action and therefore have a lower priority than statutory duties. Climate protection and climate adaptation should also become statutory municipal duties. This would require a clear legislative line setting out specific tasks and objectives that need to be met at local authority level and corresponding funding for these statutory duties from the state and federal governments.
Measures aimed at activating private property owners offer great potential for savings, for example through deep renovation or switching to district heating. In practice, only a fraction of potential GHG reductions are realised, as these are exclusively voluntary activities. To improve utilisation of the huge reduction potential in the building sector, local authority responsibilities in this area need to be expanded.
There is a lack of specific expertise for important, regulatory options, in particular for legally compliant implementation. These measures are therefore not implemented (e.g. compulsory connection and use of district heating in existing buildings, temporary reclassification of roads as cycle paths).

Where sectoral legislation includes climate protection stipulations that are relevant for local authorities (e.g. in Section 52 of the GEG, the obligation to use renewable energies in existing public buildings), the resulting additional personnel costs for local implementation are not taken into account or remunerated

Furthermore, we agree with the assessment of the Deutscher Städtetag (Association of German Cities) that there is a strong need for information and advice for citizens and that this will increase as the transition progresses. It is therefore imperative that existing advisory structures in cities are expanded and supported by the federal and state governments. Local authorities must also receive greater funding support from the federal and state governments, in the form of fixed, long-term climate finance budgets rather than individual funding projects.

We see the following challenges for the City of Münster and our Münster Climate Neutral 2030 ambition:

Decarbonisation of district heating/expansion of renewable energies: Implementation of the district heating transition in Münster requires a massive expansion of renewable energy, particularly through the use of deep geothermal energy. To accelerate the transformation process and the expansion of renewable energies, this requires simplification of the legal procedures.
Phase-out of gas supply in existing buildings/ deep renovation of existing buildings: The phase-out of gas supply in existing buildings, both through local deep renovation campaigns and through the development of green gases at federal level, is one of the greatest challenges to achieving the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reduction targets. A shortage of skilled labour, particularly in the skilled trades, and in some cases supply difficulties are damping the speed of deep renovation. Support for deep renovation campaigns is therefore needed in the form of funding programmes, an increase in legal requirements, and an acceleration in the development of green gases or substitutes for natural gas.
New building construction: Construction requirements for new buildings are aligned with climate-neutrality by local authorities through local regulations (KfW40 or Passivhaus standard). The challenge for local authorities here is that the former EnEV and the current GEG have lagged behind the state of the art (building envelope) for years. An update to legal requirements is long overdue.
Accelerating the transport transition: The transport transition cannot be achieved by switching from cars to e-mobility. It requires a significant reduction in the share of journeys made by cars and a massive expansion of local public transport and rail transport. To achieve our ambition, we need more room for manoeuvre as a model for innovative transport models (e.g. expanding 30 km/h zones), simplification and acceleration of rail expansion and financial support for the expansion of local public transport.

Overall, it is clear that, although the legal framework and developments at federal and state level form a good foundation, local authorities are receiving too little support with concrete implementation on the ground - be it regulatory, communicative or financial. As mentioned above, statutory obligations - for example with regard to a climate-neutral heating supply - fall short of what would is needed for effective climate protection. At the same time, the debate is leading to uncertainty in urban society, which is being felt by local authorities through increased demand for advice and information. In addition to legal requirements, subsidies for citizens and companies also need to be expanded in order to accelerate the socially responsible, innovative, growth-promoting transition to climate neutrality locally.

To address these challenges, nine German cities have come together to form the stonGERcities network. The German mission cities regularly exchange information within the framework of this network. A steering committee has also been set up as a formal forum for dialogue between various interest groups. This consists of representatives from federal ministries (Federal Ministry of Housing, Urban Affairs and Development, Building and Construction/ Federal Ministry of Education and Research/ Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport/ Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate and the Ministry of Finance), the Deutscher Städtetag (Association of German Cities), the Federal Institute for Urban Development Research, two representatives from the mission cities and representatives from state ministries. The steering committee provides mission cities with the opportunity to address needs and obstacles, and work on solutions (for more information, see Table C-1.2).

The "Emissions gap" table was calculated using the economic model provided by Net Zero Cities: https://netzerocities.app/group-capabilitybuildingprogrammebuildingastrongeconomiccase The emissions gap for achieving the 2030 climate neutrality target is therefore 1,600,000 tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  measured against the target of the city mission and is therefore lower than the emissions gap shown in the energy and greenhouse gas inventory measured against the City of Münster target. In the Münster climate neutrality 2030 target scenario,  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions will fall by over  $95\%$  compared to 1990. In 1990, annual emissions amounted to 2,618,000 tonnes, so that a reduction of  $95\%$  means a reduction in annual emissions of 2,487,000 tonnes in 2030 compared to 1990. Since this goal complies with the goal of reducing 82 percent of the 2021 baseline year GHG emissions calculated by the Economic Model, the Münster climate neutrality 2030 target meets the requirements of the "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" mission.

The portfolios of measures described in Module B-2 relate solely to the implementation of strategic projects that are within the scope of action of City Group Münster and which exert a direct and indirect influence on the implementation of climate protection measures. Direct influence means that City Group Münster can realise the climate protection measures itself. Indirect influence means that City Group Münster sets the framework conditions, but implementation of climate protection measures is highly dependent on Münster society. For example, the City Group Münster exerts indirect influence on increasing the share of cycling from the current 47 per cent to 55 per cent of the modal split by improving the cycle infrastructure further in order to make cycling more attractive for its citizens.

Achieving the goal of climate neutrality is therefore dependent on all stakeholders – i.e. City Group Münster, Münster society, the federal government, the state and the EU – utilising their scope for action. City Group Münster’s strategic projects directly utilise its own scope for action directly and indirectly addresses the scope for action of city stakeholders. The scope for action at federal, state and EU level is addressed through various forms of representation, for example through the Deutscher Städtetag or through the networks created as part of the mission, as well as through many other associations.

Against this backdrop, the "Emissions gap" table is based on the assumption that all stakeholders are utilising their scope for action. This applies equally to emissions reductions in other sectors, such as agriculture and IPPU. In Münster, these sectors are primarily addressed by the "Education and food" and "Business and academia" fields of action. These sectors are also addressed through the expansion of renewable energy, particularly photovoltaics.

## 3.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

Module A-3 "Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality" should document the results of the stakeholder, systems and ecosystem mapping and identification of systemic barriers and opportunities.

Table 14 Analysis of systemic barriers and opportunities - textual elements

## 3.3.1 Scope for action by Münster society stakeholder groups and municipal sphere of influence

The Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study set out a possible path to achieving the climate neutrality 2030 target and highlighted the challenges this poses for urban society. But what specific scope for actions aimed at shaping the pathway to achieving this target does the city have? What potential savings are there and what direct and indirect influence does City Group Münster have to ensure that these savings are realised? What contribution is needed from federal, state and EU governments and market participants (citizens and households, companies, institutions) in Münster? Below, we aim to outline this distribution, developed as part of the concept study, i.e. savings potential and areas of influence of the various stakeholders by field of action (the fields of action considered in the Münster climate-neutral 2030 concept study differ slightly from the current fields of action in climate protection). Moreover, we identify barriers to and opportunities for action. The concept study has been published in 2021. Therefore, we also provide examples on how the City Group Münster has addressed barriers and opportunities and developed measures further within the last years.

## 3.3.1.1 Systemic environment and decision-making levels

To analyse different influences on the formulated objectives, the Münster Climate Neutral 2030 concept study identified and analysed key factors and associated decision-making levels and determined their influence on achievement of the targets. The individual factors have been summarised into clusters. The result is an actor-factor matrix for each field of action. The matrix represents the base data for analysing influence potential. Factor analysis sheds light on the environment in which the goal of climate neutrality in 2030 is to be achieved. This environment is shaped by decision-making levels and factors that strongly influence the achievement of the target. These factors are therefore equivalent to systems in the logic of Net Zero Cities.

A distinction is made between three decision-making levels: The federal government (including the EU and the state of NRW), City Group Münster together with its subsidiaries, and market participants (citizens and households, companies, institutions). The decision-making levels outline who makes

specific decisions and therefore co-determines the scope of action of all stakeholders. With the decisions at the respective levels, the factors can have an inhibiting or promoting effect. The factors are categorised into the following clusters:

![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)
Figure 12 Analysis cluster of the factor analysis

Source: Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study, p. 40

A. Technology and infrastructure: Achieving the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 requires technical solutions for reducing greenhouse gases. The factors describe whether the solutions are available, how they can be used, the opportunities they offer and the obstacles to their use. The existence of and low-threshold access to an infrastructure is a basic prerequisite for being able to utilise climate neutrality solutions and offerings (e.g. the existence of an infrastructure for producing and distributing gases from renewable sources)
B. Economic and social aspects: Good economic management is a basic prerequisite for achieving the goal of climate neutrality. The economic framework conditions influence investment decisions in technologies and infrastructures (e.g. profitability gaps when investing in deep renovation measures), tariffs and subsidies have the effect of guiding climate-friendly decisions (e.g.  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  pricing). Economy for the Common Good approaches provide new approaches that take into account social factors. The
STADT MÜNSTER

preservation of dignity and free development of personality are basic prerequisites for social acceptance of the required transformation (e.g. dealing with sufficiency of income).

C. Law and organisation: Laws and regulations set the legal framework for action. They influence the structures within which people and organisations can act (e.g. opposing steering effect of regulatory instruments). Organisational factors are decisive in determining efficiency of implementation of climate protection measures (e.g. sufficient availability of skilled workers, particularly in construction and renovation).

D. Knowledge and consequences: Knowledge of climate-friendly solutions and direct experience of the consequences of one's own actions are basic prerequisites for individual and organisational learning (e.g. knowledge of how to heat and ventilate correctly). Factors in this cluster directly influence the development of climate-friendly behaviours and are therefore a key driver of transformation.

E. Attitudes and values: Factors in this cluster describe the effects of social transformation on the achievement of objectives with a longer-term effect (values) and short-term effect (attitudes). Values and attitudes influence behaviour at an individual level and the actions of groups and organisations at a societal level (e.g. patterns of consumption)

Factor analysis was carried out for each field of action in the above clusters. A total of 157 individual factors yield a comprehensive description of the current environment for achieving the goal of climate neutrality by 2030. The factor analysis across all clusters provides important pointers for targeting measures aimed at transforming Münster society.

## Spheres of influence of City Group Münster

The key question here is, in addition to implementing in-house measures, how much influence does City Group Münster have to motivate and support Münster society in particular to implement measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, since Münster society is responsible for the vast majority of emissions. We differentiate between

Direct sphere of influence: This refers to City Group Münster's ability to directly and immediately influence the implementation of measures (especially by third parties). The direct sphere of influence includes, for example, binding energy standards, stipulations in development plans, specific funding programmes and the deep renovation of its own properties.

Indirect sphere of influence: This refers to opportunities for municipal influence that exert an indirect effect by initiating or supporting actions by Münster society (companies, citizens, civil society). They carry a reasonable probability of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but are dependent on implementation by third parties (companies, citizens, civil society).

In addition to City Group Münster and Münster society, the federal government, state and EU also exert a significant influence on the scope for action of all stakeholders. Below, we discuss systemic

barriers, the scope for action of City Group Münster and other stakeholders, and influencing factors, broken down across specific fields of action.

Portfolio deep renovation: The strategic objective for the deep renovation rate is primarily determined by decision-making at federal government level and by local market participants.

City Group Münster cannot define or fully control decision-making levels of the federal government or market participants. It can only influence them through direct or indirect actions to achieve the target. Clusters with a particularly high significance for achieving the climate-neutral 2030 deep renovation target are economic factors (profitability gap), legal factors (confusing legal framework with insufficient standards) and organisational factors (shortage of skilled workers). These clusters have a particularly high impact on target achievement. The economic efficiency gap represents a significant obstacle to achieving the objectives. This must be closed by means of suitable subsidies at federal level. There is a high risk of market failure due to a lack of specialised personnel.

The City of Münster supports stakeholders from Münster society through the residential building subsidy programme and a comprehensive information service.

New build: In the new build sector, owner-occupiers often perceive the Plus Energy standard/climate-neutrality to be uneconomical. For institutional landlords, additional cost increases are expected, particularly in (social) rented housing construction, which means that the Plus Energy standard may not be feasible under current regulations for publicly subsidised rental housing construction. Investors and, in some cases, planning offices often do not have the planning and execution expertise required to introduce the Plus Energy standard across the board. There is a risk here that the required circumspection in planning and execution, taking into account cooling, unwanted heat flows and sector coupling, will not be achieved. As energy-related greenhouse gas emissions fall, emissions caused by building materials themselves become more important. These need to be reduced.

Münster's standard for climate-friendly construction includes specifications for the building energy standard and the use of solar energy, and is stipulated in all urban development contracts and leasehold contracts with City of Münster.

Municipal buildings: As a growing city, Münster's demand for municipal building space will continue to grow in the future. In order to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2030, the City of Münster must act as a role model and create good examples of sustainable land use and development. In principle, it has a large potential for action in the "Technology and Infrastructure" cluster. This presupposes the availability of sufficient financial resources. This requires a change in the previous planning and decision-making maxim from "What is the maximum we can achieve with the available funds and personnel capacities?" to "What do we need to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2030?"

The "2020 Building Guidelines: Climate Protection and Sustainability" represent binding quality criteria and guidelines for everyone involved in the construction process for municipal buildings, both for new builds and for conversion and deep renovation measures.

Based on the influencing factors and municipal spheres of influence described above, the following overall picture emerges. The "Economy and social affairs" and "Law and organisation" clusters are particularly strongly influenced by the federal government and market participants. In the "Technology and infrastructure" cluster, City Group Münster has a high degree of influence through its municipal building stock. The discrepancy between the factor effect and the municipal effect in the "Technology and infrastructure" area is due to the small size of the factor effect. This is due to the fact that the technical prerequisites in the "Construction and deep renovation" field are already very good, and technology in this field requires little further development to achieve the targets. On the other hand, there are several measures offering significant greenhouse gas savings that must be at least partially allocated to this factor, with the result that the municipal effect exceeds the factor effect. The greatest factor effect is achieved in the "economic and social" and "legal and organisational" factors. The municipal impact is largely confined to "economic and social".

## 3.3.1.3 Climate-friendly decision-making by Münster society

The Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study shows that, by taking a strategic marketplace approach, through campaigns building on this approach, and using predominantly tried and tested mutually reinforcing instruments (e.g. climate training, real-world laboratory), the City of Münster possesses a package of measures offering a high degree of leverage. The concept study came to the conclusion that, provided this package of measures was sufficiently well resourced, the high degree of leverage should enable the reduction target for this field of action to be exceeded. The City of Münster has significant potential for action in this area. Because it is cross-sectoral (energy, housing, mobility, consumption, nutrition), the package of measures also promotes acceptance in all other fields of action.

However, the analysis also made clear that greater consideration needs to be given in particular to social balance. The "justice question" is of significant importance for acceptance by society as a whole: if consumption is rationalised solely through financial instruments, it will particularly affect those who are already economically disadvantaged. There is considerable acceptance risk here. Realising this potential therefore requires gradually reaching out to all of Münster society.

By using appropriate, socially just measures and measures to foster solidarity, the City of Münster can have a levelling effect. To this end, the Council has formulated new proposals for measures, some of which also interface with other fields of action (e.g. free public transport to promote low-threshold access to mobility).
STADT MÜNSTER

Against this backdrop, since August 2023 Münster has had a Münster travelcard priced at €29 per month, which facilitates mobility at a cost of roughly one euro per day.

The City of Münster's marketplace concept already incorporates an economic and entrepreneurial perspective. According to the Münster Climate Neutral 2030 concept study, this requires a balanced strategy that takes into account both economic and social concerns, and promotes climate-friendly, sustainable restructuring of companies.

Additional areas of municipal influence include, for example, the expansion of campaigns. As in the "Construction and deep renovation" field, in the "Climate-friendly decisions" field too there are municipal effects that exceed the factor effect. This is primarily due to the expansion of campaigns and communication, which is allocated to the "Climate-friendly decisions" field of action but also has effects in other areas. In the "Attitudes and values" field, the factor effect is higher than other factors and through the measures is exploited to an even greater extent.

## 3.3.1.4 Work and business

The Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study shows that this field of action is particularly challenging in terms of the scope of action available to the City of Münster. Environmental objectives and economic policy strategies need to be reconciled in the form of a municipal strategy for improved climate protection and a positive framework for business.

The aim in the "Work and business" field of action is therefore to leverage and strengthen previously identified potential, and to explore new sets of measures. Given this, the concept study has identified two strategic objectives:

Companies in Münster should undertake climate-neutral work and production. Energy consumption for space heating, light, power and process heat must be reduced by 9.3% every year (as of 2020/2021).
Climate neutrality must become the goal and success factor of Münster's economic policy.

A significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions are generated by Münster's businesses, as well as by the large number of administrative buildings in the trade, commerce and services sectors. Although Münster is not particularly seen as an industrial centre, industrial companies and what they consume is relevant to climate protection in Münster. Most of the potential lies in existing buildings. In addition to promoting energy savings through buildings improvements, efficient, sector-specific energy supply services are of particular strategic importance.

The City of Münster's strategy focuses on accelerating the already dynamic transformation processes and deep renovation cycles, on increasing the level of technical innovation through targeted advice and customised offers at both individual company and regional levels. Münster can build on a wide range of measures, projects and approaches, such as the energy efficiency advisory programme for start-ups.

"Münster's Alliance for Climate Protection" is a network of over 100 Münster companies and trade associations. The city therefore offers a good framework, which needs to be consistently built upon in order to achieve the ambitious climate protection targets for trade, commerce, services and industry.

The numerous commitments to support the Climate City Contract by Münster companies also show that Münster's business community actively supports the climate protection process in Münster and has adopted the goal of a climate-neutral economy.

In this context, the City of Münster is striving to anchor the goal of climate neutrality as a strategic guideline in the 2030+ location development strategy, e.g. through climate-neutral business parks or the expansion of infrastructure for climate-neutral business, such as H2 networks and green energy.

An analysis of the influencing factors in the concept study shows that the transformation of Münster's economy towards climate neutrality requires more than just technical efficiency solutions. Climate neutrality needs to become an integrated goal for Münster as a business location, on an equal footing with the goal of creating and securing jobs. This requires good framework conditions as well as the introduction of guidelines for transforming existing companies and the establishment of new climate-neutral businesses.

Overall, the concept study comes to the conclusion that the factor effect across all factors in this area is quite low. Municipal influence can be exerted primarily in the areas of technology and infrastructure. In the economic sector in particular, supra-regional, national and global market interdependencies have a strong impact, partly due to increasing globalisation. This reduces the municipal sphere of influence.

## 3.3.1.5 Energy supply and renewable energies

The Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study shows that the goal of climate neutrality can only be achieved if fossil fuels can be completely replaced by renewable energies using cross-sectoral approaches. The prerequisite for cross-sector supply concepts is the integration of renewable energies into the system in keeping with the 2030 climate neutrality targets. Energy saving, energy efficiency, renewable energies and the joint optimisation of electricity, gas and heating grids (hybrid grids) and climate-friendly heat generation are the keys to achieving this. On the user side, two trends are becoming clear: individual users striving for self-sufficiency at property level and shared solutions at district and neighbourhood level. Münster's energy-efficiency improvement programme wherever possible prioritises the latter due to the efficiency benefits. Based on the assumed target development path of climate neutrality by 2030, the strategic priorities for action already formulated in the 100% Climate Protection Masterplan apply:

Driving forward the expansion of renewable energies
Promoting cross-sector concepts for the replacement of fossil fuels
STADT MÜNSTER

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Developing an efficient, climate-friendly heat supply in a spatial context
Developing an energy-efficient land utilisation strategy

Given the goal of climate neutrality, the concept study identifies three strategic goals:

Power supply: Electricity consumption must be 100% covered by renewable energy. 3,100 GWh would need to be generated locally and remaining electricity demand imported.
Heat supply: The heat supply must be converted to 100% renewable energy. 100% of oil heating systems must be replaced by efficient renewable energy systems. Fossil natural gas must be replaced by a mixture of different renewable energy sources.
District heating: As an infrastructure for distributing heat from renewable energy, district heating must be boosted and expanded. Decarbonisation of district heating must be initiated by 2030.

The main influencing factors and municipal spheres of influence for achieving the target are described below.

Power supply: The strategic goal of covering 100% of Münster's electricity consumption with green electricity generated as locally as possible is primarily set by higher level decision-makers at the federal government. The legal framework hinders the expansion of renewable energies at a supra-regional and local level. It is highly unlikely that the German electricity mix will be CO₂-neutral by 2030. At municipal level, decentralised PV solutions (tenant electricity, neighbourhood solutions) are particularly affected by the obstacles, which massively inhibit the necessary participation of market participants (housing industry, private homeowners, etc.) and the expansion of PV, despite the presence of roof area potential. The expansion of wind energy in Münster has been significantly hampered in particular by the higher level legal framework (federal government - e.g. through distance regulations) and a lack of acceptance (market participants). City Group Münster cannot determine or fully control the decision-making levels of the federal government or market participants, but can only influence them through direct or indirect actions to achieve their objectives. The greatest potential for action lies with Stadtwerke Münster, which, as a supply network operator and provider of electricity products, is able to exert direct influence. Competition for space is a significant risk to realising local potential for the expansion of renewable energies in Münster. City Group Münster has scope to prioritise the use of land for energy. This potential must be utilised at all levels (targeted design of land use plans and urban land-use planning).

Against this backdrop, by 2030 Stadtwerke Münster aims to supply all households in Münster with self-produced wind and solar power generated, and also enable targeted citizen participation.
STADT MÜNSTER

With regard to the competition for space, the City of Münster is currently working on an integrated space concept with the aim of identifying development areas for new housing and workplaces, locating potential space for a climate-neutral energy supply and at the same time protecting and further developing the city's high-quality open spaces as a key unique selling point.

**District heating**: Münster already has a well-developed natural gas and district heating network. Münster's district heating network, which is around 200 kilometres in length, consists of one primary and six secondary circuits. It supplies heat to parts of the neighbouring areas of Gievenbeck, Gremmendorf and Mecklenbeck. The main feed-in is the CCGT power plant in the Hafen district. Additional combined heat and power plants operate in the more outlying neighbourhoods of Roxel-Nord, Albachten and Amelsbüren. Waste heat is fed into the local district heating network and supplies three residential areas. The network operator in Münster is Stadtnetze Münster GmbH. The share of district heating is around 24%. With the existing grid-based heat supply, City Administration Münster together with Stadtwerke Münster and Stadtnetze Münster has an effective instrument over which it has control, and which has high direct action potential for achieving the key goal of climate neutrality. The legal framework set by the federal government, inadequate funding and resulting economic viability gaps have an inhibitory effect.

As a strategic technical instrument for distributing renewable and waste heat, the Münster Climate Neutral 2030 concept study found that the district heating network should be expanded. This applies above all to city districts and neighbourhoods with a high number of listed buildings. This is an area where a climate-friendly heat supply could realise significant synergies in building deep renovation. The expansion of district heating should also be stepped up in areas in which buildings do not have significant architectural value. This applies in particular to decentralised heat distribution systems aimed at supplementing the expansion of district heating into new neighbourhoods. The opening up of the district heating network to allow feed-ins from other heat sources (industrial waste heat) should be accelerated. This offers opportunities for the integration of additional generation capacities and the utilisation of private and commercial space potential (e.g. roof areas, car parks, etc.). It would therefore be possible to further develop the district heating infrastructure into a platform for the exchange of heat from renewable energies (cf. "Green district heating" certificate measure).

To chart a course to climate neutrality by 2030, the City of Münster is drawing up an energy utilisation plan intended as a long-term foundation for planning a sustainable heat supply. The plan will be updated regularly. Thanks to the integrated approach taken by the energy utilisation plan, which in addition to municipal heating planning includes topics such as electricity, green gases and cooling, the city is going beyond the expected statutory regulations.

**Property supply**: When it comes to achieving climate neutrality by 2030, replacing individual oil and gas boilers is a major challenge. One option is to connect to the district heating network (see expansion and densification of district heating). Heating systems that cannot be connected to a grid-based heat supply would have to be converted to renewable energy. This would require realising 100% of
STADT MÜNSTER

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

the solar thermal and biomass potential described in the master plan, and in particular switching to green gases and heat pumps by 2030. Oil heating systems need to be completely replaced.

The Building Energy Act (GEG) and Heat Planning Act (WPG) will, from 2024, restrict the use of new oil and natural gas heating systems, but only gradually. The GEG will, however, expand the system of subsidies for replacing heating systems.

Sector coupling: As a cross-sectoral technology, sector coupling is a basic prerequisite for achieving the goals in the field of energy production and renewable energies. We therefore also analyse the potential for action in sector coupling in detail here, as this is necessary to achieve all of the key objectives in the field of action of energy production and renewable energies. City Group Münster cannot determine or fully control the decision-making levels of the federal government or market participants, but can only influence them through direct or indirect actions to achieve the objectives. The city can usefully support this process by networking relevant stakeholders, creating framework conditions and assuming a coordinating function: cross-sectoral, interdisciplinary networks and exchange platforms for initiating cooperation, creating relevant knowledge and realising pilot projects are effective ways of exerting influence. The current understanding is that climate neutrality by 2030 cannot be achieved without the consistent use of sector coupling.

The greatest factor impact is achieved in the factors "technology and infrastructure", "economy and social affairs" and "law and organisation". The municipal impact is primarily achieved in the areas of "technology and infrastructure" and "law and organisation".

## 3.3.1.6 Mobility

Against the backdrop of the goal of climate neutrality, the Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study has identified two strategic goals in this field of action:

Reduction in the use of motorised private transport and strengthening of eco-mobility: The study model requires a 5% reduction in emissions from motorised private transport, still largely powered by fossil fuels, annually. A central focus is on the consistent strengthening of eco-mobility through the expansion of cycling infrastructure and climate-friendly public transport - both sub-strategies are mutually dependent (push-pull factors).
Transformation of drive systems: City of Münster must consistently exploit its opportunities for action with regard to transitioning to climate-friendly drive systems and fuels, even if these are small compared to the potential offered by transport planning.

In the assumed target development path, private motorised transport would therefore need to be 100% climate-neutral by 2030. Reducing car traffic by 50% by 2030 will require the expansion of public transport and cycling as mobility alternatives, and these modes of transport will also need to be made more attractive.

The strategic objective is primarily determined by higher level decision-making at the federal government and by supra-regional market participants. City Group Münster cannot determine or
STADT MÜNSTER

fully control the decision-making levels of the federal government or market participants, but can only influence them through direct or indirect actions to achieve the objective. However, as a masterplan municipality and a city with nationwide appeal in the mobility sector, particularly in relation to cycling, Münster can indirectly influence political decisions at State and federal government level by running successful model projects.

With the Münster 2035+ Mobility Masterplan, the Administration is currently developing a conceptual framework for designing climate and city-friendly mobility for Münster that guarantees social participation for all Münster residents. The focus is on striving to continue to improve the high quality of life in the city in future through binding targets and tailor-made measures.

In Münster, the clear goal is to ambitiously continue on the current path to make cycling even more attractive, to increase the share of cycling from the current 47 per cent to 55 per cent of the modal split, and to promote the city's cycling culture. Model projects such as redesigning more streets to create high-quality cycle priority streets 2.0, the implementation of cycle network 2.0 measures, the Kanalpromenade route, the creation of additional cycle parking facilities and bike boxes at railway stations, and the expansion of cycle routes to boost environmentally friendly mobility in the city region should help in this area.

The greatest factor impact is achieved in the factors "technology and infrastructure", "economy and social affairs" and "law and organisation". The municipal impact is primarily realised in the areas of "technology and infrastructure" and "economy and social affairs". In other areas, the municipal impact is almost zero.

## 3.3.1.7 Scope for action at a glance

The previous sub-chapters have described the scope for influence and limits of municipal action. Additional potential for action can be identified in all fields of action.

Overall, the potential reduction in emissions achievable by City Group Münster in conjunction with market participants is a maximum of 50%. The degree and extent to which this potential can be realised depends on decisions made by market participants in Münster. The remaining 50 per cent lies within the influence of the federal government, state and EU. This potential can only be realised if all stakeholders are involved in implementing these measures.

# 3.3.2 "Münster is becoming a climate city" - citizen participation

Becoming a climate-positive city depends on the different forms of engagement exhibited by various members and stakeholders of Münster society. Citizen participation is a broad term that can have many meanings. When implementing measures at the municipal level, there is statutory citizen participation, but there is also informal, i.e. non-statutory, citizen participation. In addition, there are also formats that primarily serve to activate and inform. All aspects are utilised in municipal climate protection process. As described in the Expression of Interest, the City of Münster can build on many years of experience and a wide range of participation formats. The City of Münster also offers a wide range of information and advisory services for all stakeholders in urban society: https://www.stadt-muenster.de/klima/service-beratung

In this paragraph, we firstly describe how citizen participation is realised in implementing municipal climate measures. In 2017, the "100% Climate Protection Masterplan" has been developed with a high level of citizen participation. This plan still forms the strategic foundation of the City of Münster's climate protection measures. Since Münster is now focussing on the step from planning to implementation, citizen participation takes place in the context of implementation of concrete climate protection measures, i.e. by statutory and non-statutory formats. In order to enable also so-called "silent groups" to take part in these formats, the City Administration Münster has developed guidelines for "good public participation" that are continuously developed further.

Then, we describe how participation in the process "Münster is becoming a climate city" process takes place. In this context, the focus is on expanding and utilising the scope of action of all stakeholders in Münster society. Beyond participation formats, the City of Münster provides also further approaches initiatives to enable stakeholder to engage in the climate protection process by utilising their scope of action. These approaches and initiatives are explained in module C-2.

These different forms of citizen participation are all relevant in the context of the climate city contract. Those explained in the first part, are mainly relevant in the context of municipal portfolio of actions. Those explained in the second part, are mainly relevant in the context of enabling and motivating stakeholders to contribute to the climate protection process according to their individual scope for action.

# 3.3.2.1 Citizen participation in the implementation of municipal climate protection measures

To up the pace of climate work, Münster is focussing on the step from planning to implementation. The strategic foundation for all of the City of Münster's climate protection activities is formed by the "100% Climate Protection Masterplan" and the "Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 Concept Study",
STADT MÜNSTER

which builds on the masterplan. The "100% Climate Protection Masterplan" was developed in 2017 with a high level of participation from Münster society. A total of around 1,200 participants took part in the consultation - from local experts and committed volunteers to people who took part in a survey for the sufficiency study. It became clear that climate protection in Münster is of particular concern to the participants. It was also important to them that the input from the events was perceptibly incorporated into the strategies of the masterplan:

Key core results of the strengths and weaknesses analysis from the kick-off event have been taken into account, in particular when determining the potential for action in Chapter 5. One focus here was on the assessment of future developments and trends in Münster by the civic players and their assessment of the potential for positive behavioural changes on the part of Münster's population.
The ideas and visions of the citizens on the climate-neutral future of the city from the vision workshops and the future workshop were the basis for a tangible vision of Münster in 2050. The results can be found in chapters 2 and 6 of the masterplan.
The concrete results of the project workshops are a total of 19 project ideas that were formulated by civic stakeholders. They were included in the programme of action (Chapter 7.2) as project ideas for the master plan. Future support programmes for civic climate protection projects were also discussed in the project workshops and have been developed further afterwards.
All project ideas and approaches are documented as a "pool of ideas" for the implementation phase of the masterplan and will support further work.

The participation process and the individual formats are described in detail in the 100% Climate Protection Masterplan: https://www.stadt-muenster.de/klima/unser-klima-2030/vision/masterplan-100-prozent-klimaschutz

# Citizen participation in implementation of climate protection measures and projects

A wide variety of public participation formats are used by departments and offices during implementation of climate protection-related projects. The Council has adopted guidelines for public participation by tabling the bill "MünsterZukunft gemeinsam machen: "Mitgestaltende Öffentlichkeitsbeteiligung stärken - digitale Beteiligungsinstrumente ausbauen" (V/0553/2021). Particular attention is paid to:

promoting the participation of previously "silent" population groups (promoting diverse and broad participation, i.e. inclusive participation),
transparency about the institutional agencies involved in the process,
the potential inclusion of civil society engagement (strengthening co-production in the sense of joint city-making) and
the expansion of digital participation opportunities.

It is against this backdrop, that the "Guidelines for good public participation - communication, participation and co-production in Münster" were developed (https://www.muensterzukunft.de/Resources/Persistent/0/6/9/6/0696296735cb5e798d53d4f5424b49d5c532da84/Leitorientierungen_Muenster.pdf). They are also available in simple language: https://www.muensterzukunft.de/Resources/Persistent/f/1/e/c/f1ecd68685b10bc6c06ee604dd9476026cf71a2e/Infoblatt_Leichte_Sprache_%C3%9Cbersetzt_07042022.pdf

As an example of a participation process during implementation of municipal climate protection measures, here we explain the public participation process for the "Integrated Land Use Concept", which is being developed under the leadership of the City Administration Münster's Department of City Planning. The aim of the integrated land use concept is to identify development areas for new housing and workplaces, to locate potential areas for a climate-neutral energy supply and, at the same time, to protect and further develop the city's high-quality open spaces as a key unique selling point.

In May 2023, a public participation workshop was held to exchange views on the integrated spatial concept with the aim of charting a course to a common set of values for spatial development supported by Münster society. Participants discussed striking spatial development scenarios and their respective advantages and disadvantages. From 19 May to 11 June 2023, a comprehensive online participation process gave all interested parties the opportunity to immerse themselves in the findings of the workshop process and discuss the striking development scenarios online. With around 400 participants, around 8,350 responses and around 2,260 spatial comments, numerous suggestions from citizens were documented and analysed. Based on the workshop meetings and the evaluation of the online participation, an integrated overall spatial concept was drafted, which takes a balanced approach to the three main uses and tries to combine the advantages of the different scenarios in the best possible way. This draft was again discussed at a final public workshop in November. Detailed information on the public participation process can be found here: https://www.stadt-muenster.de/stadtplanung/planen/integriertes-flaechenkonzept

Another example of public participation is the Mobility Masterplan 2035+. Information on different formats that have taken place during the process, like consultation, surveys, or traffic experiments) can be found here: https://mobil-in-muenster.de/c/beteiligung/

The City of Münster addresses the issue of social justice both through citizen participation, and through climate protection measures. For example, we know that the effects of the climate crisis affect genders differently, even in the Global North. Both the consequences of climate change and the opportunities for political influence and engagement in the field of climate protection exhibit significant gender-specific differences, which are often related to the gender social roles and economic resources. Gender-sensitive approaches are needed to take account of gender-specific needs and challenges in tackling the climate crisis. The Münster 5th Action Plan of the European Charter therefore focuses on climate and gender justice. The 5th Action Plan will be submitted to Münster City

Council in spring 2024. Another example is the Münster travelcard, costing €29 per month, which enables mobility for roughly one euro per day.

## 3.3.2.2 Participation in the "Münster is becoming a climate city" process

With the message "Münster is becoming a climate city" and the climate city contract, a process is being launched that aims to bring together as many stakeholders in Münster society as possible - the City Administration, the city corporation, companies, associations, citizens, clubs, climate activists. Because it takes all of us. The focus of this process is on expanding and utilising the scope for action, which means that it is primarily about information, activation and motivation. The individual formats implemented in this process to date are described below.

## City forum "Münster is becoming a climate city"

The city forum "Münster is becoming a climate city" was the public launch of this climate protection process. It provided space for different perspectives on the goal of climate neutrality and brought about a constructive exchange between citizens, businesses, science, administration and politics. The programme included a Climate Perspectives forum, in which representatives of the following institutions took to the stage to discuss the challenges to becoming a climate city from their perspective: IHK Nord Westfalen, Kreishandwerkerschaft Münster, Stadtnetze Münster, Landwirtschaftskammer NRW, Beirat für Klimaschutz der Stadt Münster, Zentrum für interdisziplinäre Nachhaltigkeitsforschung (WWU Münster). The evening was organised around the question "Who has a concrete idea, approach or project through which they, alone or with others, can contribute to achieving climate neutrality in Münster?" Citizens were also asked to register topics during the registration process. The proposed topics inspired the creation of the following four working groups:

Education, opinion and co-determination
Climate-friendly living - from nutrition to mobility
Space for green buildings, energy and business
Climate in art, culture and society

For more information, please see https://www.stadt-muenster.de/klimastadt/stadtforum On this website, a video recording of the event is also provided.

Following on from the city forum, Münster City Administration launched a process for collecting contributions from Münster society for the Climate City Contract: www.klimastadt.ms (for more information please see below).

# Climate City Week: Because it needs impetus

From 21 to 27 October 2023, the City of Münster invited all citizens to its Climate City Week. The event involved numerous stakeholders giving presentations on their contribution to becoming a Climate City. Participants in Climate City Week were invited to find out more, gain new perspectives, discuss together, scrutinise knowledge and be inspired to develop their own ideas and projects for a climate-neutral Münster.

Climate City Week also saw numerous guided tours and events in which citizens could experience what Münster society is doing to create a climate-neutral future for Münster. Climate City Week served as a showcase on the pathway to a climate-neutral, climate-adapted Münster. The low-threshold, free event significantly realised a significant increase in the circle of participants compared to other events. It was also possible to involve sections of Münster society that had previously been reluctant to participate.

During Climate City Week also saw Münster run its first ClimateBarCamp. A BarCamp is a format explicitly designed to be organised by the participants, as, by proposing a session (whether spontaneous or planned), participants are able to get involved with topics of their own choosing. They then

organise and moderate the session themselves. Although very few people had any experience with this format, it was widely used. The participants ran a total of ten different sessions. With different questions and perspectives, all worked towards the shared goal of climate neutrality and engaged in open, constructive dialogue.

More events to involve and motivate Münster society are planned.

# 3.3.2.3 Participation in the Climate City Contract

The "Münster is becoming a climate city" city forum in June 2023, has been the start to drawing up a climate city contract and initial contributions from initiatives, citizens and companies were received. Everyone who registered for the city forum was invited to a subsequent workshop. On 25 September 2023, around 70 people interested in and committed to climate action met at the invitation of the City of Münster to work together on two follow-up questions from the city forum:

What constitutes contributions from citizens and civil society for the Climate City Contract and what criteria do they need to fulfil?
What ideas, projects and plans from the city forum should be developed further and what needs to be done to realise them?
STADT MÜNSTER

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The workshop showed that the Climate City Contract is an important but not the sole instrument for achieving climate neutrality. No-one can achieve a climate-neutral city alone - it takes all of us (City Administration, business, civil society, national framework conditions). The workshop was therefore a useful step to ensuring that civil society is able to connect with the Climate City Contract and for identifying important issues for the process.

Businesses in particular - as important stakeholders - are also involved in the process. In March 2023, representatives from the city's business community, universities and the Administration met to discuss climate protection in Münster. Over the past few years, participants have observed an increased dynamism and willingness to make changes in the Administration, in the population, and in large parts of the business community. Many companies in Münster are already clearly prioritising the issue of climate protection, making them pioneers within the city. Participants agreed to actively support the Climate City Contract process, including in future years.

In addition to the Alliance for Climate Protection, during the development of the Climate City Contract cooperation in the field of climate protection between the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, the Chamber of Crafts, the District Craftsmen's Association and City group Münster has been further strengthened. The above network of stakeholders has, for example, jointly solicited commitments from companies in Münster. In addition, there is now regular networking within this network, which, alongside the Alliance for Climate Protection, strengthens networking between Münster's business community and the City Administration at the level of associations and chambers and their multiplication and communication effect.

During development of the Climate City Contract, all stakeholders in Münster society are therefore invited and encouraged to commit to the goal of "climate neutrality for Münster" within their scope of action. For companies and institutional stakeholders, that means climate protection projects and measures developed and/or implemented within their company or institution, such as converting their vehicle fleet to electromobility, building energy-efficiency improvements or setting up climate-friendly services. This also includes creating and implementing entire climate protection concepts or transformation roadmaps, or developing and testing innovations that make an important contribution to the climate transition. It also includes public relations work or communication measures, such as education programmes, awareness-raising campaigns or advisory services that promote climate protection. For citizens and civil society, this includes climate protection projects and measures implemented in their own lives, such as energy-efficiency improvements to their homes, getting rid of a car or using social media to raise awareness of climate protection issues. Projects and measures implemented in initiatives and associations also play an important role. The range of activities through which Münster society is supporting the City of Münster on its path to climate neutrality by 2030 is also reflected in the contributions to the first version of the Climate City Contract (see Signatories table in the Commitment). Activating Münster society will be a key element of the "Münster is becoming a climate city" process over the next few years.

The following picture shows how many stakeholders contributed to the first version of the Climate City Contract of the City of Münster:

Commitments can still be submitted via the website www.klimastadt.ms. This is because the Climate City Contract is constantly being updated, i.e. the process is ongoing and everyone still has the opportunity and is still encouraged to participate.

## 3.3.2.4 Climate dashboard: data at a glance

Where is Münster on the path to climate neutrality? What progress is being made on climate protection? And where are the consequences of climate change visible in our city? City of Münster energy and greenhouse gas inventory (https://www.stadt-muenster.de/fileadmin/user_upload/stadt-muenster/67_klima/pdf/01032023_Energie_Treibhausgasbilanz_2021_Bericht.pdf) and the climate dashboard at https://klimadashboard.ms/ provide key data on these questions. They form the basis for charting our future course on climate protection and climate impact adaptation for urban development and urban planning. Today, for example, there are already 38 electric buses in the Stadtwerke Münster bus fleet and 6,003 PV systems with a total output of 91 MWp. https://klimadashboard.ms/

# 4 Part B - Pathways to Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B represents the core of the Action Plan, shaped by local authorities, local businesses, and stakeholders, consisting of the most essential elements: scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, action portfolios and indicators for monitoring, evaluation, and learning.

## 4.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Module B-1 "Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways" should list impact pathways, early and late outcomes and direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits) according to and adapted from the NZC Theory of Change and the AP Guidance - clustered by fields of action.

Table 18 B-1.0: Introduction Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

### 4.1.1 Münster climate neutrality 2030: strategy and fields of action

Münster is a dynamically growing city and therefore faces particular climate protection challenges. The challenge for the future is to achieve our ambitious climate protection targets against the backdrop of a growing population. Münster is able to build on a strong foundation. Since 1995, the city has been one of the most active cities in Germany and Europe in pursuing climate protection and a pioneer in climate-friendly strategies, measures and projects. The climate protection strategy therefore does not need to make good any fundamental omissions, but rather needs to intensify and expand the many existing lines of action and projects. In addition, however, we also need to take carefully selected new paths and pilot innovative approaches. The strategy for Münster is therefore not a rigid plan, but rather a flexible framework for action which enables the city to react to future changes in framework conditions and requirements (for more information on how this framework is applied in practice please see module C-1). The strategic foundation for all of the City of Münster's climate protection activities is the "100% Climate Protection Masterplan" and the "Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 Concept Study". The strategic premises of Münster's climate protection activities are, in order of priority:

Saving as much energy as possible
Utilising the energy we still need as efficiently as possible
Generating the energy we still need from renewable resources
Choosing resource and energy-saving behaviours with a consumer culture to match

This strategy guides our actions in our six areas of activity:

Energy production
Mobility
Building carbon reduction measures
STADT MÜNSTER

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

6

Business and academia
Climate budget
Education and food

Building carbon reduction measures and mobility are the areas with the greatest energy saving potential for Münster. Münster's growing population means that this potential will continue to grow in future. The energy production field of action takes an integrated, cross-sectoral view of generation, distribution and local, renewable energy. In addition to the expansion of renewable energies, the main challenges here are the decarbonisation and expansion of district heating and the decarbonisation of property-based individual heat supply. In addition to technical fields of action, a cultural transformation is also required. It is for this reason that the business and academia field of action offers strong local potential. As a dynamic science and business location and with its innovative, networked companies and research institutions, Münster offers particular opportunities for accelerating already dynamic transformation processes and deploying technical innovations. In addition, the City of Münster has long placed a strong emphasis on maintaining an intensive dialogue with civil society on climate protection and will expand this further in future. The education and food field of action deals with climate-friendly lifestyles and sufficiency and is of particular importance. It focuses on promoting an eco-sufficient lifestyle which prioritises the conservation of resources and, in conjunction with technical measures, is essential for achieving our climate protection targets. The city has great potential for action through integrated, interdisciplinary cooperation, particularly important in the area of climate budget field of action. The main focus here is on ensuring a close interlinkage between climate neutrality and budget planning.

In addition to these issues, City Group Münster has long tackled climate protection and climate adaptation in tandem, with the City of Münster aiming to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 and to adapt to the consequences of climate change.

The results of the assessment of potential and the scenarios outlined in the Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study clearly show that our ambitious climate protection targets are achievable, but that this is a mammoth task for the whole of Münster society. The transformation will only succeed if the technical and spatial potential is utilised consistently and at an early stage, and if the city intensifies and expands its extensive activities by incorporating sufficiency considerations in particular.

The impact pathways for the fields of action required in the templates are presented below. These fields of action do not entirely correspond to the fields of action presented above, which are the main focus in Münster. The impact pathways are primarily based on the results of the Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study, which serves as the strategic foundation for all City of Münster's climate protection activities. The emissions reduction potential that needs to be realised in the fields of action are based on the city's energy and greenhouse gas inventory (as at 2021) and are geared towards the goal of reducing emissions by 95 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. To this end,
STADT MÜNSTER

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

the emissions that can be determined from energy consumption in individual sectors (private households, commercial and other, industry, and mobility) have been applied to the individual fields of action as follows.

Emissions that can theoretically be saved through measures in the energy production field of action consist of consumption in the static sector ("private households", "trade, other" and "industry") of the energy sources district heating, heat from renewable energies and electricity. Emissions that can theoretically be saved through measures in the building carbon reduction measures field of action consist of consumption in the static sector ("private households", "trade, other" and "industry") of the energy sources heating oil and natural gas. Emissions that can theoretically be saved through measures in the mobility field of action consist of fuel consumption in the transport sector.

The impact pathways show how the goal of climate neutrality - measured against the Cities Mission target of tackling 80 per cent of the emissions gap by 2030 - could theoretically be achieved, provided that all stakeholders – i.e. the City of Münster (City Group Münster and Münster society) and federal, state and EU governments – fully exploit their scope for action and significantly streamline and accelerate the processes required to achieve this. In order to maximise the scope for action of City Group Münster and Münster society, the fields of action in Münster go beyond the classic climate protection fields of action.

The City of Münster is very aware of the co-benefits associated with the climate protection measures and these are always tackled in discussions. It is not currently possible to quantify the co-benefits associated with individual projects, but there have been deliberations and developments in this area, for example in the CoLAB Pilot Cities project. https://netzerocities.eu/germanys-pilot-activity-colab-committed-to-local-climate-action-building/

Table 20 B-1.2: Description of impact pathways- textual and visual elements

(B-1.2: Description of impact pathways- textual and visual elements
(Describe, visualise, and contextualise pathways listed above)

The explanation below of the impact pathways outlined above is largely based on the Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study. This describes a possible, theoretical pathway to climate neutrality by 2030. It does not formulate a rigid plan, but rather guidelines necessary for achieving this goal. The fields of action correspond to the priorities set out in the commitment - a mix of technical fields of action with high CO₂ reduction potential and non-technical fields of action primarily aimed at the cultural transformation of Münster society. The presentation for each area of action also provides examples of the measures City Group Münster is taking to meet the challenges.

## 4.1.2 Münster climate neutrality 2030: scenario and impact pathways

## 100% of electricity from renewable energy

For a city, Münster has a relatively large theoretical and technical potential to generate electricity from renewable energy. The photovoltaic potential theoretically installable on roofs and in open spaces is 2,400 megawatts peak (MWp). The challenge lies in realising this potential. The total area required is available in principle, but the primary goal has to be solving problems with competition for space. A solution is currently being developed in the form of the Münster integrated area concept. The aim of the integrated area concept is to identify development areas for new housing and workplaces, to identify potential locations for a climate-neutral energy supply and, at the same time, to protect and further develop the city's high-quality open spaces as a key unique selling point.

If this potential is realised, Münster can generate a large proportion of its electricity demand within the city itself. Under our assumptions, additional electricity imports from the surrounding region would need to cover around 16% of electricity demand. From the user point of view, green electricity can already be purchased at the same cost as the basic supply. The figure below shows electricity consumption in Münster and possible changes in the electricity mix. It is based on the scenario for achieving climate neutrality in 2030. Despite an increase in electricity consumption as a result of factors such as the switch to electromobility and electricity use for heat generation, 100% of demand can be met by renewable energies. The scenario was based on the assumption that the German electricity mix will also be required to be climate-neutral by 2030.

The fundamental challenge in this area is the competition for and limited availability of space in Münster. The priority is to utilise the potential offered by roof space, particularly in existing buildings. The roof areas of new residential buildings must of course be utilised for photovoltaics.

Photovoltaic and wind power are already economical today (especially when the electricity is used at the point of production).

# 100% heating from renewable energy

The transition to a climate-neutral heating supply is taking place in the boiler room, the municipal district heating infrastructure and the broader transformation of the gas market. By 2030, the transition to decarbonising district heating will have begun. "Green district heating" can only be realised economically if the number of properties supplied in compact spatial contexts increases and consumption intensity decreases, resulting in a fall in heat density. The transition to "green district heating" requires the conversion of centralised heat generation, a reduction in temperatures in the pipe system and grid densification and expansion.

Challenges to the district heating transition include:

Decarbonised generation portfolio: The existing generation portfolio needs to be decarbonised. This requires, for example, the replacement or conversion of the existing combined cycle power plant. Deep geothermal energy offers significant potential in Münster.
Grid expansion and densification: Grid expansion and densification are prerequisites for securing the place of district heating as the backbone of the heating supply in Münster. This applies both in areas with large numbers of listed buildings and in areas consisting of buildings with no significant

architectural value. In particular, it is necessary to close the profitability gap for new networks - which depends above all on the higher-level legal framework.

Planning periods: A fundamental problem is the length of planning and implementation periods. Realising the heating supply transition by 2030 requires a significant acceleration in the planning and construction processes.

In addition to the conversion of the district heating system, heating oil and natural gas need to be removed from the heating mix. This affects an estimated 165,000 homes. Heat generation in Münster is unlikely to function entirely without gaseous fuels. Green gases from renewable energy will therefore need to replace fossil natural gas by 2030. One fundamental risk is that there will not be sufficient green gases from renewable energy available by 2030 (sector coupling). Uncertainties concerning future technical and legal developments are creating a cautious investment climate in sector coupling. Many technologies are still in the development or test phases and will only become economically viable for market participants when an appropriate framework is in place and innovative concepts have been developed to market maturity.

To achieve the goal of a climate-neutral heat supply, a transformation roadmap for Münster is currently being developed in the context of federal funding for efficient heating networks (BEW) as well as a municipal heat and energy utilisation plan.

## Climate-friendly mobility

Avoidance, modal shift and improvement (meaning greater efficiency and/or use of renewable energy) is the triad for climate-friendly mobility. The Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study shows that motorised private transport's share of energy consumption needs to fall by around 5% per year. This means
STADT

MUNSTER

#

that a shift to cycling and public transport is absolutely essential. Simultaneously, fossil fuels need to be phased out completely, meaning that by 2030 motorised private transport needs to be  $100\%$  electric. In addition, it is also necessary to develop a charging infrastructure. This needs to occur in both the public and private domains. To achieve a ratio of 14 vehicles per public charging point requires, taking into account existing public charging points in Münster at the time of the study (2020/2021), around 9,000 public charging points. According to the Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study, around 79,000 private charging points also need to be installed.

The figure below shows the changes in energy consumption in the transport sector required to achieve the target. Energy consumption falls sharply due to efficiency improvements and reduced traffic, coupled with the replacement of petrol and diesel with electromobility

Figure 21 Scenario evolution of energy consumption in the mobility sector and share of electricity from renewable energy

With the Masterplan Mobility Münster 2035+, the City Administration is currently developing a conceptual framework for designing climate and city-friendly mobility for Münster that guarantees social participation for all Münster residents. The aim is to achieve extensive local climate neutrality in the mobility sector through increased traffic avoidance and a shift from motorised private transport to eco-mobility.

# Münster waste-free 2030

awm is striving for a waste-free Münster 2030 by turning Münster into a bastion of waste prevention. Realistically, it will not be possible to prevent all waste in future. The goal is therefore to ensure that, by 2030, all remaining waste will be reusable materials, most of which will be recycled. The rest will be channelled

into efficient waste-to-energy generation. The "Waste-free Münster 2030" vision is primarily a public relations challenge.

## Climate adaptation

In Münster climate protection and climate adaptation go hand in hand. The strategic foundation for climate adaptation in Münster is the climate adaptation concept developed in 2015. This is the foundation for a climate adaptation policy work programme which aims to continue the longstanding process of developing Münster's urban, green and open spaces to maintain the good urban climate conditions in Münster.

## Climate-neutral new builds

Münster is a dynamically growing city. The forecast is for around 2,000 additional residential units per year by 2030. The KfW-40 standard for new builds has been introduced for urban development contracts and property purchase agreements together with the solar standard.

The figure below shows the effect of the KfW 55 and KfW 40 energy standards (gradual introduction of the Plus Energy standard) on City of Münster's greenhouse gas inventory based on the forecast additional residential units. It is clear from this comparison that the introduction of the KfW 40 standard and the gradual introduction of the Plus Energy standard is a necessary prerequisite for avoiding further impacting City of Münster's CO₂ inventory.

The Münster City Administration has binding quality criteria and guidelines for everyone involved in the construction process for municipal buildings for both new builds and renovations. The building guidelines apply to all buildings municipal buildings with the aim of creating a building stock aligned with climate protection and sustainability.

# 100% climate-neutral residential building stock

In the 2030 scenario, achieving the goal of climate neutrality requires almost 100 per cent of the housing stock to be renovated by 2030. This would correspond to a deep renovation rate of 8-9%, i.e. deep renovation of a total of around 1,210,000 m² of living space per year. This assumes that deep renovation reduces energy demand by around 80 per cent, roughly in line with the KfW 40 standard. The deep renovation of existing buildings represents the biggest local challenge to achieving the climate protection target.

Deep renovation costs are mainly incurred by the housing industry and private homeowners. Economic viability for the housing industry is completely different than for owner-occupiers. Landlords can pass on 8% of the cost to tenants each year after deducting maintenance costs (non-occupancy costs) and subsidies (e.g. repayment subsidy). Depending on the framework conditions (rent levels), deep renovations are more economical in this sector. There is, however, a risk that, in a growing city like Münster, which already suffers from high rents, rents will increase further if this is not cushioned by federal policy regulations.

For owner-occupiers, the only economic amortisation, taking subsidies into account, arises from reduced energy costs. Given the high standards required, there is a fundamental risk that this will be unprofitable.

The shortage of skilled labour and the high capacity utilisation of trade businesses are already hampering deep renovation activity. Given the deep renovation rates required, it is to be expected that market participants will be unable to meet demand. There is a considerable execution risk here, over which City Group Münster has only limited influence, but, together with trades, architects and the construction industry as a whole, they must use what influence they have.

The City Administration is leading by example with its strategy to achieve climate neutrality for municipal buildings by 2020. Münster also has an initiative by the district craftsmen's association and craft businesses, Altbau-Partner Handwerk Münster, that have joined forces to form a powerful alliance for the expert deep renovation of existing buildings. They support Münster citizens who need help with in modernising and renovating existing buildings. Integrated advisory services, ideally in combination with financial incentives such as Münster's "climate-friendly residential buildings" funding programme, have been in place since 1997 and need to be expanded to cover private renovators and homeowners' associations.

So far, we have primarily outlined the areas of action that - as outlined in the commitment - are of outstanding importance for the climate protection process due to their  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  savings potential. However, the City of Münster is also focussing on non-technical fields of action, the impact paths of which are explained briefly below.

# Climate-friendly work and business

To maintain an equal emphasis on economic, social and environmental concerns in Münster, emissions must be decoupled as far as possible from employment growth. To achieve this, the 2030 scenario requires an  $80 - 90\%$  fall in GHG emissions per employee - which means a climate-neutral economy. One example is the introduction of mandatory use of photovoltaics in suitable new commercial buildings. This is one area where there is direct potential for municipal action.

Key challenges for realising this transformation include:

Insufficient renewable electricity for the manufacturing industry. Given the target of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  neutrality by 2030 and to ensure Münster's viability as a future business location, particularly for manufac

turing and industrial companies, it will be important to provide companies with a reliable, competitive supply of electricity from renewable energy. In view of the limited resources for constructing and operating power plants generating electricity from renewable energy, a proportion of renewable electricity will need to be sourced regionally wherever possible in future.

Process energy is generated efficiently, but is not climate-neutral. Final energy demand for process heat in Münster arises in particular from companies in the chemical and food industries. Process heat accounts for the largest share of final energy consumption in the industrial sector. The high cost pressure on energy-intensive companies results in the rapid implementation of efficiency improvements. This is not yet sufficient to achieve climate-neutral production. In addition to further efficiency efforts, additional measures for decarbonising process heat are needed. This challenge too can be addressed through the Climate City Contract and dialogue with business representatives.

Climate-neutral transformation of existing companies and relocation: For many Münster companies, sustainability is also a key corporate development issue. A municipal economic policy orientation towards climate neutrality makes it necessary to focus action on supporting the transformation of existing companies and the establishment of new climate-neutral companies. This issue is a core topic of discussion in "Münster's Alliance for Climate Protection - the Business Network", where experiences in this area are exchanged.

Lack of knowledge about their emissions. Companies have a social responsibility to reduce climate-relevant emissions. They are coming under increasing pressure to provide information about their efforts to do so. A fundamental problem is often a lack of data on emissions, particularly supply chains emissions. Small and medium-sized companies in particular have neither the knowledge nor the resources to analyse this. Here, too, the Alliance and the start-up advice for SMEs are an important element of municipal action.

# Climate-friendly individual choices

Promoting social change: The experience of being able to do something about global warming strengthens people's feelings of self-efficacy and is a driving force for social change towards greater sustainability and climate protection. It is not about lecturing, but about taking care of yourself and thus setting a positive example for others. When a critical mass of people is attained, this individual experience becomes a social process.

The Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study shows that around  $25\%$  of Münster's citizens would have to be activated and qualified through concrete offers in order to achieve permanently stable climate-friendly behaviour in everyday life. Experience from City of Münster's projects (e.g. the climate-friendly choices real-world laboratory) shows a there is the potential to reduce energy-related  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions by between 1 and 1.5 tonnes per person per year.

The portfolio of measures of the City of Münster Group focuses on the implementation of strategic projects that are primarily intended to bring about systemic change with regard to both the City of Münster Group's direct and indirect scope for action. The Münster City Group's climate protection work has long pursued the approach of achieving climate protection targets not only by technical measures. What is also needed is a cultural transformation of the entire urban society. The following areas of action are therefore at the centre of the portfolio of measures: Energy production, Mobility, Building carbon reduction measures, Business and academia, Climate budget, Education and food. The measures listed in this brief description are explained in detail in section 4.2.2.

Stadtwerke Münster's heating strategy consists of various decentralised renewable generation technologies, with the district heating network forming the backbone as an existing large-scale inner-city distribution structure that is to be further densified. Deep geothermal energy, which is a promising option in view of the geological situation, could become a major component of heat generation. Other leading technologies include solar thermal energy, electrical heat generation in power-to-heat plants, utilisation of environmental heat using large heat pumps (including from the Dortmund-Ems Canal and from wastewater) as well as seasonal large-scale heat storage systems. Some of these technologies are or will be located in the combined heat and power plant.  |

To this end, Stadtwerke Münster has agreed to a comprehensive cooperation with Deutsche Telekom, among others, in which Stadtwerke will contribute its expertise for laying the fibre optic lines and Telekom will provide its own know-how. Due to its higher efficiency, fibre optic technology consumes significantly less electricity than copper-based networks (up to 17 times less electricity). As a result, Stadtwerke Münster's fibre optic expansion is making a crucial contribution to the goal of climate neutrality in Münster.  |

|  Mobility | Electrification of public transport | Target 2030: Another important building block for the heartbeat of Münster is substituting the municipal fleet of diesel busses by electric and emission-free drive technologies. In addition, the development of the transport sector into a systematically interlinked multimodal mobility system. By 2029, 100% of the 116 buses owned by the Stadtwerke Münster and around 100 rental busses from the decentralised depots of private partner companies on the outskirts of the city are to be electric and emission-free. At the same time, the necessary infrastructure is being built at the bus depot and at selected bus stops. Various funding programmes are utilised to finance the project. The Stadtwerke Münster are trying to involve their contractors and regional transport companies as far as possible. The multimodal mobility system will integrate various modes of transport, including carsharing by the Stadtwerke's holding in the carsharing provider "Stadtteilauto".  |

|  Climate budget | Socio-ecological criteria for procurement | On 7 September 2022, the Council commissioned the First Mayor to set up a joint working group of politicians and the administration in order to develop socio-ecological criteria for the procurement of goods, services and trades. Moreover, this working group's tasks is also to propose a procedure for ensuring and monitoring compliance with these criteria in accordance with the law. The administration has proposed a guideline text to the working group and submitted it for discussion in the political realm with related stakeholders from civil society. Political representatives have commented on the draft of guidelines that is now with the administration for revision so that the working group can then vote on version to propose to the Council.  |
|  Climate budget | Guidelines for sustainable investments | There is no standardised definition of a sustainable investment. In principle, sustainable investments are responsible, ethical, social and ecological investments. Environmental factors, social responsibility and good corporate governance are included in the investment process (ESG criteria). Sustainable investing indirectly increases the pressure on companies and countries to fulfil their responsibility towards our society to a greater extent. The investment has a steering function and strengthens sustainable companies/states in competition. Since 2016, investments have been made in accordance with sustainability criteria. The investment guidelines have now been developed and expanded to include sustainability criteria. For the first time, investment and exclusion criteria for the purchase of government bonds have also been defined. In addition, certain ESG rating classifications must be met in the future for investments in companies / countries.  |

In particular, this should serve to keep an eye on investment costs and to assess which cost increases are actually necessary. In addition, controlling should take a critical look at the demands of individual offices and examine the extent to which these are actually necessary. Politics, real estate management and individual offices are currently not able to check this independently.  |

|  Climate budget | Green bonds | In September 2021, the City Council of Münster resolved that the administration should initiate sustainable capital procurement via a green bond. The Green Bonds has been placed on the market in September 2022. Due to the great interest in the Green Bonds, the original volume of EUR 100 million was increased to EUR 140 million and allocated. It was pleasing that all maturities from 7 to 20 years met with interest from investors and could be serviced. A total of 16 investors subscribed to the green bonds. The first allocation and impact report on the green bond was published in September 2023. The report provides information on the use of funds (allocation report) and the sustainability impact of the financed investments and projects (impact report).
The launch of a further green bond for 120 million euros is planned in 2024.  |

|  Education and food | Climate-friendly lunch catering in schools | Status: The requirements for the quality of lunchtime catering in schools are increasing (Council resolution 2022 / citizens' suggestion §24 GO). The city administration has therefore increased the required proportion of certified organic food from 20% to 30% in the latest tenders. The key component of climate-friendly lunchtime catering would be the use of regionally produced food and catering. This could minimise transport costs and thus CO2 emissions. However, restricting tenders to a regional area is contrary to public procurement law. The schools currently have different catering systems depending of the availability of on kitchen-, catering facilities-. At the moment, the city administration is exploring alternative forms of organisation for climate-friendly lunchtime catering at schools and day-care centres. Among other things, the possibilities of reducing climate-damaging effects by utilising existing canteen kitchens are being analysed. Due to the complexity of the topic (e.g. various stakeholders with different interests, legal framework conditions, financing), a considerable amount of research and coordination is required. The city administration assumes that a draft resolution on lunchtime catering in day-care centres and schools can be presented to the City of Münster's council committees in the third quarter of 2024.  |

## 4.2.2 Münster climate neutrality 2030: from project to principle - the step from planning to action and acceleration

In order for local climate and energy transition to be successful, it is critical to move from the development of concepts and plans to the development, prioritisation and, most importantly, the implementation of measures and projects. To this end, Münster is focussing in particular on the implementation of strategic projects that are within the city group's scope of action and with which the greatest possible direct and indirect influence can be exerted on the realisation of climate protection measures. Direct influence means that the City of Münster Group can realise the climate protection measures by itself. Indirect influence means that the City of Münster Group sets the framework conditions, but the realisation of climate protection measures is highly dependent on the involvement of the city society. Strategic projects of the City of Münster Group, are defined as projects that enable a realisation of climate protection-relevant activities in the City of Münster Group and in city society by

Support and promotion
Making change possible
Setting clear rules

This focus on these strategic projects, which then should lead to corresponding implementation projects across the breadth of society and of the City group, allows for "moving from planning to action" to a much greater extent and, if possible, to generate additional acceleration of implementation. The strategies, goals and objectives on which these projects are based have been developed in the 100% Climate Protection Masterplan and the Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study. The implementation of the strategic projects is managed by the principle "from project to principle", which means that focus is put on systemic changes rather than on individual projects. To illustrate this, the City of Münster is not only deeply renovating individual school buildings, but has also developed a strategy and a roadmap for how the relevant building portfolio needs to be deeply renovated in terms of energy efficiency.

In the following, an overview of the portfolio of measures is provided which are in the implementation phase as part of the City of Münster Group's strategic projects. It is not possible to show all of the underlying individual implementation measures. This focus on the strategic projects is linked to a new governance structure that is currently being established in order to accelerate implementation. This structure not only has an impact in terms of the climate protection process, but also in terms of climate protection policies, as the fields of action go beyond the traditional fields of action of municipal climate protection. This means that the cross-sectional orientation of climate protection in the City of Münster Group is also realised by a holistic approach to climate protection.

## 4.2.2.1 Anchoring and monitoring climate protection as a cross-sectional task in the Münster city group

At the governance level, climate protection is now being established as an interdisciplinary topic in the city group to a greater extent and has been defined as one of the most important issues for the future by the city council. This means that all departments and offices as well as institutions and municipal
STADT MÜNSTER

subsidiaries must utilise their respective scope of action in order to become a climate-friendly city. The Administrative Board manages this process, which is the top management level in the City of Münster group. In concrete terms, one person from the top management level of the city group assumes process responsibility for a specific field of action and reports quarterly to the Administrative Board on the status of implementation of the various projects and plans within that respective field of action. This process ensures an effective monitoring of the climate protection process (see also Module C-1).

The portfolio is presented below, organised by the different areas of action. The current status is also briefly discussed as background information at the beginning of each section.

Quantifying the carbon reduction impact of climate protection measures is complex and not always feasible, as various factors and interactions play a role. This includes complex societal, economic and social systems. In addition, time lags can occur between the implementation of measures and their actual impact. Quantification models are often build on extensive assumptions, which entails uncertainties meaning that it is not possible to measure progress in terms of carbon reduction quantitatively. In addition, local factors and global interactions can complicate the assessment. Therefore, the quantification of climate protection measures can only be provided for some measures - usually where concrete changes in energy consumption can be directly assigned to a measure.

## 4.2.2.2 Energy production

On the road to climate neutrality: the strategy of the City of Münster and Stadtwerke Münster in the area of energy production.

The City of Münster and Stadtwerke Münster are jointly pursuing an ambitious vision: the transformation of their energy supply towards climate neutrality. This ambitious strategic objective is not only an ecological goal, but also paves the way for a future worth living for all residents of Münster.

The focus of the field of action "energy production" is the conversion of all urban energy sources to renewable alternatives. From the generation of electricity and heat to the distribution of energy through intelligent supply networks, the City of Münster and Stadtwerke are focussing on a mix of wind and solar energy as well as other renewable heat sources to replace fossil fuels. Electricity and heat are becoming genuine local products - and more and more Münster residents are becoming electricity producers.

Sustainable heating transformation: In 2030, new renewable heating technologies will drive the decarbonisation of district heating in Münster. In doing so, the municipal utilities are utilising the opportunities that Münster offers them. From the development of deep geothermal energy to the establishment of ground-mounted solar thermal energy and the use of large heat pumps, innovative technological solutions are being implemented to make the city's heating supply sustainable. Reliable planning forms the basis for the heating transformation: a transformation plan in the context of federal funding for efficient heating networks (BEW) and a municipal "heating and energy utilisation plan" in accordance with the law on municipal heating planning - an integrated plan that also analyses the role of electrification (heat pumps) and hydrogen in the future energy supply. For the necessary decarbonisation of the property-based, individual heat supply by private homeowners, the City of Münster is dependent on the federal

and state governments creating the framework conditions for the heating transition, e.g. through standards and funding by means of the Buildings Energy Act as well as CO₂ pricing.

Expansion of renewable energies: a determined expansion of decentralised energy generation from the sun and wind on-site is key to meeting electricity requirements in a climate-neutral way. The city's wide range of advisory and campaign services continue to support private homeowners in the expansion of PV systems. For example, the Münster solar cadastre service provides an initial assessment of the roof potential for every building in the city: www.solarkataster-muenster.de. Information services like this have contributed to Münster being the leader in the expansion of private photovoltaic systems in 2023. According to a nationwide study: a total of 513 private PV systems per 100,000 residents were installed in the city in the period from January to September 2023 (https://www.stadt-muenster.de/aktuelles/pm-details?1141702).

However, when it comes to solar energy generation, it is not just the potential space on roofs that needs to be exploited. Ground-mounted systems will also contribute to both the renewable electricity and heat supply in 2030 - and create ecological niches for biodiversity. Through projects such as agri-PV projects and the implementation of "tenant electricity" (Mieterstrom in German) pilot projects, innovative approaches are being pursued to maximise the use and acceptance of solar energy. The expansion of PV systems on municipal buildings falls within the City of Münster Group's field of action "Building carbon reduction measures", as this is governed by the so called municipal building guidelines.

Wind energy plays a key role in sustainable energy supply. Stadtwerke Münster plans to generate 280 GWh of electricity per year through its own wind turbines from 2030 and to double the number of turbines it owns and operates.

The energy transition in Münster is a joint project between the city administration, Stadtwerke Münster and the city society. Through innovative technologies, specific measures and the active participation of the population, Münster is a pioneer in terms of climate protection and sustainability.

This assumption relates to the CO_{2} emissions of our power plant at the municipal port in the base year 2021. The actual CO_{2} reduction potential can deviate significantly in reality, as the emissions depend on the actual heat consumption in the respective year and are therefore subject to fluctuations due to the expansion of the district heating supply and weather conditions, among other things. The calculation also assumes that the use of renewable heat is emission-free.

A more concrete assumption of the CO_{2} savings potential can only be made once the transformation plan has been drawn up.  |

Stadtnetze Münster GmbH is part of the H2vorOrt initiative, which has launched an industry-wide planning process with the Gas Grid Transformation Plan (GTP). The GTP lays the foundation for a hydrogen transformation in the distribution grid throughout Germany. H2vorOrt is an association of currently 47 distribution network operators in the German Technical and Scientific Association for Gas and Water (DVGW) in cooperation with the Association of Municipal Enterprises (VKU). They are pooling their expertise for a ramp-up of the hydrogen economy. The aim of the GTP is to accelerate the transformation of the gas distribution networks and to embed the individual plans of the network operators in a coherent target picture for the whole of Germany.
This involves, among other things, connecting the distribution grid to the hydrogen long-distance grid by rededicating individual transfer stations. Stadtnetze Münster has concrete expansion plans for the supply of climate-neutral gases for all other generation plants that are to be operated in the future. In addition, joint projects with upstream network operators will secure capacities of green gases at an early stage and feed them into the distribution networks.
In addition, Stadtwerke Münster and Westenergie AG have decided to push ahead with the ramp-up of green hydrogen in Münster. This partnership also extends to its subsidiaries, Westnetz GmbH and Stadtnetze Münster GmbH. In a letter of intent (LOI), the four companies have agreed to share their experience  |

The aim is to identify development areas for new housing and workplaces, to locate potential areas for a climate-neutral energy supply and, at the same time, to protect and further develop the city's high-quality open spaces as a key unique selling point. The aim is to create a sustainable framework for future spatial urban development and at the same time preserve Münster's ability to act with regard to future housing and workplace requirements.

In this respect, the IFM process is intended to prepare a cross-departmental and interdisciplinary consideration of the different demands on the space, it is informal and is carried out proactively by the city.  |

## 4.2.2.3 Building carbon reduction measures

In the "Building carbon reduction measures" field of action, a distinction is made between new construction and the deep renovation of existing buildings. The implementation of measures focuses in particular on the topic of deep renovating existing buildings, as this is where the greatest potential for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ savings can be realised. In the area of new construction, the measures focus primarily on the aspect of "setting clear rules". Examples of this are measures such as the guidelines for climate-friendly urban land-use planning or Münster's standard for climate-friendly construction, which are continuously developed further. The aim of the guidelines for climate-friendly urban land-use planning is to establish climate protection and climate adaptation concerns in the processes of building land development and to take them into account obligatorily. Münster's standard for climate-friendly construction is established by all urban development contracts, land purchase contracts and leasehold contracts with the City of Münster and includes requirements for the building energy standard and the use of solar energy in new buildings.
STADT MÜNSTER

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Thus, the municipal scope of actions is utilised purposely. Further specifications and requirements for climate-friendly new construction are required by corresponding laws and regulations at the national and state level. The City of Münster proceeds as a role model with its own building portfolio. With the 2020 building guidelines, binding quality criteria, with regard to climate protection, and sustainability, apply to both the new construction and deep renovation of municipal buildings. These guidelines go well beyond the minimum legal requirements and ensure that new buildings are constructed as net zero-emission buildings. As a municipal subsidiary, Wohn- und Stadtbau also has a deep renovation strategy for its building portfolio. The City of Münster also promotes a wide range of measures to optimise the energy efficiency of private residential buildings through the "climate-friendly residential buildings" funding programme. Moreover, the city administration of Münster offers a wide range of information services: https://www.stadt-muenster.de/klima/bauen-sanieren. In addition to strategies for individual buildings, an integrated approach is being pursued at neighbourhood level. In this way, synergy effects can be utilised through a concerted approach, resulting in a significant acceleration of energy-efficient building refurbishment overall.

The neighbourhood level also makes it possible to investigate property-independent factors that increase residential value and have an indirect influence on energy-efficient deep renovation (living environment, local amenities, mobility options, etc.) in an integrated manner. Solutions are tested as models within the framework of neighbourhood concepts and are implemented and further developed in a next step. The stakeholders, e.g. homeowners, must carry-out the deep renovations themselves. The Interreg project FutureBEEing is also developing a specification for a digital tool in Münster that provides an integrated overview of all measures and different scenarios that can promote the sustainability of a neighbourhood. Among other things, it is an important instrument for answering planning questions in connection with the deep renovation and restructuring of existing neighbourhoods in conjunction with their cost points.

Particularly with regard to the deep renovation of the private building stock, it is of central importance that the federal government and the state of NRW exploit their scope for action, e.g. within the framework of the Building Energy Act, the modernisation guideline RL MOD NRW 2023 plus funding programme, the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  pricing as part of the climate package. The portfolio of measures in the "Building carbon reduction measures" field of action thus forms the basis for achieving the necessary emission savings as part of the EU mission. To this end, the measures it contains are constantly being developed and adapted to new standards.

## 4.2.2.4 Mobility

The latest mobility survey conducted by the City of Münster in autumn of 2022 shows the following: Münster residents make almost half of their daily journeys by bike, with cycling currently accounting for 47% (2019: 44%). At the same time, the share of car traffic has fallen to 26 per cent (2019: 34 per cent). The share of pedestrians is 19 per cent (2019: 12 per cent), while local public transport accounts for eight per cent (2019: ten per cent). The so-called eco-mobility, i.e. a sustainable transport system consisting of footpaths, bicycles and public transport, thus already has a share of 74 per cent in Münster (2019: 66 per cent). With the Münster Mobility Masterplan 2035+ (Masterplan Mobilität 2035+), the city administration is currently developing a conceptual framework for designing climate-friendly and urban-compatible mobility for Münster that guarantees social participation for all Münster residents. The focus is on continuing to increase a high quality of life in the city in the future through binding targets and tailor-made measures. The objective is to achieve local climate neutrality in the mobility sector to a large extent by an increase in traffic avoidance and modal shift from motorised private transport to eco-mobility. Local public transport, which is shifted towards more climate-friendly drive technologies, is a key pillar of mobility, i.e. it is operated on dedicated routes or prioritised over motorised private transport as far as possible. The system is completed by a reallocation of areas and an expansion of infrastructure for local mobility. A redistribution of road space in favour of eco-mobility and an expansion of green and open spaces also promote a better quality of life in public spaces. At the same time, a purposeful expansion of charging infrastructures should also promote a transition to electric mobility in private motorised transport. The portfolio of measures in the field of mobility will continue to develop against the

backdrop of the development of the masterplan. As for the electrification of commercial vehicles envisaged in the Economic Model, the City of Münster is relying on the federal and state funding framework, e.g. via the "Directive on the promotion of commercial vehicles with alternative, climate-friendly drive systems and associated refuelling and charging infrastructure" (KsNI). Through the measures outlined here and their further development, the City of Münster is laying the foundations for the emission savings required as part of the mission.

|   |  Action description | Target 2030:
Another important building block for the heart-beat of Münster is the substitution of municipal fleet’s diesel buses by electric and emission-free drive technologies as well as the development of the transport sector into a systematically interlinked multimodal mobility system. By 2029, 100% of the 116 buses owned by the Stadtwerke Münster and around 100 rented buses from the decentralised depots of private partner companies on the outskirts of the city are to be electrified.
At the same time, the necessary infrastructure is being built at the bus depot and at selected bus stops. Various funding programmes are being used to finance the project. The Stadtwerke Münster are trying to involve their contractors and regional transport companies as far as possible.
The multimodal mobility system will integrate various modes of transport, including car sharing by the Stadtwerke’s holding in the carsharing provider “Stadtteilauto”.  |

# 4.2.2.5 Climate budget

In Münster, processes of target and strategy development in order to meet the changing social challenges have been discussed for many years. The grand challenges of the future, such as climate neutrality and its associated tasks, require a reorientation and prioritisation of municipal funding in addition to the necessary federal, state and EU funding schemes. This means that the municipal climate protection strategy and the description of budgets and their impact on the budget must be closely interlinked. Münster is currently working on the development of a climate budget. In addition, the City of Münster has implemented a framework for green and social financing, which includes the obligation to report annually on the use of funds and the sustainability impact of the borrowed capital raised. Beyond that, climate protection is also addressed with regard to capital investments of the City of Muenster. Currently, a cross-departmental, cross-party working group is developing guidelines for procurement aiming at establishing social-ecological criteria for the procurement of goods, services and trades for the City of Münster. Although the measures of the "climate budget" field of action do not directly reduce emissions, they form a central basis for the necessary steps towards transformation by guiding the allocation and use of funds and thus pave the way for achieving the mission goal.

The administration has proposed a guideline text to the working group and submitted it for discussion in the political realm with related stakeholders from civil society. Political representatives have commented on the draft of the guidelines that is now with the administration for revision so that the working group can then vote on which version to propose to the Council.  |

|   | Action description | There is no standardised definition of sustainable investment. In principle, sustainable investments are responsible, ethical, social and ecological investments. Environmental factors, social responsibility and good corporate governance are included in the investment process (ESG criteria). Sustainable investing indirectly increases the pressure on companies and countries to fulfil their responsibility towards our society to a greater extent. The investment has a steering function and strengthens sustainable companies/states in competition.

The City of Münster invests money in two special municipal funds, in particular to reduce future pension burdens for pension payments to civil servants. The City of Münster is the sole investor in the Versorgungs- und Sanierungs-fonds (VUS Fund), while the Westfälische-Versorgungs-Rücklage Fonds (WVR Fund) is a consortium of nine municipalities.

Since 2016, investments have been made in accordance with sustainability criteria. The equities and corporate bonds acquired by the fund management must fulfil certain sustainability criteria. Some sectors are completely excluded (fracking/military weapons/atomic energy/climate-damaging energy), while all other sectors must achieve a certain level of sustainability. Corporate bonds must be so-called 'green bonds'. Provisions on the sustainability of investments are set out in the City of Münster's investment guidelines.

In addition, the City of Münster has significantly expanded ESG reporting, particularly in its solely held fund. The ESG report and the carbon report are now an integral part of the Investment Committee's semi-annual meeting. These  |

|   |  | measures have significantly improved the carbon footprint and ESG rating of the securities held and therefore of the city's investments.
The investment guidelines have now been further developed and expanded to include sustainability criteria. For the first time, investment and exclusion criteria for the purchase of government bonds have also been defined.
In addition, certain ESG rating classifications must be met in future for investments in companies / countries.  |

In particular, this should serve to keep an eye on investment costs and to assess which cost increases are actually necessary. In addition, controlling should take a critical look at the demands of the individual offices and examine the extent to which these are actually necessary. Politics, real estate management and individual offices are currently not able to check this independently.  |

The climate budget tool is intended to help us to understand the climate impact of financial decisions.
Yet, no local authority in Germany does have a genuine climate budget. Therefore, a concept needs to be developed in order to interlink information on the budget and information on climate projects.
The classification into categories A-D with regard to the climate impact of investment in municipal school buildings was a first step, but did not lead to comprehensive transparency and clarity (see Investmentplan). The idea is to create a link between the monitoring elements of budgeting and climate impact via an accompanying budget template in which the city group's major/strategic projects in the area of climate protection and climate adaptation are listed centrally. The template contains the following elements:
Review of the balance sheet presentation (water level report)

# 4.2.2.6 Education and food

The City of Münster's climate protection work has long been characterised by the approach that climate protection targets cannot be achieved by technical climate protection measures alone. What is needed in addition is a cultural transformation of the entire urban society. In this respect, the main issue is that systemic changes are required for the social transformation to succeed. The aim of the City of Münster is therefore to create and promote an environment that supports citizens to make climate-friendly decisions in areas such as mobility, housing and energy or consumption and nutrition. As part of the transformation process of the city administration into a modern and future-oriented organisation, the following goal was set accordingly: "The transformation of the urban society must be understood as a systemic task of the city, citizens and companies. The aims are to activate, qualify and multiply climate-friendly behaviour in society as a whole". Comprehensive sustainable education is firmly established in school and extracurricular facilities and concrete spaces and opportunities are created for trying out and experiencing with climate-friendly alternatives. Climate training (a coaching programme for citizens) forms a basis for this. It will be scaled up in the coming years. The topic of "Education and food" closely links to the comprehensive Münster 2030 sustainability strategy, which shows how the city can be designed so that future generations will also have the same resources and decision-making opportunities, making Münster fit for grandchildren. In 2019, Münster was honoured with the German Sustainability Award for its 2030 sustainability strategy: https://www.stadt-muenster.de/umwelt/nachhaltigkeit. Although the measures in the "Education and food" field of action are unlikely to result in direct emission savings, they are particularly important for communicating the topics of a climate-friendly lifestyle and individual options for action to the population in order to achieve the mission goal.

|   |  | implementation as one of the key projects of the Münster 2030 sustainability strategy.

The goals of a sustainable food system are
Implementation of the German Nutrition Society's quality standards for community catering in as many community catering establishments as possible, including an increase in organic-certified community catering establishments (bronze, silver, gold)
Establishing and expanding regional value chains and strengthening supply structures for regional, seasonal, fair trade and organically grown foods
Contribute to halving food waste and reducing food losses or packaging waste
Expansion of co-operations
Expansion of educational and information services and
Exploring and utilising the municipal scope for action in order to achieve targets

At the time, the administration had commented in the council resolution that this comprehensive project approach could only be realised if additional resources were made available, including for a staff position and material resources.

The administration has now (August 2023 submitted a project proposal for the BMEL competition "Food for Münster 2030 (FoorMS2030). Shaping the food transition in the region collaboratively"), in cooperation with Münster University of Applied Sciences and Ernährungsrat e.V. It is a two-stage process. The proposal is under review.  |

|   |  | In its resolution V/0669/2019, the City Council of Münster adopted the following objective: "Catering in the municipal canteens is increasingly organic, fair, regional and seasonal. Vegetarian and vegan options are fixed components of the menu"

The programme of measures for a climate-neutral city administration in 2030 was adopted with the submission V/0731/2021. It specifically states: "City events, lunch catering in the canteens and council work will be sustainable and climate-neutral."

Until 2022:
% of the catering in the municipal canteens is based on fair, seasonal and regional organic food. 33% of the dishes are vegetarian.

By 2030:
Where available, food requirements are covered entirely by environmentally friendly, seasonally produced organic food from the region. Also applies to municipal facilities and businesses (within the available budget)

Various sub-projects need to be implemented in order to achieve this goal. The central approach is currently the application of the municipal canteen for the NRW canteen programme of the NRW Consumer Advice Centre: The NRW Consumer Advice Centre offers specialist advice to support publicly funded institutions in optimising their catering services. Canteens are supported in making their catering supply more attractive and health-promoting, reducing food waste and raising awareness for greater appreciation of food. They also receive impulses for the procurement of regionally produced food. It re-  |

Moreover, a portfolio of around 15 products and services in the context of housing and energy, mobility, consumption and nutrition is supplied permanently by Münster-based companies and organisations in order to provide the opportunity to test climate-friendly products and services. This portfolios checked on a regular basis and any necessary adjustments are made.

The ClimateTraining approach is to be scaled up by providing it more target group-specific
ClimateTraining goes school: ClimateTraining is established as a project course at the Mathilde-Anneke comprehensive school, participating pupils are trained as climate trainers in order to coach pupils from the lower school or primary schools,
Climate training in the neighbourhood: As part of project up2030 urban planning and design, the concept of climate training in the neighbourhood will be developed as a measure to involve residents. It is planned to implement the concept in 2025.  |

|   |  | §24 GO). The city administration has therefore increased the required proportion of certified organic food from 20% to 30% in the latest tenders. At the same time, the change in sponsorship of open all day-schools (OGS) from the city to independent sponsors has reduced the city's influence on the organisation of catering at primary schools. The aspect of climate-friendly nutrition is to be pursued further as part of the revision of the OGS quality standards. For tenders for lunchtime catering at secondary schools, climate-friendly aspects can be taken into account in the specifications, insofar as this is permitted under public procurement law. The specifications provide for the proportionate use of organic, seasonal and fairly produced food.  |

|   |  | The key component of climate-friendly lunchtime catering would be the use of regionally produced food and catering. This could minimise transport costs and therefore CO₂ emissions. However, restricting tenders to a regional area is contrary to public procurement law. The schools currently have different catering systems depending on kitchens facilities available.  |
|   |  | The city administration is currently looking at other alternative forms of organisation for climate-friendly lunchtime catering at schools and day-care centres. Among other things, the possibilities of reducing climate-damaging effects by utilising existing canteen kitchens are being examined. Due to the complexity of the topic (various stakeholders with different interests, legal framework conditions, financing), a considerable amount of research and coordination is required. The administration assumes that a draft resolution on lunchtime catering in day-care centres and schools can be presented to  |

Construction costs per well (excluding operating costs)
Drinking fountain: > 30,000 euros
Drinking fountain wall model: < 10,000 euros

Example:
Every district of Münster (17) will have a drinking fountain. Assumption: Around half of the drinking fountains can be realised as wall-mounted models on existing buildings without an additional pipe network and sewer connection:
drinking fountains x 30,000 euros = 270,000 euros
wall models x 10,000 euros = 80,000 euros
Total: € 350,000

CO_{2} reduction potential:
Drinking fountains: 102 tonnes of CO_{2} reduction with 17 drinking fountains with a withdrawal of 30,000 litres per year (empirical value)
Refill Germany: Water quantities cannot be recorded, so it is difficult to quantify a CO_{2} reduction.
"DrinkWater" information campaign: Difficult to quantify, as it is not possible to evaluate changes in user behaviour.  |

## 4.2.2.7 Business and academia

Through networks such as "Münster's Alliance for Climate Protection", "Münster's Alliance for Science", the City of Münster's Advisory Board for Climate Protection and many other formats, close links have been established between the City of Münster and the business and academia sectors since more than 10 years (see Module C-2 and Module A-3). For example, over one hundred companies are involved in the "Münster's Alliance for Climate Protection" network to implement concrete measures and climate protection roadmaps in their own companies. In specific projects, such as "Ökoprofit" or the "Consultation on energy efficiency", companies get specific advice and support by the City of Münster in order to
STADT MÜNSTER

C

realise climate protection. With concrete measures, the companies save energy costs and carbon emissions. For example, after a total of 13 project rounds in which a total of 138 companies implemented more than 1,500 individual measures, Ökoprofit was able to collectively save more than 30.4 million kilowatt hours of energy, almost 20,108 tonnes of carbon dioxide, 172,156 million litres of fresh water and 2,064 tonnes of residual waste per year. In addition to the operational support, the City of Münster is focusing on the broad participation and involvement of the local economy in strategic economic projects such as the location development strategy 2030+, in which the development of a climate-neutral city is a central core element. Due to its numerous universities and research institutions Münster as Science City is also a pioneer in many areas, particularly in the field of sustainable and climate research. The success of the energy transition will also largely depend on a functioning skilled trades sector. Close co-operation, e.g. through the master plan for the skilled trades, forms the central basis for this. As part of the development of the Climate City Contract, the Münster City Group has been supported by many companies and universities (see Description of participatory model).

## 4.2.2.8 Waste

Waste Management Münster (awm) is a subsidiary of the City of Münster. In 2020, awm has developed its vision for 2030 that entails a clear sustainability perspective. With Vision 2030, awm is striving for a waste-free Münster 2030.
STADT MÜNSTER

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

Waste Management Münster wants to develop Münster into a capital of waste prevention by 2030 through actively involving citizens and building a strong network of cooperation partners. These goals can be achieved through projects with citizen participation, target group-oriented educational work, high-quality waste recycling and partnerships for the generation of renewable energies. Consequent waste avoidance by urban society and innovative utilisation of the remaining waste make a fundamental contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Awm's current measures and objectives are set out in the DNK declaration for 2022:

https://datenbank2.deutscher-nachhaltigkeitskodex.de/Profile/CompanyProfile/13986/de/2022/dnk

In addition to the measures and projects outlined in the DNK report, awm is examining further innovative technologies and methods in order to continuously optimise its processes and intensify its contribution to the bioeconomy and circular economy. Currently, one focus is on pyrolysis as a potential expansion of processes for the utilisation of biowaste and/or green waste. This negative emission technology (NET) could be used to produce biochar from biogenic waste such as fermentation residues and screen overflows from composting. This process promises to reduce  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  efficiently in the long term. Carbon from the atmosphere is bound in the form of biochar, which thus acts as a carbon sink. In this process, biomass is thermally processed at temperatures between  $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and  $800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  under the reduced influence of oxygen. Part of the waste heat generated is utilised to support the process. Surplus energy could also be utilised sensibly, for example by feeding it into the district heating network. The biochar produced by pyrolysis is characterised by its versatility. This method aims to improve the utilisation of organic waste and promote the production of sustainable products, which would make an important contribution to achieving global sustainability goals, particularly in the areas of climate and energy efficiency as well as waste avoidance and recycling.

Awm is currently also intensively examining its own heat production and utilisation with the aim of possibly feeding surplus heat into the public district heating network.

## 4.2.2.9 Climate adaptation

Climate adaptation has long been part of Münster's climate work. The City of Münster has been taking part in the European Climate Adaptation Award (eca) since autumn 2020. The City Council approved the City of Münster's participation in the European Climate Adaptation Award on 25 March 2020 (V/0149/2020). The eca is a quality management system and certification procedure for municipalities to support them in their work to adapt to the consequences of climate change. In addition to an analysis of the current situation, a climate adaptation policy work programme must be drawn up and adopted for certification. As part of the eca, the existing programme of measures (Climate Adaptation Action Plan 2030) has been explored according to the needs and potentials identified in the as-is analysis. The result of this analysis is that the measures described in the climate adaptation action plan are already a good basis for achieving the City of Münster's climate adaptation goals. Through implementation of the measures by 2024, an increased score for certain areas can be achieved. For this reason, the Climate Adaptation Action Plan 2030 will be transferred to the Climate Adaptation Policy Work Programme as

part of the eca (V/0075/2023): https://www.stadt-muenster.de/sessionnet/sessionnetbi/get-file.php?id=524001&amp;type=do

The budgeted costs of the measures in the financial and cost plan (V/0799/2019) are totalling to approx. 12.3 million euros up to 2030. The costs are based on the preliminary estimates of the respective offices and the organisers of the measures and reflect the framework of the costs for personnel, investment and material resources. In addition to the funds estimated here, further funds, primarily investment and personnel funds, are required in the individual budgets of the agencies for adaptation to climate change. It will only be possible to concretise the cost framework in the preparation of the respective separate resolutions. The costs can be significantly reduced through third-party funds (e.g. subsidies or fee financing).

## 4.2.2.10 Agriculture

The City of Münster covers an area of 303.3 square kilometres. Of this, 103.5 square kilometres are used as farmland, 22.7 square kilometres as green space and 49.70 square kilometres as forest land. Altogether, this area corresponds to almost half of the city area. This land is farmed by around 600 family farms, almost half of which do this as main source of income.

Since 2021, the city administration of Münster has had the position of an Agricultural Officer, whose task is to advise the administrative management and its departments on all agricultural issues and to act as a contact person for Münster's farmers in order to ensure a good exchange between the city administration and farmers. This task also comes into play in many projects relevant to climate protection, for example:

Initiating and coordinating the organisation of a soil practitioner course in cooperation with Bioland NRW (association of organic farmers), the Bioland Foundation, the Westfälisch-Lippischer Landwirtschaftsverband e.V. (famers association) and the Landwirtschaftsverlag (publishing house). In the soil practitioner course, 25 farm managers (both organic and conventional) from Münster / Münsterland were trained by the Bioland Foundation in the areas of: Soil life, humus formation, water retention capacity, soil protection, carbon storage, nutrient cycle were intensively trained over a period of 9 months. Further courses are planned in order to distribute the topic of climate protection in agriculture. The journalistic support of the weekly newspaper with a series of articles has given this course a national profile. The transformation of agriculture in the City of Münster is thus decisively advanced.
Representation of agricultural interests in the process for the integrated area concept for settlement development and the creation of areas for the production of renewable energies with a focus on urban and energy area development that minimises land consumption (see measure in the energy production field of action).
Initiating, coordinating and planning the joint development of rooftop PV systems in the Kasewinkel farming community. The background to this is the frequent negative feedback from Stadtnetze Münster on the demand of individual farmers to expand the grid due to economically

unviable expansion costs of the grid infrastructure for each individual farmer. The aim of the project is to support the merger of farmers through to the formation of a company in order to realise a joint, economically viable connection point with the grid operator. This is fulfilled in cooperation with the Westfälisch-Lippischer Landwirtschaftsverband e.V. (association of farmers) and the Münster Netze.

Other projects with a link to agricultural concerns can be found in the portfolio outlined above in the fields of energy production and education and nutrition.

Table 1B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions
B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

(Detail how residual emission will be offset, if applicable)

Despite all the efforts that are already being made in the City of Münster to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero and that will continue to be made in the coming years, it will be necessary to offset a residual amount of unavoidable emissions. This residual contribution is made up of unavoidable emissions and upstream chains over whose reduction the City of Münster has no direct influence. Against this background, the City of Münster has commissioned experts to draw up proposals for possible offsetting strategies. However, offsetting is only a last resort in Münster. The focus of climate protection work in Münster is primarily on energy saving, energy efficiency and the expansion of renewable energies, which are strictly prioritised over offsetting.

Based on an expert estimate as part of the Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study, this remaining base will still amount to around 90,000 tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  equivalents annually in 2030. This calculation is based on the City of Münster's target of reducing emissions in 2030 by 95 per cent compared to emissions in 1990. The calculation was based on emissions of 1,891,000 tonnes in 2019 and also assumed a reduction of 95 per cent by 2030.

Therefore, the assumption of the residual contribution assumed here differs from that calculated in the economic model. In order to achieve the mission's target of reducing emissions by 80 per cent by 2030, the economic model offered by NetZeroCities has shown that 342,000 tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  must be offset.

The Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study has identified options for offsetting for the City of Münster, which are discussed below. An offsetting strategy for the City of Münster and the goal of climate neutrality in 2030 will be developed.

Due to the requirements for municipal greenhouse gas accounting in accordance with the BISKO methodology (municipal accounting system), projects that are not included in the municipal inventory must be selected for offsetting measures. This would otherwise mean double counting of the reduction or include measures that are carried out by the municipality anyway to prevent emissions (e.g. installation of PV systems). An offsetting strategy could therefore also include the following measures in light of the EU mission requirements:

# Local compensation through reforestation

There is no general answer to the question of how much CO₂ can be stored by planting a tree. How much and how quickly a tree can bind carbon dioxide depends on various factors such as species, age, wood density, climate, soil quality and water supply. However, it is possible to come close to a statement based on certain assumptions.

Assuming a normally grown beech tree with a height of 23 metres and a certain circumference, it can store around 550 kilograms of dry matter in its leaves, branches and trunk. With an estimated additional ten per cent stored in the biomass of the roots, a total of around 600 kilograms of dry matter is bound - this corresponds to the storage of one tonne of CO₂. Due to the production and release of oxygen during photosynthesis, the amount of CO₂ stored exceeds the dry mass.

In order to absorb one tonne of CO₂, a beech tree must grow for around 80 years. Converted to one year, the tree can store 12.5 kilograms of CO₂. This means that around 80 trees are needed to offset one tonne of CO₂ per year. However, it should be noted that trees tend to accumulate little biomass in the first few years after planting. It is only with increasing age that more CO₂ can be bound.

The following table shows a rough estimate of the space required and the costs if the remaining amount is fully compensated by reforestation on the urban area.

Table 22 Space required for afforestation as a compensation measure

|  Assessment of space requirements | Unit | Result  |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Unavoidable greenhouse gases | [tCO₂eq/a] | 90.000 |   |
|  Storage 81 beeches | [tCO₂eq/a] | 0,0125 |   |
|  Demand trees | [-] | 7.200.000 |   |
|  Squad afforestation | [Trees/ha] | 1.230 |   |
|  Space requirement | [ha] | 5.850 |   |
|  Area City of Münster | [ha] | 30.290 |   |
|  Share of space required | [%] | 20 |   |
|  Forest stock Münster | [ha] | 4.860 |   |
|  Costs (min. to max.) | [€/ha] | 1.500 | 3.500  |
|  Total costs | [€] | 8.775.000 | 20.475.000  |
|  Specific costs | [€/tCO₂] | 98 | 228  |

Source: Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study, p. 47 (appendix)

In this calculation example, it should be noted that the actual space requirement and the associated costs may be lower. This is due to the fact that in addition to the beech as the main tree species, secondary tree species are also planted between the beech trees in the selected group afforestation. As these also bind CO₂, which was not taken into account in the present calculation, this could result in lower costs in the future

Soil is an indispensable asset not only against this background, but above all due to its diverse functions in the ecosystem. Its loss cannot be compensated for. Münster has been involved in the "Alliance

for Land" at the Ministry of the Environment, Agriculture, Nature Conservation and Consumer Protection of North Rhine-Westphalia and has contributed its experience with resource-conserving settlement development. In 2014, Münster was one of six pilot municipalities to be certified by the NRW Ministry of the Environment with the "Milestone" as a land-saving municipality (Milestone "Gold").

As part of the Münster 2030 sustainability strategy (submissions no. V/0648/2017, no. V/0515/2018 and no. V/0669/2019), strategic development goals were formulated to preserve the natural foundations of life, according to which development potential should generally be utilised in existing built-up areas before new land is used in outdoor areas. In operational target mode, this means keeping sealing as low as possible. This is in recognition of the fact that Münster is a growing city and that the population increased from 296,440 to 319,441 inhabitants between 2011 and 2022, an increase of 7.8 per cent. A further objective was formulated that the ratio of land for settlement and transport (FSuV) per inhabitant should fall continuously.

With the resolution on the 2019 - 2022 programme of measures of the Münster 2030 sustainability strategy (submission no. V/0669/2019), further concrete measures for space-saving development were formulated; among other things, the development of the barracks sites and the reuse of areas such as the former city harbour, Beresa, Lancier were mentioned in the area of inner development.

Regional and supra-regional compensation through moorland rewetting

In principle, it is possible to take measures to rewet moorland areas to compensate for emissions. However, the areas are limited and face enormous demand. Compensating for the remaining 90,000 tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  per year in 2030 would require a moorland area of around 218,000 to 436,000 hectares. In this case, the costs would amount to an estimated 2,180,000,000 to 4,360,000,000 euros.

MoorFutures: By offsetting through the purchase of corresponding certificates such as MoorFutures from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Brandenburg and Schleswig-Holstein, it is possible to offset 1 tonne of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  by purchasing a certificate for 64 euros. With over 600,000 hectares, these federal states are among the most peatland-rich states in Germany. The certificates are closely aligned with the Verified Carbon Standard and the Kyoto Protocol and follow the requirements of internationally recognised environmental standards (ISO 14064 and 14065). MoorFutures are registered at regional level by regional coordinating organisations, so that decommissioning is ensured by a corresponding register. Offsetting the remaining 90,000 tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  per year in 2030 would result in costs of around €5,760,000 per year.

On this basis, the City of Münster will develop a compensation strategy in the coming years in order to off-set all residual emissions necessary...

(Please provide here any further detail on listed interventions)

Back in 2019, the City Council passed a resolution that Münster should become climate neutral by 2030 if possible. The Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study has once again shown very clearly that transforming Münster society to become climate neutral is a systemic task for the city, citizens and companies, and has to be understood as an agile process.

Module A-3 outlined how Münster society is involved in the "Münster is becoming a climate city" process. In summer 2022, an inter-departmental Climate City core team was formed to realise participation by Münster society. The team is made up of the Climate Office from the Directorate for First Mayor Affairs and Münster Marketing, a wholly-owned company based in the Directorate for Planning, Building and Economic Affairs. The Climate Office primarily contributes its professional perspective and experience from almost 30 years of work on citizen participation in municipal climate protection. Münster Marketing has expertise and experience in large, city-wide participation processes, such as the "MünsterZukunft" future process. The core team is also supported by the Department of City Planning, also part of the Directorate for Planning, Building and Economic Affairs. The Department of City Planning also has extensive experience in participation processes and was in charge of developing the "Strengthening co-designing public participation - expanding digital participation tools" public participation guidelines (V/0553/2021).

The municipal scope for action was outlined in Module A-3. Exploiting this requires the participation of all departments, offices, institutions and municipal subsidiaries, not just one focus area.

This process was kicked off by an internal City Group Münster administrative conference in May 2022. The climate conference brought together representatives from the departments and from municipal operating companies such as Abfallwirtschaftsbetriebe Münster and municipal subsidiaries such as Stadtwerke Münster. The all-day event included workshops featuring a moderated process that looked at more than 100 proposals in the areas of education and food, households, mobility, buildings, energy, science and business, and identified, discussed and adopted concrete measures for achieving Münster's goal of climate neutrality by 2030.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Climate neutrality as a priority field of action and cross-cutting issue - management by the Administrative Board

At the governance level, the City Council defined it as a key issue for the future and the City Administration Münster has more firmly established climate protection as a cross-cutting issue. This process is managed by the Administrative Board.

Management by the Administrative Board is based on the climate project board, a digital board similarly to a Kanban board. The aim of the project board is to provide an overview of all of the City Group's strategic climate neutrality projects. In this case, "strategic" means projects that are highly significant in terms of CO₂ savings, regulatory/framework and/or support, such as municipal energy efficient improvements or the expansion of renewable energy.

In the project board, these strategic projects are allocated to fields of action (energy production, building carbon reduction measures, mobility, business and academia, education and food, climate budget). For each field of action, there is a senior manager responsible for the process who reports to the Administrative Board and is responsible for the implementation process. They are known as topic owners (Themenpaten). Technical responsibility and responsibility for project implementation remains with the specialist departments. Topic coordinators form the link between specialist departments and topic owners. They collect information from specialist departments and identify interfaces between individual projects across all fields of action. This process is supported by the Climate Office.

The Climate Project Board, which lists the City Group's major climate projects, is particularly important for internal coordination within the City Group. The project board and the associated process are used to drive forward project implementation. Accordingly, the board is used for status reports/discussions on achieving climate neutrality in the Administrative Board and is continuously updated and supplemented with new measures. Reports are submitted to the Administrative Board on a quarterly basis.

## Climate impact assessment

On the basis of three resolutions (V/0669/2019, V/0770/2019, V/0738/2020), the Council has decided that political proposals should be subject to a climate and sustainability assessment. This means that the Council has recognised that the challenges of climate change and sustainability are a high priority in municipal policy and must be taken into account in all decisions. To better consider the impact of all climate and sustainability-related proposals in future, the Administration has developed a proposal on how draft resolutions can indicate the expected impact on climate and sustainability. This proposal is still being finalised within the Administration. Once this proposal is in a position to be applied, it will provide politicians with a further option for steering the city-wide climate protection process. Certainly it creates further transparency and should increase awareness of climate protection within the Administration long term.

Climate-neutral City Administration

In addition to a city-wide assessment in the "Münster climate neutrality 2030" concept study, the "Climate-neutral City Administration" concept study specifically assessed energy consumption and emissions for the City Administration as an organisational unit. Working from this baseline footprint, the study identified reduction path scenarios and, taking into account all processes already underway, developed a comprehensive programme of 22 bundles of measures to set the City Administration on the path to climate neutrality. These measures are being implemented since 2021 and are coordinated by a single office.

The success of the execution of City Group Münster's strategic climate protection projects is reviewed via a monitoring system, the elements of which are described below.

## Energy and greenhouse gas inventory

The City of Münster's energy and greenhouse gas inventory provides an overview of changes in energy consumption and energy-related greenhouse gas emissions within the city. It is compiled annually and provides an overview of historical and current emissions. Münster draws up its GHG inventory in accordance with the nationally recognised and established BISKO standard, which takes national framework effects, such as the national electricity mix, into account in making local calculations.

The GHG inventory also differentiates between different areas of use (heat, electricity and transport), energy sources (e.g. heating oil, electricity, natural gas, district heating) and sectors (private households, trade and other, industry and transport). The 2030 climate neutrality target can also be used to model the annual depression target and residual budget both by sector and by field of action.

The GHG inventory is updated annually and is the central tool for measuring climate neutrality in Münster. However, because achieving city-wide climate neutrality is not solely in the hands of the City Group, other instruments are helpful for measuring progress in the climate protection process and utilising the City Group's scope for action.

## Climate dashboard

Alongside the energy and greenhouse gas inventory, the dashboard uses indicators to show where Münster stands on the path to climate neutrality and where progress is being made in climate protection. It also maps the consequences of climate change. Sample indicators include number and output of installed PV and wind power plants, composition of the local electricity mix, motor vehicle traffic, number/proportion of electric buses, waste quotas, activities of stakeholders from business and society, etc., etc. The data used in the dashboard are updated on an ongoing basis and are open data. See: https://klimadashboard.ms/

## Budget template (climate budget) and climate report

Currently, the city's investment programme does not fully link individual measures and city-wide objectives or politically agreed fields of action. The focus currently is on the deployment of financial resources in individual planning years. The budget therefore shows investment measures sorted by department and office. This type of overview, which fulfils the requirements of budgetary law, makes direct consideration of the impact of individual measures in the budget difficult (a detailed explanation can be found in the investment plan).

Previous experience with the implementation of a climate budget in Münster has shown that a climate budget taking the form of an accompanying budget template appears to be the most appropriate option. This is because it enables additional information to be presented in a supplementary budget template (as well as in a structured electronic file) without requiring an unreasonable amount of work. Realising a purely qualitative estimate of the impact on a particular field of action, in this case climate neutrality, requires answers to the following questions:

Does the investment measure support the relevant field of action (positive impact)?
Does the measure have neither a positive nor a negative effect (neutral)?
Would the measure have a negative impact on the field of action if implemented?

This outlines the inter-departmental and inter-office management of strategic climate protection projects within City Group Münster. As described in Module A 3, Münster society is involved both in implementing individual climate protection projects and in the broader "Münster is becoming a climate city" process.

Below, we outline the involvement of superordinate bodies.

# Regional level: State of NRW

At state level, the three mission cities, Münster, Aachen and Dortmund, have forged an alliance and speak with a common voice to the state government. The three cities view the following points in particular as ways in which the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia, represented by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Municipal Affairs, Building and Digitalization of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia (MHKBD), can support a shared implementation of a comprehensive climate and energy transition:

The MHKBD assumes a central contact and coordination function with respect to other state ministries with climate-related mandates for the cities of Aachen, Dortmund and Münster in terms of state policy issues and requirements.

The MHKBD pilots potential legislative changes in the cities of Aachen, Dortmund and Münster. The use of experimental clauses (Experimentierklauseln) enables the implementation of specific pilot projects, access to funding and, where necessary, a simplified MHKBD procurement process.

The cities of Aachen, Dortmund and Münster and the MHKBD agree on regular meetings (four times a year) involving a fixed group of senior figures, to discuss relevant requirements, needs and problems in shaping the climate and energy transition in the participating cities, and address them to the appropriate bodies. The aim is for all other ministries with climate-related mandates to take part in these meetings.

The cities of Aachen, Dortmund and Münster will make the experience and knowledge gained in implementing climate protection via the EU mission, and in particular from implementing the specific pilot projects, available to other cities in NRW, with the aim of provide enduring support for the transformation of the state of NRW.

Climate protection can only be realised together. For this reason, support from the superordinate levels of government in NRW will boost and expand scope for action at municipal level.

Since 2022, the state of NRW has combined all previous climate protection and energy initiatives under the umbrella of the state company NRW.Energy4Climate. The core role of this state company is to facilitate necessary investments in NRW, attract funding to NRW and thereby to advance the implementation of climate protection and the energy transition. NRW.Energy4Climate GmbH supports the Münster climate protection process. This support consists primarily of specialist workshops and targeted advice, and networking on various climate protection-related topics and issues, and with other State of North Rhine-Westphalia institutions and committees. NRW.Energy4Climate is able to draw on a broad regional and professional network to actively support the process in Münster.

level to create a favourable framework for achieving their goals. They are supported in this by the Deutscher Städtetag, which, as the leading local authority association, lobbies the federal government, Bundestag, Bundesrat, European Union and numerous other organisations on behalf of municipalities. The First Mayor of Münster, Markus Lewe, is current President of the Deutscher Städtetag.

In 2023, the German government stated in its future strategy for research and innovation that it wants to make an active contribution to the success of the EU's "100 climate-neutral and smart cities" mission and provide the selected nine German cities with the best possible support (p. 42): https://www.bmbf.de/SharedDocs/Publikationen/de/bmbf/1/730650_Zukunftsstrategie_Forschung_und_Innovation.pdf?_blob=publicationFile&amp;v=4

The analysis "Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality" shows that, in addition to federal, state and local government, market participants, i.e. citizens and households, companies and institutions, also have an important role to play in achieving climate neutrality. The City of Münster has long been involving these stakeholders in its climate protection work. In doing so, it is important to consider the scope for action of each of these participants and the framework conditions required,

and to hold them accountable in proportion to their $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions reduction potential. In this part, we present approaches initiatives to enable stakeholder to engage in the climate protection process by utilising their scope of action. Citizen participation approaches in the context of climate protection policies are described in Module A-3, 3.3.2).

## Business participants in city society

As part of Münster's Alliance for Climate Protection, which has been in existence since 2011, companies are involved in climate protection activities and benefit from a network that offers a platform for dialogue, workshops, specialist events and advice. Dedicated companies and institutions create model projects and campaigns in Münster with the aim of encouraging others to follow suit. Because they know that active climate protection is not just good for the environment, it's good for the economy too. Alliance for Climate Protection members (industrial businesses, skilled trades, retailers, service providers, etc.) undertake:

to play an active role in achieving Münster's climate protection target
to take energy-saving and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-reduction measures in their area of responsibility
to draw up an internal $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ footprint with specific $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reduction targets
to participate in developing and implementing at least one $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reduction project

The companies are supported with their climate protection activities through regular themed workshops, enabling them to benefit from extensive networking opportunities and advisory services. The success of the alliance is clear and quantifiable through the voluntary engagement of those involved and the networking that takes place. Becoming a member of Münster's Alliance for Climate Protection is worthwhile for every company, thanks to the economic benefits achieved by implementing energy-saving projects, sharing experience with other companies and expertise transfer from external advisors.

Alongside the Alliance for Climate Protection, the development of the Climate City Contract has further strengthened cooperation between the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, the Chamber of Crafts, the District Craftsmen's Association and Münster City Administration on climate protection. The above network of stakeholders has, for example, jointly solicited commitments from Münster companies. In addition, there are now regular exchanges within this network, which, alongside the Alliance for Climate Protection, also strengthens networking between Münster's business community and the City Administration at the level of trade associations and chambers of commerce.

## City society: Climate-friendly choices by citizens

In 2017, the 100% Climate Protection Masterplan established the principle of trying to connect with the whole of Münster society. Studies carried out during development of the Masterplan clearly show it is not possible to meet climate protection targets through purely technical climate protection measures. It requires a cultural transformation of the whole of Münster society. The issue of ecousufficiency highlights that climate protection work in Münster is a socio-political task. The Münster

approach sees sufficiency not as a question of going without, but as a question of consuming the right amount of energy and resources in line with the City of Münster's climate protection goals and creating a consumer culture to match. The aim of the City of Münster is to create an environment that promotes climate-friendly choices in areas such as mobility, housing and energy, and consumption and nutrition. This means focusing equally on citizens and providers of climate-friendly services, offerings and products.

The Münster marketplace model: In 2017, results from underlying analysis, first principles and guidelines were used to develop the "Münster marketplace model". As a future target group, it focuses on the heterogeneous civil society, which the model divides into decision-makers and providers. By definition, both groups are open to climate protection, are engaged or already have climate-friendly products on the market. The creation of innovation niches in which decision-makers and providers develop climate-friendly offerings, live and serve as "transformation pioneers" and role models. Initial approaches to activating sections of civil society on the part of the city include participatory formats and offerings such as Münster's participatory campaign "Our Climate 2030", the city's environmental advisory service and project workshops, and the "Climate-friendly residential buildings" funding programme. These approaches are continually being developed further, as outlined below.

Climate training is a key component of the "Climate-friendly living" field of action. ClimateTrainers support others in navigating their way towards climate-friendly day-to-day living. They provide support in drawing up an initial carbon footprint, advice on individual goals and give tips and assistance in realising the goals set. City Administration Münster regularly offers climate training to Münster citizens. All Münster residents aged 16 and over can apply. There are currently 18 active climate trainers.

Everyone who takes part in ClimateTraining is given the opportunity to test and try out climate-friendly behaviours, offerings and products from various Münster providers. This enables them to experience practical ways of sustainably improving their individual day-to-day carbon footprint. The aim for participants during the trial phase is to think about which climate-friendly choices they can and should integrate into their day-to-day lives long term. For a decision to really become routine takes time. Participants support each other and are motivated by the climate trainers. Providers also benefit from direct contact and dialogue with participants, the city and each other. They have the opportunity to test and introduce new products and services, expand cooperation and improve the environment for climate-friendly choices in Münster for everyone.

Pupils at Mathilde Anneke School will also take part in the next ClimateTraining event in spring 2024, with the aim of enabling them to use the knowledge they gain to coach younger pupils.

ClimateTraining was preceded by the real-world laboratory. For one year in 2019, the climate-friendly choices real-world laboratory saw 12 households and 13 companies in Münster work on new ways of integrating climate protection into their everyday lives and sustainably changing individual behaviour. What made this approach different was that it brought together providers of climate-friendly products and services, such as zero waste shops, cargo bike hire, car share providers and clothing upcyclers

with households as potential customers, and enabled them to develop existing or new offerings for private households in Münster. The project focused not on experienced climate protectors, but on curious households who wanted to contribute to protecting the climate. With active support from 13 Münster companies, participating households tested and tried out a wide range of climate-friendly offers roughly 130 times.

The real-world laboratory was such a great success that, from 2022 to 2025, the knowledge gained from it is being rolled out more widely through the "Climate-friendly choices" city network. The network will be funded by the BMWK via the National Climate Initiative (NKI). At the heart of the network concept are 9 cities and one district (Bielefeld, Bottrop, Drensteinfurt, Düsseldorf, Essen, Gelsenkirchen, Wuppertal and the district of Steinfurt), 9 real-world laboratories made up of households and companies, and a sharing of experiences to enable further more widespread application.

A further important measure for ensuring that low-income groups are also involved in the climate protection process is the energy-saving check and scrappage scheme for refrigerators operated by Caritas Münster:

Energy-saving check: Qualified energy-saving helpers carry out energy-saving checks in low-income households. They measure the energy consumption of refrigerators, washing machines, lamps, consumer electronics and other electrical appliances. Eligible households receive expert tips on simple means for reducing energy consumption, and free individual energy and water-saving items.
Replacing refrigerators: Old refrigerators are a burden on the environment and your wallet. Anyone on a low income, such as unemployment benefit II, social assistance or housing benefit, can get rid of these energy guzzlers. Energy Saving Check Plus, in addition to the standard energy saving check, offers financial support for the purchase of a new, energy-saving appliance through a scrappage scheme

Another example of City Administration Münster's comprehensive approach to climate protection work is the 5th Action Plan for the European Charter for Gender Equality, which focuses on "Climate and gender equality", was developed by an internal administrative working group, and finally discussed with representatives from civil society organisations. The 5th Action Plan will be submitted to the Council for consideration in spring 2024.

For the "Housing and energy" area of action, the offer has been further developed in two directions - from individual solutions, to a neighbourhood approach and on to creating structures instead of having the City Administration Münster provide everything.

A significant increase in the rate at which existing buildings are deep renovated is a key factor in achieving the goal of climate neutrality by 2030, as these buildings are responsible for a large proportion of climate-damaging emissions. There are a number of factors hindering an increase in deep renovation activity, chief among them being capacity shortages (planning permission, advice and

specialist planning, skilled trades, materials, infrastructure). To make the most efficient use of emissions-reducing improvements to existing buildings, it is recommended that, in addition to strategies for individual buildings, an integrated approach is used at neighbourhood level. A concerted approach enables the exploitation of synergy effects, enabling a significant acceleration in building energy-efficiency improvements. The neighbourhood level also makes it possible to take an integrated look at property-independent factors that make a neighbourhood a more attractive place to live and have an indirect influence on energy-efficiency improvements (living environment, local amenities, mobility options, etc.). Potential solutions can be tested as models within the framework of neighbourhood concepts and then implemented and developed further subsequently. A building deep renovation project then needs to be carried out by local stakeholders. A wide range of funding opportunities are currently available at federal and state level as well as from the City of Münster.

Age-appropriate flexibility in the use of infrastructure in the residential environment can also be considered for supporting sociodemographic change in city neighbourhoods and generating positive effects in terms of building energy-efficiency improvements. The neighbourhood level also offers key advantages for fostering public involvement. Where comparable measures, such as funding programmes, are aimed primarily at individual property owners, addressing entire neighbourhoods enables more people to be persuaded to undertake energy-efficiency improvements. A sense of belonging/neighbourhood identity also increases willingness to actively implement changes in your own living environment.

The neighbourhood approach offers the opportunity to identify efficiency potential and approaches, not just in individual properties, but also in an urban development and energy context. In addition to essential energy-efficiency improvements and a renewable energy and heat supply, an integrated approach also takes into account additional issues relating to energy-efficiency-related urban regeneration for functional, social, environmental and economic reasons. The "energy-efficiency-related urban regeneration" process is therefore one of the most strategically important points in terms of existing buildings. For this reason, the Administration intends to create a pathway to testing "energy-efficiency-related urban regeneration" in individual neighbourhoods and, if possible, to extend and establish it throughout the city in future. Individual projects, such as the EU project UP2030 "urban planning and design ready for 2030" or the Future BEEing project, an Interreg VI C project being carried out in conjunction with Enschede Council, energieland2050, Hengelo Council, Buro de Haan, Küsters.Grün.Stadt.Klima, Münster University of Applied Sciences and Saxion University, will also support this process and contribute building blocks for this overall approach.

The UP2030 project is developing conceptual principles that provide an overview of which planning guidelines/instruments, short, medium and long-term measures, data bases, funding opportunities, participation approaches, etc. should or can be taken into account in existing neighbourhoods. This will then enable concepts to be drawn up more quickly or an initial assessment to be made and measures implemented in comparable neighbourhoods. UP2030 will focus in particular on the synergies between climate adaptation and climate protection measures, and on participation approaches
STADT MÜNSTER

C

that go beyond advisory and information services. UP2030 will therefore also further develop the established city-wide approach of neighbourhood level climate training, and thus develop a potentially systematic approach that promotes the implementation and acceptance of measures by neighbourhood stakeholders.

The FutureBEEing sub-project being run by the City of Münster aim to create a specification sheet for the development of a digital tool that presents an integrated overview of all measures and different scenarios able to promote the future viability of a neighbourhood. Among other things, this is an important instrument for answering planning questions relating to deep renovation and restructuring of existing neighbourhoods in conjunction with their cost points. These planning questions relate to energy efficiency, weather resistance and standards for sustainable neighbourhood development. The tool will then be developed by the other partners and is aimed at individual owners, cooperatives, owners' associations and investors.

Creating structures instead of the City Administration providing everything - this is the goal pursued by the-sponsored solar neighbourhood festivals. Solar neighbourhood festivals are events organised by citizens themselves, at which hosts invite other interested citizens to their homes and show them their own solar energy systems. The motto of the solar neighbourhood festival is: "Come on over and take a look at my solar energy system!" Because people who are thinking of installing a solar energy system on their roof often have lots of questions, for example, is my roof suitable? What bureaucratic hurdles do I need to overcome? Is it a worthwhile investment? The City of Münster is working with the Solar Energy Promotion Association (SFV e.V.), responsible for the packdraf initiative, to organise solar neighbourhood festivals. These events involve solar energy system owners showing guests their systems and talking about their experience. By raising awareness, this should allow more and more solar energy systems to spread, driving forward the energy transition and doing away with more and more fossil fuels, with corresponding benefits for the climate.

# Münster is becoming a climate city

The climate protection process bound up with the Climate City Contract will be continuously built out in future years. In particular, formats and measures for promoting civil society involvement will be developed further. We will also run events such as Climate City Week. Our efforts to address and the involvement of stakeholders from Münster society will also be continuously expanded: www.klimas-tadt.ms

The Committed to local action building project (CoLAB), funded by NetZeroCities as part of its Pilot Cities funding programme, is an important component of this. This project involves the cities of Münster, Aachen and Mannheim testing innovative ways to reduce behaviour-related greenhouse gas emissions. The heart of the project is a platform for connecting all stakeholders in Münster society, from the City Administration and politicians to businesses and citizens, and inspires and mobilises them to take concrete, sustainable action, helping to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge

and practical changes in everyday life. Münster is developing a digital offering to support the development of a climate-friendly, sustainable lifestyle, which will highlight ways that citizens can take conscious actions that have a significant everyday impact, and help citizens visualise and experience the goal of climate neutrality as a task for the whole community. Münster City is building on its experience in the field of "climate-friendly living". Mannheim is planning a platform called "IDEAL for Mannheim" as a gateway for action to identify areas of impact for local action and stakeholders, analyse their effectiveness, make them visible and network them. Aachen is planning to set up a 2030 agency as a contact point for all stakeholders and as a management unit for the climate goal. It will facilitate access to offerings, enable networking and generate direct local impact.

# International city-climate partnerships

The City of Münster also operates the following climate partnerships:

The twin cities of Münster and Monastir are taking part in the "Municipal Climate Partnership" project organised by Servicestelle Kommunen in der Einen Welt in collaboration with the NRW 21 state working group (LAG 21). The aim is to develop a joint action plan with topics and projects important to both cities in terms of climate protection. The following topics have now been agreed: Waste management, climate-adapted rainwater management, sustainable urban development. The core Münster City team, responsible for actual implementation, consists of staff from various areas, specifically the International Office in the Department for Citizen and Council Services, the Department for Mobility and Civil Engineering, the Department for Green Spaces, Environment and Sustainability and Waste Management Services. The steering group responsible for promoting the project within the city and providing advice is also made up of members of the council, the University, the University of Applied Sciences, the advisory board for municipal development cooperation, Freundeskreis Münster-Monastir e.V. and Overberg College.

Since 2015, there has been a climate policy exchange between cities in NRW and Minnesota (USA). The "Climate Smart Municipalities" (CSM) project is organised by the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis and supported by the State of NRW and the State of Minnesota. Münster and Rochester have been nominated as climate partner municipalities within the project. Rochester is a city of around 135,000 people and home to the world-famous Mayo Clinic. Shared topics in the CSM project include "climate-neutral living &amp; building" and "modern infrastructure". The project aims to emphasise that climate protection and the energy transition are a task for society as a whole and can only be achieved through integrative approaches at municipal level.

First Mayor Markus Lewe has agreed a climate partnership in Italy between the cities of Münster and Bologna, which is also one of the 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030. Lewe and the Deputy Mayor of Bologna, Valentina Orioli, have agreed on regular mutual consultations and the establishment of a German-Italian committee that will collate best-case studies from both cities and examine them to identify areas of reciprocal transferability.

Since 2022, City of Münster has been developing an intensive climate partnership with its American partner city Fresno through the Urban Diplomacy Exchange project set up by SKEW. The Urban Diplomacy Exchange project offers existing German-US municipal partnerships and municipalities interested in working together the opportunity to engage in technical and political dialogue. The framework for the project is provided by the 2030 Agenda with its 17 goals for sustainable development and strengthening democracy. Through events, expert exchange trips, ongoing advice and support, "Urban Diplomacy Exchange" helps the cities to strengthen their relationships with municipalities in the USA, establish exchanges of specialist knowledge, network with each other and represent municipal interests at national and international level. Successful implementation of the project in both cities has over the last two years already led to various municipal exchanges on the topics of climate protection, sustainable urban development and climate-friendly mobility in both Münster and Fresno.

# 6 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for further refining the Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract.

## Table 38 Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration - textual elements

**Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration - textual elements**

From project to principle - this maxim underpins Münster's climate protection strategy and over the next few years City Group Münster will be extending it to the whole of Münster society. The Climate City Contract will enable Münster society to be engaged in the climate protection process with much greater commitment than previously. Münster's City Administration needs to be constantly working to create the conditions required for this to happen (see also Social innovations). To this end, the Climate City Contract will be continuously updated and resubmitted to the European Commission for review every two years.

Prioritising implementation of climate protection strategies and measures is carried out by Münster City Council and the City Administration Administrative Board. Climate protection-related information is currently being established for both bodies, such as a budget template and the climate protection overview board, intended to provide transparent support for the decision-making process (see module C-1).

The implementation status of climate protection strategies and measures is reviewed internally by the Administrative Board every three months through a reporting system. The city's annual energy and greenhouse gas inventory provides information on where Münster stands with regard to the 2030 climate neutrality target.

# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

Climate change has already reached us: the effects of global warming have been clearly noticeable in Münster for several years. Excessively hot, dry summers and heavy rainfall events are causing noticeable damage. Climate change is no longer an abstract threat; it is happening right here on our doorstep. Man-made global warming is threatening the quality of life, prosperity and future prospects of people in Münster and around the world. The latest scientific findings and climate forecasts make clear that society today is living at the expense of future generations. We are nearing the point of no return, with melting ice in the Arctic, thawing permafrost in the Arctic Circle and the destruction of rainforests all imminent tipping points for global warming and the climate. It is highly likely that the changing climate will further damage the city's economy and lead to social upheaval in Münster.

Towns and cities play a key role in achieving climate neutrality. They occupy only 4% of the EU's land area, but are home to 75% of EU citizens. In addition, towns and cities consume over 65% of the world's energy and are responsible for more than 70% of global CO₂ emissions.

Against this backdrop, our Climate-neutral Münster 2030 vision aims to significantly boost existing efforts to protect the climate, to increase the use of new technologies, but also to change the way Münster society as a whole thinks and acts. That means that work to reduce our climate impact should no longer be selective, but should instead be comprehensive and undertaken wherever there is opportunity to do so. Thanks to comprehensive climate protection work over the past 30 years and a good decentralised energy supply, in 2020 energy-related CO₂ emissions were, at 5.8 tonnes per inhabitant, below the national average. Münster is therefore on the right track. This is also evident from national and international rankings:

SECAP has been approved by the official body of the Covenant of Mayors on March 12, 2024
November 2023: A-Ranking CDP-ICLEI Track
"Climate-active Municipality 2022" award for the "Climate-neutral City Administration Münster 2030" concept study and associated action programme.
The municipality of Münster has several times been honoured with the European Energy Award Gold, the highest honour for municipal climate policy measures, for its wide-ranging climate policy measures. Following gold certifications in 2005 and 2009, in 2012, 2015, 2018 and 2022 the city achieved one of the highest scores of all gold-certified municipalities in Europe.
German Sustainability Award 2019

Münster is proud of these successes. They show that protecting the climate is in the city's DNA.

Despite these successes, we know that Münster still has a long way to go in reducing its CO₂ emissions. The scientific community continues to sound the alarm – the next few years will be decisive, speed is of the essence. We must do more to stop climate change, do more to adapt to the consequences of climate change, which now appear unavoidable, and step up the pace of climate

action! Unless we change direction on the climate, the future looks bleak. Society, through an unprecedented global movement, has shown that the fast majority is ready to implement the changes needed to achieve climate justice. The aforementioned global movement also brought a sense of urgency to Münster. Against this background, in 2019, Münster City Council set itself the ambitious goal of becoming climate neutral by 2030. As a result, the study "Münster climate neutrality by 2030" has been commissioned to work out what it needed to do to achieve this goal. The study focussed on two challenges:

The goal can only be achieved if the whole of city society works together.
The extent to which the city itself can contribute to meeting this target is limited to at most 50 per cent. The rest requires action at state, federal government and EU level.

That means that to realise its ambitious climate target Münster now needs also to bring others on board – others within Münster society, but also the state, federal government and EU. The state, federal government and EU have to provide a framework that promotes climate-friendly action and ensures that this action is in keeping with social justice. For their part, within this framework various members and stakeholders of Münster society need to act to make climate neutrality a reality.

With the message "Münster is becoming a climate-positive city", the City Administration is now launching a process that brings together a full range of members and stakeholders within city society. All participants will be able to

demonstrate what they are currently doing to achieve the goal of climate neutrality,
commit to implementing measures that make a difference,
initiate measures that require collaboration with other stakeholders,
receive support implementing measures and offer support to other stakeholders,
take responsibility for a better tomorrow.

The City Administration has enlisted support for this process, which will continue to develop over the coming years. Münster has used its role as a pioneer of municipal climate action to apply for the EU mission "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" and was chosen by the EU, together with eight other cities in Germany, from 377 applications to be one of 112 mission cities. Münster's application for the Cities Mission has been motivated by both, the Climate City Contract, which is an innovative instrument for accelerating the transformation of city society as a whole (for more on this, see below), and the coming together of 112 pioneering cities for the sake of the climate - particularly in terms of networking, shared learning and fair competition, with the focus on their shared goal of climate neutrality by 2030.

## The Münster Climate City Contract

The Climate City Contract is an innovative tool that forms a framework for the work and measures being undertaken in Münster to achieve the goal of climate neutrality. The commitment of individual companies, initiatives, private individuals and the City administration alone is not enough - it takes all

of us! All members and stakeholders in Münster society are called upon to pull whatever levers are available to them to maximum effect:

# City administration, its subsidiaries, and municipal companies (Münster City Group)

The strategic basis for all Münster City Administration's climate protection activities is the "100% Climate Protection Masterplan" and the "Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 Concept Study", which builds on the masterplan. The "100% Climate Protection Masterplan" was developed in 2017 with a high level of participation from Münster society. A total of around 1,200 participants took part in the consultation.

The strategic premises of Münster's climate action are prioritised as follows:

Saving as much energy as possible.
Utilising the energy we still require as efficiently as possible.
Generating the energy we still require from renewable resources.
Choosing resource and energy-saving behaviours with a consumer culture to match

This strategy shapes our activities in six fields of action:

Energy production
Building carbon-reduction measures
Mobility
Business and academia
Education and food
Climate budget

Based on these strategic guidelines, a wide range of climate protection measures are being implemented by various units within the Münster City Group on the basis of a number of Council resolutions. In order to focus on and accelerate the implementation of climate protection measures, Münster City administration is now treating climate protection as much more of a cross-cutting issue, meaning that all departments, offices, institutions and municipal subsidiaries and companies have to take what action they can. The Münster City Group's climate protection process is managed by the Administrative Board. In concrete terms, this means that for each field of action one person from the city group's senior management team is responsible and reports quarterly to the Administrative Board on the status of the various projects and plans.

The City of Münster Group, consisting of the core administration plus its own companies and municipal subsidiaries, is aware of its special responsibility. At the same time, we know that Münster cannot achieve its full $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ savings potential through the action of politicians and the City Group alone. With the message "Münster is becoming a climate-positive city", the City Group has therefore launched a process that calls on all members and stakeholders in Münster society to commit to the goal of achieving "climate neutrality for Münster" using the levers available to them.

# Impact partners

In addition to the municipal corporation, other stakeholders in Münster have significant leverage when it comes to reducing CO₂ emissions. The term "impact partners" refers to any organisation - commercial enterprises, associations, universities, etc. - able to make a significant contribution to climate neutrality in Münster. Some impact partners in Münster have already made concrete plans to achieve climate neutrality, others are implementing ambitious emissions reduction projects and measures. The Climate City Contract is intended to highlight this commitment and, by making it a matter of public record, strengthen signatories commitment to it.

Münster benefits from the Münster Alliance for Climate Protection network, founded in 2011, in which more than 100 companies support the city's climate protection goals and are involved in climate protection activities. In developing the Climate City Contract, the city administration created additional structures to boost stakeholder engagement. For example, it established a regular dialogue between the business community and the City Administration with the aim of working together on the implementation of our Climate-neutral Münster 2030 vision.

# Innovators

Not every measure is amenable to calculating how much CO₂ it will save or what future effects it might have. Nevertheless, such measures are also important, because making Münster a climate-friendly city takes ideas, creativity, research, progress and the courage to try something new. If, for example, researchers at the University of Münster come up with innovative recycling methods, this knowledge will benefit not just Münster but ultimately the whole world. In addition to our universities, Münster-based companies too are using innovative solutions to drive technological transformation. Close links between the universities and industry ensure that Münster is a highly innovative environment.

As a city of science, Münster can build on established networks such as the "Alliance for Science" or the "Smart City Münster Alliance".

# Committed citizens

Every one of Münster's 320,000 inhabitants is part of our city society and affects the pathway to becoming a climate-positive city. For many, this means reorienting their everyday decisions towards climate-friendly options. Some, however, have the opportunity to engage more profoundly, whether by supporting a repair café or by buying an electric car to share with neighbours.

Becoming a climate-positive city depends on the different forms of engagement exhibited by various members and stakeholders of Münster society. To strengthen this and to enable the whole of Münster society to benefit from it, Münster City Administration has long been encouraging Münster society to get involved by means of the following:

Formal and informal citizen participation initiatives (formal and informal ones) for the joint development of climate-related implementation projects, such as the development of a shared vision for the spatial development of Münster's urban landscape as part of the Münster

integrated area concept, the submission of proposals, ideas and prototypes in the context of the development of the Münster 2035+ mobility master plan, a workshop on the goal of a low-car, accessible city centre with multipliers or the joint development of desired urban development goals and fundamental qualities of the neighbourhood as part of Münster model neighbourhoods

Information and communication initiatives, such as a wide range of energy advisory services or thermographic flights to create thermal images. There are also initiatives that bring the city community together to inspire, provide information about the climate protection process, engage in dialogue and motivate people to get involved, such as the " Münster is becoming a climate-positive city" forum, Climate City Week and KlimaBarCamp.

In this way, small building blocks in the form of the measures taken and contributions made by each individual stakeholder and citizen help create a shared pathway to becoming a climate-positive city - because it needs all of us to take action. Further participatory initiatives will be organised in the coming years, with the aim of finding even more participants whose contributions will be recorded in the ever growing Climate City Contract.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

## Goal

### Definition of climate neutrality for Münster

In ratifying the Paris Climate Agreement, the Federal Republic of Germany has entered into a binding commitment under international law to meet the climate targets set out therein. These targets mandate limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The recommendation is that if possible this increase should not exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius.

On 11 December 2019, councillors at Münster City Council voted to aim for climate neutrality by 2030. Against the backdrop of the Paris Climate Agreement goals, the following definition of climate neutrality for the city of Münster is used:

By 2030, the city of Münster will no longer produce any energy-related greenhouse gas emissions.
The energy-related $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ budget for achieving the 1.5 degree target is met.
The city of Münster is prioritising the avoidance and reduction of greenhouse gases in the city.
Greenhouse gases are offset if this is necessary to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 and are informally taken into account in the accounting.
Offsetting will be carried out to the extent required first locally and then regionally.

The resolution relates to the urban area of Münster, an area of 303.3 square kilometres. As of 2022, Münster had 320,946 inhabitants. According to the city of Münster energy and greenhouse gas

balance for 2021 (published in 2023), $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions break down as follows: Private households 28 per cent, commerce and miscellaneous 30 per cent, industry 11 per cent, transport 31 per cent.

In the Münster climate neutrality 2030 target scenario, emissions will fall by over $95\%$ compared to 1990. In 1990, annual emissions amounted to 2,618,000 tonnes, so that a reduction of $95\%$ means a reduction in annual emissions of 2,487,000 tonnes in 2030 compared to 1990. Since this goal complies with the goal of reducing 82 percent of the 2021 baseline year GHG emissions calculated by the Economic Model, the Münster climate neutrality 2030 target meets the requirements of the "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" mission.

The current version of the City of Münster's energy and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ balance sheet (BISKO standard), which is regularly updated, serves as a frame of reference for ongoing monitoring.

# Plotting the pathway to Münster climate neutrality 2030

If we are to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, meeting percentage emissions reduction targets alone is not sufficient. To achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, we also need to limit total greenhouse gas emissions in absolute terms. The term carbon budget is used to illustrate how much $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can be emitted per capita while still limiting global warming to $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. The German Advisory Council on the Environment (SRU) recommends setting a German carbon budget compatible with the Paris Climate Agreement and tightening climate targets accordingly. The carbon budget is intended as a broad-based assessment tool to help achieve these targets.

There are no binding methodological guidelines for calculating carbon budgets at municipal level. If the population principle recommended by the SRU is applied to the distribution within Germany, this results in a share of around 51 tonnes per person to meet the 1.5 degree target¹. The population principle also specifies an equal per capita emissions right for every person on earth.

The "Münster Climate Neutrality 2030" concept study calculated a carbon budget for Münster for 2020/2021 using the then applicable baseline data. This was based on the assumption that the 1.5 degree target would be met. This means that at the time of the calculation, Münster, with a population of around 310,000 people, had a budget of around 15,800,000 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by 2050. The carbon budget considers $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ alone, as this is main, longest-lived greenhouse gas. Energy and non-energy $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions were analysed. As short-lived greenhouse gases, methane and nitrous oxide were not included in the budget.

In accordance with the territorial principle (BISKO standard), the city of Münster balances only energy-related greenhouse gases, including methane and nitrous oxide in the form of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalents. In applying the carbon budget to the budget limits for Münster, the following assumptions were therefore made: The National Inventory Report on the German Greenhouse Gas Inventory found that approximately $93\%$ of emissions ($\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, methane and nitrous oxide) are energy-related. Budget

analysis was based on just 14,700,000 tonnes of the 15,800,000 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ described above. Annual emissions of the city of Münster from the BISKO balance sheet were deducted from this budget in the sense of a residual budget balance. As soon as the total becomes negative, the City of Münster's budget is used up and the city is considered to have failed to meet the 1.5 degree target. Since the BISKO balance includes both $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalents, this represents a conservative approach.

The "Münster climate neutrality 2030" target scenario describes absolute changes in greenhouse gas emissions and changes over time needed to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 and compliance with the 1.5 degree target. The figure illustrates the need to accelerate reductions over time by also showing the change in GHG emissions since 1990.

![img-30.jpeg](img-30.jpeg)
GHG emissions Münster, trend and target, by sector

From 1990 to 2019, GHG emissions in Münster fell by around $28\%$. This corresponds to a reduction of around $1\%$ per year. Münster is a dynamic, growing city. The population has increased by $13\%$ over this period. This means that the city has achieved a slight decoupling of GHG emissions despite a rising population, and that, in absolute terms, GHG emissions have fallen. Nevertheless, the speed of reduction in emissions to date is not sufficient to meet the targets set out in the Paris Climate Agreement. The average annual reduction since 1990 is around 25,000 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ per year. From 2020 to 2030, annual emissions need to be reduced by around 182,000 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ per year. That would mean increasing the rate at which emissions are reduced roughly sevenfold.
STADT MÜNSTER

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

According to the 2030 scenario path explored in the concept study "Münster climate neutrality 2030", from 2020 to 2030, the carbon budget will fall by around 63%, from around 14,800,000 tonnes of CO₂ to around 5,600,000 tonnes of CO₂. Should this be the case does that mean that from 2030 the carbon budget can no longer be burdened. In addition to measures to reduce GHG emissions, to achieve the goal of net zero climate neutrality some offsetting will therefore also be required.

A comparison of emissions reductions to date with the required speed of reductions illustrates how comprehensive the changes we need to make are. The above figure is nonetheless also encouraging, as it shows that the rate of reduction of GHG emissions has accelerated since 2015.

# Münster Climate Neutrality 2030 - How the City of Münster Group is meeting the challenge

Against the backdrop of the resolution passed by Münster City Council in 2019 to strive for climate neutrality by 2030, the Climate Neutrality 2030 concept study was drawn up and adopted by the Council to outline a possible theoretical path towards climate neutrality by 2030, associated challenges and fields where action can be taken.

The study highlights challenges (e.g. a refurbishment rate of 8% by 2030) that from today's perspective appear unrealistic. At the same time, it is becoming apparent that some processes in our fields of action, such as the switch to electromobility by 2030 or construction of new buildings to the PlusEnergy standard, have become much more likely. Until a few years ago, for example, it would have been considered unrealistic that commercial companies would choose to stop producing internal combustion engines by 2030. In this respect, when assessing "realistic" development pathways, the possibility of changes in the framework within which we operate always needs to be taken into account.

In this respect, the study cannot answer the question of feasibility of implementation, provide a specific list of measures or ensure that the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 is achieved. The immense challenges in the current climate protection process must be overcome through collaboration between the City of Münster Group and Münster society, and changes in the broader framework within which the city operates.

The concept study clearly shows that the City of Münster Group's does not have sufficient room for manoeuvre to realise the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 by itself. Additional measures needed include a significant change to the broader framework within which we operate, over which the City of Münster Group has little influence. These include, for example

Sufficient financial resources (e.g. for refurbishing buildings, expansion of renewable energies, investment in electromobility) must be provided punctually through private investment and federal subsidies to eliminate economic efficiency gaps (e.g. in the area of green district heating).
STADT MÜNSTER

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

A legal framework consistent with an expansion in renewable energy generation needs to be created (federal government)
The human resources needed for energy-efficient refurbishment need to be available, particularly in the skilled building trades and building completion (commerce).
Essential technical solutions (particularly in the area of sector coupling) need to be available and mature (federal government, commerce).

The implementation-based transformation strategy for Münster set out in this Climate City Contract is a suitable format for meeting the challenges because

by including non-technical fields of action it takes into account the need for a cultural transformation of the whole of Münster society;
the project is clearly prioritised within the City of Münster Group in that the municipal climate protection process is managed by the Administrative Board;
by regularly reviewing the status of project implementation (quarterly by the Administrative Board) and reductions in emissions (annual energy and greenhouse gas balance), it is possible to react flexibly to changes in the complex and dynamic environment (technical innovations, political framework conditions, etc.).

With regard to extending this transformation strategy to the whole of Münster society, the City of Münster is able to draw on existing networks and structures, which will gain further in importance and be strengthened, not least through the use of the Climate City Contract presented here. Priorities in terms of content are explained in Part 3.

## Co-benefits of climate protection measures

Various climate protection measures in the action areas of energy production, building carbon reduction measures, mobility, business and academia, education and food, and climate budget generate the following co-benefits: prevention of environmental damage, regional value creation, job creation, independence from fossil fuels, increased local market stability and resilience, increased business tax revenues, favourable/stable energy costs, cleaner air, lower noise emissions, alternative uses for traffic areas, improved road safety/fewer serious accidents, increased value of properties along formerly busy roads, higher quality of life in public spaces, increased climate justice, more pleasant living conditions, more climate-resilient building stock.

## 3 Strategic priorities

### Strategic priorities

**From project to principle - moving from planning to action and to acceleration**

The explanation of the challenge in Part 2 makes clear that achieving our goal requires comprehensive changes and an acceleration in our implementation.
STADT MÜNSTER

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

A successful climate and energy transition requires us to draw up concepts and plans to enable us to start implementing, prioritising and developing change processes. To this end, the focus in Münster is on the implementation of strategic projects that are within the capabilities of the city group and with we are able to exert direct and indirect influence on the implementation of climate protection measures, especially in Münster society. Direct influence means that the City of Münster Group can realise climate protection measures itself. Indirect influence means that the City of Münster Group creates the framework, but that realisation of climate protection measures is largely dependent on engagement by Münster society. Strategic projects of the City of Münster Group bring about the realisation of climate-related projects and measures in the City of Münster Group and in the Münster community by

supporting and promoting,
making change possible,
setting clear rules.

Strategic projects therefore form the framework for implementation projects with which the municipal group or Münster society ultimately realises the climate protection process and ensures its success. Below we showcase examples of strategic projects for fields of action with outstanding significance for the climate protection process due to their $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ savings potential. The list is not exhaustive and does not represent all strategic projects.

## Energy production

In 2030, new renewable heating technologies will ensure increasing decarbonisation of district heating. Milestones and next steps:

Climate-neutral heat from deep underground: By 2030, Stadtwerke Münster will have completed all necessary and possible steps for the development of geothermal energy (3-seismic, model development, extraction and pumping tests, etc.).
Large heat pumps as all-round solutions for environmental heat: four large heat pumps will start operating in 2030.
Ground-mounted solar thermal energy as a transformation accelerator: In 2030, ground-mounted solar thermal energy will be established in Münster. Two systems will already have been implemented.

% renewable electricity for private households from in-house generation by 2030: By 2030, Stadtwerke Münster will generate sufficient electricity for all households in Münster (380 GWh) with its own wind and solar power plants, and will also specifically enable citizen participation to enable local people to have a share of the financial rewards of renewable projects.

To this end, the wind turbine portfolio will be doubled to 42 wind turbines by 2030, with the aim of generating 280 GWh of electricity per year. The 21 additional wind turbines have a nominal output of around 120 MW. Next steps:

Thermographic survey will provide information on energy efficiency measures for all homeowners: Thermal images of Münster's rooftops will be recorded and data evaluated to facilitate energy efficiency measures, plus ongoing free energy advice and support in interpreting and evaluating thermographic survey images.

# Mobility

Public transport will be electrified by 2030: Stadtwerke Münster's municipal bus fleet will be fully converted to electromobility by 2029. Required infrastructure will be installed at the bus depot and at selected bus stops and the electricity needed will be provided by further expansion of PV systems. Various funding programmes are being used to finance the project. Stadtwerke Münster is working towards electrification of contractor and regional transport company bus fleet to the extent that it is able.

Münsterland S-Bahn - major implementation steps by 2030: Local rail passenger transport will be massively expanded over the next few years, achieving a shift in commuter traffic from motorised private transport to eco-mobility. As well as increasing the number of trains running on existing routes, disused railway lines will be reactivated and new stations built. Next steps:

Stage 1 from 2026: includes reactivation of the Westfälische Landes-Eisenbahn (WLE) between Münster and Sendenhorst;
Stage 2 from 2032: includes main line MS and marketing as S-Bahn;
Stage 3 from 2040: Full development of the destination concept

Further expansion of the networking of different transport modes and boosting ecomobility by 2030: The expansion of Mobilstationen aims to improve the networking of different transport modes, particularly ecomobility transport. After defining quality standards and developing a design guideline, and once the location concept has been approved by councillors, the scheme will be implemented in stages starting in 2024.

Moving forward with good ideas - en route to becoming cycle city 2.0: In Münster, the clear goal is to continue ambitiously on the path we have taken, to make cycling even more attractive, to increase the share of cycling from the current 47 per cent to 55 per cent of the modal split, and to promote the city's cycle culture. Showcase projects, such as reshaping more streets to create high quality cycle-priority streets 2.0, the implementation of cycle network 2.0 measures, the Kanalpromenade, the creation of additional cycle parking facilities, bike boxes at railway stations and the expansion of cycle routes to boost environmentally friendly mobility within the city region, aim to help realise this goal.
STADT MÜNSTER

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Development of a Mobility Masterplan Munster 2035+: Working with an external agency, the city is developing an implementation scenario and corresponding recommendations for action. The masterplan provides the city of Munster with a strategic instrument for use for future urban and transport planning. It sets out guidelines for shaping transport (in the form of realised mobility) in Munster so that it remains future-proof to 2035 and beyond.

Many of the measures discussed here lie within the City of Münster's direct sphere of influence. Some, particularly in the fields of building carbon reduction measures and mobility, can be influenced only indirectly, i.e. here the city group is dependent on implementation by market participants, specifically homeowners and tradespeople for building carbon reduction measures and Münster society as a whole for mobility choices.

## Non-technical fields of action

Scaling climate training: ClimateTrainers help other people draw up an initial CO₂ balance sheet, provide advice and support on individual objectives and give tips and assistance to help them realise the goals they have set. The City of Münster offers all Münster residents one climate training session every six months.
Establishing education for sustainable development (ESD) in educational institutions by 2030 has been adopted as a goal by Münster City Council.
Action plan for a sustainable food system: In 2019, the Global Sustainable Development Advisory Board recommended this project for implementation as a key project for the Münster 2030 sustainability strategy.
Continue and expand the climate communication and public relations projects "Our Climate 2030" and "Münster is becoming a climate-positive city".
Masterplan for the skilled crafts sector: The skilled crafts sector will be of great importance in tackling the challenges of the future. This applies in particular to the climate and energy transition. The skilled crafts sector can only fulfil its key function if the framework within which it operates is designed to enable it to do so. The City of Münster, the Chamber of Crafts and the District Crafts Association are therefore working on a joint masterplan to provide specific support for skilled trades and to create the best possible conditions for a strong climate-related skilled trades sector.

The goals set out in the Climate City Contract can only be achieved through close cooperation with Münster society and with the state, federal government and EU. The Climate City Contract is intended to be an innovative instrument for bringing these groups together and deepening their cooperation in multiple areas. At the time of submission, Climate City Contract of the City of Muenster and the linked goal of climate neutrality for Münster are supported by around 60 commitments from individual citizens, civil society institutions, universities and businesses. This circle will be expanded over the course of the mission.

# 4 Process and principles

## Process and principles

### Münster's climate protection process and updates to the Climate City Agreement

From project to principle - this maxim underpins Münster's climate protection strategy and, over the next few years, will also be needed across the whole of Münster society. With the help of the Climate City Contract, city society will be engaged in the climate protection process with much greater commitment than previously. Münster City Group needs to be constantly working to create the conditions required for this to happen. To this end, the Climate City Contract will be continuously updated and resubmitted to the European Commission for review every two years.

Prioritising implementation of climate protection strategies and measures is carried out by Münster City Council and the Administrative Board of the City of Muenster. The city is currently developing a range of decision-making formats to enable the climate neutrality goal to be integrated into budget planning.

The implementation status of climate protection strategies and measures is reviewed internally by the Administrative Board every three months through a reporting system. The city's annual energy and greenhouse gas balance sheet provides information on Münster's current position with regard to the 2030 climate neutrality target.

All of these analyses show that, in addition to federal, state and local government organisations, market participants – local citizens and households, companies and institutions – also have an important role to play in achieving climate neutrality. The City of Münster has for a long time been making effort to engage the stakeholders in its climate protection work, which does not just revolve around technical climate protection measures. A cultural transformation of the whole of Münster society is also needed. The aim of the City of Münster is to create an environment that promotes climate-friendly choices in areas such as mobility, housing, energy, consumption and nutrition. This means considering both citizens and providers of climate-friendly services, offers and products. The Climate City Contract is the right instrument for continuing and intensifying this approach.

This approach is characterised by the principles of transparency and accountability, steering and monitoring, stakeholder involvement, citizen participation and climate justice.

# 5 Signatories

Münster's Climate City Contract embodies the collective commitment of a diverse urban society to the path to climate neutrality. It involves not just the administration and the business community, but the whole of Münster society, including associations, initiatives, universities, private individuals, hospitals, banks, and health and social organisations. It is testimony to the will and willingness of all those involved in tackling this important challenge together.

![img-31.jpeg](img-31.jpeg)

The Climate City Contract reflects a broad diversity of contributions, ranging from comprehensive transformation plans by large companies to individual citizens giving up their cars. Each contribution helps pave the way to climate neutrality. What really marks out the Münster Climate City Contract is its focus on implementation. Every contribution includes a concrete implementation project, and large parts of these contributions are already being realised.

![img-32.jpeg](img-32.jpeg)

Münster shows that it is possible to move towards a sustainable future through joint efforts and concrete measures. The Climate City Contract is a living document that demonstrates the determination and drive of an entire city. This applies today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and until our common goal is achieved.

In the research field, they aim to expand sustainability-related research by, for example, networking researchers and practitioners and providing targeted support for research institutes. FH Münster's increasing efforts to promote sustainable development within the University have given rise to an initiative to create a climate protection concept to provide a targeted strategy for achieving climate-friendly operations. FH Münster has set itself the ambitious but realistic goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 65% compared to 1990 levels within ten years. The reduction pathway chosen by FH Münster is based on the goal of a climate-neutral North Rhine-Westphalia state administration by 2030, and also aims to maximise savings potential by 2045. In concrete terms, this means that FH Münster will reduce its emissions to 7,687 tonnes or 0.47 tonnes of CO2 per university member by 2030. |  |  |  |   |

The app offers precisely control of access to groups and visibility of offers. This enables school classes, for example, to remain completely invisible when sharing, making sharing particularly secure. As does sharing with people from your personal milieu. Things are done properly and handovers are particularly easy because you are dealing with people you regularly meet. That makes the Kleine Tat sharing app fundamentally different from other apps and web services currently on the market. With no solution yet having led to a breakthrough in sharing, Kleine Tat wants its app to make sharing a natural part of our everyday lives.

MAKING A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD

![img-37.jpeg](img-37.jpeg)

Armacell – Making a Difference around the World

Einer der größten Klimaschützer unter den in Münster ansässigen Industrieunternehmen dürfte die Firma Armacell sein. Seit 1967 fertigt das Nachfolgeunternehmen der Dämmstoffsparte der Armstrong World Industries im Süden von Münster flexible Dämmschläuche und -platten, die Heizungs- und Wasserleitungen, Klimakanäle, technische Ausrüstung wie Kessel, Pumpen, Kompressoren, Kondensatoren, Lüftungsanlagen sowie Prozessleitungen in der Industrie weltweit vor Energieverlusten schützen. Die Dämmung dieser technischen Anlagen ist eine der einfachsten und effizientesten Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung der Energieeffizienz in Gebäuden und in der Industrie. Wie eine Ökobilanz des Unternehmens zeigt, sparen die flexiblen Dämmstoffe von Armacell 140-mal mehr Energie ein als für ihre Herstellung benötigt wird und verhindern jährlich den Ausstoß mehrerer Millionen Tonnen Kohlendioxid.

Das Unternehmen weist in seiner Pressearbeit und in Kampagnen regelmäßig auf das enorme Energie-Einsparpotenzial durch technische Dämmung hin. Zudem ist Armacell Gründungsmitglied verschiedener

Verbände, die es sich zum Ziel gesetzt haben, die Energieeffizienz technischer Anlagen durch Isolierung zu verbessern. Hier sei als Beispiel die European Industrial Insulation Foundation (EiiF) genannt, die als gemeinnützige Einrichtung seit 2009 die Dämmung von betriebstechnischen Anlagen in der Industrie zur Verbesserung der Nachhaltigkeit und zur Bekämpfung des Klimawandels fördert. Mit dem TIPCHECK-Programm (Technical Insulation Performance Check) hat die EiiF ein standardisiertes Energie-Audit-Tool entwickelt, das aufzeigt, wie durch die Optimierung von Isoliersystemen eine höhere Energieeffizienz erreicht werden kann. Mehrere Mitarbeiter von Armacell sind geprüfte TIPCHEK-Auditoren und führen selbstständig Energie-Audits durch.

Als erstes Unternehmen seiner Branche hat Armacell bereits 2015 Umweltdeklarationen (Environmental Product Declaration, EPD) veröffentlicht, die die Grundlage für die Planung nachhaltiger Gebäude gemäß Gebäude-Zertifizierungssystemen wie LEED, BREEAM oder DGNB bilden. 2023 hat das Unternehmen einen kostenfreien Rückholservice für seine Holzpaletten eingeführt. Durch diese Mehrfachnutzung werden Ressourcen geschont und das Abfallaufkommen sowie $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Emissionen reduziert. Während sich die am Armacell Standort in Polen gefertigten Polyethylen-Produkte sehr einfach recyclen lassen, ist das mit synthetischen Kautschuk-Materialien schwieriger. Der Produktionsausschuss aus der ArmaFlex-Produktion fließt jedoch in die Fertigung der ArmaSound Schallabsorptionsprodukte. Das Unternehmen bieten auch ein Rücknahme-System von Baustellenverschnitt an. Entscheidend ist hier jedoch, dass die Baustoffe trennbar sind. Die Wiederverwertung ist daher mitunter begrenzt, aber es gibt positive Beispiele.

Fortsetzung des Beitrags folgt hier:

Auch im betrieblichen Umweltschutz ist Armacell Vorreiter seiner Branche. Der Standort Münster ist seit dem Jahr 2000 nach DIN EN ISO 14001 (Umweltmanagementsystem) und seit 2014 gemäß DIN EN ISO 50001 (Energiemanagement) zertifiziert. Der Energieverbrauch ist seit 2015 um 27 % pro m³ Endprodukt gesunken.

Da sich eine energetische Sanierung des alten Verwaltungsgebäudes nicht rentiert hätte, sind die Verwaltungsmitarbeiter im Sommer des letzten Jahres in einen energieeffizienten Büro-Neubau an der Robert-Bosch-Straße umgezogen. Ehrgeizige Pläne hat das Unternehmen auch für die Energieversorgung des neuen Armacell-Werks. Das Unternehmen hatte 2022 das direkt an das Armacell-Gelände angrenzende, außer Betrieb genommene Werk von der Knauf Ceiling Solutions GmbH &amp; Co. KG übernommen. Durch den Ausbau wird die Position des Standorts Münster als zentrales Kompetenzzentrum für flexible Elastomerschäume sowie als Hauptproduktionsstandort für Europa, den Nahen Osten und Afrika (EMEA) weiter gestärkt. Zudem konnte der CO₂-Fußabdruck durch eine deutliche Reduzierung des Transportaufwands verringert werden.

BASF Coatings stellt hochwertige Lacke, Farben und Beschichtungsstoffe her, die Oberflächen vor Umwelteinflüssen schützen und verschönern. Damit leisten wir permanent einen wichtigen Beitrag zur nachhaltigen Schonung von Ressourcen.

Nachhaltigkeit ist fest in unserer Geschäftsstrategie verankert und steht im Mittelpunkt unseres Handelns, mit dem Motto: „Chemie- die verbindet für eine nachhaltige Zukunft“. Diese Vision ist bereits in allen unseren geschäftlichen Prozessen integriert.

Bei BASF Coatings analysieren wir unseren ökologischen Fußabdruck entlang der gesamten Wertschöpfungskette.

Um unseren $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Fußabdruck deutlich zu senken, haben wir entlang der gesamten Wertschöpfungskette Maßnahmen ergriffen:

Wir arbeiten zusammen mit unseren Lieferanten daran, die Kohlenstoffemissionen hinsichtlich der von uns verwendeten Rohstoffe zu reduzieren. So haben wir beispielsweise den Einsatz von erneuerbaren Rohstoffen zur Reduzierung von $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Emissionen erhöht.

Wir verfolgen an all unseren Standorten Maßnahmen zum Energiemanagement. Wir reduzieren die eingesetzte Energie und die Emissionen, die durch unsere Produktionstätigkeiten entstehen. Ein Beispiel hierfür: Egal ob Verpackungen mit Lackrückständen, Filtermaterial oder flüssiger Abfall – wir verwerten den Abfall, der durch unsere Lackproduktion entsteht, an unserem Standort in Münster.

Mit unseren Produkten und Prozessen bieten wir Lösungen an, die unseren Kunden bei der Reduzierung ihres $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Fußabdrucks helfen. So werden zum Beispiel durch den integrierten Prozess für Fahrzeuglacke bis zu 20 Prozent $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Emissionen eingespart.

Unser Ziel ist es, bis zum Jahr 2030 eine spezifische $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Reduktion von $40\%$ zu erreichen. Für die Produktionsstandorte haben wir bereits ein Carbon Management Programm etabliert und treiben Aktivitäten zur deutlichen Reduzierung der

Entlang der gesamten Wertschöpfungskette retten wir, die fairTEiLBAR (vorrangig im Raum Münster &amp; Münsterland), noch genießbare Lebensmittel, indem wir diese vor ihrer Entsorgung bewahren. Auf Basis dieser Arbeit fußt unser 3-Säulen-Konzept mit Laden, Manufaktur &amp; Bildung. So ermöglichen wir unseren Kund*innen durch ihren Einkauf einen sehr konkreten Beitrag zum Münsteraner Klimaschutz zu leisten. Mit Auszeichnungen der Stadt Münster durch den Umweltpreis und „Münster: Vielfalt Machen“ durch „GUTES MORGEN MÜNSTER“, wurde uns bereits mehrfach die Wichtigkeit unseres Projekts/Konzeptes bestätigt.

Durch die aktive Rettung von Lebensmitteln schafft die fairTEiLBAR nicht nur Strukturen der Nahrungsversorgung für Menschen, sondern trägt mit der aktiven Eindämmung der regionalen Lebensmittelverschwendung insbesondere dazu bei, dass dadurch ausgestoßene Klimagase verringert werden. Mit Hilfe unserer Arbeit bringen wir Münster näher an das große Ziel, bis 2030 klimaneutral zu werden und sehen uns somit als Teil des konkreten und verbindlichen Maßnahmenplans zur Reduktion der CO₂-Emissionen in der Stadt. Denn allein 10% der ausgestoßenen Treibhausgase werden durch die Verschwendung von Lebensmitteln erzeugt. Durch unsere Arbeit wirken wir diesem Ausstoß konkret entgegen.

Als einer der Hauptakteure im Bereich Ernährungswende im Münsterland erleben wir ein wachsendes Bewusstsein bzw. Motivation der Münsteraner Gesellschaft, sich aktiv für den Klimaschutz einzusetzen. Diesem Hunger nach Wissen und dessen praktischer Umsetzung möchten wir mit unserem Bildungsprogramm, unseren Vorträgen und Workshops nicht nur nachkommen, sondern diesen auch ganz bewusst generieren.

Zudem tragen wir durch die Sensibilisierung für saisonalen/regionalen Verzehr von Lebensmitteln ebenfalls dazu bei, dass Münsteraner Bürger*innen sich für kürzere Transportwege entscheiden und sich durch Bildung über klimafreundliche und eine pflanzenbetonte Ernährung klimagesünder ernähren. Des Weiteren sorgen wir durch die Bildung unserer jüngsten Bürger*innen (in Kitas und Schulen) dafür, dass auch in Zukunft das Bewusstsein und die Wertschätzung von Lebensmitteln und den damit verbundenen Ressourcen weiter wächst. Als einer der Hauptakteure der Nachhaltigkeits-Szene sehen wir unsere Arbeit als wichtigen Bestandteil der Münsteraner Transformation zur klimaneutralen Stadt in 2030 an und möchten diese Entwicklung weiter vorantreiben. Ganz im Sinne der Worte unseres Oberbürgermeisters Markus Lewe bei der Eröffnung des Umwelthauses. Allein bis heute haben wir seit unserer Eröffnung bereits ca. 600–700 Tonnen unterschiedlichste Lebensmittel vor ihrer Entsorgung gerettet.

Aber über die Grundidee und Basis unseres Konzeptes hinaus sind zudem nachfolgende Maßnahmen gelebter Teil unserer klimaneutralen Unternehmens-Philosophie:

Die Organisation unserer Workshops erfolgt mit dem Lastenrad
Auch unsere wöchentliche Manufaktur (zur Haltbarmachung großer Mengen geretteter Lebensmittel) erfolgt ökologisch mit dem Lastenrad

# Klimaschutz in der Lehre und umfassende Klimaschutzmaßnahmen

Institution
Fachhochschule Münster

Website
www.fh-muenster.de

Ansprechperson
Marion Behrends

Transformationsziel
Das Ziel unseres Transformationsfahrplans ist es, bis 2030 klimaneutral zu sein.

Die FH Münster hat sich entschlossen, eine Vorreiterrolle im Bereich des Klimaschutzes einzunehmen und setzt umfassende Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung ihrer Treibhausgasbilanz um. Die FH Münster verfolgt verstärkt das Ziel der nachhaltigen Entwicklung. Basierend auf dem Hochschulentwicklungsplan für den Zeitraum von 2021 bis 2025 strebt die FH danach, die Nachhaltigkeitsprinzipien verstärkt in den Perspektiven Bildung, Forschung und Ressourcen der Hochschule zu integrieren.

Um die Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie der FH Münster konkret zu entwickeln und umzusetzen, wurde als Managementinstrument die Academic Scorecard (ASC) Nachhaltigkeit eingeführt. In der Lehre beispielsweise bietet die FH den Studierenden die Gelegenheit, Nachhaltigkeit in zwei verschiedenen Masterprogrammen (Nachhaltige Dienstleistungen und Nachhaltige Transformationsgestaltung) intensiv zu verankern.

Die FH Münster möchte darüber hinaus in allen Fachbereichen Nachhaltigkeit und Klimaschutz verankern und somit gezielt Einfluss auf gesellschaftliche Entwicklungen und zukünftige Entscheidungsträger*innen nehmen. Im Bereich der Forschung wird ein Ausbau der nachhaltigkeitsorientierten Forschung angestrebt, unter anderem durch Vernetzung von Forschenden und Praxis und der gezielten Förderung unserer Forschungsinstitute.

Mit den verstärkten Bemühungen der Hochschule, die nachhaltige Entwicklung an der Institution voran zu treiben, ist die Initiative zur Erstellung eines Klimaschutzkonzeptes als zielgerichtete Strategie für den klimafreundlichen Betrieb entstanden. Die FH Münster

FH MÜNSTER

setzt sich zum ambitionierten, aber realistischen Ziel, in spätestens zehn Jahren 65 Prozent der CO₂-Emissionen gegenüber dem Vergleichsjahr 1990 einzusparen. Der von der FH Münster angestrebte Reduktionspfad orientiert sich an der Zielsetzung der Klimaneutralen Landesverwaltung (KNLV) 2030 und strebt darüber hinaus das maximale Einsparpotenzial bis 2045 an. Konkret bedeutet das, dass die FH Münster ihre Emissionen bis zum Jahr 2030 auf 7.687 t oder 0,47 t CO₂ pro Hochschulangehörigen reduzieren wird.

Rechtliche Vorgaben verhindern für Hochschulen derzeit noch (Stand Januar 2024) das Erreichen der bilanziellen Klimaneutralität, da der Sockelbetrag an nicht vermeidbaren Emissionen nicht kompensiert werden kann. Maßnahmen des Klimaschutzkonzeptes sind beispielsweise der verstärkte Ausbau der PV-Anlagen, die vollständige Umrüstung zur LED-Technik, die Verankerung von Klimaschutzaspekten in der Beschaffung, die Erstellung eines nachhaltigen Begrünungskonzeptes zur Anpassung an den Klimawandel sowie die stetige Förderung des Umweltverbundes, um Emissionen aus Pendelwegen zu reduzieren.

Zudem wird aktuell ein Energiemanagement aufgebaut, das zum besseren Verständnis des Energieverbrauchs und zur Identifikation von Energieeinsparpotenzialen dient. Eine regelmäßige Fortschreibung der Bilanz sowie halbjährliche Klimabeiratssitzungen sichern die Umsetzung der definierten Maßnahmen.

Die Kommunikationsstrategie des Klimaschutzkonzeptes enthält eine Reihe von Informations- und Sensibilisierungskampagnen sowie Beteiligungsformaten, wie zum Beispiel ein hochschulinterner Nachhaltigkeitstag mit themenspezifischen Workshops

und Vorträgen oder der Ausbildung von Multiplikator*innen. Letztendlich müssen für die erfolgreiche Umsetzung des Konzeptes alle Hochschulangehörigen kontinuierlich informiert, sensibilisiert und motiviert werden, da der Klimaschutz an der FH Münster nur als Gemeinschaftsleistung realisiert werden kann. Die Klimaschutzbemühungen der FH Münster sind Teil eines ganzheitlichen Ansatzes, der nicht nur darauf abzielt, den eigenen CO₂-Ausstoß zu minimieren, sondern auch Bewusstsein für Nachhaltigkeit zu schaffen und umweltbewusste Praktiken in den Hochschulalltag zu integrieren. Durch diese Maßnahmen leistet die Hochschule einen wichtigen Beitrag zum globalen Klimaschutz und setzt gleichzeitig ein inspirierendes Beispiel für andere Bildungseinrichtungen und Institutionen.

HWK®
HANDWERKSKAMMER MÜNSTER

Die Handwerkskammer (HWK) Münster bietet ein breites Spektrum an Unterstützungsleistungen für Betriebe rund um das Thema Nachhaltigkeit und Klimaneutralität an. Schwerpunkte der Angebotspalette sind klimarelevante Bildungsmaßnahmen im Handwerkskammer Bildungszentrum (HBZ) sowie einzelbetriebliche Energieberatungen. Die für eine hohe Qualität handwerklicher Ausführungen notwendigen Praxisschulungen des HBZ werden durch eine Vielzahl theoretischer Bildungsangebote und Webinare ergänzt. Die direkten Unterstützungsleistungen werden flankiert von Informationsveranstaltungen sowie Online- und Printmedien. Zur Veranschaulichung aktueller Techniken wurden in den vergangenen Jahren mehrere Demonstrationszentren errichtet. Diese sind beispielsweise in den Bereichen Bau &amp; Energie, Fachwerk, Sanieren mit nachwachsenden Rohstoffen dargestellt. In unterschiedlichen Projekten werden Lösungsansätze entwickelt, um dem Klimawandel zu begegnen.

Darüber hinaus war die HWK Münster maßgeblich an der Entwicklung des bundesweit eingesetzten Energiebuches „E-Tool“ der Mittelstandinitiative beteiligt, für dessen Nutzung weiterhin aktiv bei den Mitgliedsbetrieben geworben wird. Weitere konkrete Unterstützung finden die Unternehmen in den Themenfeldern Energieeffizienz, erneuerbare Energien, klimafreundliche Gebäude, zirkuläre Wertschöpfung, innovative Mobilität sowie Nachhaltigkeit.

Als Interessensvertretung des Handwerks ist die HWK Münster an vielfältigen, insbesondere kommunalen Netzwerken beteiligt. Hier sind exemplarisch folgende Beteiligungen gemeinsam mit der Stadt Münster zu

nennen: Mitglied Münsters Allianz für Klimaschutz, Beirat Globale Nachhaltige Kommune, Netzwerk Altbau-Partner Handwerk, Mitwirkung ÖKOPROFIT.

Neben den vielfältigen Angeboten für Mitgliedsbetriebe setzt die HWK Münster als Organisation selbst vielfältige Maßnahmen im eigenen Bereich um, die kurzfristig auf das Ziel der Klimaneutralität der Stadt Münster einzahlen und berichtet über deren Auswirkungen, zum Beispiel auf den $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Fußabdruck. Gemeinsam mit zehn weiteren Handwerkskammern hat die HWK Münster seit dem Jahr 2021 das „Energieeffizienz- und Klimaschutz-Netzwerk der Handwerkskammern“ gegründet. Zielsetzung der Netzwerkarbeit ist es, eine klimaschonendere Betriebsweise der jeweiligen Standorte und Gebäude zu realisieren. Dazu gehören beispielsweise die energieeffiziente Beheizung der Bildungszentren, die Optimierung von Beleuchtung und IT, aber auch eine smarte Gebäudetechnik. Für die Darstellung der Ergebnisse sowie der Analyse der Energieverbräuche wird das entwickelte E-Tool eingesetzt.

Exemplarisch für die konkreten Energieeinsparmaßnahmen der HWK Münster seien die sukzessive Umstellung des Fuhrparks auf Elektromobilität im Gleichklang mit der Installation von E-Ladesäulen, die großflächige Optimierung der Beleuchtungssituation durch Reduzierung von Leuchtmitteln sowie Umstellung auf LED-Leuchtmittel, der Austausch energieaufwändiger Anlagen, wie Druckluftanlagen sowie die Optimierung der Belüftungssteuerung beziehungsweise auf wasserbedrohtende Außerbetriebnahme nicht mehr notwendiger Lüftungsanlagen zu benennen.

# Fortsetzung des Beitrags folgt hier:

Neben den direkten Maßnahmen wurden zudem die Mitarbeitenden zu Energiesparmaßnahmen sensibilisiert, die HomeOffice-Möglichkeit ausgeweitet und die Nutzung von Job Rad beziehungsweise Job Ticket durch einen freiwilligen Arbeitgeberzuschuss attraktiver gestaltet.

In den Planungen befinden sich aktuell die Ausweitung der Photovoltaikanlagen sowie der verstärkte Einsatz erneuerbarer Energien. Ein großer zukünftiger Meilenstein zur Reduzierung klimaschädlicher Emissionen am Standort Münster wird der geplante Teilneubau inklusive Modernisierung weiterer Bestandsgebäude unseres Bildungszentrums sein. Mit diesem für die HWK Münster historischen Bauprojekt soll nicht nur direkt ein großer Beitrag zur Klimaneutralität geleistet, sondern in der Weiterführung der Tradition der Demonstrationszentren ebenfalls ein Anschauungsobjekt für klimafreundliches Bauen geschaffen werden.

# Klimaneutrale Energieversorgung und Mobilität bis 2030

Unternehmen
Hengst Filtration

Ansprechperson
Thomas Hülsdau

Transformationsziel
Das Ziel unseres Transformationsfahrplans ist es, bis 2030 klimaneutral zu sein.

Wir bekennen uns dazu, die Emissionen aus der Verbrennung fossiler Energieträger durch eigene Anlagen und Fahrzeuge bis zum Jahr 2030 auf Null zu reduzieren und 100 % des elektrischen Stroms aus erneuerbaren Quellen zu beziehen. Die Verbrennung fossiler Energieträger erfolgt bei Hengst Filtration im Wesentlichen in Form von Erdgas zur Beheizung von Produktions- und Lagerhallen und Büros sowie in diversen Produktionsprozessen. Diese Verbrennungsprozesse werden wir bis zum Jahr 2030 nach und nach substituieren oder derart umgestalten, dass keine fossilen Energieträger mehr verbrannt werden. Dazu starten wir in 2023 mit der Erarbeitung eines Transformationskonzeptes für die Standorte Münster und Nordwalde, in denen der größte Erdgasverbrauch der Hengst Gruppe zu verzeichnen ist.

Wir sind ein Green Sign Hotel und befassen uns schon seit Jahren mit dem Thema Nachhaltigkeit. In der Vergangenheit haben wir unseren Stromverbrauch durch Projekte wie die Umstellung auf LED, Entfernung der Minibars in den Hotelzimmern und den Bau eines begehbaren Frosters seit 2019 um 27 % deutlich senken können.

In einem historischen Gebäude in dieser Größenordnung sind Strom und die Art wie wir heizen zwei Kernfaktoren, die für eine Klimaneutralität von äußerster Bedeutung sind. Für die Umstellung der Stromerzeugung ist die Realisierung einer PV-Freiflächenanlage auf einem Grundstück geplant, welches an das Trafohaus sowie die Hauptstromleitung des Hotels angrenzt. Diese Anlage muss noch genehmigt werden. Auf dieser Fläche könnten wir zum Beispiel gleichzeitig Nutztiere wie Hühner oder Schafe halten.

Leider ist eine PV-Anlage auf den Dächern limitiert, da auf dem historischen Hauptgebäude keine PV-Anlage genehmigt würde und die anderen Flächen die eventuell in Frage kämen, nicht die entsprechende Leistung bringen würden. Mit Bezug auf das Heizungsthema ist es schwieriger. Momentan heizen wir mit Öl und suchen nach einer klimafreundlichen Alternative. Diesbezüglich würden wir uns gerne mit dem Thema Geothermie befassen und werden uns zur Umsetzbarkeit extern beraten lassen.

Katholische Hochschule Nordrhein-Westfalen
Catholic University of Applied Sciences

Die Abteilung Münster der Katholischen Hochschule Nordrhein-Westfalen (katho) erkennt die Bedeutung nachhaltigen Handelns als integralen Bestandteil ihrer Verantwortung gegenüber Gesellschaft und Umwelt. Sie verpflichtet sich dazu, konkrete Maßnahmen zu entwickeln, die den Weg Münsters zur Klimaneutralität unterstützen.

Die im Januar 2024 verabschiedete Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie der Hochschule bietet dabei den Rahmen für konkrete Maßnahmen und Projekte (wie das SUNRISE LAB). Sie wurde unter Beteiligung von Beschäftigten und Studierenden entwickelt und verfolgt das Ziel, eine nachhaltige Entwicklung in den Bereichen Lehre, Forschung und Betrieb zu fördern. Diese Strategie basiert auf den Prinzipien einer christlichen Sozial- und Umweltethik und richtet sich an globalen Herausforderungen wie dem Klimawandel, der Ressourcenknappheit und sozialer Ungerechtigkeit aus. Die Hochschule beabsichtigt, durch konkrete Maßnahmen und Initiativen einen Beitrag zur Bewältigung dieser Herausforderungen zu leisten. In der Lehre strebt die katho danach, eine ökologisch-planetarische Perspektive zu fördern und das vorherrschende, anthropozentrische Weltbild kritisch zu hinterfragen.

Konkret erforderlich sind dafür die Integration von Nachhaltigkeitsthemen in die Curricula, die Förderung von interdisziplinären Lehransätzen sowie die Schaffung von Lernumgebungen, die nachhaltiges Denken und Handeln unterstützen. Ziel ist es, Studierende zu befähigen, in ihrer späteren beruflichen Tätigkeit eine ökologische Transformation sozialer und anderer Organisationen voranzutreiben und in dem Bewusstsein von Risiken für Umwelt und Klima verantwortungsvoll zu handeln. Studierende sollen

in die Lage versetzt werden, ihr Wissen an andere weiterzugeben, um so zur gesamtgesellschaftlichen sozial-ökologischen Transformation beizutragen. Das bestehende Lehrangebot zu diesen Themen soll ausgebaut werden und Lerninhalte verschiedener Veranstaltungen und Module sollen aufeinander abgestimmt werden.

Darüber hinaus verpflichtet sich die katho, nachhaltige Betriebsabläufe zu etablieren, beispielsweise durch die Implementierung einer nachhaltigen Gebäudebewirtschaftung, die Förderung von umweltfreundlichen Mobilitätskonzepten und die Reduzierung des Ressourcenverbrauchs. Außerdem überprüft und optimiert die Hochschule regelmäßig ihre Verwaltungsabläufe, um einen ressourcenschonenden Campusbetrieb zu gewährleisten. Dazu gehören die Förderung von Elektromobilität, die energetische Sanierung von Gebäuden sowie die Implementierung klimafreundlicher Dienstleistungen.

Die Zusammenarbeit in Netzwerken spielt eine wichtige Rolle bei der Umsetzung dieser Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie, um Synergien zu nutzen, Best Practices auszutauschen und gemeinsame Ziele zu verfolgen. Im Bereich Forschung und Transfer werden ressourcenschonende Prozesse und innovative Lösungsansätze gefördert. Dies umfasst die Unterstützung von Forschungsprojekten, die sich mit Nachhaltigkeitsthemen befassen, sowie die Förderung von Kooperationen mit externen Partnern, um Forschungsergebnisse in die Praxis zu transferieren. Damit trägt sie zur Erreichung der Klimaneutralität sowie zur Generierung und Verbreitung von Wissen im Bereich Klimaschutz bei.

Wir sind ein kleines Unternehmen aus Münster und beschäftigen uns mit Lösungen für einen klima- und umweltfreundlichen Lebensstil. Mit einem Team aus überwiegend Freiwilligen haben wir jüngst die Sharing-App „Kleine Tat“ herausgebracht.

Die App organisiert Sharing für bestehende Gruppen wie Familien, Freundeskreise, Arbeitskolleg*innen, Nachbar*innen aber auch für große Communities wie Vereine, Gemeinden und ganze Stadtteile. Jetzt können Dinge, wie die Heckenschere, Kartoffelpresse oder Bierzeltgarnitur einfach unter Bekannten geteilt werden. Der Clou dabei: Der Zugang zu den Gruppen und die Sichtbarkeit von Angeboten kann punktgenau gesteuert werden. Eine Schulklasse kann so beim Teilen völlig unsichtbar bleiben. Das macht Sharing besonders sicher. Auch, weil man mit Menschen aus

dem persönlichen Umfeld teilt, denn hier werden Dinge ordentlich behandelt und Übergaben sind besonders einfach, weil man sich ja regelmäßig begegnet.

Damit funktioniert die Kleine Tat Sharing-App fundamental anders, als die bisher am Markt verfügbaren Apps und Web-Services. Wir machen dies, weil keine Lösung bisher zum Durchbruch von Sharing geführt hat. Den brauchen wir aber, denn nur wenn Sharing ein so selbstverständlicher Teil unseres Alltags wird, wie Lebensmittel einkaufen, kommen wir zu messbaren Effekten für das Klima. Und das wird passieren, wenn viele Menschen Dinge gemeinsam nutzen. Denn dann wird weniger produziert, was weniger Ressourcen benötigt, den globalen Transport senkt und den bei uns anfallenden Müll reduziert.

Darum ist die Kleine Tat App für private Nutzer*innen kostenlos, werbe- und gebührenfrei. Nutzende können uns freiwillig unterstützen, indem sie „Kleine Tat Tags“ bestellen. Das sind Kennzeichnungs-Etiketten und -Einnäher in verschiedenen Größen mit individuellen QR-Codes. Sie werden auf geteilten Gegenständen und Textilien sichtbar angebracht, erhöhen den Komfort der App und inspirieren andere zum Mitmachen. Sponsor-Tags enthalten zusätzlich das Logo von Unternehmen.

Hans Haake

![img-62.jpeg](img-62.jpeg)

Der Klimabeirat Münster begleitet seit 2011 die Stadt Münster auf dem Weg zur Klimaneutralität. In einer Vielzahl von Formaten hat der Klimabeirat Themen gesetzt, Debatten angestoßen, komplexe Sachverhalte aufbereitet und sowohl Politik als auch Verwaltung zu vielen Aspekten des Klimaschutzes beraten. In diesem Sinn arbeiten Expert*innen aus Wissenschaft, Handwerk, Unternehmen, Verbänden, Verbraucherschutz und Landwirtschaft eng interdisziplinär zusammen. Der Beirat steht also schon seit vielen Jahren für einen breit getragenen Konsens der Münsteraner Stadtgesellschaft, dass Klimaschutz ein zentrales Thema sein muss, getragen von einer Vielzahl von Akteur*innen, die eng mit Politik und Verwaltung zusammenarbeiten. Entsprechend ist die Verpflichtung zu einer Fortführung und Intensivierung der Aktivitäten im Rahmen des Klimastadt-Vertrags nur folgerichtig.

Die Wirkung der Arbeit des Klimabeirats lässt sich nicht in Zahlen festhalten, da er nicht direkt Emissionen reduzieren kann. Der Klimabeirat trägt über seine Impulse, Stellungnahmen und den Austausch mit vielen anderen Akteur*innen zum effektiveren Klimaschutz bei und erhöht auch die Motivation für ambitionierten Klimaschutz.

Anhand von einigen Beispielen der letzten Jahre lassen sich Wirkmechanismen nachzeichnen: Wenn der Klimabeirat über Publikationen das Bewusstsein dafür schärft, dass Suffizienz ein wichtiges Element bei der Vermeidung von Emissionen sein kann und entsprechend Vorschläge für effektive Suffizienzpolitik macht, werden sowohl Bürger*innen sensibilisiert als auch politische Entscheidungsträger*innen auf mögliche Instrumente hingewiesen. Die Darstellung des Klimabeirates, wie weit nach den aktuellen Emissionszahlen der Weg noch ist, steigert die Handlungsbereitschaft mancher Akteure. Der Beirat beschreibt, was ein wirklich modellhaftes Quartier im Sinne von Klimapositivität leisten muss, und konfrontiert alle Beteiligten an den Münsteraner Modellquartieren mit den notwendigen höheren Anforderungen, die dann teilweise umgesetzt werden.

Weiterhin sieht sich der Klimabeirat in der Verantwortung, Politik, Verwaltung und Stadtgesellschaft allgemein kritisch zu beraten und zu unterstützen. Dabei kann er besonders den Blick auf das „große Ganze“ in seiner Komplexität lenken. In diesem Sinne wird er auch den Klimastadt-Vertrag in seiner Gesamtheit weiterhin kritisch begleiten, Vorschläge für Anpassungen entwickeln und immer wieder überprüfen, inwiefern Münster auf einem guten Weg in Richtung Klimaneutralität ist.

# Lackmann

Im Austausch mit dem Handwerk stellen wir fest, dass wir mehr praxisnahe Schulungen benötigen für den Einsatz von neuen Technologien wie Home Energy Management Systeme und Wärmepumpen. Zusätzlich müssen diese Systeme ab 2025 schaltbar in das digitale Kommunikationsnetz des Netzbetreibers eingebunden werden können.

Das Konzept einer Demo-Anlage, zum Beispiel in Liegenschaften wie „Grüner Weiler“ hat sich da als Konzept bewährt. Zielgruppe wären Handwerker*innen, die die Installation der neuen Technologien im Alltag vor Ort umsetzen werden. Die Umsetzung einer Demo-Anlage kann nur im Verbund erfolgen. Lackmann als Volldienstleister für den Digitalen Messstellenbetrieb kann für derartige Projekte nur als ein Beitragender agieren. Wir sind bereit, dieses Vorhaben anzuschieben und aktiv zu begleiten.

Als Schulungs- und Demonstrationsgebäude wird eine Liegenschaft mit modernster Technologie ausgestattet – insbesondere:

PV
WallBox
Wärmepume
Erdwärme
Home Energy Management System
intelligentes Messsysteme
Funkzähler aller Sparten (Wärme, Wasser, Strom)

Zielgruppe des Schulungsgebäudes sind in erster Linie Handwerker*innen, die hier die neuen Technologien kennenlernen und den Umgang damit trainieren können. Das Gebäude stellt Schulungsräume bereit, die auch von interessierten Gruppen der Zivilgesellschaft genutzt werden können. Eine Projektskizze liegt vor, da sich ein ähnliches Projekt gerade in Wolfhagen in Nordhessen in der Umsetzung befindet. Lackmann ist darüber hinaus bereit, sich in der Lehre einzubringen.

Transformationsziel
Das Ziel unseres Transformationsfahrplans
ist es, bis 2030 klimaneutral zu sein.

LWL
Für die Menschen.
Für Westfalen-Lippe.

![img-63.jpeg](img-63.jpeg)

Der Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe (LWL) arbeitet als Kommunalverband mit mehr als 20.000 Beschäftigten für die 8,4 Millionen Menschen in der Region. Der LWL betreibt 35 Förderschulen, 21 Krankenhäuser, 18 Museen, zwei Besucherzentren und ist einer der größten Hilfezahler für Menschen mit Behinderung. Er erfüllt damit Aufgaben im sozialen Bereich, in der Behinderten- und Jugendhilfe, in der Psychiatrie und in der Kultur, die sinnvollerweise westfalenweit wahrgenommen werden. Ebenso engagiert er sich für eine inklusive Gesellschaft in allen Lebensbereichen. Die neun kreisfreien Städte und 18 Kreise in Westfalen-Lippe sind die Mitglieder des LWL. Sie tragen und finanzieren den Landschaftsverband, dessen Aufgaben ein Parlament mit 125 Mitgliedern aus den westfälischen Kommunen gestaltet.

Der LWL hat sich das Ziel gesetzt, bis zum Jahr 2030 bilanziell klimaneutral zu werden. Das ist sehr ambitioniert, gleichwohl aber auch Ansporn und Antrieb zur Wahrnehmung der Vorbildfunktion der öffentlichen Hand. Energiesparen ist beim LWL bereits

seit den 1970er Jahren wichtiges Anliegen. Zwischen 1990 und 2020 konnte der $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Ausstoß der eigenen Liegenschaften bereits um $63\%$ gesenkt werden. Darauf aufbauend wurde 2021 im Dezernat des Ersten Landesrats und Kämmerers / der Ersten Landesrätin und Kämmerin des LWL die LWL-Stabsstelle Klima, Umwelt und Nachhaltigkeit verankert, die den Transformationsprozess steuert und begleitet.

Mit der Erarbeitung eines Integrierten Klimaschutzkonzeptes (IKSK) wurden systematisch alle Bereiche des LWL bewertet. Basis für das IKSK war eine umfassende Treibhausgasbilanz. Mit 62 Maßnahmen in neun Handlungsfeldern skizziert die Klimaschutzstrategie des LWL den Weg, wie bis 2030 die Klimaneutralität gelingen kann. Im Fokus stehen die Bereiche Gebäude und Energie, dienstliche Mobilität, nachhaltige Gestaltung des Beschaffungswesens sowie Sensibilisierung und Fortbildung der Beschäftigten.

Die wesentlichen Stellschrauben und zugleich
die größten Herausforderungen liegen im Gebäudebereich: Hier werden über $73\%$ der jährlichen Emissionen verursacht. Der LWL bewirtschaftet etwa 1.400 Gebäude in ganz Westfalen-Lippe. Über $40\%$ davon wurden vor 1970 gebaut, rund $20\%$ stehen unter Denkmalschutz. Um ältere Bestandsgebäude an die heutigen Anforderungen anzupassen, sind große Investitionen notwendig. Energetische Sanierung, Dekarbonisierung der Energieversorgung und Ausbau der Erneuerbaren Energien sind nur Beispiele dafür, wie der LWL den Gebäudebereich nachhaltiger gestalten will. Dadurch könnten bis 2030 gegenüber 1990 circa $80\%$ der Emissionen eingespart werden.

Fortsetzung des Beitrags folgt hier:

Auch im Mobilitätsbereich befindet sich der LWL in einem Transformationsprozess: Der Landschaftsverband betreibt über 1.000 Dienstfahrzeuge, die zusammen ca. 2.600 Tonnen CO₂ im Jahr verursachen. Mit der Umsetzung eines ganzheitlichen Mobilitätskonzeptes wird seit 2022 die betriebliche Mobilität durch ein vielschichtiges Betriebliches Mobilitätsmanagement (BMM) nachhaltiger und effizienter gestaltet. Die Umstellung des Fuhrparks auf emissionsfreie Fahrzeuge, der Ausbau der Ladeinfrastruktur sowie unterschiedliche Mobilitätskampagnen, Angebote und Maßnahmen sollen zu einer kontinuierlichen Senkung der mobilitätsbedingten Emissionen führen (–45% bis 2030).

Die Klimaschutzstrategie des LWL widmet sich ebenfalls dem Einkaufs- und Ernährungsbereich. Hier soll die Entwicklung zu einem nachhaltigen öffentlichen Einkaufs- und Beschaffungswesen weiter vorangetrieben werden. Dadurch können bis 2030 circa 23% der Emissionen eingespart werden. Einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Erreichung des Ziels leisten die eigenen Beschäftigten. Mit gezielten Sensibilisierungsmaßnahmen, Mitmach-Aktionen und Fortbildungsangeboten wird die Belegschaft immer wieder zum Klimaschutz motiviert. Das verbleibende Kontingent an CO₂-Emissionen soll auch nach 2030 weiter reduziert und bilanziell – möglichst durch den Einsatz von Erneuerbaren Energien und dem Aufbau von CO₂-Senken – ausgeglichen werden. Eine passende Kompensations-Strategie wird noch erarbeitet.

# Erwartete Co-Benefits

Durch die Umsetzung des IKSK des LWL entstehen eine Vielzahl an positiven Nebeneffekten im Bereich des Klima- und Umweltschutzes. Der Ausbau der regenerativen Energieerzeugung beim LWL führt beispielsweise zu einer Steigerung des Anteils Erneuerbarer Energien im deutschen Strommix. Die Umsetzung des Betrieblichen Mobilitätsmanagements und die Flexibilisierung des Arbeitsplatzes (z. B. durch Homeoffice) führen zu einer allgemeinen Entlastung des Verkehrsaufkommens sowie zu einer Reduzierung der lokalen Luft- und Lärm-Emissionen sowohl in Münster als auch an den anderen LWL-Standorten in Westfalen-Lippe. Auch im Bereich des öffentlichen Einkaufs können durch die Umsetzung des Transformationsplans Impulse auf dem Markt in Richtung nachhaltiger Produkte und Dienstleistungen gesetzt werden.

# Erwarteter Projektaufwand in Euro

Mit der Umsetzung des Integrierten Klimaschutzkonzeptes sind erhebliche Kosten verbunden.

Ein großer Teil der Kosten fallen im Gebäudebereich außerhalb des LWL-Kernhaushaltes an, insbesondere in den wirtschaftlich eigenständigen LWL-Kliniken und sonst. Gesundheitseinrichtungen.

Den Kosten gegenüber stehen eine Vielzahl von kostendämpfenden Effekten beispielsweise durch zu akquirierende Fördermittel, Einsparungen, Erträge im Energiebereich sowie durch technologischen Fortschritt. Allerdings haben sich seit Aufstellung des IKSK die Rahmenbedingungen, u. a. durch die angespannte kommunale Haushaltslage, den sich verschärfenden Fachkräftemangel und die hohe Inflation verändert.

Am 10.06.2022 wurde unser Transformationsfahrplan beschlossen.

# Technische Klimaschutzmaßnahmen

Unternehmen
Landwirtschaftsverlag GmbH

Ansprechperson
Marc Schürmann

Transformationsziel
Wir wollen bis 2030 klimaneutral sein.

Landwirtschaftsverlag

Bereits im Jahr 2020 hat sich die Landwirtschaftsverlag GmbH in Hiltrup mit der Gründung eines „Team Nachhaltigkeit“ dem Thema Nachhaltigkeit intensiv gewidmet.

Neben der Aufstellung und Aktualisierung grundlegender Leitlinien/Grundsätze im Sinne der Nachhaltigkeit für den Landwirtschaftsverlag steht für uns die Umsetzung ganz konkreter Projekte im Vordergrund.

Wir haben im Februar 2023 unsere PV-Anlage mit 134 KWp in Betrieb genommen. Die Besonderheit dabei ist, dass wir nicht nur auf dem Dach eines unserer Verlagshäuser Photovoltaik installiert haben, sondern auch bestehende, versiegelte Parkplatzflächen mittels Carports überdacht und mit PV-Modulen versehen haben.
In dem Zusammenhang wurde auf der angrenzenden, von der Stiftung Landwirtschaftsverlag errichteten Kita, ebenfalls Photovoltaik (22 KWp) installiert. Beide Anlagen zusammen produzieren rd. 140.000 KWh/Jahr nachhaltigen Strom.
Wir forcieren aktuell die Elektromobilität im Landwirtschaftsverlag, indem wir sukzessive unseren Fuhrpark auf E-Autos umrüsten. In diesem Zusammenhang haben wir im Jahr 2022 bereits 5 Ladesäulen mit insgesamt 10 Ladepunkten installiert. Im Jahre 2024 folgen weitere 5 Ladesäulen mit 10 Ladepunkten. Nicht nur Firmen-PKW können dort mit Strom geladen werden, auch unseren Mitarbeitenden ist es dort möglich ihre Elektroautos aufzuladen.
Der Strom, den wir extern beziehen, ist zu 100 % Ökostrom.
Für die Ladung der E-Autos werden wir in 2024 eine weitere PV-Anlage mit rund 25 KWp installieren.

Der Allgemeinheit haben wir in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft eine öffentliche E-Ladesäule zur Verfügung gestellt und dem Stadteilauto Münster die Möglichkeit geschaffen, dort eine Station zu eröffnen.
Rund $\frac{2}{3}$ unseres Heizbedarfs wird bereits über Geothermie abgedeckt, der Rest über einen gasbetriebenen Kessel. Vor dem Hintergrund, dass viele Mitarbeitenden teilweise im Homeoffice arbeiten, wollen wir in 2024 an den Heizkörpern smarte Thermostate installieren, die nur an den Tagen heizen, wenn die Mitarbeitenden auch tatsächlich im Büro sind. Wir erwarten dadurch den Gasverbrauch um rund $\frac{1}{3}$ zu reduzieren.
Wir kümmern uns um IT-Outsourcing und lagern sukzessive hochperformante IT-Infrastruktur in energieeffiziente Rechenzentren aus.
Die Beleuchtung im Landwirtschaftsverlag wurde bereits größtenteils auf LED-Technik umgestellt. In 2024 werden wir die letzten 200 Leuchtstoffröhren gegen LED-Beleuchtung austauschen.
Nachdem wir bereits seit langem unsere Print-Produkte ausschließlich auf umweltzertifizierten Bedruckstoffen fertigen lassen, achten wir seit 2023 bei der Vergabe von Druckaufträgen auf besonders energieeffiziente Drucktechnik unserer Partner.
Neben den „großen“ Projekten haben wir sehr viele „kleine“ Projekte umgesetzt bzw. setzen sie aktuell um (zum Beispiel Erweiterung der Fahrradstände, Installation einer Akkuladestation für E-Bikes, Reduzierung des internen Papierbedarfs um ca. 75 %, Reduzierung der Außenbeleuchtung, nachhaltige Reinigung unserer Räumlichkeiten, Implementierung nachhaltiger Dienstreise-Richtlinien, betriebliche Förderung zur Nutzung öffentlicher Verkehrsmittel, Schulung der

Mitarbeitenden zu energieeffizientem Verhalten, Verzicht auf Warmwasser in den Teeküchen u.v.m).

Der Landwirtschaftsverlag ist ab dem Geschäftsjahr 2025 zur CSRD-Berichterstattung verpflichtet. Ende 2023 haben wir dazu ein Projekt mit dem Ziel gestartet, hier nicht nur gesetzlichen Anforderungen nachzukommen, sondern einen „Werkzeugkasten“ für einen kontinuierlichen Verbesserungsprozess im Bereich Nachhaltigkeit für den Landwirtschaftsverlag zu generieren. In diesem Prozess ist bis zum 30.06.2025 auch die Aufstellung eines Transformationsfahrplans zur Erreichung unserer Nachhaltigkeitsziele geplant.

Dazu gehört die Klimaneutralität am Standort Münster bis Ende des Jahres 2030!

![img-65.jpeg](img-65.jpeg)

Nachhaltigkeit ist ein wichtiger Bestandteil der Geschäftsstrategie der LBS NordWest. Mit der Unterzeichnung der Selbstverpflichtung der Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe hat sich die LBS NordWest zur Klimaneutralität im Geschäftsbetrieb bis 2035 verpflichtet. Die LBS NordWest verfolgt einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz.

## Geschäftsbetrieb

Durch verschiedene Maßnahmen gestalten wir den Geschäftsbetrieb und die Gebäude der LBS NordWest umweltfreundlich. Unser Mobilitätskonzept basiert auf dem konsequenten Ausbau der Infrastruktur für Elektromobilität. Durch die Schaffung von Ladestationen für Elektrofahrzeuge und die Förderung der Fahrrad- und ÖPNV-Nutzung tragen wir zur Reduktion von $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Emissionen bei. Der Standort der Unternehmenszentrale in Münster ist mittlerweile mit vier Elektroladesäulen ausgestattet. Zudem arbeiten wir an einem Raumnutzungskonzept, angepasst an die Bedürfnisse unserer Mitarbeitenden, und nutzen die Ressource Raum effizient. Im Zuge unserer digitalen

Transformation arbeiten wir erfolgreich daran, unsere Geschäftsprozesse umfassend zu digitalisieren. Die LBS NordWest verfolgt einen Digitalisierungsfahrplan bis 2025, auf dessen Basis in allen wesentlichen Prozessen festgelegte Digitalisierungs- und Automatisierungsziele angestrebt werden. Diese Maßnahmen steigern die Effizienz unseres Geschäftsbetriebes und minimieren den ökologischen Fußabdruck durch die Reduzierung von Papierverbrauch. Das Lieferantenmanagement der LBS NordWest sowie der Einkauf für das Betriebsrestaurant in Münster legen großen Wert auf Regionalität und Saisonalität. Zudem verfolgt die LBS NordWest eine nachhaltige Geldanlagestrategie, die sich an den Kriterien des staatlichen Pensionsfonds Norwegens orientiert. Die Umsetzung erfolgt über den Ausschluss von Unternehmen, die bestimmte Produkte produzieren beziehungsweise vertreiben oder gegen bestimmte Verhaltensweisen verstoßen.

## Energieeffizienter Wohngebäudebestand

Das Klimaschutzgesetz der Bundesregierung setzt auf eine deutliche Reduktion des $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Ausstoßes im Gebäudesektor. Dies verlangt einen deutlichen Anstieg der Sanierungsquote bei Bestandsimmobilien. Die LBS NordWest will hier als Finanzierungspartnerin einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur energetischen Modernisierung leisten. Mit Produkten wie dem „Klima&amp;Zuhause“-Modernisierungskredit bieten wir ein nachhaltig ausgerichtetes Kreditprodukt an, das unseren Kund*innen die Möglichkeit bietet, ihre Immobilie energetisch zu modernisieren. Die Anbindung an ein Netzwerk von Energieberater*innen ermöglicht es uns, ganzheitliche Lösungen für energetische Sanierungen anzubieten. Das Energie-

beraternetzwerk wird stetig ausgeweitet und unseren Kund*innen zur Verfügung gestellt. So tragen wir zur umweltfreundlichen Gestaltung und Transformation unseres gesamten Geschäftsgebiets und Münsters bei.

## Unser Engagement

Ein zentrales Element unseres sozialen Engagements ist der „Vorausdenker-Wettbewerb“. Mit dieser Initiative unterstützt die LBS NordWest regionale Institutionen, die einen positiven Einfluss auf die Umwelt und die Gesellschaft haben. Für den Vorausdenker-Wettbewerb 2023 stellte unser Haus rund 90.000 Euro an Fördergeldern bereit. Der Münsteraner Oberbürgermeister Markus Lewe unterstütze den Wettbewerb als Teil der Jury. Unter den Gewinnern des Wettbewerbs waren unter anderem Projekte im Münsteraner Stadtgebiet. So konnten wir beispielsweise mehrere Münsteraner Organisationen bei der Anschaffung von Lastenfahrrädern finanziell unterstützen. Der Vorausdenker-Wettbewerb wird auch zukünftig stattfinden und auf das gesamte Geschäftsgebiet der fusionierten LBS NordWest ausgeweitet. Zudem hat die LBS NordWest im April 2023 bei einer Baumpflanzaktion 9.232 Bäume gepflanzt, unter anderem im Waldschadensgebiet am Autobahnkreuz Münster-Süd.

Die Auswirkungen unseres Geschäftsbetriebs auf Umwelt und Klima werden uns kontinuierlich bewusster. Unser Ziel ist, alle Emissionen, die durch unsere Geschäftsaktivitäten entstehen, so zu vermeiden und zu reduzieren, dass unsere $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Bilanz so gering wie möglich ausfällt. Unvermeidliche Emissionen aus dem Dieselverbrauch unserer Flotte und aus dem Fernwärmebezug kompensieren wir durch die Unterstützung von Brunnenprojekten des Dienstleisters „Klima ohne Grenzen“ in Mosambik und Uganda.

Unser Ziel der Klimaneutralität in Scope 1 und 2 bis 2025 haben wir so bereits 2023 erreicht. Für den Scope 3 des eigenen Geschäftsbetriebs haben wir uns das Klimaneutralitätsziel 2045 gesetzt.

Damit es uns gelingt, unsere Umwelt- und Klimaauswirkungen systematisch zu reduzieren, haben wir ein ganzheitliches Umweltmanagement mit sieben Arbeitsgruppen etabliert: Energie, Ressourcen und Abfall, Beschaffung, Mobilität, Green IT, Veranstaltungen und Agenturen. Energie sparen und möglichst erneuerbar gestalten – das ist erklärtes Ziel. Dabei kommen uns unsere nachhaltigen Bauten am

Campus in Münster zugute: Das Gebäude „Kristall“ erhielt die höchste Auszeichnung der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen und auch unserer „Villa Kunterbunt“ bescheinigte die Architektenkammer Nordrhein-Westfalen besondere Energieeffizienz. Jüngster großer Meilenstein ist ein Vertrag mit den Stadtwerken Münster, mit dem wir den Ökostromanteil auf 100 Prozent ausbauen und dabei auf regenerative Energien aus möglichst regionalen Quellen setzen. Ab 2024 kommen rund 20 Prozent des Strombedarfs exklusiv aus einer Dach-Fotovoltaikanlage in Billerbeck. Darüber hinaus benötigten Strom liefern regenerative Kraftwerksparks in Schleswig-Holstein und Niedersachsen. Den größten Teil unserer Wärme beziehen wir über das Fernwärmenetz der Stadtwerke Münster. Um hier langfristig Klimaneutralität ohne Kompensation zu erreichen, wünschen wir uns eine Umstellung auf regenerative Quellen.

Mit rund 2.000 LVM-Fahrzeugen kommt es auch auf Veränderungen bei der Mobilität an, wenn wir unseren ökologischen Fußabdruck verkleinern wollen. Aktuell wird etwa jeder fünfte PKW im LVM-Fuhrpark der Zentrale elektrisch betrieben; innerhalb der Werbeflotte für die Versicherungsagenturen ist der Anteil etwas höher. Für alle, die in Münster mit dem Fahrrad zur Arbeit kommen, bietet das Unternehmen neben 750 überdachten Fahrradstellplätzen, Umkleiden und Duschen auch Leihfahrräder sowie die Option des Fahrrad-Leasings.

Die Anpassung unserer Reiserichtlinie soll Nachhaltigkeitsaspekte vor allem bei Dienstreisen noch stärker berücksichtigen. Und um die ÖPNV-Nutzung zu steigern, möchten wir Mitarbeitende, Vertrauensleute und ihre Teams noch stärker für die Auswirkungen ihres Mobilitätsverhaltens sensibilisieren.

Fortsetzung des Beitrags folgt hier:

Nach dem Vorbild der Kreislaufwirtschaft wollen wir Ressourcen effizient einsetzen, erneuerbare Materialien bevorzugen und die Lebensdauer von Materialien maximieren. Mit Pfandsystemen reduzieren wir den Abfall in unseren Betriebsrestaurants und optimieren regelmäßig die Portionsgrößen. Bioabfall wird zu 100 Prozent einer Biogasanlage zugeführt. Wir nutzen überwiegend Recyclingpapier und arbeiten an Lösungen, um beim Postversand Papier zu sparen. Zusätzlich arbeiten wir daran, unsere Abfallströme besser digital zu erfassen. Und für den Schutz der Artenvielfalt in Münster setzen wir in unseren Außenanlagen bewusst auf insektenfreundliche Pflanzen und Vogel-Nisthilfen sowie Futter- und Wasserstellen. Die weiteren Arbeitsgruppen Beschaffung, Green IT, Veranstaltungen und Agenturen setzen sich vornehmlich mit Themen auseinander, die nicht primär in Münster verortet sind. Auch hier sollen die Umwelt- und Klimaauswirkungen systematisch erfasst und reduziert werden.

Unsere Großküche produziert täglich etwa 800 Mittagessen. Dabei kann zwischen drei verschiedenen Menüs gewählt werden. Mit Hilfe der App Eaternity wurden alle Rezepte unserer Küche auf ihre Klimafreundlichkeit überprüft. Gerichte, bei deren Herstellung besonders viele Treibhausgase entstehen, sollen perspektivisch aus den Speiseplänen gestrichen werden. Wir versuchen durch saisonale, regionale und viele pflanzliche Produkte die Klimabelastung durch unsere Speiseangebote zu verringern. Außerdem sollen durch Hinweise/Icons auf dem Speiseplan Mitarbeitende und Patient*innen auf Bio-Komponenten, klimafreundliche, vegane und vegetarische Gerichte im Speiseplan aufmerksam gemacht werden. Alle mit dem Klima-Icon gekennzeichneten Gerichte verursachen mindestens 40 % weniger CO₂ als der Durchschnitt aller angebotenen Menüs. Durch die Information und Kennzeichnung können Mitarbeitende und Patient*innen für klimafreundliche Gerichte sensibilisiert werden und sie können selbst eine Entscheidung treffen, ohne sich bevormundet zu fühlen.

MExLab ExperiMINTe ist ein außerschulischer MINT-Lernort für Kinder und Jugendliche an der Universität Münster. Die inhaltlichen Schwerpunkte stellen neben den MINT-Fachdisziplinen auch interdisziplinäre MINT-Themen, wie Projekte zur Bildung nachhaltiger Entwicklung (BNE) dar, um naturwissenschaftliche Bildung von jungen Menschen mit der Entwicklung von gesellschaftlicher Verantwortung zu vereinen.

Wir verstehen uns als Schnittstelle zwischen den MINT-Schüler*innenlaboren, Fachbereichen und außerschulischen Lernorten der Universität Münster und einem großen Netzwerk an Schulen, Unternehmen, kommunalen Einrichtungen und Vereinen in Münster und darüber hinaus. So ist das MExLab ExperiMINTe auch im BNE-Netzwerk der Stadt Münster vertreten.

Besonders gefragt ist unser Workshop zum Thema Mikroplastik. Kann man Mikroplastik sehen? Wo finden wir es und wie lässt es sich nachweisen? Experimentell entdecken die Teilnehmer*innen zwei Quellen von Mikroplastik, die direkt mit ihrem Alltag zusammenhängen. So lernen sie naturwissenschaftliches Arbeiten (Schwerpunkt Stofftrennung/ Mikroskopie) entlang eines Forschungszyklus mit einem starken Lebensweltbezug kennen.

In offenen Gruppendiskussionen sprechen wir mit den Jugendlichen über zukunftsorientierte Lösungen für das Plastikproblem, die direkt in die praktische Umsetzung einer plastikfreien Alternative zu einem Alltagsprodukt, zum Beispiel die Herstellung eines eigenen Deos, führt. Zusätzlich werden in diesem Sommer wieder mindestens zwei Feriencamps für Jugendliche angeboten. Hier haben alle Teilnehmer*innen die Gelegenheit, sich noch intensiver mit dem Thema Mikroplastik auseinanderzusetzen. So werden unter anderem auch Wasserproben aus dem heimischen Aasee entnommen, untersucht und ausgewertet. Auch eigene plastikfreie Alternativen können hergestellt werden, darunter Bienenwachstücher, Deos und vegane Gummibärchen. Zum Abschluss arrangiert die Gruppe eine kleine Ausstellung, in der sie ihre Forschungsergebnisse und selbsthergestellten Produkte ihren Familien präsentieren können.

Sowohl bei der Herstellung von Plastik als auch bei der Verbrennung von Kunststoffabfällen entstehen große Mengen von klimaschädlichem $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Laut des Deutschen Instituts für Wirtschaftsforschung entfallen auf eine Tonne Plastik daher knapp fünf Tonnen $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Durch die Reduktion beziehungsweise Vermeidung von Plastik kann also viel $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ eingespart werden und dies kann dann wiederum einen Beitrag zur Klimaneutralität der Stadt Münster leisten.

# RATIODATA

Die Ratiodata plant im Jahre 2024 vier Solar-Tracker zur Energieerzeugung auf dem Parkplatz am Gustav-Stresemann-Weg 29 in Münster errichten und installieren zu lassen. Das Projekt zielt darauf ab, eine nachhaltige Energiequelle zu schaffen und die optimale Nutzung von Solarenergie zu ermöglichen. Die Solar-Tracker werden mit hocheffizienten Photovoltaikmodulen ausgestattet, die sich nach der Sonne ausrichten, um eine maximale Sonneneinstrahlung zu gewährleisten. Ein intelligentes Steuerungssystem überwacht die Bewegung der Sonne und steuert die Ausrichtung der Solar-Tracker entsprechend. Die vier Solar-Tracker sollen dabei mind. 60 GWh und damit ca. 10 % des Eigenverbrauchs der Ratiodata mithilfe der Sonnenenergie erzeugen können. Dadurch treibt die Ratiodata den Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien in Deutschland mit voran. Sollte die Pilotphase erfolgreich verlaufen, sollen vier weitere Solar-Tracker installiert werden.

![img-75.jpeg](img-75.jpeg)

Wir sind ein Unternehmen welches Photovoltaik-Anlagen mit Batteriespeicher-Systemen und Ladeinfrastruktur für Privat-, Gewerbe- und Industriekunden hier in Münster anbietet und schlüsselfertig baut. Zusätzlich wird die vollständige Entwicklung und der Betrieb von Photovoltaik Freiflächen-Anlagen im Raum Münster, realisiert. Somit ist es möglich durch in Münster und Umgebung installierte Photovoltaik-Anlagen, erneuerbare Energie zu erzeugen, direkt vor Ort zu verbrauchen und lokal zu vermarkten. Für 2024 ist es das Ziel, Photovoltaik-Anlagen mit einer Leistung von ca. 1.300 kWp zu installieren. Die erzeugte Strommenge entspricht ca. 1,170 Mio. Kilowattstunden Solarstrom und somit eine Reduktion der fossilen Stromerzeugung und eine Einsparung von ca. 930 Tonnen CO₂.

Als familiengeführtes Unternehmen Schoenergie mit Sitz in Föhren bei Trier verfolgen wir die Vision und das Leitmotiv jedem Bürger erneuerbare Energie verfügbar zu machen. Ca. 300 Mitarbeiter*innen übernehmen täglich die Aufgabe Kund*innen für Photovoltaik-Anlagen zu beraten, Anlagen zu planen und zu bauen. Von der kleinen Einfamilienhaus PVAnlage bis zum 214 Megawatt Kraftwerk (Südeifel) kommt alles aus einer Hand. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist es dem Unternehmen wichtig, einen wertvollen Beitrag zur Energiewende beizutragen.

Außerdem werden auch die Arbeitsprozesse und Anlagen des Unternehmens klimafreundlich transformiert:

Im Januar wurde auf dem Dach der Niederlassung in Münster eine 50 kWp Photovoltaik-Anlage installiert.
Ergänzend eine Ladeinfrastruktur mit fünf Wallboxen.
Zum Einsatz kommt ebenso eine Steuerung, welche ein öko-dynamisches Laden ermöglicht.
Der Fahrzeugpark besteht, nach einer konsequenten Abkehr von Verbrennerfahrzeugen aus vier E-Fahrzeugen und zwei Hybridfahrzeugen.
Ein weiterer Austausch von Verbrennerfahrzeugen findet in diesem Jahr statt. Durch den Einsatz der Photovoltaik-Anlage wird es möglich sein, den größten Anteil des Strombedarf des Betriebs, der Fahrzeuge, sowie weiterer Mieter des Areals, zu decken.

Ergänzend unterstützt die öko-dynamische Steuerung die priorisierte Nutzung des durch die Photovoltaik-Anlage erzeugten Stroms. Diese Maßnahmen führen zu einer erheblichen Einsparung von CO₂-Emissionen sowie einer entsprechenden Entlastung des Versorgernetzes.

# S!NN

Münsters Kongress für Soziale Innovationen

![img-77.jpeg](img-77.jpeg)

Eine zukunftsfähige Gesellschaft ist eine sozial gerechte und ökologisch tragfähige Gesellschaft. Sie überwindet die vielfältigen, sich gegenseitig verstärkenden Krisen unserer Zeit. Sie erreicht Engagement, Kreativität und einen tiefgreifenden Wandel unserer Lebens- und Wirtschaftsweise.

S!NN – Münsters Kongress für Soziale Innovationen – lädt Münsteraner*innen dazu ein, diese Zukunftsfähigkeit zu diskutieren. Gemeinsam mit Expert*innen und Multiplikator*innen geht S!NN der Frage nach, welche Rolle Soziale Innovationen für die vielfältigen und zwingend notwendigen Veränderungen zur sozial-ökologischen Transformation spielen und wie wir

diese erreichen können. S!NN bedeutet, mit Neugier, Optimismus, Konstruktivität und Lernbereitschaft eigene Schritte zu gehen. Kritisch und selbstreflexiv, aber immer wertschätzend und neugierig auf Veränderung. Von Wirtschaftsverbänden über Politik und Wissenschaft bis hin zu NGOs – gemeinsam zuhören und diskutieren, voneinander lernen und sich gegenseitig inspirieren. Mit Keynotes, Panel-Talks und interaktiven Workshops. Mit großzügigen Vernetzungslandschaften, mit Kunst &amp; Kultur und in Selbstlernräumen. S!NN ist kein Kongress wie jeder andere. S!NN ist ein Möglichkeitsraum für eine nachhaltige Zukunft. Mit dem S!NN-Kongress vernetzen wir Menschen, die sich die ökosoziale Transformation zur Aufgabe gemacht haben. Von Wirtschaft und Wissenschaft über Politik bis hin zur engagierten Zivilgesellschaft – wir bringen alle zusammen, die mit Neugier und Optimismus an nachhaltigen Lösungen für unsere Zukunft arbeiten. Positive Beiträge zur Klimaneutralität müssen von der Gesellschaft getragen werden. Veranstaltungen wie der S!NN-Kongress sorgen dafür, dass Menschen und Organisationen mitgenommen werden. Sie sind der Nährboden, sie machen mehrheitsfähig und wirken in den Alltag hinein. Hier entstehen Lösungen für den Wandel zur klimaneutralen Stadt. Nicht in einer akademischen Blase, sondern in der Mitte der Gesellschaft.

Münsterland Ost

![img-79.jpeg](img-79.jpeg)

Die Sparkasse Münsterland Ost zählt zu den Großsparkassen in Deutschland. Die Nähe zu ihren Kundinnen und Kunden zeichnet sie aus. Vertrauen und Verlässlichkeit sind die Leitplanken ihres Handelns.

## Sparkasse Münsterland Ost – aktiv für den Klimaschutz vor Ort in Münster

Die Sparkasse Münsterland Ost versteht es als ihre Aufgabe, die Menschen und die Wirtschaft in ihrem Geschäftsgebiet mit ihren Produkten und Dienstleistungen, ihrem gesellschaftlichen Engagement und ihrem unternehmerischen Handeln auf dem Weg zu mehr Nachhaltigkeit und zu einem besseren Klimaschutz zu unterstützen.

## CO₂-Abbau im Geschäftsbetrieb durch erneuerbare Energien und energetische Sanierung

Deshalb engagieren wir uns dafür, den ökologischen Fußabdruck unseres Geschäftsbetriebes so weit wie möglich zu verringern. Maßnahmen wie die Umstellung auf 100 % Ökostrom, ein nachhaltiges Mobilitätskonzept, die Installation eigener Photovoltaikanlagen oder die Zertifizierung als „Ökoprofit-Betrieb“, wirken und sparen CO₂-Emissionen ein. Unsere Klimabilanz zeigt Potenzial vor allem beim Bezug von Wärme.

Das Augenmerk legen wir daher künftig auf die energetische Verbesserung der Gebäudesubstanz unserer BeratungsCenter, Filialen und übrigen Standorte. Deshalb haben wir gemeinsam mit einer Energieberatungsgesellschaft aus Münster den Ist-Zustand bewertet und einen Fahrplan zur Verbesserung der Energiebilanz unseres Gebäudebestandes entwickelt. In 2024 wird die Sparkasse auf dieser Basis damit beginnen, die Energieeffizienz ihrer Immobilien schrittweise mit einem Sanierungsprogramm zu verbessern und den CO₂-Fußabdruck weiter zu minimieren.

## Kundinnen und Kunden auf ihrem Transformationspfad begleiten

Als Finanzdienstleistungsunternehmen können wir den wirkungsvollsten Beitrag zum Klimaschutz im Geschäft mit unseren Kundinnen und Kunden vor Ort leisten. Vor allem, indem wir Finanzmittel für klimafreundliche Investitionen bereitstellen – von der energetischen Sanierung privater Wohnhäuser bis hin zur Transformation ganzer Geschäftsmodelle unserer gewerblichen Kundinnen und Kunden. Neben der Vergabe von Krediten und der Vermittlung öffentlicher Fördergelder setzen wir dabei verstärkt auf die Sensibilisierung und Beratung rund um Fragen der Nachhaltigkeit.

Mit einer eigenen Nachhaltigkeitskampagne „Wirtschaftswende. Hier und Jetzt.“ haben wir im letzten Jahr mit großer Außenwirkung und mehr als 1.000 Einzelgesprächen die Nachhaltigkeitsberatung

Zu unseren aktuellen Top-Beratungsthemen gehören unter anderem die Umstellung auf regenerative Energien, die betriebliche $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Messung, E-Mobilität und energetisches Bauen/Sanieren. In 2024 werden wir die Kampagne wiederholen und unser Nachhaltigkeitsangebot weiter ausbauen: etwa mit einer Nachhaltigkeitssoftware für mittelständische Unternehmen oder durch Kooperationen mit lokalen Netzwerkpartnern zum Beispiel im Bereich Energieberatung oder PV-Anlagetechnik.

# Förderaktion „gemeinsam nachhaltig“ mit Klima-Sonderpreis

Mit der Förderaktion „gemeinsam nachhaltig“ unterstützt die Sparkasse in 2024 erneut gemeinnützige Vereine und Initiativen dabei, nachhaltige Ideen Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen. Dafür stehen insgesamt 100.000 Euro zur Verfügung. Gemeinnützige Organisationen bewerben sich im Aktionszeitraum über www.gemeinsam-nachhaltig.org mit ihrem Nachhaltigkeitsprojekt. In der anschließenden öffentlichen Votingphase geht es dann darum, das eigene Projekt bekannt zu machen. Wer 100 Stimmen und mehr erreichen konnte, darf sich bereits über eine Grundförderung von 500 Euro freuen. Eine Fachjury kann die Finanzspritze anschließend auf bis zu 5.000 Euro je Projekt erhöhen. Wegen der besonderen Bedeutung des Klimaschutzes lobt die Sparkasse auch in diesem Jahr zusätzlich einen Klima-Sonderpreis aus. Weitere Infos gibt es online ab Mitte April, die Aktion startet im August.

$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Reduktion im Geschäftsbetrieb, Transformationsberatung von Kundinnen und Kunden und die gezielte Förderung von ehrenamtlichen Klimaschutzprojekten – mit diesem Maßnahmen-Trio leistet die Sparkasse Münsterland Ost ihren Beitrag zum Klimastadt-Vertrag.

![img-81.jpeg](img-81.jpeg)

Für uns ist Energiesparen und ein ressourcenschonender Umgang seit jeher in unserer DNA fest verwurzelt.

Um den Stromverbrauch zu senken, haben wir in den vergangenen Jahren nahezu die komplette Beleuchtung in sämtlichen unserer Märkte auf sparsame LED-Technik umgestellt. Darüber hinaus setzen wir – seit es möglich ist – konsequent auf Öko-Strom. Bereits vor über zehn Jahren ging unsere erste eigene Photovoltaikanlage in Betrieb. Den Ausbau „unserer“ Solaranlagen werden wir weiterhin durch die Intensivierung der Gespräche mit Objekteigentümer*innen forcieren.

Das mit Abstand größte Einsparpotenzial bietet jedoch die Kältetechnik. Wir haben die offenen Kühlregale mit Glasdrehtüren nachgerüstet, versuchen die Kühlkapazitäten bedarfsgerecht zu planen, um Überdimensionierungen zu vermeiden und tauschen. Altgeräte konsequent gegen effizientere Technik aus. Gute Erfahrungen haben wir mit smarten Timern für Lüftungs- und Klimaanlagen sowie CO₂-Fühlern gemacht, die eine bedarfsgesteuerte Lüftung ermöglichen.

Unseren Mitarbeitenden bieten wir ein JobRad an und wir nehmen sie bei unserem ambitionierten Vorhaben mit und motivieren sie, Ideen für noch mehr Effizienz mit uns zu teilen.

Mit einer smarten zum Teil KI-basierten Anbauplanung möchten wir – wo möglich – der Vermeidung von Lebensmittelverschwendung schon am Anfang der Kette begegnen. Auch zur Planung unserer Bestellungen setzen wir vermehrt auf Unterstützung durch Technik. „Food Tracks“ wird uns zukünftig bei der Planung und dem Bestellwesen helfen. Wir gehörten zu den ersten, die mit „toogoodtogo“ und Lebensmittelretter*innen nicht verkaufte, noch gute, Lebensmittel retten.

# Handwerkshöfe als Plattform für zirkuläre Wertschöpfung

Unternehmen
Sustina AG

Ansprechperson
Fabian Bergfort

Website
www.sustina.ag

Sustina AG

Wir setzen uns dafür ein, dass zirkuläre Handwerkshöfe in Münster entstehen und treiben damit die regionale Kreislaufwirtschaft voran. Das Projekt soll außerdem dazu beitragen, Menschen für das Handwerk zu begeistern und die urbane Produktion in Münster zu fördern. Der interdisziplinäre Wissensaustausch und die Schaffung von Synergien durch Zusammenarbeit sind wichtige Aspekte der Handwerkshöfe. Mit Sharing-Angeboten für Werkzeuge, Arbeits- und Geschäftsräume sowie mit einer geteilten administrativen Unterstützung, kann ein attraktives Angebot für Handwerker*innen geschaffen werden. So können Kosten gespart und Ressourcen effizienter genutzt werden.

Auch ein integrierter Baumarkt für gebrauchte und aufbereitete Baumaterialien soll Teil des Konzepts sein, um die Kreislaufwirtschaft im Sinne der zirkulären Ansätze Cradle To Cradle (C2C) und Urban Mining voranzubringen.

Bei C2C geht es darum, Materialien von Anfang an im Produktdesign sowie im Nutzungszyklus so einzusetzen, dass sie am Ende ihres Lebenszyklus wieder in den entsprechenden Materialkreislauf zurückgeführt werden können. Beim Urban Mining geht es darum, die bereits im Umlauf befindlichen Materialien weiter im Kreislauf zu halten und möglichst sinnvoll weiter zu nutzen, statt sie zu Müll werden zu lassen.

Letztlich soll ein Wissenstransfer zu diesen Konzepten die Zirkularität im Handwerk nicht nur fördern, sondern auch befähigen. Dieser Ort hat das Potenzial, eine starke Wirkung im Rahmen der gesamtstädtischen Kreislaufstrategie für Münster zu entfalten, indem von dort aus auch kommunale Material- und Stoffströme von der öffentlichen Hand organisiert werden können. Insgesamt bieten die Handwerkshöfe eine inspirierende Plattform für zirkuläre Wertschöpfung. So können der schonende und zirkuläre Umgang mit Ressourcen sowie der interdisziplinäre Wissensaustausch gefördert werden.

## Social Entrepreneurship Education:

Social Entrepreneurship Education (SEE) an der FH Münster, Universität Münster und der Katholischen Hochschule NRW Abt. Münster stellt ein ambitioniertes Projekt dar, das einen Beitrag zur Klimaneutralität der Stadt leisten möchte. Durch die Einbindung von SEE in die akademische Ausbildung fördern wir aktiv die Entwicklung und Realisierung von sozialökologischen Geschäftsideen und Initiativen. Die Teilnehmenden erlernen dabei, gesellschaftliche Herausforderungen nicht nur nachhaltig und unternehmerisch, sondern auch systemisch zu bewältigen. Ein besonderer Fokus liegt auf der Verknüpfung und Abwägung der ökologischen, sozialen und ökonomischen Nachhaltigkeit.

## Öffentlichkeitsarbeit und Bewusstseinsbildung durch Bildungsangebote

Ein zentraler Aspekt unseres Engagements ist die Sensibilisierung und Bildung der Öffentlichkeit im Bereich des Klimaschutzes. Durch Workshops, Seminare und Vorträge im Rahmen des SEE-Programms erreichen wir eine breite Zielgruppe von Studierenden, Lehrenden, Social Start-Ups, Projekten, Zivilgesellschaft, Unternehmen und weiteren Organisationen und tragen zur Steigerung des Bewusstseins für Umwelt- und Klimaschutzthemen bei. Diese Maßnahmen zielen darauf ab, nicht nur Wissen zu vermitteln, sondern auch zur aktiven Teilnahme am Klimaschutz zu motivieren und zu inspirieren.

## Transformationsfahrplan – Integration von SEE in die Lehre

Unser Transformationsfahrplan beinhaltet die feste Verankerung von SEE in den Curricula der Münsteraner Hochschulen. Ziel ist die Entwicklung eines hochschul- und fachbereichsübergreifenden Lehrangebots zu Social Entrepreneurship. Derzeit sind die FH Münster, die Universität Münster und die Katholische Hochschule NRW Abt. Münster mit insgesamt acht curricularen Angeboten beteiligt. Um die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Hochschulen, Praxispartner*innen und Zivilgesellschaft zu organisieren, hat sich in Münster ein Social Entrepreneurship Lehrkollektiv gegründet. Einmal pro Semester tauschen sich Lehrende und Studierende der Münsteraner Hochschulen sowie viele weitere Vertreter*innen des Gründungsökosystems wie beispielsweise die TAFH Münster GmbH, REACH – EUREGIO Start-up Center oder Social Impact Münster e.V. aus, um die gemeinsame Lehre und das Netzwerk weiterzuentwickeln.

## Transformationsprojekt – Diversität und Transdisziplinarität

Die Realisierung sozial-ökologischer Innovationen erfordert die Einbeziehung der von sozialökologischen Problematiken betroffenen Zielgruppen.

# Umfassende Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie

Institution
Universität Münster

Ansprechperson
Nico Schäfer

Website
www.uni-muenster.de

![img-84.jpeg](img-84.jpeg)

Universität Münster

Die Universität Münster begreift Nachhaltigkeit als eine verbindende Leitidee, die durch alle Angehörigen der Universität getragen wird. In ihrer Rolle als Wissenschafts- und Bildungseinrichtung sowie als integraler Bestandteil des gesellschaftlichen Lebens übernimmt die Universität Verantwortung für die ökologischen, sozialen und ökonomischen Dimensionen ihres Handelns. Als international ausgerichteter Wissenschafts-, Studien- und Arbeitsort sieht die Universität Münster nachhaltiges Handeln als Ausdruck ihrer globalen Verantwortung im Sinne einer zukunftsfähigen Gestaltung unserer Gesellschaft und des Erhalts der natürlichen Lebensgrundlagen. Die Universität Münster orientiert sich dabei an dem umfassenden Verständnis von Nachhaltigkeit, das in den Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) der Vereinten Nationen und den Zielen des Pariser Klimaabkommens festgehalten ist. Nachhaltigkeit wurde daher in den Organisationsstrukturen der Universität Münster über die Stabsstelle Nachhaltigkeit sowie das Prorektorat „Internationales, Transfer und Nachhaltigkeit“ verankert und zu einem wesentlichen Bestandteil der Universitätskultur. Die gesamtuniversitäre Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie formuliert als Rahmen gemeinsame und übergreifende Ziele für die Universität.

## Nachhaltigkeit und Klimaschutz in Betrieb und Administration

In ihrer Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie hat sich die Universität Münster das Ziel gesetzt, Nachhaltigkeit als ein handlungsleitendes Kriterium in den betrieblichen Abläufen und Entscheidungen im eigenen Einflussbereich zu integrieren. Im Fokus steht dabei ein ressourcenschonender Betrieb der Infrastruktur mit dem Ziel

der Klimaneutralität. Deshalb bezieht die Universität bereits seit 2009 Ökostrom und optimiert durch ein zentrales Energiemanagement den gesamtuniversitären Energieverbrauch stetig. Daneben wurden in den letzten Jahren sukzessive infrastrukturelle Maßnahmen umgesetzt (Sanierung von Fernwärmeleitungen, LED-Umrüstung, Installation von Wärmepumpen, etc.). Weiterhin wurden Nutzer*innen am Campus durch Energiesparkampagnen für einen bewussten Umgang mit Energie sensibilisiert. Auch organisatorische Maßnahmen wie eine Betriebsruhe wurden in den Wintern 2022/2023 und 2023/2024 erfolgreich eingeführt. In den nächsten Jahren plant die Universität die Bemühungen im Bereich Photovoltaik-Ausbau und Mobilitätsmanagement weiter zu intensivieren. Gleichzeitig soll bis 2026 ein integriertes Klimaschutzkonzept für die Universität erstellt werden.

## Forschung &amp; Lehre

Die Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler der Universität Münster erarbeiten gemeinsam Lösungen für die komplexen Herausforderungen der Gegenwart und leisten damit unter anderem auch einen Beitrag zur klimaneutralen und nachhaltigen Transformation der Gesellschaft. In aktuell vier Impact Areas verbindet die Universität Münster disziplinäre Stärken und Ressourcen für interfakultäre und interdisziplinäre Spitzenforschung mit gesellschaftlichem Impact. Die Impact Area „Sustainable Futures“ bündelt dabei unter anderem Forschungsprojekte im Bereich Battery Research, Biopolymers sowie inter- und transdisziplinäre Forschung im Bereich „Exploring and Shaping Sustainability“. Darüber hinaus nimmt das Zentrum für interdisziplinäre Nachhaltigkeitsforschung (ZIN) als zentrale wissenschaftliche Einrichtung der Uni

versität die Funktion wahr, Nachhaltigkeitsforschung, -lehre und -transfer fachbereichsübergreifend zu ermöglichen und zu vernetzen. Die Universität Münster versteht Nachhaltigkeit als ein wesentliches Element der Lehre und baut ihr Lehr- und Weiterbildungsangebote stetig aus.

## Transfer

Transfer definiert die Universität Münster als Übernahme ihrer zivilgesellschaftlichen Verantwortung in allen Gesellschaftsbereichen. Um diesem Anspruch gerecht zu werden, tritt die Universität Münster in den intensiven Austausch mit gesellschaftlichen Akteur*innen. Transferaktivitäten unter dem Gesichtspunkt der Nachhaltigkeit sind am Gemeinwohl orientiert und liefern einen Beitrag zur partizipativen (Weiter-)Entwicklung der Gesellschaft hin zu einer sozial-ökologisch nachhaltigen Lebensweise. Mit ihrem Transfer leistet die Universität Münster einen Beitrag, Bildung für Nachhaltige Entwicklung auch außeruniversitär zu vermitteln. Ein zentrales Instrument hierfür ist der jährlich stattfindende Nachhaltigkeitstag (Campus Earth) der Universität.

So gestalten wir als Westfalen-Gruppe aktiv die Mobilitätswende mit. Dabei gehen wir technologieoffen vor und investieren in verschiedene zukunftsfähige Antriebsenergien wie Bio-CNG und -LNG, Wasserstoff und E-Mobilität. Gerade an unserem Unternehmens- sitz in Münster bauen wir das Angebot von alternativen Antriebsenergien für unsere Kund:innen an unseren Tankstellen stetig aus. CO₂-neutrale Wäschen runden das Angebot im Mobilitätsmarkt ab, wodurch wir weitere Emissionen einsparen.

Auch im Wärmemarkt treiben wir die Energiewende voran: Wir bieten neben biogenen Flüssiggas die Planung, Installation und Wartung von Wärmepumpen für Haushalte und Gewerbe an und begleiten so unsere Kund:innen durch die Wärmewende.

Aber auch an unseren eigenen Standorten versuchen wir, unsere Treibhausgase zu reduzieren: Durch unsere zertifizierten Umwelt- und Energiemanagementsysteme gehen wir unsere Auswirkungen auf die Umwelt systematisch an und versuchen, diese so gering wie möglich zu halten. Unsere Werke in Deutschland

werden mit Grünstrom betrieben, außerdem haben wir die ersten Photovoltaik-Anlagen installiert. Durch die Sanierung unseres Hauptgebäudes an unserem Firmensitz in Münster reduzieren wir den Wärmeverbrauch auch im Verwaltungsbereich und vermeiden somit weitere Emissionen. Zusätzlich sind wir dabei, unseren Fuhrpark mehr und mehr zu elektrifizieren.

Nicht nur in unserem Tun und bei unseren Produkten haben wir begonnen, nachhaltiger zu handeln. Wir als Westfalen Gruppe denken heute schon an morgen- und dabei sind unsere Jüngsten uns besonders wichtig. So haben wir eine eigene Bildungsinitiative ins Leben gerufen, in welcher wir MINT-Fächer an Schulen durch Projekte fördern, um für eine Nachhaltige Entwicklung bereits in jüngeren Jahren zu sensibilisieren. In einem jährlichen Ideenwettbewerb entwickeln Schüler:innen aus Münster Ideen zu Themen wie Mobilität/Wärme der Zukunft.

Ebenfalls Teil der Bildungsinitiative ist die Partnerschaft mit dem Fachbereich EGU (Energie/Gebäude/ Umwelt) der Fachhochschule Münster. Die Zusammenarbeit mit dem Fachbereich EGU umfasst auch den technischen Bereich, insbesondere im Kontext der strombasierten Wärme. Westfalen fördert eine Forschungsgruppe, die sich vor dem Hintergrund der Wärmewende mit effizienter Wärmeplanung für Unternehmen und Kommunen befasst. Gemeinsames Ziel ist es, die Attraktivität des Standortes Münster als Wissenschafts- und Wirtschaftszentrum im Bereich Erneuerbare Energien, Bioenergie und effiziente und nachhaltige Wärmeversorgung zu steigern.

# Handwerklicher Umweltbildungsort

Verein
B-Side Kultur e.V. mit der Hansawerkstatt

Ansprechperson
Maike Grabowski

Die Hansawerkstatt soll als handwerklicher Umweltbildungsort in Zukunft allen Münsteraner*innen offenstehen. Dort können Nutzer*innen im Sinne einer Bildung für nachhaltige Entwicklung wertvolle Kompetenzen erwerben, die zum Selbermachen befähigen, zum nachhaltigen Umgang mit Ressourcen anregen und Eigeninitiative und Unabhängigkeit in Konsumentenscheidungen ermöglichen. Durch die Zurverfügungstellung von Reparaturmöglichkeiten können wir das Recht auf Reparatur vorantreiben.

Hier sehen wir auch eine große Schnittstelle zur Kinder- und Jugendbildung. Wir denken, dass die Hansawerkstatt ein wichtiger neuer Akteur in der außerschulischen BNE-Bildungslandschaft der Modellkommune Münster werden kann. Mit unseren Angeboten in der offenen Werkstatt für jedermensch (Holz- und Metallverarbeitung, 3D-Druck, Fahrradreparaturmöglichkeiten), einem Repaircafé, sowie verschiedenen Workshopformaten für unterschiedlichste Zielgruppen, wollen wir zur Umsetzung der städtischen Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie, notwendigen Klimaanpassungsmaßnahmen und der angestrebten Klimaneutralität der Stadt beitragen. Unsere Räumlichkeiten wollen wir auch interessierten Gruppen der Zivilgesellschaft zur Nutzung zur Verfügung stellen.

![img-94.jpeg](img-94.jpeg)

![img-95.jpeg](img-95.jpeg)

Der Digital Hub münsterLAND mit seinem angeschlossenen FabLab Makerspace bietet eine offene Experimentier- und Testumgebung für digitale Projekte und Vorhaben. Das Ganze ist eingebettet in eine regionale Community zur Vernetzung von Startups, Unternehmen und Hochschulen und bietet die physische und digitale Infrastruktur für Innovationsprojekte, eigene Ideen und einen Anlaufpunkt zum Austausch mit anderen Vordenker*innen und Macher*innen. Auf diese Weise trägt die offene Werkstatt zur Förderung einer Kultur der Nachhaltigkeit und Innovation bei, die für das Erreichen der Klimaneutralität in Großstädten unerlässlich ist. Unter anderem lassen sich folgende Beiträge festhalten:

## Förderung von Recycling und Upcycling

Der Makerspace bietet Werkzeuge und Ressourcen, um aus alten Materialien neue Produkte zu erstellen. Dies reduziert Abfall und fördert einen nachhaltigeren Konsum. Durch digitales Prototyping werden zudem Ressourcen im Entwicklungsprozess von Innovationen eingespart.

## Verbreitung von Wissen über Nachhaltigkeit

Durch Workshops und Veranstaltungen wie den Open Lab Day oder Informationsreihen zum zirkulären Wirtschaften können Bürger*innen lernen, wie sie nachhaltige Praktiken in ihrem Alltag umsetzen können.

## Entwicklung nachhaltiger Technologien

Hackathons wie der jährlich stattfindende MÜNSTERHACK und andere Veranstaltungen können dazu beitragen, innovative Lösungen aus der CivicTech-Szene für städtische Herausforderungen zu entwickeln wie Energieeffizienz, nachhaltige Mobilität oder Abfallmanagement.

## Unterstützung lokaler Initiativen

Unser Maker- und Coworking Space kann von lokalen Initiativen kostenlos für öffentliche Events genutzt werden, die auf technologische Lösungen für mehr Nachhaltigkeit abzielen.

## Förderung des Teilens von Ressourcen

Anstatt dass jeder einzelne Haushalt oder kleinere und mittlere Unternehmen teure Werkzeuge oder Maschinen kaufen muss, ermöglichen diese Räume das Teilen von Ressourcen, was zur Reduzierung des Gesamtressourcenverbrauchs beiträgt.

## Plattform für lokale nachhaltige Startups

Der Digital Hub bietet einen Raum, in dem Startups, die sich auf technologisch-nachhaltige Produkte oder innovative Dienstleistungen konzentrieren, in ihrem Entwicklungsprozess unterstützt werden.

# Reduktion von Lebensmittelverschwendung

Verein
foodsharing Münster

Website
www.foodsharing.de

Ansprechperson
Anton Ballmaier

# foodsharing Münster:

Gemeinsam gegen Lebensmittelverschwendung: Mindestens ein Drittel aller produzierten Lebensmittel wird nie gegessen, sondern landet im Müll. Damit einher geht eine enorme Ressourcenverschwendung, die wir uns in Zeiten globaler Ungerechtigkeiten und des Klimawandels nicht erlauben dürfen. Die Lebensmittelverschwendung zu reduzieren, ist laut Expert*innen einer der wichtigsten Beiträge zum Klimaschutz (Quelle: https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions).

Als engagierte Initiative in Münster setzen wir uns von foodsharing aktiv und direkt für die Reduktion der Lebensmittelverschwendung ein. Mit unserem Netzwerk von Foodsaver*innen und Fairteilern tragen wir dazu bei, dass Lebensmittel, die sonst im Müll landen würden, sinnvoll genutzt werden. In den vergangenen 10 Jahren seit der Gründung foodsharings in Münster haben wir diesbezüglich schon viel erreicht, aber müssen – auch unter Mithilfe der Stadt – noch viel mehr ins Rollen bringen. So heißt es in den Sustainable Development Goals der Vereinten Nationen im Ziel 12.3, „bis 2030 die Lebensmittelverluste zu halbieren und die Lebensmittelabfälle zu reduzieren.“ Ein Ziel, zu dessen Erreichen sich noch vieles verändern muss.

# Mehr gerettete, weniger entsorgte Lebensmittel:

Lokal engagieren sich bei foodsharing Münster ca. 300 Foodsaver*innen, in dem sie regelmäßig Lebensmittel in unseren Kooperationsbetrieben vor der Tonne retten. Mit einem wachsenden Bewusstsein und hoffentlich auch von der Politik gesetzten Anreizen, sollen mehr und mehr Betriebe ihre Lebensmittelüberschüsse spenden, statt zu entsorgen – gerne an die Tafeln oder foodsharing, die diese Lebensmittel weiterverteilen. Die Zweitverwertung aufwendig produzierter und verarbeiteter Lebensmittel als

Futtermittel oder Biogas darf nur noch als Notlösung gegenüber dem Verzehr durch Menschen gesehen werden.

# Fairteiler in allen Stadtteilen:

Fairteiler sind Regale und Kühlschränke an öffentlichen Orten, die Alle nutzen können, um überschüssige Lebensmittel einfach zugänglich zu machen. Solche Fairteiler müssen in allen Stadtteilen flächendeckend aufgebaut und beworben werden. Öffentliche und städtische Gebäude wären optimal. Es muss eine Selbstverständlichkeit für alle werden, Überschüsse zu verschenken, statt zu entsorgen. Projekte müssen gefördert werden, die eine bessere Verteilung von Lebensmitteln in der Nachbarschaft ermöglichen, um Haushaltsabfälle zu reduzieren.

# Bildungsangebote:

Auch im Bereich Ernährung und Lebensmittelverschwendung ist Bildung essenziell, um die Situation zu verbessern. Workshops in Kindergärten und Schulen sowie für den Umgang mit Lebensmitteln im Haushalt oder im Gastrobereich sollten flächendeckend angeboten werden. Organisationen wie foodsharing oder die fairTEilBAR, die solche Angebote schon jetzt umsetzen, brauchen dafür finanzielle Unterstützung.

# Politische Anreize:

Allzu oft lohnt sich momentan die Überproduktion von Lebensmitteln aus wirtschaftlicher Sicht. Es müssen Anreize gesetzt werden, um die Lebensmittelverschwendung unattraktiv zu machen. So könnten beispielsweise die Gebühren der Biomüllentsorgung von Lebensmittelbetrieben erhöht, und die zusätzlichen Einnahmen zur Subventionierung (pflanzlicher) Grundnahrungsmittel genutzt werden.

# Unterstützung von Entsiegelungsprojekten

Verein
Grün statt Grau e.V.

Ansprechperson
Christine Langkamp

Die Stadt Münster hat bisher weder ein flächendeckendes Konzept für Entsiegelungsmaßnahmen und naturbasierte Lösungen zur Anpassung an den Klimawandel, noch ist die Sensibilisierung und die aktive Einbindung der Stadtbevölkerung in die Thematik ausreichend. Der Verein Grün statt Grau e. V. möchte daher unterschiedliche Akteur*innen zusammenbringen und innovative Bürger*innenbeteiligung ermöglichen, um Flächen für Entsiegelungs- und anschließende Begrünungsmaßnahmen zu identifizieren. Mit der Umsetzung soll die Adaptionsfähigkeit an Hitzewellen, Starkregen und urbane Sturzfluten erhöht, die Biodiversität im urbanen Raum und die CO₂-Aufnahmekapazität von Boden und Pflanzen verbessert und zudem positive Wirkungen auf das Mikroklima sowie die Gesundheit und dass Mobilitätsverhalten der Bürger*innen erzielt werden. Teil des Prozesses sind eine breite Öffentlichkeitskampagne und ein Ideen-Wettbewerb, in dem die Bevölkerung aufgerufen wird, Orte in ihrer Nachbarschaft für Entsiegelung vorzuschlagen. Aus den Einreichungen wählt eine interdisziplinäre Jury aus Stadtverwaltung, Wissenschaft und Praktiker*innen – anhand von ihnen im Projekt zu entwickelnden ökologischen, sozialen und ökonomischen Kriterien – die am besten geeigneten Orte aus. Als Ergebnis des Projekts entsteht ein Leitfaden zu Bürger*innenbeteiligung und klimagerechter Stadtentwicklung mit dem Fokus auf Entsiegelung als eine Möglichkeit zur Klimaanpassung und Aufwertung des urbanen Raums, die auf andere Kommunen übertragbar ist.

# Fahrradfahren lernen für und von Frauen

Verein
Move and Meet e. V.

Ansprechperson
Laura Verweyen

![img-96.jpeg](img-96.jpeg)

![img-97.jpeg](img-97.jpeg)

Das Projekt „Bike and Meet“ läuft seit Sommer 2022. Es wird vom Verein Move and Meet e. V. geleitet und in Kooperation mit der AWO/Stadtteilbüro Coerde und dem Verein Bike Bridge e. V. durchgeführt. Das Projekt umfasst:

2 bis 3 Anfängerinnen-Fahrradkurse für Frauen pro Jahr (über je 10 Termine - ein Termin pro Woche à 2 h; 10 bis 12 TN/Kurs, 4 bis 6 Trainerinnen pro Kurs),
eine Einweisung in die Straßenverkehrsordnung pro Kurs (ab 2024 durch die Polizei Münster),
ein Reparaturworkshop pro Kurs,
zwei bis drei Schulungen zu Fahrradtrainerinnen pro Jahr,
Einbindung in Freizeit- und Begegnungsangebote des Vereins Move and Meet wie Fahrradtouren etc.
Kommunikation des Projektes in die Communities über Netzwerk-, Gremien- und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit

„Bike and Meet“ möchte v. a. Frauen mit Migrations- oder Fluchterfahrung dabei unterstützen, das Fahrradfahren zu erlernen und/oder sich selbst (im Anschluss) als Trainerinnen oder Trainerinnenassistentinnen zu engagieren. Die Freude am Fahrradfahren soll vermittelt und mehr Selbständigkeit in Alltag und in der Freizeit ermöglicht werden.

Erfolgreiche Kursteilnehmerinnen werden durch eine Schulung dabei unterstützt, im Anschluss selbst als Fahrradtrainerinnen im Projekt tätig zu werden. Ziel ist es, dass die Teilnehmerinnen zu aktiven Gestalterinnen ihres physischen und psychischen Wohlbefindens werden. Durch das Radfahren werden die Frauen ein Teil der Münsteraner Gesellschaft und erobern den öffentlichen Raum. Sie erleben Selbstwirksamkeit, u.a. durch das Reparieren ihrer eigenen Räder und der ihrer Kinder. Sie erweitern ihren sozialen und räumlichen Radius und lernen Münster und ihre direkte Lebensumgebung durch Radtouren kennen (Wege, StVO). Als Trainerinnen geben sie ihr erworbenes Können und Wissen weiter, sie sind Gestalterinnen von Kursen und Vorbilder für die Teilnehmerinnen und ihre Kinder.

„Bike and Meet“ fokussiert unter anderem das Thema der gendergerechten Mobilität und der Mobilitätsarmut vulnerabler Gruppen, denn: Frauen jeden Alters und unterschiedlichster Herkunftsländer, Religionen und Religiosität nutzen das Fahrrad nicht gleichermaßen wie Männer. Bei Frauen mit niedrigem ökonomischem Status und generell bei Frauen ab dem jungen bis ins mittlere Erwachsenenalter zeigt sich die Mobilitätsarmut (unter anderem in Bezug auf das Fahrrad) in besonderem Maße (MiD 2017: 51). Um Frauen Mobilität und die damit verbundene Selbstwirksamkeit, Unabhängigkeit und Erleichterung des Alltags zu gewährleisten, ist es eine zentrale gesellschaftliche Aufgabe, Frauen eine niedrigschwellige und auf ihre Bedarfe angepasste Möglichkeit zu bieten, das Fahrrad als kostengünstiges (und

nachhaltiges) Transport- und Freizeitmittel nutzen zu können. Nur auf diese Weise können ungleiche Voraussetzungen und fehlende Zugangsmöglichkeiten zur Mobilität ausgeglichen werden und Teilhabe gewährleistet werden (SDG 5 und SDG 10).

Durch die Steigerung der eigenständigen Mobilität der Frauen erfolgt eine Verlagerung von Bus- und Autofahrten auf das nachhaltige Transportmittel des Fahrrads. Regelmäßige Reparaturworkshops stellen sicher, dass die Teilnehmerinnen ihre Räder selbst reparieren können. Auch werden die Teilnehmerinnen auf den kostengünstigen und nachhaltigen Erwerb gebrauchter Räder bei Fahrradflohmärkten oder bei einem befreundeten Verein verwiesen. Die in unserem Projekt genutzten Räder sind zum Teil neue, zum Teil gebrauchte und gespendete Räder, die von einem Engagierten auf ehrenamtlicher Basis regelmäßig gewartet werden, damit sie langfristig genutzt werden können (SDG 12 und SDG 13).

Das Projekt „Bike and Meet“ wurde 2022 und 2023 mit verschiedenen Preisen ausgezeichnet: mit dem WestfalenBeweger 2022/2023 der Stiftung Westfalen Initiative, mit dem Aktivpreis der Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung in 2023 und mit dem Mobilitätspreis Münster 2023.

# Psychologische Beratung zur Transformation

Verein
Psychologists4Future

Ansprechperson
Anna Hessel

Um das gesetzte Ziel der Klimaneutralität zu erreichen, wird es eine unangenehme, aber notwendige Anstrengung aller Beteiligten brauchen. Der gewählte Titel „weil es uns alle braucht“ macht das deutlich. Wir sehen dabei vor allem die Kommunalpolitik in der Aufgabe, Unternehmen für klimafreundliches Handeln in die Pflicht zu nehmen und individuellen Bürger*innen klimafreundliches Handeln durch klimafreundliche Infrastruktur und Anreize zu erleichtern und ermöglichen. Wir bringen uns aus psychologischer Sicht in diese Transformation ein und steuern aus dieser Perspektive folgende Gedanken bei: Um zu erreichen, dass die äußerst herausfordernden, unangenehmen und dennoch notwendigen Veränderungen von der Breite der Bevölkerung unterstützt werden, braucht es psychologisch fachlich gut fundierte Beratung und Ausrichtung. Die Stadt benötigt ein Konzept, um konstruktiv mit Vermeidungs- und Abwehrmechanismen umzugehen. Dazu gehört öffentliche Kommunikation, die politische Informiertheit und freien Meinungsaustausch garantiert und Verzögerungsdiskurse, Manipulation und Fehlinformationen verhindert. An diesen Punkt möchten wir ansetzen und stellen dafür gerne unser Netzwerk zur Verfügung, um der Kommunalpolitik fachliche Beratung anzubieten, wie sie die nötigen Veränderungen intern und extern anregen, fördern und kommunizieren kann.

Die Stadtverwaltung sollte gleichzeitig die katastrophalen Folgen von Untätigkeit ehrlich kommunizieren und die Vorteile und Chancen einer klimafreundlichen Umgestaltung der Gesellschaft betonen.

# Durchführung von KlimaTrainings

Initiative
KlimaTrainer*innen der Stadt Münster

Ansprechperson

![img-98.jpeg](img-98.jpeg)

Der Klimaschutz ist eine gesellschaftliche Aufgabe, für die jede*r Einzelne Verantwortung trägt und zu der alle einen Beitrag leisten können und müssen. Viele Bürger*innen möchten nachhaltiger leben, deshalb ist es so wichtig, dies bestenfalls allen Menschen zu ermöglichen. Oftmals fehlt im persönlichen Umfeld der Impuls oder eine konkrete Strategie, um vom Wollen ins Handeln zu kommen. Das ist jedoch zwingend notwendig, um Klimaschutz auch im persönlichen Alltag umsetzen zu können.

Das Klimatraining zielt darauf ab, den Teilnehmer*innen auf einfachem Wege die Möglichkeit zu eröffnen, Klimaschutz in die persönlichen Entscheidungen des Alltags zu integrieren. In Kleingruppen, die durch Klimatrainer*innen begleitet werden, definieren die Teilnehmer*innen in unterschiedlichen Themenfeldern des Alltagslebens ihre persönlichen Ziele, die sie im Rahmen des KlimaTrainings erreichen möchten. Das führt zu einer erhöhten intrinsischen Motivation, diese Ziele auch zu erreichen.

Ziele der Teilnehmer*innen sind zum Beispiel, das eigene Auto abzuschaffen und auf klimafreundlichere Mobilität umzusteigen, Energie einzusparen oder nachhaltiger zu konsumieren. Im Austausch mit der Kleingruppe und den Klimatrainer*innen werden konkrete Maßnahmen entwickelt, mit denen die jeweiligen persönlichen Ziele erreicht werden können. Im Rahmen einer „Ausprobierphase“ werden Angebote und Hilfsmittel vorgestellt, die bei der Zielerreichung unterstützend wirken können. Dabei können die Teilnehmer*innen zum Beispiel die Carsharing- und Lastenrad-Angebote in Münster ausprobieren, eine Energieberatung in Anspruch nehmen, an veganen Koch- und Backkursen teilnehmen, gemeinsam Kleidungsstücke oder Elektrogeräte reparieren oder bei einer Führung über den Deponie-Erlebnispfad der Abfallwirtschaftsbetriebe Münster (awm) mehr über Abfall- und Kreislaufwirtschaft erfahren.

Durch eine enge Vernetzung der Gruppe und eine gezielte Reflexion der Erfolge bei der persönlichen Zielerreichung soll die Motivation, Klimaschutzmaßnahmen in den Alltag zu integrieren, auch über das KlimaTraining hinaus aufrechterhalten werden. Gerade der persönliche Austausch in der Gruppe wird bei jedem KlimaTraining als besonders wertvoll wahrgenommen.

Die Aufgabe der ehrenamtlich bei der Stadt beschäftigten KlimaTrainer*innen besteht vorrangig darin, die Teilnehmer*innen im Prozess zu begleiten und zu motivieren. Darüber hinaus bieten sie wertvolle Alltagstipps und Hilfestellungen.

Das Bündnis KlimaEntscheid Münster hat den Ratsbeschluss vom August 2020 zur Klimaneutralität 2030 vorbereitet: https://muenster-klima.info/2020/08/19/160/. Das Bündnis besteht aus 40 aktiven Klima- und Umweltgruppen der Stadt. Alle Stellungnahmen und Beschlüsse werden mit diesen Gruppen gemeinsam geschrieben und abgestimmt. Wir begleiten den Prozess der Umsetzung des Ratsbeschlusses von 2020 seitdem kritisch. Wir halten fest, dass er immer noch nicht umgesetzt wird. Unsere zuletzt verfasste Stellungnahme dazu findet sich unter https://muenster-klima.info/2023/06/15/muenster-wird-klimastadt/. Die aktuellen Zahlen der Energie- und Treibhausgasbilanz der Stadt Münster zeigen, dass mit den derzeitigen Maßnahmen die Stadt erst 2090 klimaneutral würde. (vgl https://www.klimabeirat-muenster.de/pressemitteilungen/). Wir erwarten deshalb, dass die Kommune im Bereich Umweltschutz ihre Aufgaben erfüllt sowie einen konkreten Plan entwickelt, der dem Klimaschutz den legitimen Rahmen gibt. Nur durch wirksames politisches Handeln kann der Energie-, Flächen- und Ressourcenverbrauch auf Dauer reduziert werden. Dazu möchten wir die Politik ermutigen. Als Bürgergruppen können wir das alleine nicht durchsetzen. Wir treffen uns alle 14 Tage (zumeist online). Wir freuen uns auf Menschen, die sich beteiligen wollen.

# Einsatz für urbane Begrünung

Initiative
Platanenpower

Ansprechperson
Dorothee Speich

Hiermit bitten wir, die Nachbarschaftsinitiative Platanenpower, das Grundstück an der Wolbecker Straße 140 (frühere Aral Tankstelle) zu entsiegeln und dort einen Tiny Forest nach der Methode von Akira Miyazaki anzulegen. 2019 rief die Stadt Münster den Klimanotstand aus und setzte sich zum Ziel bis 2030 Klimaneutralität zu erreichen. Die Stadt ging damit eine Selbstverpflichtung ein, in Zukunft bei allen Entscheidungen den Klimaschutz stärker zu berücksichtigen. Jetzt steht eine Entscheidung an, wie dieses Grundstück weiter genutzt wird. Hier an diesem Grundstück kann die Stadt Münster deutlich machen, wie ernst sie ihrer Verpflichtung nachkommen wollen. In einem Beschluss des Ausschusses für Umwelt, Klima und Bauen Anfang 2021 haben die Fraktionen für neue Baugebiete festgelegt, dass Vorgarten grundsätzlich als bepflanzte Fläche zu gestalten sind. Die Stadt Münster hielt fest, dass die klimatischen Unterschiede zwischen grünen Vorgarten und versiegelter Fläche/Schotter kein subjektives Empfinden, sondern auch Ergebnis einer Modelluntersuchung des Landes Hessen ist. Tagsüber lagen hierbei auf Schotterflächen die Temperaturen meist um 10 Grad höher als über der Pflanzfläche. Jetzt hat die Stadt Münster eine großartige Gelegenheit ihr Engagement und die Ernsthaftigkeit für den Klimaschutz zu beweisen. Es geht nicht um einen Vorgarten, es geht um eine Fläche von über 600 qm. Gerade dort gibt es ein sehr hohes Verkehrsaufkommen, eine dichte Besiedlung / Versiegelung. Wir bitten darum, dass die Stadt Münster den Mut hat, wie auch andere Städte, zum Beispiel Herford oder Almere in den Niederlanden, genau dort wo man aus dem Grundstück viel Profit erzielen könnte, den Bewohnenden eine kleine,

ökologisch wichtige Oase zu geben. Nein, keine fünf Stadtbäume für je 2.000 €, sondern eine Fläche, die nach der Anlage und zwei bis drei Jahren leichter Pflege keine weiteren laufenden Kosten erzeugt. Wir benötigen innerhalb der Stadt Flächen für Grün und Lebensqualität, keine Ausgleichsflächen. Hier könnte etwas bislang Neues entstehen, dass die Lebensqualität, dem Klimaschutz, der biologischen Vielfalt, der Luftreinhaltung und dem Gewässerschutz zuträglich ist. 2019 hat der Rat die Stadt Münster verpflichtet, sich regelmäßig mit den Auswirkungen und Folgen der CO₂-Emissionen zu befassen, und sich über die Maßnahmen zur Verringerung informieren zu lassen. Daher fordern wir die Stadt Münster auf jetzt uns Bürgern und Bürgerinnen der Stadt Münster anhand dieses Grundstückes zu zeigen, wie ernsthaft und ehrlich Sie der Verpflichtung nach dem Ausruf des Klimanotstandes 2019 nachkommen. Bislang nimmt Münster mit der stärksten Flächenbodenversiegelung in NRW den schlechten vierten Platz* ein. Es wäre jetzt ein guter Zeitpunkt damit zu beginnen, das gesteckte Ziel Klimaneutralität 2030 anzugehen.

Unsere persönlichen Beiträge zur Umsetzung des Vorhabens sind folgende:

Wir nehmen am 7. März 2024 an einer Schulung der Natur- und Umweltschutzakademie NRW, Recklinghausen teil. Thema:
„Urbane Wälder – Tiny Forests, Chancen und Grenzen von Miniwäldern in Städten“
Ziel: Durch die Fortbildung wollen wir uns in die Lage versetzen, das Konzept in Münster bekannt zu machen und dafür zu werben.

Wir, die Students for Future Münster, setzen uns seit vielen Jahren für Klimagerechtigkeit auf lokaler- und Hochschulebene ein. Im Klimastadt-Vertrag wollen wir uns dazu verpflichten, die Umsetzung des Ratsbeschlusses zur Klimaneutralität bis 2030 der Stadt Münster weiterhin einzufordern. Auch wenn jede*r Bürger*in gefragt ist, ihren oder seinen Beitrag für mehr Klimaschutz zu leisten, darf dies nicht darüber hinwegtäuschen, dass die Politik die dringend notwendigen Rahmenbedingungen dazu schaffen muss. Wir nehmen den 2019 ausgerufenen Klimanotstand ernst und erwarten von politischen Entscheidungsträger*innen, die Klimakrise als solche zu behandeln. Deshalb sehen wir es als unsere Aufgabe, die Politiker*innen an ihre Verantwortung auf dem Weg zu einem lebenswerten, klimaneutralen Münster zu erinnern. Dies wollen wir durch unsere Beteiligung am KlimaEntscheid, Demonstrationen sowie den Dialog mit der Stadt weiterhin aktiv umsetzen.

# Klimafreundliche Lebensweise

Bürger
Manfred Josef Berlin

Wir sind als Homo sapiens, wie alle wissen, zu weit gegangen. Also müssen wir richtig auf die Bremse treten: Verzicht ist das Zauberwort! Ich bin Naturschützer seit 1980!

Was habe ich gemacht: Als 1. habe ich mein Auto verschenkt und ein Fahrrad gekauft 2. bin ich aus der Kirche ausgetreten 3. bin ich Vegetarier (ovo-lakto) geworden 4. Habe ich die Grünen mit aufgebaut (Im Ökoländbau gejobt) 5. Permakultur gelernt 6. Nichtraucher geworden usw. Heute als Rentner, lebe ich auf 35 m² mein Stromverbrauch beträgt ca: 850 kWh und ich heize nie: „Mittelwohnung"!

Sport: Tischtennis (Mo.) zusätzlich radele ich in die Stadt zum Bioladen. Heute, bei 10 Grad Celsius, sehe ich wie seit Jahren, etliche Läden die Türen sperrangelweit aufhaben und die Fußgängerzone mit heizen!? Was ich tun kann, tue ich.

# Bewusster Holzverbrauch

Bürgerin
Monique Eberhardt

![img-99.jpeg](img-99.jpeg)

Ich verbrauche wenig(er) Holz und will einen Forst zum Naturwald werden lassen. Ich kaufe bevorzugt gebrauchte Möbel aus Holz, nutze ein Reise-Bidet sowie recyceltes Toiletten- und Schreibpapier. Formulare fülle ich gerne online aus und erhalte die Lohn-abrechnungen digital. Ich versuche Transport-Kartons wiederzuverwenden oder zu vermeiden. So müssen weniger Bäume gefällt werden und Kohlenstoff in ihrer Biomasse und unter ihnen im Boden bleibt gespeichert. Von Holzplantage zum lebendigem Wald. In Zukunft möchte ich einen Forst kaufen und ihn auch über meinem Tod hinaus naturnah absichern lassen (nur spazieren, Pilze &amp; Beeren &amp; Kräuter sammeln, Survival-Wochenende und Waldbaden), sodass sich langsam ein Naturwald mit vielen Tonnen CO₂ in Stämmen, Totholz und Boden entwickeln kann.

# Nachhaltigkeit mit System für Zuhause und darüber hinaus

Ein ausgearbeiteter Plan hilft mir mein eigenes zu Hause (und das jedes anderen motivierten Bürgers und jeder anderen motivierten Bürgerin, egal ob gemietet oder im Eigentum) klimaneutral und nachhaltig zu gestalten. Basierend auf den 17 Nachhaltigkeitszielen der UN fokussiere ich mich auf das Machbare, gestalte Strategien und Aktionen, messen deren Erfolg und begebe mich Schritt für Schritt in eine nachhaltige Zukunft.

Für die Umsetzung der Strategie sammeln wir umfangreiche Daten zum Beispiel aus dem Bereich Strom- und Gasverbrauch und bereiten sie mit Hilfe eines Dashboards auf. Die Methode entstammt internationaler Industriemaßstäbe und wird von Firmen auf der ganzen Welt als Managementtool angewandt. Als ein Beispiel möchte ich das Ziel „Bezahlbare, saubere Energie“ herausgreifen.

Als Familie haben wir das für uns auf das konkrete Ziel der Solarenergie mit Speicherung in Form von Wasserstoff und Salzbatterien heruntergebrochen. Die Strategie für unseren Haushalt heißt also „Elektrifizierung“.

Erste Maßnahme war die Umstellung auf einen Öko-Strom Vertrag.

Zweite Maßnahme war die Installation von Infrarotheizpaneelen. Wir sind bei der Heizung also mittlerweile weg vom Gas. Die Entwicklung dazu können Sie im „Dashboard Energie“ im Anhang sehen.

# Leben ohne Auto

Bürgerin
Eva Schröder

Permanent klimabewusst leben und auch andere motivieren durch:

Nutzung von Ökostrom und Heizen mit Wärmepumpe und Solarthermie
vegetarische Ernährung und möglichst biologisch und regional
Spenden an Umweltorganisationen wie NABU oder Greenpeace
selbst aktiv werden mittels Biotoppflege und schattenspendendem biodiversem Garten
Müllpate in der unmittelbaren Umgebung (in Zusammenarbeit mit der awm)
Einsatz einer eigenen Solaranlage und als Solarbotschafter
Autofahren auf ein Minimum reduzieren sowie die selbstgesteckte Höchstgeschwindigkeit nicht überschreiten
Kurzstrecken möglichst mit dem Fahrrad zurücklegen
lieber ein hochwertiges Teil anschaffen, das sich lohnt, repariert zu werden, als viele billige Produkte erwerben

Meine Familie und ich haben aus Überzeugung kein eigenes Auto und bewegen uns nur per Fahrrad oder Lastenrad. Nur wenn es absolut notwendig ist nutzen wir den öffentlichen Personennahverkehr.

# Unterstützung Klimastadt-Prozess

Bürger
Michael Tillmann

Als Bürger der Stadt Münster, der sich seit ca. 10 Jahren im lokalen Klimaschutz und in der Klimabewegung mit dem Schwerpunkt Klimakommunikation engagiert, habe ich den Klimastadt-Prozess in unterschiedlicher Weise unterstützt und kritisch begleitet: durch meine Mitarbeit im Klimabeirat der Stadt, durch die Organisation zweier Veranstaltungen im Rahmen der „Münsteraner Klimagespräche“ mit direktem Bezug auf das Ziel „Klimaneutralität 2030“ (u. a. unter Beteiligung von Gästen aus den EU-Mission-Städten Aachen und Mannheim) sowie mehreren Kolumnen im Online-Magazin RUMS. Weil meiner Meinung nach für den Klimastadt-Prozess ein ausformulierter „Münster-Klima-Konsens“, der von breiten Teilen der Stadtgesellschaft getragen wird, nicht nur wünschenswert, sondern eigentlich auch notwendig ist, habe ich einen solchen Klimakonsens skizziert und ihm die Form einer möglichen bzw. denkbaren Präambel zum Klimastadtvertrag gegeben (veröffentlicht in der RUMS-Ausgabe vom 17.09.2023). Trotz vieler zustimmender Bekundungen, u. a. auf dem städtischen Klima-Barcamp am 27.10.2023 setze ich mich dafür ein, dass die Diskussion um einen bürgerschaftlichen Klimakonsens fortgeführt wird. Der u. a. Text ist dafür vielleicht hilfreich.

Wir in Münster sehen in den gegenwärtigen Klimaveränderungen die stärkste Bedrohung für die Zukunft unserer Kinder und Enkel und für das Zusammenleben der Menschen auf unserem Planeten in Frieden und Gerechtigkeit. Wir erkennen in den Waldbränden, den Überflutungen, den Dürren und Hitzerekorden der Gegenwart die Vorboten einer sich schleichend verstärkenden Klimakatastrophe. Wir in Münster bekennen uns zu dem grundgesetzlichen Auftrag des Staates und der Gesellschaft, in Verantwortung für die künftigen Generationen die natürlichen

Lebensgrundlagen zu schützen (Artikel 20a). Dies umfasst auch die völkerrechtliche Verpflichtung aus dem Pariser Klimaabkommens, angemessen dazu beizutragen, die Erderwärmung auf deutlich unter 2 Grad, möglichst unter 1,5 Grad zu begrenzen. Wir in Münster wissen, dass Deutschland derzeit für etwa zwei Prozent der weltweiten Treibhausgasemissionen verantwortlich ist, wir aber nur ein Prozent der Weltbevölkerung stellen. Uns ist auch bewusst, dass die klimabedingten Extremwetterereignisse der Gegenwart zu fünf Prozent auf die von Deutschland im vergangenen Jahrhundert ausgestoßenen Treibhausgase zurückzuführen sind. Wir in Münster erkennen an, dass allen Menschen dieser Erde nur das gleiche Recht auf Belastung der Erdatmosphäre zusteht. Daraus ergibt sich für uns, dass wir in den kommenden Jahren nur noch eine begrenzte Menge an Treibhausgasen ausstoßen dürfen, ein $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Restbudget, das mit den Pariser Klimazielen vereinbar ist. Die Aussagen des Weltklimarates sowie des deutschen Sachverständigenrates für Umweltfragen betrachten wir dafür als maßgebend. Diese anteilig auf Münster zu übertragen ist das, was fairerweise von uns erwartet werden kann. Wir in Münster wissen, dass uns für eine entschiedene Abkehr von Kohle, Öl und Gas nur noch ein kleines Zeitfenster bleibt und dass ein Überschreiten von Kipppunkten die Folgen des Klimawandels vollends unbeherrschbar machen werden. Wir streben deshalb an, für die Bereiche, die wir in alleiniger Verantwortung gestalten können, bis zum Jahr 2030 Klimaneutralität zu erreichen. Wir setzen darauf, dass uns technischer Fortschritt dabei hilft. Aber uns ist gleichzeitig klar, dass es zusätzlich eine Kultur der Selbstbeschränkung und ein anderes Verständnis von Wohlstand und Freiheit braucht. Wir akzeptieren und wünschen, dass Politik und Verwaltung durch entsprechende Regeln ressourcen- und klimaschonende Lebensstile fördern. Wir in Münster

möchten, dass unser gemeinsames Eintreten für die Zukunft unserer Kinder und künftiger Generationen den Zusammenhalt in Münster stärkt und unser Gemeinwesen nicht spaltet. Wir erkennen an, dass unter dem Gesichtspunkt der sozialen Gerechtigkeit nicht alle das gleiche Maß an Verantwortung tragen. Höherer materieller Wohlstand geht im Allgemeinen mit einem höheren Ressourcenverbrauch und einer größeren Klimabelastung einher. Das begründet eine besondere Verantwortung der besser Situierten in unserer Stadt. Wir in Münster trauen uns zu, den existenziellen Bedrohungen durch den Klimawandel ins Auge zu sehen. Unser Wissen um die Gefahren verpflichtet uns zu beherzten Taten. Wir machen unser Eintreten für mehr Klimaverantwortung nicht abhängig davon, ob oder dass auch andere Staaten oder Kommunen sich ähnlich dem Klimaschutz verpflichtet fühlen und entsprechend handeln. Nicht zuletzt ist das für uns auch eine Frage der Selbstachtung.

# Machbarkeitsstudie Vollversorgung mit Solarenergie

Bürger

Jochen Witt

![img-101.jpeg](img-101.jpeg)

## Projekt-Ziel

Erstellung einer ersten Machbarkeitsstudie, ob der Endenergiebedarf von Münster vollständig mit Solarenergie kompensiert werden kann, die in der Region von Münsters tunesischer Partnerstadt Monastir, resp. Nordafrika/Arabische Halbinsel, geerntet und über stoffliche Umwandlungsprozesse (siehe Abbildung) nach Münster transportiert wird. Geprüft werden sollen technische, logistische und wirtschaftliche Aspekte. Mein Beitrag besteht darin, die lokal vorhandene Expertise aus Wissenschaft, Industrie, Verwaltung und Zivilgesellschaft einzuholen und zusammenzuführen.

Im Folgenden beschreibe ich mein geplantes Vorgehen. Die [#] sind dabei nicht als Quellenhinweise zu verstehen, sondern beziehen sich auf meine Annahmen und Vorschläge und sollen eine Diskussion im Falle einer Kontaktaufnahme erleichtern (siehe unten).

Zunächst soll der Bedarf analysiert werden, der sich meinen Berechnungen zufolge wie folgt darstellt: Münster hat zur Zeit einen jährlichen Endenergiebedarf von 6.156 GWh [#1]. Dies entspricht etwa der Energiemenge, die ein ⅔ Atomkraftwerk liefert [#2]. Um diese Energiemenge mit Solarpanelen zu decken, bräuchte man für die Solarparks ein Drittel der

gesamten Stadtfläche [#3]. Es fehlt auch die Fläche, um diesen Energiebedarf mit Windkraftanlagen (WKA) zu decken, denn dann bräuchte man pro qkm der Stadtfläche 1 WKA mit 160 m Nabenhöhe, höher als der Kölner Dom [#4]. Missverständnisse entstehen häufig, weil die projektierten „80 % Deckung des Energiebedarfs durch Erneuerbare Energien“ sich nicht auf den Endenergiebedarf beziehen, sondern nur auf Strom – der daran einen Anteil von etwa ⅓ hat [#5]. Zu lösen ist auch das Problem, dass Sonne und Wind Variabilitäten aufweisen, die sie nicht grundlastfähig machen.

## Besonderheit des von mir vertretenen Ansatzes

Wie im beigefügten Chart skizziert, soll die Solarenergie aus dem Raum von Münsters Partnerstadt Monastir in Tunesien, resp. Nordafrika/Arabische Halbinsel, importiert werden. Dort ist die Globalstrahlung etwa $2,3 \times$ so hoch wie in Münster. [#6]. Unter den dortigen Verhältnissen kostet die Produktion von 1 kWh Solarstrom unter 1 Cent [#7].

## Weitere Spezifika

Mithilfe des Solarstroms wird aus Meerwasser hochreines Prozesswasser gewonnen [#8]. Im nächsten Schritt wird aus dem $\mathsf{H}_2\mathsf{O}$ mit Elektrolyseuren $\mathsf{H}_2$ abgeschieden [#9]. $\mathsf{H}_2$ in Verbindung mit $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ bildet Methanol, das unter normalen Umgebungsbedingungen – anders als reiner Wasserstoff – transportiert werden kann [#10]. Das Methanol kann Münster per Schiff erreichen – ggf. nach Umschlag in Rotterdam oder einem deutschen Seehafen [#11]. Bei Verbrennung des Methanols in Großanlagen der Industrie oder im Fernwärmekraftwerk zerfällt dieses rückstandsfrei in Energie, $\mathsf{H}_2\mathsf{O}$ und $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ [#12]. Das $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ wird abgeschieden [#13] und wieder zurücktransportiert „nach Monastir“ wo es erneut mit $\mathsf{H}_2$ zu Methanol verbunden wird [siehe #10]. Es entsteht ein technischer $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Kreisprozess.

Fortsetzung des Beitrags folgt hier:

Im Unterschied zu den gegenwärtig viel diskutierten Verfahren wird das CO₂ also nicht aus der Umgebungsluft bei viel geringeren Konzentrationen extrahiert, und auch nicht im Boden der Nordsee verpresst (CCS) [#14]. Die prinzipielle Notwendigkeit der Rückgewinnung von CO₂ aus der Atmosphäre ist gegenwärtig wissenschaftlicher Konsens [#15].

## Kosten

Der Wissenschaftliche Dienst des Deutschen Bundestages resümierte 2020, dass die Kosten der Gewinnung Grünen Wasserstoffs aus Nordafrika und der Transport zu einem deutschen Seehafen bis 2030 ab 9 Cent/kWh darstellbar sei [#16]. Internet-Recherche weist aus, dass die Kosten der einzelnen Steps des hier beschriebenen Verfahrens zuletzt stark fallen [#17].

## Sonstiges

Solarenergie in Monastir oder der Region zu gewinnen, und nebenbei auch Trinkwasser zu produzieren und PV-Agrikultur zu ermöglichen (i.e. Landwirtschaft und Viehzucht im Halbschatten der Solarparks), hat das Potential die dortige Gesellschaft und Ökonomie zu stabilisieren und zu einem verlässlichen Partner zu machen [#18].

## Ihre Mitwirkung

In dieser ersten Phase der Machbarkeitsstudie frage ich die lokal vorhandene Expertise aus Wissenschaft, Industrie, Verwaltung und Zivilgesellschaft ab. Beiträge zu diesem Ansatz sind willkommen! Bitte wenden Sie sich für einen ersten Kontakt an die Projekt-eMailadresse solarenergieMS@aol.com. Es ist nützlich, wenn Sie Ihren Impuls nur kurz skizzieren (max. 300 Zeichen), auf die obigen [#] Bezug nehmen, und neben Ihren Kontaktdaten auch ein, zwei Zeilen zu Ihrem Erfahrungs-Hintergrund schreiben. Vielen Dank!

# Officially adopted Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions reduction target for the future – Council Resolution on the proposal V/0770/2019, decided by majority vote

In December 2019, the City Council Münster adopted a new climate protection target. The aim is to become climate neutral by 2030 (base year 1990). The greatest challenges are to reduce the energy consumption and to speed up the energy transition by the expansion of renewable sources.

Knowing that it is a very ambitious target, the City Council added "if possible". Many actions are already undertaken and we will do our best to achieve the aim.

Please find at the following link the decision of the City Council Muenster in German that is also attached to this document:

Somit beschloss der Rat:

„I. Sachentscheidung:

Der Rat bekennt sich zu den beschlossenen Zielen, die CO₂-Emissionen mit Priorität zu senken, den Klimawandel zu stoppen und dazu, dass der Klimaschutz für die heute lebenden Generationen eine Schicksalsaufgabe darstellt (V/0482/2019).

Der Rat erkennt an, dass die Ziele des Pariser Klimaabkommens, die Erderwärmung auf möglichst 1,5 °C zu begrenzen, nur dann erreicht werden können, wenn alle Akteure auf staatlichen Ebenen und in Städten und Gemeinden ihre Anstrengungen gegenüber dem bisherigen Masterplan 100% Klimaschutz deutlich verstärken.

Der Rat stimmt dem Handlungsprogramm Klimaschutz 2030 (Anlage 1 der Vorlage V/0770/2019 = Anlage 10a der Originalniederschrift) zur Umsetzung des Masterplans 100% Klimaschutz zu. Für die Umsetzung stellt der Rat in den Jahren 2020 – 2023 Finanzmittel im Umfang von mehr als 40 Mio. EUR zusätzlich zu den bereits im Haushalt veranschlagten Positionen zur Verfügung:

zur Finanzierung des Handlungsprogramms des Masterplans 100 % Klimaschutz,
zur Förderung der energetischen Sanierung privater Gebäude (Aufstockung des bestehenden Förderprogramms),
für die energetische Sanierung städtischer Gebäude, insbes. Schulen und Bäder,
für die Errichtung von Photovoltaik-Anlagen auf Dächern städtischer Gebäude
für die Förderung von Photovoltaik-Anlagen und Batteriespeichersystemen in Privathaushalten und Gewerbebetrieben (Aufstockung des bestehenden PV-Förderprogramms)
für die Begrünung öffentlicher Plätze und Gebäude
für die Fortführung der Förderung der Lastenfahrräder, inklusiv der Schaffung von Stellplätzen in der Innenstadt
für die Anschaffung von neuen Kraftfahrzeugen mit E-Mobilität bei der Stadtverwaltung
für die Beschleunigung des ÖPNV und von Modellmaßnahmen für die Umsetzung des Masterplans 2035, um Alternativen zum motorisierten Individualverkehr zu verbessern und zum Umstieg zu motivieren
für die Schaffung eines BikeSharing Angebotes in Kooperation mit den Stadtwerken
für die Planung von Mobilitätsstationen an den Radialen (Steinfurter-, Warendorfer-, Wolbecker-, Weseler- und Hammer Straße)

Über das Handlungsprogramm hinaus bekennt sich der Rat zu dem Ziel, alsbald – möglichst bis 2030 – klimaneutral zu werden. Dazu sollen Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten ausgelotet werden, die wirtschaftlich nachhaltig und sozial ausgewogen zu einer Umsetzungsstrategie geführt werden. Der Rat beauftragt die Verwaltung deshalb,

für sämtliche mittelbaren und unmittelbaren städtischen Handlungsfelder unter Einschluss der städtischen Tochtergesellschaften Handlungsstrategien zu entwickeln, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen,
Privathaushalte und Gewerbebetriebe zu informieren und zu motivieren, ihren CO₂-Ausstoß zu senken,
dem Rat einen Plan zur CO₂-Reduktion insbesondere für die Bereiche energetische Gebäudesanierung, Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien und klimafreundliche Mobilität vorzulegen.

Die Verwaltung wird beauftragt, die im Handlungsprogramm 2030 – Teil 1 (Anlage 2 der Vorlage V/0770/2019 = Anlage 10b der Originalniederschrift) genannten Maßnahmen vorzubereiten und zeitnah in die Umsetzung zu bringen.

Sie umfassen insbesondere Aufwendungen für die Koordination und fachliche Begleitung der Maßnahmenumsetzung, inkl. gutachterliche Begleitung und entsprechender Öffentlichkeitsarbeit.

## Änderungsantrag zu EE4

grundsätzlich keine Errichtung PV Anlagen auf landwirtschaftlichen Flächen.

Außerdem soll überprüft werden, welche Möglichkeiten für die Errichtung von PV Anlagen auf Dachflächen im Außenbereich vorhanden sind. Bei der Prüfung muss es neben der Erhebung des Potentials auch um die Eruierung von möglichen Anreizen und Erleichterungen sowohl von Seiten der Stadt als auch städtischen Tochterunternehmen gehen.

## Änderungsantrag zu MOB 6

E Mobilität sollte aus regenerativer Energie gespeist werden, Prüfungsauftrag, ob regionale regenerative Energie für E Mobilität ausgebaut werden kann.

Die Verwaltung wird beauftragt, für die im Handlungsprogramm 2030 – Teil 2 (Anlage 3 der Vorlage V/0770/2019 = Anlage 10c der Originalniederschrift) genannten Maßnahmen, die Voraussetzungen für die Entscheidungen in den zuständigen Gremien zu schaffen und die entsprechenden Vorlagen zu fertigen.

Bei den Maßnahmen in Teil 2 handelt es sich um Maßnahmen mit zusätzlichen Investitions- und Personalaufwendungen, wie bspw. bei ganzheitlichen energetischen Sanierungen im Gebäudebestand oder bei Entscheidungen, die im Rahmen anderer Prozesse, wie bspw. dem Masterplan Mobilität 2035+ herbeigeführt werden.

Die Verwaltung wird beauftragt, einen Sachstandsbericht zur Umsetzung des Handlungsprogramms 2030 alle 2 Jahre vorzulegen.

Die Anregung gem. § 24 GO NRW 0043/2016 (Anlage 4 der Vorlage V/0770/2019 = Anlage 10d der Originalniederschrift) ist in die Erarbeitung des Handlungsprogramms 2030 eingeflossen und wird – soweit fachlich und finanziell möglich – bei der Umsetzung berücksichtigt und umgesetzt.

„Der Rat möge beschließen:

Beschlussvorschlag:

I. Sachentscheidung:

Ändere wie folgt:

Der Rat stimmt dem Handlungskonzept Klimaanpassung 2030 mit folgender Ergänzung zu: Im Sinne eines verbesserten Klima- und Umweltschutzes, bei dem auch der Erhalt und Schutz von Natur und Grünflächen sowie der Wasserqualität im Vordergrund steht, wird die Verwaltung zudem beauftragt:

sich selbst dazu zu verpflichten, auf städtischen Flächen auf eine Verwendung von Pestiziden zu verzichten; das gilt auch für verpachtete Flächen und beim Einsatz von Bekämpfungsmitteln gegen den Eichenprozessionsspinner
in Gesprächen mit der Landwirtschaftskammer und dem Landwirtschaftlichen Kreisverband darauf hinzuwirken, dass landwirtschaftliche Betriebe sich selbst dazu verpflichten, durchweg auf den Einsatz von Pestiziden und (chemischen) Pflanzenschutzmitteln zu verzichten.

Die Verwaltung wird beauftragt, die im Handlungskonzept Klimaanpassung 2030 (Anlage 1) beschriebenen Maßnahmen einschließlich der in Punkt 1 benannten Maßnahmen vorzubereiten und zeitnah in die Umsetzung zu bringen. Diese Maßnahmen umfassen insbesondere Informations- und Beratungsangebote, Planungsgrundsätze der Stadt- und Freiraumplanung, Regelungen des ÖPNV bei Extremwetterereignissen durch die Stadtwerke Münster GmbH sowie die Koordination und fachliche Begleitung der Maßnahmenumsetzung.

Für die im Handlungskonzept Klimaanpassung 2030 (Anlage 1) genannten Maßnahmen einschließlich der in Punkt 1 benannten Maßnahmen, die eines zusätzlichen und weiterführenden politischen Beschlusses bedürfen, wird die Verwaltung beauftragt, die Voraussetzungen für die Entscheidungen in den zuständigen Gremien vorzubereiten und zu schaffen. Dabei handelt es sich insbesondere um Maßnahmen mit zusätzlichen Investitionen in die städtische Infrastruktur, Gebäude und Gewässer, die für den Schutz der Stadtgesellschaft erforderlich sind und die u. a. mit zusätzlichen Ressourcen
