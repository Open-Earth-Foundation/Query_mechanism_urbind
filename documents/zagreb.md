# Summary

## Textual element

Zagreb is committed to becoming a leading example of urban sustainability and climate resilience by integrating climate action into every aspect of city governance. The Climate Action Plan outlines a path to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. This plan emphasizes a holistic approach that combines both mitigation and adaptation efforts, ensuring the city not only reduces its carbon footprint but also enhances its resilience to climate impacts. Through the Climate City Contract development exercise, Zagreb has recognized the full scope of efforts needed to reach climate neutrality and to integrate the resilience into the processes, highlighting the complexity of execution and the need for a coordinated, cross-sectoral approach. Taking a disruptive path, Zagreb has moved away from traditional business-as-usual models, with a bold strategy that embeds climate considerations into the core of all city operations.

## Key Elements of the Climate Action Plan are following:

Climate Goals and Commitments: Zagreb is dedicated to achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and reaching carbon neutrality by the target year, aligning with global commitments such as the Paris Agreement, surpassing national targets. This ambition reflects a comprehensive understanding of the challenges ahead, emphasizing the need for integrated mitigation and adaptation strategies that address the complex, interconnected nature of climate action.

Resilience and Adaptation: In response to increasing climate risks, including extreme weather events, flooding, and heatwaves, Zagreb's strategy integrates adaptation into urban planning and infrastructure development.

# Disruptive Approach to Governance:

Zagreb's approach to the development of the Climate City Contract is distinctly disruptive, moving away from business-as-usual practices. Unlike traditional models that often rely on a separate transition team, Zagreb has made climate action a shared responsibility across all city officials. There is no specific transition team in place; instead, all main city officials are required to incorporate climate-related issues into their agendas and daily operations. This approach ensures that climate action is not siloed but embedded into every decision and process. Notably, the Mayor of Zagreb serves as the Chief Climate Officer, underscoring the city's commitment to making climate action a top priority at the highest level of leadership.

# Mainstreaming Climate Action Across All City Processes:

The Climate City Contract exercise revealed the importance of embedding climate considerations into all city functions, ensuring that the city's approach is comprehensive and cohesive:

Integration into Urban Planning and Zoning: Climate resilience and sustainability are already embedded into urban planning, zoning, and land use regulations up to certain level, but more will be done in future iterations. This ensures that all developments align with the city's combined mitigation and adaptation goals, such as promoting low-carbon transport, energy-efficient buildings, and expanding green spaces to enhance urban cooling and flood management.
Climate-Oriented Public Procurement: The will revise procurement policies to prioritize climate-friendly and resilient solutions, integrating both mitigation and adaptation considerations. By selecting low-emission vehicles, renewable energy systems, and resilient construction materials, Zagreb supports its broader climate strategy through every purchase.
Incorporating Climate Risk into Budgeting and Financial Planning: Mainstreaming climate action involves integrating climate risk assessments into budgeting and financial planning processes. This ensures that financial decisions align with the city's combined mitigation and

Action Plan

adaptation objectives, creating a unified approach to addressing the complexity of climate challenges.

Establishing Climate Action as a Cross-Cutting Priority: A dedicated climate task force will oversee the integration of climate considerations across all city departments, fostering collaboration and ensuring that every policy, program, and project is evaluated for its climate impact and contribution to both mitigation and adaptation goals, maximizing overall effectiveness.

Policy and Regulatory Adjustments: To support the combined approach of mitigation and adaptation, Zagreb is revising its policy and regulatory frameworks. This includes mandating green building standards that not only reduce energy use but also improve resilience to extreme weather, and updating zoning laws to promote climate-smart land use, fully implementing the climate proofing and monetisation aspects. The Climate City Contract has been instrumental in identifying these necessary policy shifts, underscoring the need for regulatory flexibility and innovation.

## Enhanced Cooperation with Stakeholders:

National Ministries: Zagreb's climate strategy involves close collaboration with national ministries, such as the Ministry of Green transition, Ministry of economy, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of transport, Ministry of regional development and EU funds and others to ensure local efforts are supported by national policies and resources. The Climate City Contract process highlighted the critical need for this alignment, enabling cohesive action across governance levels.
Private Sector Engagement: The private sector plays a pivotal role in driving both emissions reductions and resilience-building. Through partnerships, incentives, and collaboration platforms, Zagreb aims to disrupt traditional business models and advance both mitigation and adaptation, as recognized in the comprehensive scope outlined by the Climate City Contract action plan.
Citizen and Community Participation: Engaging citizens is central to Zagreb's climate action strategy. The city will actively involve residents in
Climate Neutrality
Action Plan

climate initiatives through education, outreach, and participatory processes, ensuring that the community understands and supports both mitigation efforts and adaptation measures. The Climate City Contract emphasized the importance of this inclusive approach, recognizing the role of citizens in the city's climate journey.

Innovation and Technology: Leveraging innovative technologies that address both mitigation and adaptation needs is a key aspect of Zagreb's strategy. The Climate City Contract process identified opportunities for smart city initiatives, green infrastructure, and advanced energy systems, which are critical to addressing the complexity of achieving climate neutrality.

Social Equity and Inclusion: Ensuring a just transition is fundamental to Zagreb's climate strategy. By focusing on inclusive policies that address social disparities and create opportunities in the green economy, the city aims to ensure that all residents benefit from combined mitigation and adaptation efforts. The Climate City Contract highlighted the need for these efforts to be equitable and inclusive, ensuring that no one is left behind.

Scaling Up Successful Initiatives: To maximize impact, Zagreb will expand successful pilot projects that integrate mitigation and adaptation across the city.

Monitoring, Reporting, and Continuous Improvement: A robust monitoring and reporting framework will track progress on both mitigation and adaptation fronts. This transparent approach allows for continuous learning and adaptation, ensuring that the city's climate actions remain effective and responsive to evolving challenges. The Climate City Contract has provided a roadmap for ongoing evaluation and refinement, essential for navigating the complex path to climate neutrality. We have also developed our own index, index that will allow us to track the mainstreaming effect of mitigation and adaptation into all governance processes. This innovation will support the disruptive way of considering climate issues.

# 2 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

By uniting two medieval settlements, Kaptol and Gradec, in 1850, the City of Zagreb embarked on a rapid development trajectory. Throughout the 19th century, the population increased tenfold, and from the 1960s onwards, the City began expanding rapidly across the plains along the Sava River. $^{1}$

Today, Zagreb is the Republic of Croatia's capital and economic and administrative hub. It hosts key state institutions - legislative, judicial, and executive branches - as well as institutions for finance, defence, healthcare, culture, education, transportation, and others. The City covers an area of  $641.24\mathrm{km}^2$ , comprising 69 settlements and 17 urban districts.

According to the 2021 census $^{2}$ , the City of Zagreb has 767,131 residents, accounting for  $19.8\%$  of the total population of the Republic of Croatia. This is a decrease of  $2.9\%$  compared to the 2011 census. The population structure reveals that women constitute  $53.3\%$  of the total population, while men comprise  $46.7\%$ . The largest demographic group falls within the age bracket of 40-44 (Figure 1), comprising  $7.7\%$  of the population.

The City of Zagreb, nestled at the foothills and southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain range and along the banks of the Sava River, experiences diverse microclimatic conditions. Zagreb enjoys a humid continental climate due to its location in the southwest part of the Pannonian Basin. However, recent times have witnessed alterations in the Köppen-Geiger climate classification across all meteorological stations within the City. These observations underscore the necessity for vigilant monitoring and adaptation to emerging conditions to ensure the City's resilience and sustainability for the future.

# 2.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

## 2.1.1 Infrastructure

### 2.1.1.1 Built environment

#### Key statistics on the buildings sector

The City of Zagreb owns over 1,000 buildings. This building stock includes kindergartens, schools, hospitals, health care buildings, social care buildings, cultural sector buildings, and sports and recreation buildings (including several large multi-functional buildings and complexes). The building stock also includes all the buildings of the city utility companies. Most buildings are older than 30 years, have worse energy classes, and generally need renovation. Considering the development plans of the City of Zagreb, adaptation, renovation, reconstruction, extension, revitalisation, change of purpose or demolition with the construction of replacement buildings are planned for a large part of the building stock. In the coming period, the focus is particularly on investments related to kindergartens and schools and implementing capital projects in health, culture, and sports.

In the last 10 years, the City of Zagreb has carried out energy renovation of 80 public buildings, including 37 kindergartens, 18 primary schools, 4 secondary schools, 4 administration buildings / regional offices, 4 homes for the elderly and infirm, 8 health care buildings (health centers and hospital buildings), 2 sports buildings, 2 local self-government buildings. The mentioned buildings have a total area of 213,214 m². The energy renovation cost of these buildings is 62 million EUR.

The series of earthquakes in northwestern Croatia in 2020 greatly impacted the building stock in the City of Zagreb, as many buildings were damaged due to the earthquakes. In accordance with the Law on Reconstruction, the City of Zagreb is solely responsible for the reconstruction of public buildings it owns, while the Government of the Republic of Croatia is responsible for the reconstruction of private houses, multi-apartment buildings, and other public buildings. The City of Zagreb prioritised the renovation of kindergartens, schools, and road infrastructure, and then the focus shifted to health and cultural buildings and city administration buildings.

Action Plan
C

The City of Zagreb contracted 207 renovation projects for buildings it owns, of which 177 are currently completed, which amounts to more than 85%. At the same time, the buildings are not only renovated in solely part regarding construction but completely, which means that other important requirements for the building, including thermal protection and rational use of energy, have also been improved – all according to national regulation. The buildings were renovated with the funds made available to Croatia by the European Union as a sign of solidarity after the earthquakes in 2020. The City of Zagreb managed to use the funds with the great commitment of its city employees, who through eight calls for different types of buildings had to prepare projects according to the strict rules of the Law on Reconstruction and of the European Commission.

## Public lighting system

Based on the latest available data - Energy Efficiency Action Plan for the City of Zagreb for the period 2022 – 2024 and Action plan for modernisation of the public lighting system in the City of Zagreb, there are around 120,000 lamps (luminaires) with a total power of around 19 MW. The most represented light sources are high-pressure sodium (81%), LED (9%), adapted high-pressure sodium (replacement for high-pressure mercury) at around 8%, as well as other particular types (2%), all presented in the following table.

Table 1 Public lighting system in the City of Zagreb

|  Source | Number of lamps | Share in number of lamps (%) | Installed power (kW) | Share in installed power (kW)  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  High-pressure sodium | 97,418 | 81% | 16.432 | 86%  |
|  LED | 10,895 | 9% | 722 | 4%  |
|  Adapted high-pressure sodium | 9,633 | 8% | 1.588 | 8%  |
|  Other special types | 2,000 | 2% | 300 | 2%  |
|  Total | 119,946 |  | 19.042 |   |

The whole public lighting system works around 4,200 hours every year which results in a total annual electricity consumption of around 78.5 GWh which generates around 9 million euros of annual expenses for electricity.

Since the public lighting system of the City of Zagreb is relatively large, but also outdated, the City of Zagreb recognised the importance and necessity of its public lighting system modernisation several years ago when a project called RePubLEEc was implemented in the period 2018-2021. This project, financed through ELENA (European Local Energy Assistance), had the aim to co-finance preparatory activities (technical and tender documentation) for the reconstruction and modernisation of at least 70% of the entire public lighting system in the City of Zagreb.

Throughout the project, with the great help of REGEA, and due to several limitation factors, the City of Zagreb prepared a tender documentation for an Energy Performance Contract (EPC) for 40% of the public lighting system (around 51,000 luminaires), while the tender was published at the end of 2021.

The total value of this tender was set at around 28 million EUR. However, due to the nature of EPC, the City of Zagreb did not invest its financial funds, but it obliged a private partner to independently design, finance, and conduct work, as well as to guarantee services such as guaranteed energy savings, availability, and luminance. Expected outputs of these activities were creating an EPC contract in 17 years, by which 65% energy savings (25 GWh), 75% savings in maintenance costs (2.7 million EUR), and 5,000 tonnes of CO₂ reduction were achieved. Due to low electricity prices (2021), offers received on the tender procedure were higher than the estimated contract value (investment could not be covered by the energy savings) so the City decided to cancel the tendering procedure and the EPC contract has not been signed.

Except for EPC tender documentation, the City of Zagreb prepared and launched smaller reconstruction projects during 2019 - 2022. These smaller investment projects were primarily focused on older parts of the infrastructure that had to be realised due to other (in parallel) infrastructure modernisation programmes (like holistic reconstruction of streets and infrastructure on public roads). The overall investment of realised smaller investment projects is approximately 1,000,000 EUR.

While a bigger investment project was not implemented, there is still a great need for a major renovation of the public lighting system in terms of not only replacing old luminaires

with LED, but also changing the infrastructure such as lighting poles, electricity cables, as well as to integrate energy management and monitoring system.

# EL-TO Zagreb

EL-TO Zagreb, operated by HEP Proizvodnja Ltd (a daughter company of Croatian Energy Company – HEP Ltd) is a cogeneration heat and power plant built located in the western part of the city center. Initially built in 1907 for the electrification of the City of Zagreb, it operated as a typical thermal power plant, producing electricity only until 1954, when its utilisation in the heating sector started. Over the years, different blocks have been installed at the location, keeping up the energy needs, both in electricity and heat of the major city. As of today, 8 different production blocks are available with a nominal electricity power of 50 MWe and a nominal heat power of 200 MWt. Two blocks are classified as natural gas cogeneration blocks, two blocks are classified as typical thermal electricity production blocks (using natural gas or extra light fuel oil), while the other 4 are used for heating purposes only (using natural gas or extra light fuel oil). Production blocks can also participate in steam production with a nominal capacity of 80 MWt.

As it is a cogeneration power plant, its primary purpose is to produce electricity and heating energy through a complex process of optimisation of different blocks based on energy needs. Apart from these, this power plant is also used as a vital production unit in auxiliary services provided to electricity distribution and transmission operators (tertiary balancing services). On a yearly basis, EL-TO produces around 550 GWh of heating energy, 250 GWh of electricity, and 290,000 tonnes of steam.

It is important to mention that, just as any other cogeneration power plant, EL-TO is defined by its work regime to produce a maximum amount of electric energy, while the heating energy is produced as a byproduct. If there is not enough heating energy to meet the heat demand, blocks mentioned above for the production of heating energy only are activated. This is also one of the reasons why EL-TO Zagreb also has a large water storage, which enables smoother optimisation of production units, especially during the night and in morning hours.

Due to exceeded lifetime of several production blocks, EL-TO is currently in the process of modernisation of its production blocks where a brand new cogeneration block with a nominal electricity power of 150 MWe and a nominal heat power of 114 MWt has been built.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

As a part of this modernisation project, a new 32,000 m³ water storage is planned which will have a thermal capacity of 1,000 MWh and an integrated 150 MW heater.

## TE-TO Zagreb

TE-TO Zagreb, operated by HEP Proizvodnja Ltd (a daughter company of Croatian Energy Company – HEP Ltd), is also a cogeneration heat and power plant built located in the east part of the City near the Sava River. Initially built in 1962, contrary to EL-TO, its purpose was immediately to meet both the electricity and heating needs of the eastern part of the City of Zagreb, where its nominal production capacity has increased over the years. As of today, 6 different production blocks are available with a nominal electricity power of 300 MWe and a nominal heat power of 508 MWt. Two blocks are classified as natural gas cogeneration blocks, one block is classified as typical thermal electricity production blocks (using natural gas or extra light fuel oil), while the other 4 are used for heating purposes only (using natural gas or extra light fuel oil). Production blocks can also participate in steam production with a nominal capacity of 246 MWt.

As it is a cogeneration power plant, its primary purpose is to produce electricity and heating energy through a complex process of optimisation of different blocks based on energy needs. Apart from these, this power plant is also used as a vital production unit in auxiliary services provided to electricity distribution and transmission operators (tertiary balancing services). On a yearly basis, EL-TO produces around 900 GWh of heating energy, 1,650 GWh of electricity, and 200,000 tonnes of steam.

Just as EL-TO Zagreb, this facility is also defined by its work regime to produce a maximum amount of electric energy, while the heating energy is produced as a byproduct. If there is not enough heating energy to meet the heat demand, the above-mentioned blocks for the production of heating energy only are activated. This is also one of the reasons why TE-TO Zagreb, just as EL-TO Zagreb, has a large water storage, which enables smoother optimisation of production units, especially during night and in morning hours. The thermal capacity of the water storage is 750 MWh, and it also has an integrated 150 MW heater.

# Central wastewater management facility

A very important aspect of high-density urban areas is management of waste-water due to an increased load for drainage and purification of sewage water. Having that in mind, the City of Zagreb established a company called Zagrebačke Otpadne Vode Ltd (engl. Zagreb Wastewater, ZOV) in 1998, whose integral purpose was to design, finance, build and operate a central waste-water management unit for the whole area of the City of Zagreb.

In 2000, the City of Zagreb signed a concession agreement with ZOV, after which ZOV started to build the central waste-water management facility in July 2002. The first phase of this facility was commissioned in April 2004 when mechanical purification was introduced. In the following years, the facility was improved in 4 different phases with the final result of having 100% biological purification (4th stage), which is still in operation. The total capacity of the facility is 1.5 million ES (equivalent inhabitants), and the wastewater volume is 442,370 m³/day. Units within this facility are designed to withhold peak hour demand of 37,790 m³/h and "biological" demand BPK5 of 90,000 kg/day.

It should be mentioned that, as a part of this facility and its development, ZOV also invested in the most complex part of the infrastructure – a wastewater supply pipeline from the city to the facility and a purified water drainage pipeline from the facility to the Sava River. ZOV also participated in the design, finance, and build of the main wastewater supply pipeline (in total 10 km long), which enabled the connection of the whole City of Zagreb to the facility, as well as the design, finance, and build of Domovinski most (engl. Homeland Bridge), a crucial bridge over the Sava River under which main wastewater supply pipeline are leading to the facility.

As of today, the company underwent a privatisation process after which companies WTE Wassertechnig GmbH and Westenergie Aqua GmbH have an equal ownership share of 48.5%, while a city-owned company Vodoprivreda Zagreb (engl. Water Management Zagreb) has a 3% ownership share. Although the concession agreement should have lasted until 2028, after which the facility would be transferred into the City of Zagreb's ownership, the agreement was canceled in 2024 due to several reasons where the most important one is that the land which was part of the concession agreement could be transferred in City of Zagreb's ownership before 2028 since the main waste management center is planned there.

# Integrated PV systems

In the last several years, integrated PV systems have become one of the top priorities of the City of Zagreb's representatives since there were only 21 small-scale systems integrated on public buildings' roofs with a total power of 0.66 MWp. Most of these PV systems were installed to participate in the previous incentive systems (guaranteed purchase price).

To set more ambitious goals, in 2021, the City of Zagreb developed a programme called: Integrated PV systems on public buildings, multi-apartments, family houses, and business sector 2022-2024, which aims to install around 50 MWp out of which 10 MWp are planned to be installed on public buildings' rooftops, 10 MWp on multi-apartments and family houses' rooftops, while the rest (30 MWp) are planned for the business sector which per classification also includes large city-owned companies which should be leaders in this aspect.

The main support to the City of Zagreb in management of this programme is given by REGEA throughout the European project called PVMax. In the programme, it is stated that the City of Zagreb will build those PV systems using various models such as a traditional model (own funds, subsidies, credit lines), incentive systems, but also innovative models such as Power-Purchase Agreements (PPA).

As of today, the City of Zagreb and REGEA prepared technical documentation for around 160 integrated PV systems for mixed purposes (self-consumption and sell-to-market) on public buildings' rooftop with the total power of around 20 MWp, two times more than the programme predicted.

PV systems (1.43 MWp) were successfully installed through the EGP mechanism (EEA Grants), 16 PV systems are currently in the process of installation for which PPA was signed (1.7 MWp), while others are in different stages of development (obtaining permits, preparation for tender process or other). It is important to mention that the main factor that hinders this process is rooftops quality and complex administrative procedures.

Apart from public buildings, city-owned company Zagreb Holding and Zagrebački Velesajam Ltd, as part of the business sector are also contributing to the programme. The Zagreb Holding and its connected companies identified 24 projects with a total power of

around 33 MW which alone fulfill the programme's aim for this sector, while Zagrebački Velesajam Ltd is in the process of obtaining technical requirements from the electricity distribution company for its 3.3 MW PV system. It is important to mention that 2 PV systems that belong to this group have already been commissioned with a total power of 1 MW, while others will be published in a tender process by the end of this year after Zagreb Holding decides on the implementation model and financing schemes.

In 2022, the City of Zagreb established the company Zagrebački sunčani krovovi Ltd. (Zagreb Solar Roofs, ZSK) which has the main task of installing PV systems and storage systems, with the final objective to be able to supply green electricity primarily to public buildings owned by the City of Zagreb. The company is currently in the process of installing approximately 1.5 MW of building integrated PVs (planned by mid 2025), while it is planned to increase the capacity to over 20 MW by 2027.

## Electricity network

The electricity network is one of the most developed infrastructures in the City of Zagreb, with more than 18,300 km of grid. It provides electricity to more than 570,000 points through 3,800 grid stations (total power 4,850 MVA). Every year, this electricity network is responsible for distributing around 16,900 GWh of electricity to end consumers, while the average distribution losses are around 7%. The reliability of the network, according to two main parameters – number of outages (SAIFI) and duration of outages (SAIDI), is the best among all parts of the country which is mostly due to the very dense and well-developed power distribution network, which enables various alternative power supply chains. However, several parts of the electricity grid are outdated and need to be modernised, while the whole grid is simply not ready for the "smart grid" concept due to a lack of digital measurement units, advanced regulation units and others. According to the investment strategy of the electricity distribution network operator (HEP ODS), most of the investments in the next decade will focus on digitalisation, the introduction of the "smart grid" concept, and an increase in the number of transformation units across the City. Regarding the spare capacity in the grid, for now, no major problems have been reported, which means that the grid can integrate a large share of renewable energy sources.

# DH network

The City of Zagreb relies on HEP Toplinarstvo Ltd for delivery of heat through its heat distribution network based on the long-term concession agreement. In total, around 100,000 end customers are supplied with high-temperature water or steam through a 227.3 km long heat distribution network. It should be mentioned that heat delivered through this network is produced in EL-TO and TE-TO Zagreb, the two main production units explained earlier. Until a few years ago, heat distribution network conditions were inadequate, with a high share of heat and water losses. In order to change that, HEP Toplinarstvo successfully applied for a large-scale EU project, "Revitalisation of district heating network," financed through the ITI mechanism. The project is still in its implementation phase where the final results will be a complete revitalisation of 1/3 of the total length (68.5 km). This project will result in a reduction of water losses by 47%, heat losses by 28%, and a number of urgent interventions by more than 90%. As a part of this project, HEP Toplinarstvo is also introducing an advanced management and control system for the heat distribution network to improve the security of supply and the overall energy efficiency of the grid. However, there are still several areas where the heat distribution network is outdated and needs to be revitalised. On the other hand, the biggest problem in the heat distribution network is probably the fact that heat exchanger units located at the site of end-consumers are not in the ownership of HEP Toplinarstvo but of those end-consumers. This directly impacts attempts to lower the inlet and outlet temperature in the heat distribution network and consequently decrease energy and water losses. It should also be mentioned that, due to the very long tradition of heat distribution network and district heating in general, there is a lack of individual meters in the system, which causes a very negative public perception since end customers do not pay for what they consume. However, this is a direct problem of current legislation in the heating sector.

# Gas network

Gas distribution is operated by a city-owned company, Gradska Plinara Zagreb Ltd (engl. City Gasworks Zagreb), based on obtained permits for this activity, but also on a long-term concession agreement with the City of Zagreb. This company has provided gas distribution services since 1862 and is the largest gas distribution company in the country. The gas network is very well developed and covers almost the whole area of the City. In total, there

Climate Neutrality
Action Plan

are around 4,000 km of gas pipelines through which Gradska Plinara Zagreb Ltd delivers gas to around 300,000 end consumers. Yearly, around 300,000,000 m³ of natural gas is distributed through the network. However, most of the gas distribution networks are relatively old and inefficient, with certain losses. This causes high maintenance costs. To back up that, a recent series of earthquakes in the City of Zagreb showed the aforementioned problem of inadequate and old gas network in the city center for which Gradska Plinara Zagreb Ltd had to invest major resources and time for reparations. On the other hand, only a few parts of the gas network were enhanced with digital measurement units, while for other parts, employees still had to do field inspections and register the consumption of each measurement unit. Also, several parts of the City have yet to be connected to the gas network due to the relatively high gasification costs.

## 2.1.1.3 Mobility

### Key transport statistics

### Registered vehicles and trends

The number of passenger vehicles has been increasing since 1997. The fastest growth in registering new cars occurred between 2005 and 2008. After the financial crisis, the number of newly registered vehicles declined until 2014, when it began to rise again. The reduced number of newly registered vehicles compared to the period before the 2008 financial crisis significantly contributed to the increase in the average age of cars.⁴

In 2022, 442,049 motor vehicles were registered, which is 3.4% more than in 2021. Of the total registered motor vehicles in 2022, 82.6% (364,924) were passenger cars.⁵

### Share of transport modes

The results of a study on weekday travel demand show that car traffic is the City's most preferred form of transportation, with a share of 60%. Following car traffic is public transportation, which in the City of Zagreb includes buses, trams, cable car, and funicular,

with a demand share of 37.7%. The lowest demand, with a share of 2.3%, is for bicycle traffic.⁶

Regarding the public transport statistics, in 2023, 158.7 million passengers were transported in the City of Zagreb, which is 7.0% less than in 2022, when 170.7 million passengers were transported. Trams transported 108.1 million passengers in 2023, 7.1% less than in 2022, when 116.3 million passengers were transported. Buses transported 49.7 million passengers, a decrease of 7.1% compared to 2022, when 53.5 million passengers were transported. In 2023, the funicular transported 522,000 passengers, which, compared to 2022, when 536,000 passengers were transported, represents a decrease of 2.7%.⁷

## Public transport

### Busses

The bus system in the City of Zagreb is under the jurisdiction of Zagrebački električni tramvaj (engl. Zagreb Electric Tramway, ZET), a company owned by the City. The City has 110 bus lines, with 241 vehicles deployed on weekdays, 160 on Saturdays, and 120 on Sundays. Most of the bus lines are connected through 29 terminals, but in addition to these, there are several other terminals located within the tram line system where ZET buses operate.

In 2022, the length of the tram lines was 1,538 km, while the number of seats in trams amounted to 45,459. A total of 26,818,000 km were traveled, and 53,484,000 passengers were transported.⁸

Various transport companies operate intercity lines, connecting Zagreb with all major cities in Croatia, in addition to the City's public bus transport.

### Trams

Tram traffic for passengers in the City of Zagreb was opened in 1881, and in 1910 the network was electrified. Tram traffic in the City of Zagreb operates as part of the ZET system, and the fleet consists of 263 tram vehicles, 142 of which are low-floor. In the City area, 15 daytime

and 4 nighttime lines connect the City center with its eastern, western, and southern parts. The timetable for daytime trams depends on the time of day and season, with the highest frequency during peak rush hour. In addition to the regular daytime tram lines, four nighttime lines with fixed schedules also operate in the City. The nighttime tram lines cover all parts of the City and connect residential areas with the City center.

In 2022, the length of the tram lines was 208 km, while the number of seats in trams amounted to 45,842. A total of 11,849,000 km were traveled, and 116,303,000 passengers were transported.⁹

## Trains

The public railway transport system throughout Croatia and in Zagreb is under the jurisdiction of the company HŽ Putnički prijevoz (engl. HŽ Passenger Transport, HŽPP). In the 2023/2024 timetable, HŽPP operates 769 trains, of which 725 are in domestic and 44 in international traffic, depending on the season. In the City area, railway transport connects the eastern and western parts of the City, while in the southern part of the City, the existing railway network is used exclusively for freight transport. Within the City, 143.4 km of railway tracks are in use and 16 stops. In terms of tariffs, passenger railway transport within the City is integrated with ZET, allowing passengers to purchase a combined monthly HŽPP and ZET ticket.

International passenger traffic at the Zagreb hub is organized on 9 lines that run daily, with an average occupancy of 33% of international trains.

## Alternative transport

### Bicycle

Cycling traffic in the City of Zagreb is on a slight rise, with its share amounting to slightly more than 3%. According to 2022 data, the total length of cycling lanes within the traffic network is 320 km, while the length of sports and recreational paths is 187 km.⁹

The public bike system has been implemented in Zagreb, but it is not sufficiently developed or integrated with other forms of public transport. The public shared bike system has 22 stations where city bikes can be rented and returned. In collaboration with ZET, the City of Zagreb introduced the BoB – Bike on Bus service in October 2014, allowing citizens to transport their bicycles free of charge on three bus lines. The goal was to increase the number of bus and bicycle users and to encourage residents of the foothill areas to use bicycles.

## Pedestrian traffic

Pedestrian traffic in Zagreb is important, especially in the city center and historical areas, where many pedestrian streets are adapted. Some of the most prominent pedestrian zones include the city center (Gornji Grad and Donji Grad) and Ban Jelačić Square, the central square of Zagreb. Bridges and underpasses are also adapted for pedestrians, particularly in train stations and major traffic intersections. Many pedestrian paths pass through parks and green areas, such as Maksimir, Zrinjevac, and Jarun, providing a pleasant walking experience in natural surroundings.

## Freight transport

## Road transport

The road transport of freight predominantly takes place via the motorway network, which enables truck transport to terminals or the final destination. In the area of the City of Zagreb, the following motorway routes are vital:

A1 Zagreb-Split-Dubrovnik,
A2 Zagreb-Macelj,
A3 Bregana-Zagreb-Lipovac,
A4 Zagreb-Goričan,
A11 Zagreb-Sisak.

These routes are used for domestic freight transport and have international significance, as most continue towards Central and Eastern Europe.

Zagreb has three road-rail container terminals: Vrapče, Jankomir, and Žitnjak. The Jankomir and Žitnjak terminals are smaller container terminals compared to Vrapče. They are located in industrial zones and are used for receiving, storing, customs clearance, repackaging, and dispatching goods.

In the City of Zagreb in 2023, a total of 16.2 million tons of goods were transported, which is a 4.8% decrease compared to 2022, while compared to 2019, there was an increase of 0.6%, when a total of 16.1 million tons of goods were transported. In domestic transport, 14.1 million tons of goods were transported, a 4.3% decrease compared to 2022, and in international transport, 2.1 million tons of goods were transported, marking a decrease of 8.2%.¹⁰

## Railway transport

Freight railway traffic in the area of the City of Zagreb operates on railway lines located on two international corridors, as well as on local and regional railways. Freight is brought into the Zagreb area via the Mediterranean corridor of the TEN-T network from the direction of Rijeka and Karlovac to Klara and the marshalling yard in Zagreb. A significant route for the delivery and dispatch of goods is the M101 railway line, which is also part of the Mediterranean TEN-T corridor, extending from the border with the Republic of Slovenia to the City of Zagreb.

## Air transport

The cargo terminal for air transport, whose primary function is the transshipment of cargo from air transport to road vehicles for further distribution, is located within Franjo Tuđman International Airport. The mentioned airport is a registered IATA cargo agent that provides services for the reception and dispatch of goods and mail and owns and operates its own cargo warehouses.

The total cargo traffic at Zagreb Airport in 2023 amounted to 9,035 tons, a decrease of 3.5% compared to 2022 when the cargo traffic totaled 9,362 tons.¹⁰ The mentioned cargo traffic

at Zagreb Airport refers to loaded and unloaded goods and mail in commercial operations, excluding passenger baggage, while cargo in direct transit is not included.

## 2.1.1.4 Utilities

### Gas power plant at landfill Jakuševec

The City of Zagreb, through the city-owned company Čistoća Ltd (part of Zagreb Holding Company Ltd), is operating the biggest landfill in the Republic of Croatia – landfill Jakuševec. In 2004, Čistoća Ltd developed a gas power plant and gas network as a part of the active degassing system at Jakuševec landfill. The primary task of this landfill's active degassing system is the continuous collection and thermal treatment of the generated landfill gas to ensure general safety, environmental protection, and protection from fire, as well as utilisation of its energy for producing electricity from a renewable energy source.

The gas network consists of 137 permanent wells, a 10 km gas distribution network covering the whole landfill area and 5 degassing lines on which waste is disposed daily. On the other hand, a gas power plant called mTEO Jakuševec, developed in phases over the years consists of 3 high-temperature torches with compressors, 3 gas engines and 3 generators. The nominal capacity of the gas power plant is 3 MW. Additionally, in 2021, Čistoća Ltd developed an additional gas power plant, mE Jakuševec 2, which consists of 1 gas engine and 1 generator with a nominal capacity of 1.2 MW. Since its beginning of operation, both gas power plants produced around 230 GWh of electricity. This production unit will continue its operation until 2036 when the feed-in tariff, granted in 2021 for 25 years, will end. Under this feed-in tariff, Čistoća Ltd is obliged to deliver all produced electricity to the electricity distribution network.

### Water distribution network

The main source of drinking water in the City of Zagreb is the underground water of the Sava alluvium. Drinking water is obtained by pumping from the Zagreb aquifer and, for the western part of the City, from the Samobor - Zaprešić aquifer. These two aquifers are connected in one natural unity. After natural filtration, which lasts for weeks and months, the water in the wells is captured by pumps, disinfected preventively with gaseous chlorine, and distributed to consumers through the water supply network. The basic idea of the water supply system is lifting the water into water tanks, along with the distribution of water to

6
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

consumers. Such a water supply system in Zagreb has been functioning since 1878 when the flow capacity was 53.2 L/s distributed along around 4km of water pipeline network. Today, water is pumped from 44 wells at 7 water pumping stations: Sašnjak, Žitnjak, Petruševec, Zapruđe, Mala Mlaka, Strmec, and Velika Gorica, with a total storage capacity of around 120,000 m³ (41% of daily needs), while the flow capacity is around 310,000 m³/day distributed along 3,900 km of water pipeline network. The water supply system is responsible for delivering fresh water to around 900,000 inhabitants. However, most of the water distribution network is more than 30 years old which results in around alarming 50% distribution losses. Also, the average level of underground water in the two aforementioned aquifers dropped by more than 3m in the last 20 years.

## 2.1.2 Emissions

This chapter looks closely at energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions for the City of Zagreb in 2019. It provides an overview of various sectors and energy carriers. Public lighting is not analysed on its own, but it's considered as part of the Services sector. The energy balance is based on the 2021 Energy and Climate Development pathway of the City of Zagreb for 2030 with an outlook for 2050¹¹.

The total energy consumption of the City of Zagreb in 2019 was 12.424232 TWh. Among the sectors, Households are the largest consumers, accounting for 4.503281 TWh (36%), followed closely by Mobility and Services at 3.839586 TWh (31%) and 2.654058 TWh (22%), respectively. The industry sector contributed to 1.385279 TWh (11%), while the Agriculture sector registered the lowest consumption, amounting to 0.042028 TWh (less than 1%) (Table 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4).

The highest energy consumption was attributed to Natural gas, accounting for 3.069947 TWh (25%). This was closely followed by Diesel and Electricity, contributing 2.869891 TWh (23%) and 2.766336 TWh (22%) respectively. District Heating represented 1.578307 TWh (13%), while Petrol accounted for 0.907917 TWh (7%). The utilisation of additional fuels,

The Climate City Contract (CCC) takes a comprehensive approach to its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory, encompassing all emissions within the city's territorial boundaries, including mobility and transport. While the current inventory integrates all available emissions data as CO2 equivalents, the city recognizes the need for further granularity in detailing regions with high energy consumption, areas of intense traffic density, and sector-specific emissions (e.g.,  $\mathrm{CH}_4$  and  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$ ) compared to a baseline.

To address these gaps, the city is committed to enhancing its data collection and analysis capabilities. Efforts will focus on developing mechanisms to reliably map high-energy consumption regions, identify local areas with significant traffic congestion during peak hours, and further disaggregate emissions from transport categories such as cars, motorcycles, light trucks, heavy trucks, and buses.

Although current limitations in data resolution exist, the city plans to strengthen its methodologies and collaborate with relevant stakeholders to ensure accurate, detailed, and actionable insights. This iterative process will support the continuous refinement of the GHG inventory, providing a robust foundation for informed decision-making and targeted climate action in the future.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Zagreb's extensive green infrastructure, which comprises approximately 72% of its urban area or about 46,152 hectares, presents a substantial potential in the context of AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use) strategies for carbon sequestration. This preliminary estimate, suggesting that these green spaces could sequester around 461,520 tonnes of CO2 annually, based on an average of 10 tonnes per hectare per year, highlights the critical role of urban forestry and land use in mitigating climate change. However, this is a rough estimate that necessitates further refinement and more precise data collection to fully integrate these natural resources into Zagreb's Climate City Contract Action Plan. Enhanced monitoring and verification are required to ensure that these green spaces are accurately evaluated for their carbon offset capabilities, aligning with broader environmental sustainability goals. This approach will also support the development of targeted policies and practices that promote effective land management and urban planning strategies within the AFOLU framework.

The current scope of the Climate City Contract (CCC) does not include emissions from Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) or Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) in detail, only the rough estimate for AFOLU as stated above. However, the city acknowledges the importance of these sectors in achieving comprehensive climate action.

As part of future iterations of the CCC, a detailed plan to incorporate IPPU and AFOLU emissions into the GHG inventory will be developed. This plan will include:

Baseline Data Development: Establishing methodologies for quantifying emissions from IPPU and AFOLU, including identifying key emission sources and determining appropriate data collection processes.
Stakeholder Engagement: Collaborating with industry representatives, agricultural stakeholders, and forestry management entities to co-create actionable strategies and ensure accurate data inputs.
Rationale and Action Plans: Outlining the rationale for including these sectors and developing targeted action plans to address emissions reduction and sustainable practices in industrial processes, agriculture, and land use management.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Policy Integration: Aligning these actions with national and international frameworks to enhance accountability and facilitate resource mobilization.

The inclusion of IPPU and AFOLU will be guided by an iterative approach that builds on existing data while strengthening the city's capacity for comprehensive climate governance. By integrating these sectors, the CCC will advance its mission of fostering a sustainable, climate-resilient city.

## 2.2 Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

At the national level in the Republic of Croatia, there are many laws and regulations governing energy, climate, and mobility. In the sector of energy, the most prominent national laws include the Energy Act, the Electricity Market Act, the Gas Market Act, the Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal Act, the Heat Energy Market Act, the Oil and Oil Derivatives Market Act, the Biofuels for Transport Act, the Energy Activities Regulation Act, the Renewable Energy Sources and High-Efficiency Cogeneration Act, the Energy Efficiency Act, and the Implementation of Council Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 on urgent intervention to address high energy prices Act. These laws form the legal framework guiding activities in the energy sector, ensuring alignment with the EU's energy objectives.

In addition to the array of national laws and regulations, the Republic of Croatia has a Strategy for Energy Development of the Republic of Croatia until 2030, with a perspective towards 2050. This strategy represents a crucial step towards realising the vision of low-carbon energy, ensuring a smooth transition into a new era of energy policy. Central to this strategy is the assurance of an affordable, secure, and high-quality energy supply without imposing additional burdens on the state budget, achieved within the framework of state aid and incentives.

At the national level, legislation concerning climate encompasses a range of laws to mitigate climate change and protect the ozone layer. The Climate Change and Ozone Layer Protection Act delineates climate change mitigation, adaptation, and ozone layer protection responsibilities. It addresses key aspects such as greenhouse gas emission monitoring and reporting, emissions trading systems, aviation activities, substances harmful to the ozone layer, financing for climate mitigation and adaptation, and administrative oversight. Additionally, regulations like the Biofuel Quality Regulation set standards for the quality of biofuels on the domestic market, including assessment and compliance verification criteria. Furthermore, the Distribution plan for greenhouse gas emission quotas in Croatia and numerous other regulations contribute to the comprehensive legal framework to combat climate change and safeguard the environment.

In the mobility sector, The Road Act, Road Traffic Safety Act, Railway Act, Railway Safety and Interoperability Act, Air Traffic Act, and Act on Transport in Regular and Occasional Coastal
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Maritime Traffic establish regulatory frameworks to enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability in transportation. Additionally, the Act on Promoting Clean Vehicles in Road Transport encourages the adoption of low-emission and alternative fuel vehicles, further aligning the transportation sector with climate goals. These laws collectively address various aspects of transportation, including infrastructure development, safety standards, emissions reduction strategies, and promoting sustainable modes of transport, contributing to national efforts in combating climate change.

Regarding local and regional planning and associated responsibilities, the Spatial Planning Act establishes a structured system to ensure coherence and effectiveness in spatial development initiatives. Secondly, the Regional Development Act outlines policies and spatial plans vital for regional growth and sustainability. Additionally, the Act on Local and Regional Self-Government incorporates spatial and urban planning provisions, granting local and regional authorities the authority to manage their territories efficiently. Together, these laws provide a solid framework for spatial development, aligning local and regional plans with national strategies.

Transitioning from national policies to local initiatives and strategies, The City of Zagreb was among the first European capital cities to join the Covenant of Mayors, a significant initiative launched by the European Commission in January 2008. Following a consultation process on the future of the Covenant of Mayors, the European Commission introduced a new integrated Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy on October 15, 2015, surpassing the set targets for 2020. The City of Zagreb has developed its Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), aligning its efforts with the Covenant's objectives and outlining specific strategies and actions to achieve these ambitious emission reduction targets. The indicative target for reducing  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions by  $40\%$  compared to 2008 levels was set, amounting to 1,118,000 tons of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions for the City of Zagreb.

Additionally, the City has developed the Energy-Climate Development Framework for the City of Zagreb until 2030, with a perspective towards 2050. This framework encompasses an analysis of two scenarios for developing the City's energy sector. The first scenario, termed the Reference Scenario, delineates future energy flow trends in line with anticipated technological advancements and structural changes in energy consumption and production primarily driven by market principles, with limited proactive involvement from the City of
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Zagreb in shaping and implementing energy and climate measures. Conversely, the second scenario, the Climate Neutrality Scenario, assumes the implementation of active policies to support energy transition within the City of Zagreb. This scenario entails a model incorporating eleven elaborated measures across various sectors, each with defined activities. Also, the City of Zagreb is currently developing its Climate adaptation plan.

The progression from the SECAP to the Energy-Climate Development Framework demonstrates the City of Zagreb's evolving commitment to combating climate change and transitioning towards sustainability. With the initial focus on emission reduction targets set by the SECAP, the subsequent Energy-Climate Development Framework broadens the scope to encompass a longer-term vision, extending its perspective to 2050 and outlining proactive strategies for achieving climate neutrality. These documents reflect a growing ambition and dedication to environmental actions, moving from reduction targets to a comprehensive plan with different scenarios.

Within the energy and climate planning framework, spatial planning documentation of the City of Zagreb also plays a significant role. Among these documents is the General Urban Development Plan of the City of Zagreb. It establishes the fundamental spatial organisation, protection of natural, cultural, and historical values, land use and purpose, and proposed conditions and measures for their regulation. Covering an area of approximately 220 km², the plan encompasses the inner urban area between the Medvednica mountain range and the Zagreb bypass road, including its historical centre. Additionally, other spatial plans contribute to Zagreb's comprehensive spatial management strategy, ensuring alignment between spatial development objectives.

Moreover, the City of Zagreb is a member of several prominent associations committed to sustainable development and climate action. These include the above-mentioned Covenant of Mayors, Energy Cities, Eurocities, and ACR+ (Association of Cities and Regions for Sustainable Resource Management).

In Croatia, the legal and policy landscape governing energy, mobility, and climate actions is predominantly centralized at the national level, leaving local and regional authorities with limited capacity to create and implement their own policies, yet they do, as the SECAPs and

4
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

CCC are the examples on how cities are moving forward with ambition. This centralization stems from the overarching role of national legislation in shaping the country's climate, energy, and mobility strategies. Several key national policies, including the Energy Act, Renewable Energy Sources and High-Efficiency Cogeneration Act, and National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), guide the overall approach to energy transitions and emissions reductions.

National Level Policies and Regulations:

Energy Sector:
Croatia's Energy Act and the Renewable Energy Sources and High-Efficiency Cogeneration Act promote sustainable energy transitions by encouraging renewable energy production, enhancing energy efficiency, and reducing dependency on fossil fuels. The National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) further drives Croatia's goals of meeting EU climate targets, focusing on increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix and promoting energy efficiency measures.

Mobility Sector:
The Act on Promoting Clean Vehicles in Road Transport and regulations such as the Road Traffic Safety Actfocus on reducing emissions from the transportation sector. These regulations support the adoption of low-emission and alternative fuel vehicles while improving infrastructure to meet EU sustainability standards.

Climate Change Policy:
At the national level, the Climate Change and Ozone Layer Protection Act and accompanying regulations outline efforts to monitor and report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, implement emissions trading systems, and tackle substances harmful to the ozone layer. The overarching goal is to align national climate actions with EU climate strategies and commitments.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

Local and Regional Governance Challenges:

Despite these comprehensive national frameworks, local and regional authorities in Croatia face challenges in driving sectoral change independently. The capacity for local authorities to craft and implement climate policies is limited by:

Centralized Decision-Making: Most climate and energy policies, including those for mobility and energy efficiency, are dictated by national laws and EU regulations. This reduces the flexibility of local and regional governments to tailor policies to specific regional needs or local contexts.

Broad Policy Frameworks: National policies, while robust, tend to be broad and generalized. They mostly focus on the energy and mobility sectors, with less emphasis on other domains such as industrial processes or agriculture, which may be relevant for a comprehensive Climate City Contract (CCC). As such, there is little additional localized data or information that can be readily provided for sectors outside of these frameworks.

Lack of Local Implementation Capacity: Regional and local governments are often tasked with implementing national policies but lack the resources and administrative capacity to enforce them effectively or to develop localized solutions. This makes it challenging for local authorities to make meaningful progress in addressing emissions or to adapt strategies based on specific local needs.

In summary, while Croatia's national policies provide a solid foundation for climate and energy action, local and regional authorities face challenges due to the centralized nature of governance. For the Climate City Contract to be successful, it will focus on leveraging national policies while addressing sector-specific gaps and enhancing local capacity for implementation.

## 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

### 2.3.1 Legislative and political

#### 2.3.1.1 Barriers

Notable dependencies and structural intricacies characterise Croatia's energy landscape. With an import dependency rate of 56% in 2021 (57% in 2020)¹³, Croatia relies significantly on imports, particularly oil and petroleum products. The national oil and gas company, INA, stands at the centre of Croatia's energy dynamics. Co-owned by the Hungarian oil company MOL and the Croatian government, INA's operational management by MOL underscores Croatia's vulnerability in the production and supply of oil and oil derivatives. Despite possessing active oil and gas fields and refineries, INA has experienced a steady decline in production, particularly evident in the natural gas supply, where INA's position has been supplanted by Prvo plinarsko društvo (PPD), operating under a ten-year contract with Gazprom, thereby reinforcing Croatia's energy dependence.

Furthermore, the national electricity and heat supply company, HEP Group, wholly owned by the Croatian government, maintains dominance in installed capacity, electricity production, and wholesale market sales, controlling nearly two-thirds of the total market share. Although Croatia's electricity market underwent formal liberalisation in 2001, the practical outcomes must be improved. Over 90% of electricity supply is still provided by HEP Group, indicating the persistence of state control in the energy sector¹⁴. Additionally, the transmission system operator (TSO) and distribution system operator (DSO), crucial players in managing the electricity grid, are intertwined within the HEP Group structure. Despite their critical roles, neither TSO nor DSO effectively ensures transparent, fair, and timely grid

access to all potential investors and producers, indicating persistent challenges in achieving a fully competitive energy market.

Following the energy crisis, it is also necessary to examine the role of subsidies, mainly how they influence Croatia's energy sector. High subsidies for energy and fuel pose a significant barrier to the development of renewable energy sources in Croatia. In response to the energy crisis in February 2022, the Croatian government implemented several measures to alleviate energy prices, including reducing VAT rates for heating energy and excise duties on petroleum products. While these measures relieved consumers, they also inadvertently hindered investments in renewable energy, particularly in photovoltaic (PV) power plants. This is primarily due to the artificially low prices of gas and electricity, sustained through subsidies, which do not accurately reflect market conditions. Consequently, there is a diminished incentive for investors to pursue renewable energy projects like PVs, which could contribute to reducing Croatia's energy dependency and enhancing energy security.

In the realm of legislative and political barriers in Croatia's energy sector, several obstacles hinder the seamless transition towards climate neutrality. One significant challenge lies in the underdeveloped energy market, particularly concerning electricity. The absence of a smart grid capable of real-time consumption monitoring constrains the integration of renewable energy sources by disrupting the effective balancing of production. The traditional grid infrastructure, designed primarily for centralised energy distribution, needs more flexibility and resilience to accommodate the decentralised nature of renewable energy generation. This limitation poses a barrier to the widespread adoption of renewables and the realisation of Croatia's renewable energy potential.

Moreover, Croatia faces challenges in transitioning away from natural gas dependency. The well-established gas network, supported by subsidies and historical preferences, has traditionally been a dominant energy source. Yet, this historical reliance substantially challenges Croatia's aspirations of diversifying its energy portfolio and curbing carbon emissions. Although there is increasing acknowledgment of the need for sustainability and environmental responsibility, reducing reliance on natural gas requires significant investments in alternative energy sources and infrastructure upgrades. However, recent regulatory changes and evolving market dynamics, including increasing environmental awareness and EU directives, are reshaping investor sentiments. Despite the attractiveness
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

of natural gas due to its relatively low cost and convenience, concerns regarding its environmental impact and long-term sustainability are prompting a shift towards cleaner energy alternatives. On the regulatory front, Croatia has taken significant steps to promote sustainable energy practices. Building regulations requiring nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB) for new constructions signify a commitment to energy efficiency and carbon reduction. These regulations mandate that in nZEB buildings, a minimum of 30% of the annual delivered energy must be sourced from renewable energy, preferably generated on-site or nearby.

The unplanned development of the energy network poses an additional barrier and aggravates inefficiencies within Croatia's energy infrastructure. The overlapping infrastructure of gas and district heating systems contributes to mutual competition between the two energy sources. District heating should be favoured in suitable locations to optimise energy usage and promote efficiency. Still, the district heating infrastructure must improve its inefficiencies due to aged infrastructure and insufficient investments, resulting in significant heat losses and increased energy consumption. Addressing these infrastructural challenges requires strategic investments in modernising and optimising energy networks to enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Moreover, in line with EU directives, by 2027, at least 50% of all heat generated from district heating systems must come from renewable energy sources. This directive underscores the urgency of transitioning towards sustainable energy solutions, driving efforts to increase the share of renewables in district heating networks and further aligning energy policies with environmental objectives.

Additionally, the ownership structures of real estate pose another significant barrier. The fragmented ownership of buildings, particularly in residential complexes where different parties own individual apartments, further complicates the decision-making process for energy renovations or investments in renewable energy sources. Achieving consensus among multiple owners for such initiatives becomes exceedingly challenging, impeding progress in sustainable energy transitions. Moreover, the need for unified ownership hampers the implementation of cohesive energy efficiency strategies and the adoption of renewable energy solutions on a larger scale.

In summary, Croatia's energy market presents significant dependencies and structural complexities, characterised by dominant state-owned entities and barriers to renewable

energy development. Addressing these issues will foster a more competitive, resilient, and sustainable energy landscape in Croatia.

## 2.3.1.2 Opportunities

Amidst the challenges facing Croatia's energy sector, there are significant opportunities at various levels to drive the transition towards sustainability and resilience. Firstly, the European Union's ambitious targets for decarbonisation, as outlined in initiatives like the EU Green Deal, Repower EU, and Fit for 55, provide a clear framework for Croatia to align its energy policies with broader European objectives. These initiatives prioritise the transition to renewable energy sources, energy efficiency improvements, and carbon reduction strategies.

Furthermore, the ongoing revision of Croatia's National Energy and Climate Action Plan (NECP) presents an opportunity to enhance the country's energy transition efforts. While the current NECP provides a foundational framework, there is a need for more ambitious targets, extensive stakeholder engagement and transparency in the revision process. By incorporating feedback from a diverse range of stakeholders, Croatia can ensure that its energy and climate objectives are robust and inclusive.

In addition, Croatia possesses considerable geothermal potential, particularly within the Pannonian basin. While current production and utilisation are limited, there is growing interest and momentum, especially in response to the energy crisis. The Croatian government's plans to increase geothermal energy utilisation and dedicated funding in the National Recovery and Resilience program signal a positive trajectory. Regional and local initiatives, particularly in district heating, balneology, and agriculture, further underscore Croatia's potential in this renewable energy source.

Moreover, Croatia possesses significant untapped potential for photovoltaic (PV) installations, yet its current process is lengthy and complex, hindering progress. Despite recent expansions, PV capacity remains relatively low compared to other EU countries. However, there has been notable progress, with unofficial data suggesting a doubling of capacity in 2022. Expanding PV installations presents a critical opportunity for Croatia to

diversify its energy mix and expedite its transition to renewable energy sources¹⁵. However, the ongoing legal adjustments and developments have not accelerated the process; rather, they have further slowed it down¹⁶. Revision and optimisation of the current procedures are still necessary to streamline the process, offering investors greater clarity and confidence in the regulatory framework.

Lastly, Croatia's local and regional authorities, along with energy agencies, are actively engaged in implementing sustainable energy projects. These initiatives focus on deep energy/comprehensive renovation buildings and the utilisation of local renewable energy sources. Such grassroots efforts play a crucial role in driving the energy transition at the community level and showcasing the commitment of local stakeholders to sustainability. Within the City of Zagreb, several initiatives underscore its ambition in the energy and climate sphere. Zagreb's inclusion among the 100 climate-neutral and smart European cities reflects its commitment to sustainability and innovation. Initiatives such as the energy-efficient renovation of public buildings, installation of solar collectors on various facilities, and efforts to improve energy efficiency in street lighting demonstrate concrete actions towards reducing energy consumption and promoting renewable energy use. These initiatives showcase Zagreb's proactive approach and readiness to embrace sustainable practices at the local level.

many cases, there is not enough necessary data about buildings, and the databases currently used are not sufficiently functional.

Ownership - barriers connected with ownership and permits, which is a major obstacle. A great amount of the public buildings in the City of Zagreb do not have all legislative/ownership documentation resolved in full, which effectively prevents their renovation through using any form of EU co-financing.

Reliance on EU grants - low energy costs in the past (before the Ukraine crisis) made renovation (energy renovation) of public buildings financially not viable (i.e., payback periods of over 20 years in the best-case scenarios) without a high level (50% or more) of grants/subsidies. This has been recognised as the most critical barrier, and as a result, within the 2014-2020 financial framework in Croatia, a total of 253,4 million EUR of grants/subsidies for public building renovation have been disbursed (the original allocation in the Croatian Operational Programme was 211 million EUR). The calls for application were closed within days of being open, indicating a very high demand in the public sector for grants/subsidies (i.e., obviously, the total amount of grants/subsidies, even though increased from the original plan, was not nearly sufficient to cover the demand). This directly leads to the following over-reliance of the public sector on grants and subsidies, available mostly through ESIF, leading to a reluctance at all levels (national, regional, local) to implement any other financial model (e.g., ESCO/EPC, energy supply contracting (PPA or similar), public-private partnership (PPP), green/white certificates, financial instruments, etc.) for the renovation of buildings.

Technical documentation/Project design documentation preparation – Today, in Croatia, there is limited access to financial institutions or national funds to cover the costs of the technical preparation phase. This means that all local or regional authorities must secure funding from their budgets, posing a significant financial barrier. The ELENA assistance is used for the implementation of activities that cannot be implemented by current staff of the City of Zagreb, i.e., preparation of EPC documentation, preparation of Main Project Designs, technical and legal advice, and support in the preparation of the feasibility studies for energy management systems in buildings, etc. Receiving EIB/ELENA funding for this action,
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

through the ZA-GREEN project will significantly speed up the process of its realisation, which would provide instant benefits for the City of Zagreb (energy and cost savings).

Lack of construction companies - The main risk related to the actual implementation of the construction works identified based on the current situation and experience with energy/comprehensive renovation of buildings is related to the lack of capacity of the construction industry to implement all planned works within the planned timeframe and budget. In addition, the increase in construction material costs within the last months due to the overall situation in the world (Ukraine crisis, post COVID effects), resulted in several cases where the construction company contracted to implement the works asking for either a contract annex, which would allow for an increase in costs or the cancellation of the contract if the costs cannot be increased.

# Reliance on individual gas heating systems

Although the district heating and its heat distribution network is relatively well-developed in the City of Zagreb, most of the buildings are using individual gas heating systems due to multiple issues. Firstly, the price of heating delivered by district heating systems is heavily regulated by the Hrvatska energetska regulatorna agencija (engl. Croatian Regulatory Energy Agency, HERA). This means that HERA directly dictates the selling price of heat to end consumers, at a level that makes district heating systems completely non-competitive in comparison to the individual gas heating system. Secondly, according to the law, the price of gas is subsidies through several mechanisms, which makes it cheap and often the top pick for buildings that are built or renovated. In other words, it completely diminishes any economic feasibility of using any other source of heat but natural gas.

Reliance of individual gas heating systems can also be ascribed to the fact that investment costs (CAPEX) in those systems are the lowest among all heating options for both new and renovated buildings, no matter the size. Another contributing factor is that, in comparison to district heating systems where the end customer must
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

pay relatively high connection costs, costs for connection on gas grid is relatively cheap.

The same situation is observed when comparing individual gas and electric heating systems, as electric heating systems require a large connection power to match the functionality of gas heating systems. This means that end customers must pay for additional connection power to distribution system operators.

Despite the fact that district heating is probably the only source that could move individual gas heating systems out of the market, it is failing to do so because public opinion is mostly negative about district heating systems for several reasons. That is why end customers often rather choose individual gas heating systems. One of the biggest reasons for the negative public opinion is the fact that end customers in multi-apartment buildings cannot pay for their consumption due to technical limitations, but they pay their share of the energy bill based on various formulas.

## 2.3.2.2 Opportunities

### Existence of an efficient DH system

As presented above, the City of Zagreb has a relatively large district heating system which, for now, uses favourable heat production units (cogeneration plants). In comparison to all other heating sources, district heating systems are characterised as the most reliant and most environmentally friendly heating options, especially if they use renewable heat such as cogeneration plants, heat pumps, or geothermal energy.

District heating systems present probably the best option to decarbonise large number of building stock in urban areas such as the City of Zagreb since one needs to replace main production unit instead of numerous individual systems. The same goes for attempts to increase energy efficiency where district heating systems can increase it faster and easier than individual systems. This means that district heating systems can be perceived as a technology for the best uptake of renewable energy and energy efficiency in urban areas.

Opportunity for end customers can also be found in the fact that, in connection to district heating systems, all maintenance costs become obligatory for the district

C

heating system operators. Since the optimisation of the whole system will come to one place (district heating system operators), management and control of one central system instead of numerous individual systems presents a massive opportunity in terms of additional energy/financial savings.

Once the Law on Thermal Energy Market is changed and aligned with EU Directives, district heating systems (if decarbonised and sustainable) will become one of the most competitive heating sources in terms of cost.

# The existence of a tram infrastructure for public transport

Potential for renewable and waste energy utilisation (PV, geothermal, waste heat from industry, and energy from waste)
The City of Zagreb, as the largest city in the country, possesses a great potential for integration of various PV systems. The City of Zagreb has a fair insolation, which can result in a relatively high production of renewable electricity from PV systems (around 1000 kWh/kWp), which is better than most locations in, i.e., France or Germany.
Apart from the installation of individual integrated PV systems (i.e., for each household or each company), which definitively presents a great way for decarbonisation, according to new EU and Croatian laws, energy communities are more and more popular where numerous incentives are organised among different actors. Croatian legislation identifies three types of energy communities. The most important one for the City of Zagreb is a community dedicated to multi-apartment buildings that foster the integration of PV systems on their rooftops and the sharing of produced electricity among more users.
Also, perhaps the greatest opportunity for integration of PV systems is a recently changed Law on Electricity Market which introduced the so-called "net-metering" system, favourable for small scale systems installed in households.

## 2.3.3 Governance

### 2.3.3.1 Barrier

"The Bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy" – Oscar Wilde

Being a large city can bring significant advantages in terms of resources, capacities, options, and opportunities. The size, however, also brings certain challenges. Large systems require complex mechanisms of control, management, and communication to ensure overall efficiency. These mechanisms grow in complexity with the size of the system. The City of Zagreb is no exception. With numerous departments, offices and companies, vast amounts of land, buildings, infrastructure and vehicles in its territory and in some cases ownership, keeping track of everything, let alone optimising it, is a monumental task.

The City of Zagreb needs to balance the need for tight control and compliance with a desire for agility and efficiency. The current system of governance does not always allow this to happen and will need to be updated and modernised.

### 2.3.3.2 Opportunities

Despite the aforementioned barriers, the City of Zagreb has several opportunities to pilot positive changes in terms of its governance. The two that are in the focus of this process are the existence of a vast GIS database, the Zagreb Energy Atlas, and the initiation of an integrated energy, climate, and spatial planning principle.

Zagreb Energy Atlas is an extensive GIS database that holds georeferenced data on all buildings located within the city, including their size, category, age, number of users, and energy and water consumption data for the past 6 years, alongside data on key energy infrastructure. This database is an invaluable resource for all planning activities as it can bridge the information gap and help assess key areas and fields of intervention.

Likewise, linking energy and spatial planning is an innovative approach enabling the city to not just plan, but also enforce energy and climate measures as spatial plans are executive

documents, alongside being planning ones as well. This integrated planning process provides a direct link between the proposed ambitions and methods to achieve them.

## 2.4 Climate risks and hazards

Climate change is evident in the City of Zagreb, where a notable alteration in Köppen-Geiger climate classes has been observed over the past six decades (Table 4). Rising temperatures have led to a transition from a subtropical highland (Cfb) to humid subtropical climates (Cfa) across all Zagreb meteorological stations, highlighting the profound influence of urbanisation on microclimatic variations within the City. This change is attributed to the increase in the average monthly temperature of the warmest month exceeding 22 °C. Additionally, the unique case of the Puntijarka station, a mountainous station near the City, demonstrates how even mountainous regions are not immune to these changes, further underlining the pervasive nature of climate change in both urban and rural areas. There, the Köppen-Geiger class transitioned from a humid continental climate with severe winters (Dfb) to a subtropical highland climate (Cfb) due to the rise in the average monthly temperature of the coldest month, which no longer falls below -3 °C. Interestingly, alternations in climate classes due to changes in precipitation regimes were not observed during the 60 years under study.¹⁷

Given the specific geographical location of the City of Zagreb, situated on the banks of the Sava River and the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain, coupled with its position within a region prone to seismic activity, the City faces many climate hazards. Furthermore,

Zagreb's urban morphology contributes to the development of urban heat islands, exacerbating the effects of rising temperatures. With the growing influence of climate change, these hazards are becoming more pronounced, posing significant challenges for urban planning and resilience efforts.

# 2.4.1 Key hazards

# 2.4.1.1 Extreme temperatures

According to the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development of the Republic of Croatia (2014), Croatia is facing overall warming throughout the country, manifested, among other things, in significant positive trends in mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures, which is also noticeable in Zagreb (Figure 19). Anomalies are referenced to the climatological period 1991-2020. The red (blue) colour indicates above-average warm (cold) months.

Warming is also evident in all extreme indices, with warm temperature indices (warm days, warm nights, and the warm spell duration) showing a significantly increasing trend, while cold temperature indices (cold days, cold nights, and the cold spell duration) exhibit a negative trend.

## 2.4.1.2 Flash flood

In recent years, we have witnessed increasingly intense weather events that often result in not only hail and strong wind gusts but also significant rainfall within a short period. Such events in urban areas lead to flash (urban) floods. The streams in the Zagreb urban area's foothills often react swiftly to precipitation in their catchment areas, experiencing a sudden rise in water levels characteristic of torrential watercourses. Some of the urban streams have been incorporated into the sewage system of the City of Zagreb, significantly burdening it during heavy rains. According to some estimates, their contribution to the total flow in the sewage system during peak flows is more than 30%. The sewage system is of a combined type, meaning it receives both sanitary and stormwater, and with the City's growth, the proportion of asphalted and waterproof surfaces is increasing, significantly enhancing surface runoff. Lesser amounts of rainfall naturally infiltrate into the ground, and surface water flows more rapidly towards drainage openings, which, often due to lack of maintenance, become impassable. In such situations, the drainage system malfunctions, and in lower parts, pressurised sewage water emerges to the surface, mixing with rainwater.

## 2.4.1.3 Gale force wind

Figure 20 displays the average annual wind speed, while Figure 21 illustrates the number of days with stormy winds at the Grič station for the period from 1981 to 2023. There is a notable variability in the average wind speed. In the period from 2006 to 2015, there was an increase in the average annual wind speed (from 1.4 to 1.9 Beaufort) and an increase in the annual number of days with gale-force winds. However, from the year 2020 onwards, the figures show a decreasing trend. Despite the downward trends, the possibility of encountering gale-force and hurricane-force winds is not ruled out, as witnessed during the summer season of 2023.

# 2.4.1.4 Landslide

Climate conditions play a role in triggering landslides. Increased rainfall, especially after dry periods, can significantly impact soil stability. Intense rains can saturate the soil with water, increasing its weight and reducing friction among soil particles. This reduction in friction can

lead to landslide initiation. Additionally, changes in climate conditions, such as extreme weather events, prolonged rainfall, or snowmelt, can increase the risk of landslides. Rising temperatures can accelerate ice and snow melting, adding extra stress to the soil and the potential for sliding.

Settlements in the City of Zagreb, located on the southern slope of Medvednica, face the risk of landslides and unstable slopes due to specific geological conditions. The threat of active landslides affects approximately 700 buildings in populated areas.

Areas not prone to landslides cover an area of  $366.4\mathrm{km}^2$  or  $57.1\%$  of the City of Zagreb's total area. Regions with a relatively low landslide density (number of landslides per  $\mathrm{km}^2$ ) occupy an area of  $116.2\mathrm{km}^2$ , accounting for  $18.1\%$  of the City of Zagreb's total area. Areas with a relatively high landslide density cover an area of  $158.7\mathrm{km}^2$ , approximately  $24.8\%$  of the City of Zagreb's total area.

The spatial development plan of the City of Zagreb designates a portion of the terrain as predominantly unstable, defined by the Ilica-Jurisićeva-Vlaška-Maksimirska-Dubrava line as the southern boundary and the boundary with the Medvednica Nature Park to the north. Therefore, landslides pose the most significant threat in the urban districts of Gornji grad – Medveščak, Črnomerec, Gornja Dubrava, Maksimir, Podsljeme, Podsused – Vrapče, and Sesvete. $^{18}$

# 2.4.1.5 River flood

According to the Risk of Major Disasters Assessment for the Area of the City of Zagreb, the greatest risk of flooding arises from the potential breach of the Sava River levee during periods of high-water levels, as well as the potential failure of retention systems in the Medvednica area. Although short-term, heavy rainfall may lead to flash floods, their impact is anticipated to primarily be local, confined to smaller areas affected by stormy weather. This contrasts with a broader area of the City that would be affected by the failure of flood protection infrastructure.

# 2.4.3 Impacts

The vulnerability level of Croatia is evident from the fact that agriculture and tourism together accounted for a quarter of the total GDP in 2018. The effects of climate change depend on a wide range of parameters. According to international climate modeling results (IPCC, EEA), the Mediterranean basin has been identified as a 'hot' climate spot with particularly pronounced effects of climate change. Croatia, which largely falls within this region, is certain to feel the consequences of climate change, and its vulnerability is assessed as high. The vulnerability of certain economic sectors is particularly significant: construction, transport, tourism, agriculture, forestry, and energy, as their success largely depends on climatic factors. As a result, the extreme vulnerability of the economy to the effects of climate change can negatively impact overall social development, especially among vulnerable groups of society.

Investing in adaptation measures today will reduce the cost of addressing potential damages in the future and open opportunities for the development of new jobs.

The following table outlines various risks and their potential influence, highlighting the significant challenges climate change poses on infrastructure, public health, water resources, biodiversity, and social vulnerability.

# 3 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

The City of Zagreb is dedicated to achieving net climate neutrality from 2030 onward, with residual emissions systematically neutralised, and full structural decarbonisation consolidated by 2050. These pathways quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions across key sectors and measures, establishing ambitious but realistic interim targets. The plan aligns with Croatia's Climate Law, the EU Green Deal, and the EU Cities Mission framework.

The city of Zagreb will deliver approximately a 90% reduction in territorial GHG emissions by 2030 (relative to the 2019 baseline of 2.93 MtCO₂e), reducing emissions to ~293 ktCO₂e. These remaining residuals will be managed through a dedicated residual emissions and removals strategy based on local sinks, bio-based construction, and certified removals.

By 2040, residual emissions are expected to shrink to ~158 kt, and by 2050 to ~6 kt. These will continue to be neutralised, ensuring sustained net climate neutrality.

Waste sector is handled separately, on top of baseline emissions workout.

|  Year | Target Reduction (%) | Target Emissions (tCO₂e) | Residuals neutralised (tCO₂e) | Cumulative Reduction (tCO₂e)  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  2019 | Baseline | 2,930,000 | - | -  |
|  2030 | 90% | 293,000 | 293,000 | 2,634,000  |
|  2040 | 95% | 158,000 | 158,000 | 2,772,000  |
|  2050 | 100% - net zero | 6,000 residuals | 6,000 | 2,924,000  |

Note: The City's official 2019 baseline of 2.93 MtCO₂e covers energy-related emissions in buildings, transport, and local industry, plus agriculture. Waste-sector emissions (~85 ktCO₂e in 2019) are reported separately, consistent with SECAP methodology. They are fully addressed in the pathways and residuals strategy but not counted in the 2.93 Mt baseline.

# 3.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways – summary

In developing Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways, Zagreb focuses on front-loading reductions by 2030, closing the ambition gap through a gap-closing portfolio of measures in the built environment (deep renovations, heat pumps, district heating decarbonisation, rooftop PV) and transport (public fleet electrification, modal shift, private EV adoption, freight decarbonisation).

These mitigation pathways are complemented by adaptation scenarios, ensuring that all major infrastructure transformations are climate-proofed against extreme weather, flooding, heatwaves, and other climate risks.

The integrated pathway ensures that:

Mitigation actions reduce emissions by ~90% by 2030.

Residual emissions (~293 kt in 2030) are neutralised through a residuals and removals strategy.

Adaptation measures safeguard infrastructure and communities, embedding resilience into the city's long-term climate neutrality framework.

This approach positions City of Zagreb not only to meet its 2050 neutrality target, but to act as an EU frontrunner city by achieving net climate neutrality already in 2030.

# Credibility and Achievability of the Scenario

The proposed modelled scenario is grounded in transparent assumptions, sector-specific pathways, and alignment with EU and national decarbonisation frameworks. It reflects realistic adoption dynamics, available technologies, and policy commitments, while integrating financial instruments already accessible to the City of Zagreb (e.g., EIB framework loans, EU funds, national programmes). Sensitivity testing has been applied to key drivers such as technology uptake, behavioural change, and investment pacing, ensuring robustness under different future conditions. Together, these elements confirm
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

that the scenario is both credible and achievable, providing a resilient pathway to climate neutrality by 2030 in line with the EU Cities Mission.

The following is our approach.

Development of Climate Neutrality Scenarios

Baseline Scenario: The baseline reflects current trends and projections for emissions, focusing on the built environment and transport sectors as the key contributors. Local non-ETS industry plays a smaller role, while ETS-covered industry is regulated primarily at the national and EU level. This scenario provides a reference point to understand the magnitude of emission reductions required to achieve neutrality.

Mitigation and Adaptation in Synergy

Mitigation Scenarios: Alternative mitigation scenarios outline different pathways toward climate neutrality, targeting a ~90% reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to 2019. These scenarios include ambitious energy efficiency improvements, renewable energy deployment, electrification of transport, and sustainable urban development. A special focus is placed on systemic enabling measures, regulatory, financial, and institutional, which are technically prerequisites for implementation. All scenarios include a residual emissions and removals strategy, ensuring that unavoidable emissions (~293 kt in 2030) are neutralised.

Adaptation Scenarios: To address climate risks to the built environment and transport, adaptation scenarios define measures for resilience: green infrastructure, flood defences, building renovations, and land-use planning. All technical measures are designed to be climate-proofed, embedding resilience into Zagreb's mitigation actions. Zagreb has implemented climate proofing as mandatory for all city projects.

Integrated Scenarios: Zagreb integrates mitigation, adaptation, and residuals management to deliver a holistic pathway. This ensures synergies between emission reduction, resilience-building, and neutralisation through forestry, bio-based construction, blue-green infrastructure, and certified removals.

# 3. Broad Programmes and Stakeholder Enablement

The action plan presents broad programmes rather than isolated measures. Many decarbonisation actions require delivery by other stakeholders, the private sector, national government, and regional authorities. The city's role is to create enabling frameworks, incentives, and platforms for collaboration. These programmes also structure the gap-closing portfolio that delivers the 90% decarbonization by 2030.

Direct one-to-one attribution between specific actions and city implementation is not always possible, as responsibilities lie with diverse actors. However, by framing the action plan as a portfolio of programmes, the city ensures it catalyses action, facilitates coordination, and tracks progress.

# 4. Connection to Investment Plan

The action plan includes a detailed description of how emissions reductions are linked to capital-intensive measures in the investment plan. These measures, deep building renovations, district heating decarbonisation, public fleet electrification, renewable rollout and new Waste treatment Facility are scaled to deliver the ~90% emissions cut by 2030. Residual emissions are managed via the removals strategy, ensuring the broader programmes are connected to specific, measurable, and financeable actions.

# Explanation:

Implementing early policy adoptions via a horizontal approach is crucial for mainstreaming climate action and setting a strong foundation for both mitigation and adaptation efforts. These policies integrate climate considerations across all aspects of urban development, ensuring that sustainability becomes a core component of city planning and operations. For instance, adopting stringent building codes and energy performance standards not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also enhances the resilience of buildings to climate impacts, making them more energy-efficient and better prepared for future extreme weather events.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Implementing urban green spaces and zoning policies contributes to urban resilience by reducing the heat island effect, increasing biodiversity, and providing natural buffers against climate-related impacts as well as improving population's well-being. Offering incentives for renewable energy installations, such as tax credits and subsidies, promotes the widespread adoption of clean energy solutions, reducing the city's reliance on fossil fuels and lowering overall emissions. Developing comprehensive climate action plans ensures that climate goals are integrated into all city projects and initiatives, providing a clear roadmap for coordinated and effective climate action.

These early policy measures will collectively **mainstream climate action** into the city's governance framework, creating a supportive regulatory environment that encourages sustainable urban development, reduces emissions, and enhances resilience to climate impacts. By embedding climate considerations into the city's core operations and planning processes, these policies ensure long-term sustainability and resilience, benefiting both the environment and the community.

# 3.1.1 Impact Pathways – Built environment

Initial overview

|  Type | 2019 baseline | 2030 (tCO2e) | 2040 (tCO2e) | 2050 (tCO2e)  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Policy | - | 130,000 | 130,000 | 130,000  |
|  Technical | - | 1,195,000 | 1,250,000 | 1,342,000  |
|  Total | 1,472,000 | 1,325,000 | 1.380,854 | 1.472,000  |
|  Residual emissions |  | 147,000 | 100,000 | 0  |

The built environment is Zagreb's largest emitting sector, with a 2019 baseline of 1,472,517  $\mathrm{tCO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ . By 2030, the sector will deliver  $\sim 1.33$ $\mathrm{MtCO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$  of gross reductions, equivalent to a  $90\%$  decrease from baseline levels.

This transformation is enabled through a balanced portfolio of policy measures ( $\approx$ 130  $\mathrm{ktCO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ ) and technical measures ( $\approx$ 1.20  $\mathrm{MtCO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ ). Policy measures include advanced building standards, spatial development plan revisions, mandatory climate proofing, and incentive frameworks. Technical measures comprise deep building renovations, district heating decarbonisation, electrification of heating with large-scale deployment of heat pumps, rooftop PV with storage, water system modernisation, and nature-based runoff management.

Even with these ambitious measures,  $\sim 147$  ktCO $_2$ e of residual emissions remain in 2030. These are linked to transitional reliance on fossil backup in district heating, segments of the building stock that are harder to renovate, and lagging technology uptake. They represent around  $10\%$  of the sector's baseline.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

All residuals are fully neutralised under Zagreb's Residual Emissions and Removals Strategy, through urban and peri-urban forestry, bio-based construction materials, soil carbon improvements, blue-green infrastructure, and, if required, certified removals. This ensures that net emissions in the built environment are zero from 2030 onwards.

By 2040, as renovation reaches nearly the entire building stock and district heating fully transitions, residuals decline to  $\sim 100\mathrm{ktCO_2e}$ . By 2050, the sector is effectively fully decarbonised, with gross reductions equal to the baseline and no residuals remaining.

The built environment thus becomes the cornerstone of Zagreb's climate neutrality, delivering early, deep reductions, driving systemic change across energy, water, and spatial systems, and sustaining net zero from 2030 forward.

## Summary of Actions and Implementation Environment

## Strategic Vision: The Built Environment as the Foundation of Climate Neutrality and Resilience

The City of Zagreb is pursuing a comprehensive transformation of its built environment, recognising it not only as a source of emissions but also as a structural lever for systemic change. Buildings represent long-lived infrastructure that shapes energy demand, water use, mobility patterns, and vulnerability to climate impacts. For this reason, the pathway to climate neutrality places the built environment at its centre, treating it as a complex system that integrates spatial, social, and technical dimensions.

The city's strategy combines direct emissions reductions with enabling infrastructure and regulatory measures. It addresses buildings, energy and water systems, and citizen behaviour, underpinned by a governance and investment framework that is already being deployed and scaled up.

# A Phased, Resilient, and Accelerated Pathway

The built environment pathway is designed to:

Accelerate impact by 2030, achieving ~90% gross reductions (~1.33 MtCO₂e) relative to the 2019 baseline.
Sustain progress into 2040, reducing residuals to ~100 ktCO₂e as district heating fully transitions and renovation reaches the bulk of the building stock.
Consolidate full decarbonisation by 2050, with gross reductions equalling the baseline and all residuals eliminated.

This transformation is driven by a diverse but coherent portfolio of measures:

Comprehensive renovation of public, residential, and service buildings, eliminating fossil fuel use and improving efficiency through envelope upgrades, digital controls, and advanced standards.
Expansion and decarbonisation of district heating, shifting to geothermal, solar thermal, industrial-scale heat pumps, and waste heat, supported by network revitalisation and user switching from individual gas boilers.
Electrification of heating with the large-scale rollout of heat pumps, particularly in gas-dependent buildings, supported by financial incentives and workforce capacity building.
Public lighting modernisation, converting the entire stock to smart LED systems, with IoT-readiness for systemic sensor deployment.
Installation of rooftop solar PV and on-site storage, prioritising public facilities and large rooftops, scaling to at least 150 MWp by 2030.
Deployment of district cooling systems in dense urban areas to address rising cooling demand sustainably.
Revitalisation of the urban water system, with pump upgrades, energy recovery, efficiency measures, and integration of solar power.
Nature-based runoff management, including green roofs, permeable surfaces, and retention basins, reducing flood risk and energy demand in drainage systems.
Smart energy and water management systems, enabling real-time monitoring, efficiency optimisation, and demand response.
Climate Neutrality
Action Plan

Behavioural and awareness campaigns, promoting energy and water efficiency, low-carbon lifestyles, and citizen participation.
Green urban development strategy actions, reinforcing building measures through spatial planning, regulatory tools, and participatory governance.

## Residual Emissions and Modelling Assumptions

Even after full deployment of these measures, ~147 ktCO₂e of residual emissions remain in 2030, primarily from transitional district heating and hard-to-abate segments of the building stock. These are fully neutralised through Zagreb's Residual Emissions and Removals Strategy, ensuring net zero in 2030.

All measures are grounded in emission reduction modelling, based on Croatia's Long-Term Renovation Strategy, Zagreb's SECAP, district heating decarbonisation plans, and supporting EU technical studies.

## Spatial planning as a structural enabler of 90% by 2030

The transformation of Zagreb's built environment is anchored in the revision of the General Urban Development Plan (GUP). The new "Green GUP" structurally embeds mitigation, adaptation, and residuals management into the city's spatial and regulatory frameworks. It provides the long-term certainty and alignment required to reach ~90% emission reductions in the built environment by 2030. Specifically, the Green GUP will:

Integrate energy and climate objectives directly into zoning, density, and mobility frameworks;
Reserve space for district heating expansion and renewables infrastructure (solar, geothermal, heat pumps);
Designate green belts, permeable areas, and blue-green corridors as verified carbon sinks to neutralise residual emissions;
Restrict development in climate-sensitive areas such as floodplains;
Mandate green-blue infrastructure and passive cooling strategies for new developments and major retrofits;
Enable compact, walkable, mixed-use urban form that reduces energy demand from transport and buildings.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

By mainstreaming climate action into urban planning, the city unlocks synergies between land use, infrastructure, and decarbonisation, ensuring that spatial governance underpins both mitigation and the Residual Emissions and Removals Strategy.

## Green Deal—aligned standards and climate—proof design

Zagreb has adopted Green Deal Design Guidelines for new construction and for the renovation of existing buildings. These guidelines exceed minimum national standards and are fully aligned with the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) recast and the Renovation Wave. They establish:

A sustainable building approach, incorporating passive design and resilient construction;
Integration of on-site renewables, nature-based solutions, and circular construction methods that lock carbon into materials;
Mandatory climate proofing and "Do No Significant Harm" (DNSH) assessments for all projects.

These guidelines are mandatory for municipal projects and promoted to the private sector through permitting and technical assistance. They are a critical driver of the scaled renovation and technology deployment needed to close the ~736 kt gap to 90% reductions by 2030.

## Climate proofing and adaptation co-benefits

All technical measures are designed not only to cut emissions but also to strengthen resilience against climate impacts. Climate proofing is embedded in design, construction, and operations, ensuring durability and protection of investments. Buildings and infrastructure are systematically adapted to:

Heatwaves, through passive design (natural ventilation, solar shading, reflective surfaces, green roofs) that reduce indoor temperatures and cooling demand;
Urban and pluvial flooding, via stormwater management, permeable pavements, vegetated swales, and rain gardens;
Climate Neutrality
Action Plan

Water scarcity, through greywater reuse, rainwater harvesting, and efficient appliances;
Extreme weather, with stronger facades, roofs, and glazing against wind, hail, snow, and heat stress.

Many of these measures contribute directly to the Residual Emissions Strategy e.g., green roofs, permeable surfaces, and blue-green infrastructure are counted as verified local sinks.

## Implementation risks and systemic responses

Achieving 90% emission reductions by 2030 requires rapid scaling of renovations, technology deployment, and financing. Zagreb recognises key risks but is addressing them through systemic solutions:

Workforce shortages: Accelerated curricula, certification, and training with vocational schools, chambers, and universities to expand capacity in renovation, heat pump installation, energy auditing, and adaptive design.
Low renovation uptake in multi-owner buildings: Expansion of one-stop-shop models offering legal, financial, and technical support to homeowner associations and cooperatives, streamlining procedures and procurement.
Technology performance and investor hesitancy: Post-renovation monitoring and verification of energy savings, comfort, and resilience, supported by feedback loops to strengthen investor and resident confidence.
Affordability and financing barriers: Integration with national subsidies, RRF and Cohesion Policy funds, and deployment of ESCOs, revolving funds, and performance-based PPPs to unlock private capital.
Procurement inefficiencies: Adoption of framework agreements and cluster-based procurement to aggregate demand and reduce transaction costs.

These measures turn risks into drivers of green jobs, innovation, and inclusion, supporting a just transition.

# Opportunity-driven transition

The built environment transition is not only an emissions reduction effort but also a driver of social and economic change. It is expected to:

Create new skilled jobs in renovation, renewable technologies, smart systems, and green materials;
Stimulate SME growth in construction and energy services;
Foster youth reskilling into future-fit green professions;
Improve comfort, health, and safety for residents, particularly in low-income communities.

# Institutional architecture and stakeholder engagement

Zagreb's governance model recognises that decarbonisation is a city-wide endeavour, requiring joint ownership by municipal institutions, utilities, building owners, private companies, and civil society. The City coordinates strategy, regulations, and public investment, while stakeholders lead implementation:

Public building owners and operators implement deep renovation and apply design guidelines.
District heating operators (HEP Toplinarstvo) and electricity distributors decarbonise and expand thermal and power grids.
Water utilities modernise systems and integrate renewables.
Homeowner associations and cooperatives unlock large-scale renovations in multi-residential buildings.
ESCOs, contractors, and technology providers deliver projects under innovative frameworks.
Universities and vocational institutions build workforce capacity and co-design solutions.
Civil society engages communities, ensuring inclusiveness, equity, and acceptance.

Flagship projects such as Zagrebački Sunčani Krovovi ("Zagreb Solar Roofs"), developed with REGEA, demonstrate this governance model in practice, installing municipal PV capacity while catalysing private rooftop investment through a digital solar mapping platform.

## Financial and institutional readiness

Zagreb demonstrates robust financial and institutional capacity. Key pillars include:

EIB framework loans, already financing public building renovations, system modernisation, and integrated climate investments. These loans enable programmatic delivery, bundling projects, phasing investments, and ensuring compliance with EU green finance standards.
Alignment with national and EU funding (RRF, Cohesion Policy 2021–2027) for energy efficiency, DH decarbonisation, resilience, and circular construction.
Innovative finance, such as aggregated renovation models, ESCO contracts, revolving funds, and green loan facilities.

This layered financing strategy ensures diversification, scalability, and resilience of funding streams, directly linked to the delivery of 90% emission reductions by 2030 and the neutralisation of residuals through verified local sinks and removals.

Overview of emissions reduction per measure till full decarbonization in 2030 is given in the table below, without residuals – 90% decrease.

Despite achieving ~90% gross reductions in the built environment by 2030, approximately 147,000 tCO₂e of residual emissions remain. These residuals are primarily linked to transitional reliance on fossil-based backup in district heating systems, segments
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

of the building stock that are technically or financially harder to renovate by 2030, and lagging uptake of new heating technologies. Rather than being left unmanaged, these emissions are addressed through Zagreb's Residual Emissions and Removals Strategy, which combines verified local sinks (urban and peri-urban forestry, soil carbon improvements, blue-green infrastructure), carbon-storing construction materials, and, if needed, certified EU removals. This ensures that residuals are fully neutralised and that the built environment reaches net zero already in 2030, while continuing to shrink residuals to ~100 kt by 2040 and eliminating them entirely by 2050.

## Assumptions and data sources

The emissions reduction model for Zagreb's built environment is based on sector-specific mitigation measures and reflects the city's accelerated pathway towards a 90% reduction by 2030, followed by the progressive elimination of residual emissions by 2050. The modelling combines technical interventions, policy instruments, investment estimates, and projected decarbonisation impacts across all building segments.

For public buildings, covering around 2.7 million m², the model assumes that by 2030 the stock will undergo deep renovation, achieving energy savings of at least 80 kWh per m² per year. At least 70% of energy demand in these buildings is expected to be supplied from renewable sources, setting a benchmark for the wider sector. In the service sector, which includes approximately 6.2 million m² of commercial and institutional space, at least half of the stock is assumed to be renovated by 2030 to medium- or deep-renovation standards, delivering energy savings of 50–70% depending on depth. The residential sector, which comprises 36.6 million m² of housing, is assumed to achieve deep renovation of 40–50% of its total area by 2030, with savings ranging from 50–70%. By 2050, the full stock is expected to meet nZEB or higher standards.

In parallel with demand reduction, the model assumes a large-scale transformation of energy supply systems. The district heating (DH) network expands significantly, connecting around 50% of households and service buildings currently using individual gas boilers by 2030. At the same time, DH decarbonisation progresses rapidly, with 80–90% of current fossil-based generation replaced by industrial heat pumps, geothermal, solar, and
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

waste heat. By 2040, DH is expected to be fully decarbonised. The model also assumes large-scale heat pump deployment, with around 200,000 households switching to electric heating by 2030. In addition, at least 150 MWp of rooftop solar PV is installed by 2030, with integrated storage deployed across public and service facilities.

Despite these ambitious measures, residual emissions of about 147 ktCO₂e are expected to remain in 2030, primarily from transitional use of fossil fuels in district heating and hard-to-renovate building segments. These residuals are explicitly integrated into the model and are neutralised through Zagreb's Residual Emissions and Removals Strategy, which combines verified local sinks (urban forestry and soils), carbon-storing construction materials, blue-green infrastructure, and certified removals. By 2040, residuals are projected to fall to ~100 ktCO₂e and are eliminated completely by 2050.

The baseline year for the modelling is 2019, with emissions calculated from energy consumption by source — electricity, natural gas, diesel, and other fuels — across households, services, and local industry. Reduction impacts are estimated per measure, drawing on Croatia's Long-Term Renovation Strategy (2020), the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) for Zagreb, studies by the Croatian Energy Institute, data and plans from HEP Toplinarstvo, geothermal potential mapping, district heating planning documents, and outputs from EU-funded projects such as D2Heat. Costs are estimated per tonne of CO₂ equivalent reduced, including both capital and operational expenditures.

# 3.1.2 Transport Sector – impact pathways

The transport sector baseline in 2019 was approximately 1.11 MtCO₂e. Under Zagreb's accelerated climate neutrality pathway, the sector will deliver ~1.01 MtCO₂e of gross reductions by 2030, equal to a 90% cut from baseline levels. The remaining ~102 ktCO₂e represent residual emissions, primarily from freight and logistics, lagging private fleet decarbonisation, and a share of municipal utility vehicles. These residuals are fully neutralised through Zagreb's Residual Emissions and Removals Strategy, ensuring the transport sector reaches net zero in 2030. Residuals are expected to fall to ~50 kt by 2040 and be eliminated by 2050.

Strategic vision. Zagreb is redefining its mobility system as clean, integrated, and people-centred, treating transport not only as a source of emissions but as a structural lever that shapes urban form, public health, and resilience. Public transport is repositioned as the backbone of the mobility system, embedded within compact, walkable neighbourhoods that reduce car dependency.

Decarbonisation pathway. The core driver of reductions is the electrification and modernisation of public transport, including the procurement of new low-floor trams and electric buses, depot upgrades with rooftop solar PV, and smart charging systems. Together, these measures deliver over half of total sectoral reductions by 2030. Complementary measures include:

Low-Emission Zones (LEZs) expanded and enforced, reducing fossil vehicle traffic in key areas;
Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) actions, integrating land-use reform with mobility planning to reduce travel demand;
Green transit corridors and priority bus lanes, improving speed and reliability of collective modes;
Shared mobility platforms integrated with public transport ticketing;
Smart multimodal hubs at key interchange points;
Municipal fleet electrification, including vans, waste collection, and utility vehicles.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

Private fleet decarbonisation remains the largest structural challenge. While the city cannot directly mandate vehicle turnover, it creates enabling conditions for rapid electrification: restricting parking in central zones, expanding charging infrastructure, integrating shared e-mobility services, and advocating for stronger national EV incentives. The strategy anticipates 300,000–400,000 private EVs in circulation by 2030, supported by compact urban development and stronger alternatives to car use.

Active mobility is mainstreamed through safe cycling corridors, bicycle superhighways linking peripheral areas to the centre, expanded e-bike sharing, and pedestrianisation. These measures provide co-benefits of reduced congestion, better air quality, and improved public health.

Climate proofing is embedded throughout: heat-resilient buses and trams, flood-protected charging substations, permeable paving and bioswales in corridors, and PV-powered depots with battery backup. These interventions ensure service continuity under extreme weather and protect the long-term emission reduction gains.

Governance and just transition. The transformation of Zagreb's transport system is coordinated through a multi-actor governance model. At its core:

ZET leads public fleet and service upgrades;
IPZP (Integrated Transport Authority) ensures synchronisation across modes (trams, buses, cycling, shared mobility, regional rail) and levels of government, aligning operations, ticketing, and planning under a single integrated framework;
Urban planning and SUMP teams align mobility and spatial planning;
REGEA and HEP support energy integration and renewable deployment;
Universities and vocational institutions drive workforce reskilling;
Civil society and NGOs ensure inclusiveness and community participation.

The transition is designed to be socially just: electrification programmes prioritise underserved areas, free public transport is secured for youth and the elderly, and tiered pricing protects affordability. Green jobs are created across maintenance, smart mobility, and infrastructure, while participatory budgeting ensures investments match community needs.

milestone. By 2030, transport emissions are reduced by ~1.01 MtCO₂e, leaving ~102 kt of residuals. Through the residuals strategy, these are neutralised, delivering net zero transport two decades ahead of EU-wide targets. By 2040 residuals are halved, and by 2050 transport is fully decarbonised.

# Assumptions and data sources: Foundations of Zagreb's transport emissions reduction modeling

The transport emissions reduction pathway developed by the City of Zagreb is built on a robust foundation of technical realism, operational experience, and international methodological standards. Each measure is modeled using data-driven assumptions grounded in existing or planned municipal initiatives, validated through sectoral benchmarks, and refined using inputs from actual procurements and implementation experience. Rather than being speculative, the model reflects the city's current transformation efforts, enhanced by conservative estimates for scaling and emissions performance.

At the heart of the model is the transition to an electrified and modernised public transport fleet, a process already well underway in Zagreb. The bus fleet electrification scenario is directly based on ZET's procurement pipeline, which includes 70 electric buses currently being acquired, supported by the EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility. The model assumes

3
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

a phased deployment of up to 500 e-buses, aligning with operational projections and city fleet planning. Emissions savings per vehicle are estimated using published values from the IEA Global EV Outlook and urban fleet case studies, assuming average operational hours, energy efficiency improvements, and Zagreb's electricity grid decarbonisation trajectory.

Similarly, the assumption of deploying 100 energy-efficient low-floor trams is drawn from the city's ongoing fleet renewal with Končar Electric Vehicles. These new-generation trams are expected to deliver significant energy savings and improved lifecycle emissions performance, based on manufacturer data and validation from UITP's fleet benchmarking reports. The model integrates realistic estimates of emissions savings per tram unit, calibrated against current usage patterns, line densities, and vehicle retirement schedules in Zagreb's public transport network.

To support and amplify the benefits of electrified public transport, the model incorporates measures to prioritise collective mobility within the city fabric. One such measure is the development of over 100 km of green public transit corridors, including tram and bus lanes, which are designed to increase system reliability, reduce travel times, and attract modal shift from private vehicles. Assumptions for emissions reductions in these corridors are drawn from data provided by the EU Urban Mobility Observatory and UITP case comparisons. Average emissions avoided are calculated per vehicle-kilometre reduced and adjusted for likely ridership increases.

Beyond fleet and infrastructure, the model integrates a set of policy and spatial planning measures that enable long-term behavioural shifts. A key example is the expansion of low-emission zones (LEZs), from the current single zone, covering high-traffic and high-pollution areas. Emissions reduction assumptions for this measure are based on empirical studies of similar schemes, including London's ULEZ (cited via ICCT 2021) and other European examples. Expected outcomes are scaled for Zagreb's fleet composition, urban form, and anticipated regulatory compliance rates.

The integration of smart city mobility systems, including adaptive traffic signals, AI-based traffic routing, and city-wide sensor networks, is modeled based on assumptions in the European Commission's Smart Mobility 2030 Strategy. Emissions reductions are calculated

4
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

by estimating improvements in traffic flow efficiency, reduced idling time, and lower stop-start frequency, particularly during peak congestion periods.

Spatial planning measures are also central to the model, with Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) and transit-oriented development (TOD) treated not as standalone policies but as structural enablers of system-wide emissions reductions. The model assumes the integration of TOD principles at key nodes, particularly where new tram or bus infrastructure intersects with residential and commercial development. Emissions impacts are derived from shifts in trip length, vehicle kilometres travelled, and mode share, based on ELTIS Urban Planning Guidelines and validated urban mobility studies.

A key pillar of the pathway is the active mobility component, encompassing both infrastructure and behavioural enablers. The model assumes the citywide rollout of a bike-sharing and e-scooter programme, over a 10-year horizon. Emissions reduction assumptions are based on modal substitution for short trips (less than 5 km), derived from ICLEI's Mobility Atlas and EU cycling modal share studies. These programs are supported by the expansion of safe, segregated cycling corridors and connected pedestrian infrastructure, modeled as emissions-reducing through avoided car trips and increased access to public transport stations.

Further assumptions address emerging areas of urban transport transformation. The model includes a scenario for dynamic road pricing, applied to two zones within the city, inspired by Stockholm's congestion pricing framework. Emissions impacts are calculated using elasticity estimates for vehicle use reduction and time-of-day pricing incentives. Similarly, urban logistics zones and consolidation hubs are modeled to reduce last-mile delivery vehicle activity in the inner city, based on the EU's Smart Urban Logistics guidelines and local pilot projects.

The single largest source of modeled reductions is the decarbonisation of the private vehicle fleet, an area not directly controlled by the city but critically important to its climate goals. The model estimates the transition of approximately 292,500 vehicles to electric powertrains by 2050, referencing IEA's Global EV Outlook 2023 and national projections for EV adoption. Emissions reductions are calculated using fleet turnover rates, average emissions factors for conventional vehicles, and Zagreb's urban driving profile. While the city does not set

Climate Neutrality
Action Plan
C

national standards or subsidies, this measure is included to represent the importance of enabling infrastructure, behavioural incentives, and advocacy for national support.

Across all measures, the modeling approach adheres to principles of technical realism, institutional capacity alignment, and policy coherence. Where possible, assumptions are validated against actual procurement processes, operational data, or city planning documents. Where no local precedent exists, European comparators and peer-reviewed guidelines are used to ensure conservative and credible estimates.

The primary sources of data used in constructing the assumptions include:

City of Zagreb and ZET procurement records and implementation reports, particularly for bus and tram fleet upgrades and depot modernization;
IEA Global EV Outlook 2023, UITP performance benchmarks, and national transport decarbonisation strategy documents;
EU Smart Mobility 2030 Strategy, Urban Mobility Observatory, ELTIS, and ICLEI publications for behavioral and spatial impact parameters;
London ULEZ (via ICCT), Stockholm congestion pricing, and EU cycling and walking infrastructure data for policy interventions and modal shift;
Technical documentation from Končar Electric Vehicles, operational experience with shared mobility platforms (e.g., Nextbike), and pilot projects in low-emission logistics.

This layered, evidence-based modeling framework ensures that Zagreb's transport pathway is not only ambitious, but replicable, verifiable, and grounded in the city's real capacity to deliver transition outcomes by 2030 and beyond.

NOTE: Zagreb airport, eventhough it is called Zagreb airport, is not situated in Zagreb administrative area, but outside of it! That is why it is not considered in the CCC workout.

Improved reliability and durability of rail and power systems
Reduced service disruptions, enhanced safety, and long-term sustainability

Explanation:

Implementing these early adoption measures in the transport sector is essential for several reasons. Firstly, transitioning to electric buses and deploying energy-efficient trams significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, directly combating climate change. The installation of solar panels and energy storage systems at depots and tram stations not only cuts operational costs but also enhances resilience to power outages, ensuring uninterrupted service. Real-time passenger information systems and contactless payment methods improve efficiency and user experience, encouraging greater public transport use, which further reduces emissions. Additionally, smart traffic signal priority and comprehensive maintenance programs enhance the reliability and longevity of transport assets, optimising their performance. Modernising the energy network for trams and increasing the resilience of the rail and electricity network ensure the infrastructure can withstand future climate impacts, reducing service disruptions and enhancing safety. Collectively, these measures create a more sustainable, efficient, and resilient urban transport system, improving the overall quality of life and setting a strong foundation for future climate action.

# Explanation:

Implementing these mid-term measures in the transport sector focuses on leveraging advanced technologies and assets to enhance sustainability and resilience. Expanding the electrified public transport fleet and developing a comprehensive EV charging network will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. Integrated ticketing systems and upgraded infrastructure will increase efficiency and convenience, promoting higher public transport usage. Autonomous electric vehicles and resilient infrastructure projects will enhance safety and reliability. Smart grids and energy management systems will optimise energy use, while low-emission zones and green corridors will further reduce emissions and improve urban livability. These measures collectively support a more efficient, environmentally friendly, and resilient urban transport system.

As part of Zagreb's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promoting sustainable urban mobility, the Climate City Contract outlines a comprehensive strategy to transform the transport sector. Through a combination of regulatory measures, infrastructure investments, technological innovation, and public engagement, these initiatives will create a modern, low-carbon, and resilient transportation system.

## 3.1.3 Waste – From Liability to Circular Asset

Strategic vision: waste as part of climate neutrality

Although waste is not included in Zagreb's official baseline inventory (2.93 MtCO₂e in 2019), the city is proactively addressing ~85 ktCO₂e of landfill and wastewater emissions through the development of the new Waste Management Centre (CGO Resnik) and the Zagreb Water Supply and Wastewater improvement project (UPOV). By 2030, this will reduce waste-sector residuals to ~25 ktCO₂e, which are fully integrated into the Residual Emissions and Removals Strategy. These residuals are **fully neutralised** through Zagreb's Residual Emissions and Removals Strategy, ensuring the waste sector emissions are eliminated by 2050.

Waste accounts for a smaller share of Zagreb's territorial GHG emissions compared to buildings and transport, but it remains strategically important due to its link to methane (CH₄) emissions from landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste and wastewater sludge. In 2019, total waste-sector emissions were ~85,000 tCO₂e. If added to the baseline inventory, this would correspond to ~3% of citywide emissions. These emissions derive mainly from landfill methane at Jakuševec (~70,000 tCO₂e as the landfill has an active gas recovery and cover but not perfect capture), wastewater treatment (~15,000 tCO₂e), and smaller contributions from waste collection and treatment facilities.

Without intervention, these emissions would persist, as methane generation from legacy landfilled waste continues for decades. The planned **Centar za gospodaranje otpadom Zagreb (CGO Resnik)** – Waste management centre is therefore critical for Zagreb's climate neutrality pathway, as it replaces reliance on Jakuševec landfill with a modern **Recovery** and recycle facility (mechanical-biological treatment (MBT) and recycling centre), fully enclosed and compliant with EU standards.

## Future Integration of Waste Sector Emissions

While the waste sector is currently treated separately from Zagreb's official baseline and target, the city recognises the importance of ensuring consistency across all emitting sectors. In future iterations of the Climate City Contract, waste-sector emissions will be fully
Climate Neutrality
Action Plan
8

embedded in the baseline inventory and treated on equal footing with buildings, transport, and industry. This will strengthen transparency, improve comparability, and ensure that waste-related reductions directly contribute to Zagreb's overall climate neutrality pathway.

## Mitigation impact and residuals

Based on design concepts presented in the public hearing and EIA documentation, the CGO Zagreb is expected to handle up to ~400,000 tonnes/year of municipal waste at 2030 (both for City of Zagreb and neighbouring Zagreb County), with:

~58,000 tonnes/year biowaste treated through composting/anaerobic stabilisation;
~50,000 tonnes/year bulky waste sorted and processed;
~250,000 tonnes/year recyclables and mixed fractions processed via mechanical separation and recovery;
RDF/SRF produced from non-recyclable residues.

The mitigation effects are estimated as:

Avoided landfill methane: ~45,000–55,000 tCO₂e/year by diverting organics and stabilising residuals.
Improved landfill gas capture: ~5,000–8000 tCO₂e/year from upgrading collection at Jakuševec.
Material/energy recovery credits: ~5,000–20,000 tCO₂e/year from recycling and SRF displacing fossil fuels.

Net impact: 50,000–70,000 tCO₂e/year avoided, reducing waste-sector emissions by ~70%.

By 2030, waste-sector residual emissions are projected at ~20,000–35,000 tCO₂e, mostly coming from wastewater CH₄/N₂O and minor fugitives from composting. These residuals are integrated into Zagreb's Residual Emissions and Removals Strategy, neutralised through blue-green infrastructure, soil carbon enhancement, and certified removals if required.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

Climate proofing is embedded in the preparation of waste and wastewater treatment projects, ensuring long term service continuity and environmental protection under future extreme weather conditions.

## Assumptions and data sources

The waste-sector model is based on:

2019 baseline: derived from IPCC waste-sector inventory methods and Croatia's national GHG inventory, scaled to Zagreb's waste generation (~400,000 tonnes MSW/year).
Methane emissions: estimated using first-order decay (FOD) factors for biowaste fractions, consistent with IPCC 2006 Guidelines. Local analysis indicates ~127,680 tCO₂e methane potential from Zagreb's biowaste; with 50% LFG capture, net is ~63,800 tCO₂e — consistent with reported landfill emissions.
CGO Resnik design parameters: drawn from the public EIA documentation (2025 hearing), including treatment capacities for biowaste, bulky waste, and recyclables.
Capture efficiency: landfill gas capture increases from ~50% today to 80% post-CGO integration.
Recycling and SRF credits: calculated conservatively using EU LIFE project benchmarks, assuming displacement of virgin materials and fossil fuels at 0.3–0.5 tCO₂e/tonne of recovered fraction.
Operational footprint: CGO electricity and logistics estimated at ~2,000 tCO₂e/year, assuming grid factors in line with Croatia's 2030 electricity mix.

## Governance and planning integration

The Zagreb Waste Management Center is coordinated as a joint recovery and recycling facility of the City of Zagreb and Zagreb County, as required by the National Waste Management Plan adopted by the Government of the Republic of Croatia. Both City of Zagreb and Zagreb County will implement behavioural and awareness campaigns promoting waste reduction, proper separation and recycling, circular economy practices, and active citizen participation in sustainable waste management.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The CGO Zagreb is embedded in the Green General Urban Plan (GUP) as strategic infrastructure and integrated with peri-urban green belts, wetlands, and agro-ecological corridors, ensuring coherence between waste management and land-based neutralisation. Its development is being conducted transparently, with a public hearing (2025) and formal EIA procedures.

## Financing and circular economy role

The CGO will be financed through EU Cohesion Policy 2021–2027, the RRF, and potential EIB support. By producing compost, recyclables, and SRF, CGO Zagreb advances the circular economy, turning waste from a liability into a resource.

## Residuals strategy for waste and Outlook

2030: Waste-sector residuals are reduced to ~25,000 tCO₂e, ensuring alignment with the city's overarching net-zero commitment. The residuals strategy follows a tiered approach, integrating both nature-based and technological solutions tailored to the sector's unique emission profile. The allocation is as follows:

Forestry and Soils: Used to absorb emissions from waste decomposition processes and legacy landfill sites, leveraging natural carbon sinks.
Blue-Green Infrastructure: Integrated into urban and peri-urban waste treatment facilities, such as composting sites and anaerobic digestion plants, to enhance climate resilience and provide additional carbon capture.
Circular Economy and Bio-Based Systems: The city will prioritize upstream measures—minimizing waste generation, promoting reuse, and expanding compostable and recyclable material streams—to reduce the volume of residuals and embed carbon in long-lived materials.
Certified EU Removals: Utilized only as a last resort for emissions that cannot be addressed through local or nature-based means, maintaining credibility and transparency.

2040: Waste residuals decline below ~15,000 tCO₂e, through wastewater upgrades and further recycling. However, the significance of the sector extends beyond emissions reductions as waste management is increasingly recognized as a lever for circular economy innovation, resource efficiency, and green job creation.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Zagreb's strategic approach will align its waste policies with EU and SDG frameworks, transforming waste flows into value chains through innovation in sorting, recovery, and bio-based material cycles.

: Waste sector effectively climate-neutral, with residuals balanced entirely by local sinks.

## 3.1.4 Industry – reflection

Strategic vision: Industry as both a challenge and an opportunity

Although Zagreb's industrial sector is smaller in emissions compared with the built environment and transport, it remains a critical component of the city's climate neutrality pathway. Industry is simultaneously a source of residual emissions and an enabler of solutions that benefit other sectors, such as district heating decarbonisation, circular construction, and renewable integration. The city's strategy is therefore not to treat industry as a marginal problem, but to elevate it as a strategic pillar of climate action, green growth, and resilience.

Baseline and residual challenge

In 2019, industrial emissions accounted for an estimated ~330,000 tCO₂e, of which most were covered under national or EU regulation. By 2030, industry in Zagreb is projected to deliver ~298,000 tCO₂e in gross reductions, leaving approximately 32,000 tCO₂e as residual emissions. These residuals arise primarily from non-ETS processes, smaller facilities, and sectors with slower technology turnover. They are explicitly integrated into the city's Residual Emissions and Removals Strategy, ensuring that industry also reaches net zero by 2030.

Regulatory and corporate foundations

Zagreb's industrial pathway builds on strong regulatory foundations: the EU ETS and the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) create a carbon pricing and BAT framework, while Croatia's NECP and circular economy strategies provide additional incentives. However, corporate climate strategies are increasingly the driving force of change. Teva,
Climate Neutrality
Action Plan
C

Končar, Dalekovod, and MOL/INA have all adopted science-based targets, ESG reporting, and decarbonisation roadmaps, which are directly shaping investment decisions in Zagreb. These companies are not just reducing their own emissions but also delivering low-carbon solutions to other sectors: trams, smart grids, renewables, and circular products.

## City as an active enabler

Even though the city has limited regulatory powers over industry, it plays a proactive enabling role:

The Green General Urban Plan (GUP) reserves zones for clean industry, renewables, and logistics hubs.
Industrial waste heat recovery is being integrated into the district heating decarbonisation programme.
SME support mechanisms, co-designed with REGEA, the Chamber of Economy, and universities, provide audits, transition roadmaps, and access to EU funds.
Innovation ecosystems such as living labs and Horizon Europe pilots create testbeds for industrial circularity and low-carbon technologies.

Through these levers, Zagreb aims not only to facilitate compliance but also to accelerate industrial transformation beyond minimum legal requirements.

## Industry as a driver of circularity and innovation

Zagreb's industrial actors are already central to the city's circular and green economy transition:

Circular material flows: packaging recovery, industrial symbiosis, and green chemistry.
District heating support: harvesting waste heat from industrial processes.
Clean logistics: adoption of electric delivery fleets and participation in urban low-emission zones.
Green manufacturing: Končar's electrification systems and Dalekovod's renewable integration projects.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

These actions show that industry is not only a source of emissions but a provider of solutions for Zagreb's climate neutrality.

## Residuals strategy for industry

By 2030, the ~50 ktCO₂e of industrial residuals will be fully neutralised. The allocation is designed as follows:

Forestry and soils: absorbing process emissions that cannot yet be avoided.
Blue-green infrastructure: integrated into industrial zones, providing carbon sinks and climate resilience.
Bio-based construction materials and circular production: embedding carbon storage in buildings and supply chains.
Certified EU removals: deployed only if necessary as a last resort.

This ensures that industry plays its part in the citywide residuals strategy (293 kt total) and does not compromise Zagreb's 2030 net-zero commitment.

## Outlook: focus on industry as a strategic pillar

By 2040, industrial residuals are expected to fall to ~30 kt, and by 2050 they are eliminated. But the importance of industry goes beyond its own emissions. It is a driver of green jobs, technology development, and competitiveness. Zagreb's forward-looking approach is to make industry not just compliant but climate-leading, aligning it with SDGs and EU Mission Cities ambitions.

In sum, Zagreb's industrial pathway combines national law, corporate ambition, municipal enabling, and residuals neutralisation. The city will place greater focus on industry in the next phase of its transition, ensuring that this sector is both a net-zero contributor by 2030 and a catalyst for innovation, circularity, and green growth.

## Industrial Emissions and Credibility of the Pathway

In 2019, Zagreb's industrial sector emitted approximately 330 ktCO₂e, stemming mainly from large installations covered by the EU ETS (refining and petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, electrical equipment, and heavy manufacturing), which account for the
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

majority of emissions. A further 20–25% arises from medium and small facilities outside ETS, primarily food processing, light manufacturing, and logistics, while a smaller share (&lt;10%) is linked to industrial processes and product use (IPPU) such as solvents, chemicals, and refrigerants. This mix highlights the need to clarify whether the city's industrial accounting covers only stationary energy emissions or also includes IPPU and F-gases, as this materially affects the baseline and targets.

The projected -85% reduction by 2030 is considered credible because most reductions will result from EU ETS compliance and the Industrial Emissions Directive, which enforce decarbonisation trajectories on large emitters. Major industrial actors in Zagreb - Teva, Končar, Dalekovod, MOL/INA are already implementing science-based targets, ESG reporting, and low-carbon investment programmes, which reinforce the delivery of reductions and also provide solutions for other sectors, such as district heating, renewable integration, and circular construction materials. The city complements these regulatory and corporate drivers with enabling measures: zoning for clean industry, integrating waste heat into district heating, providing SME transition support, and fostering innovation through living labs and EU pilot projects.

By 2030, residual industrial emissions are expected to fall to around $50\mathrm{ktCO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$, mainly from non-ETS facilities and slower-turnover processes. These are explicitly integrated into the Residual Emissions and Removals Strategy, where they will be neutralised through forestry and soils, blue-green infrastructure, bio-based materials, and certified EU removals as a last resort. Taken together, these elements provide a coherent, credible, and achievable pathway for Zagreb's industry to reach net zero by 2030, while positioning the sector as a driver of green jobs, innovation, and competitiveness.

# 3.1.5 Agriculture

Agriculture and climate neutrality: small footprint, systemic significance

Agriculture in Zagreb accounts for a modest share of the city's greenhouse gas emissions – around 12,000 tCO₂e in 2019– but its role in the climate transition is disproportionately important. Emissions come primarily from livestock methane, nitrous oxide from fertilisers, and diesel use in machinery. While the sector is numerically small compared with transport or buildings, it is uniquely tied to land stewardship, food security, peri-urban resilience, and carbon sequestration potential.

By 2030, agricultural emissions are expected to remain at ~12 ktCO₂e, reflecting the hard-to-abate nature of biological methane and nitrous oxide. These are treated as residual emissions, explicitly included in Zagreb's citywide residuals pool (~293 ktCO₂e in 2030). Unlike other sectors, however, agriculture also acts as a provider of neutralisation capacity, through soil carbon sequestration, agroforestry, and nature-based practices that can offset residuals from buildings, transport, and industry.

# Legislative and governance framework

Agricultural emissions are governed primarily by Croatia's Law on Climate Change and Protection of the Ozone Layer (2025), the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP 2021-2030), and the Sustainable Agriculture Strategy (2020-2030). These are complemented by the CAP Strategic Plan, which links subsidies and eco-schemes to climate performance.

Within this framework, the City of Zagreb plays an enabling role. Through the Green General Urban Development Plan (GUP), the city protects peri-urban farmland and green belts from urban encroachment, conserving soil carbon sinks and maintaining ecological corridors in areas such as Brezovica, Sesvete, and the Sava corridor. Land-use planning is used to safeguard carbon-rich agricultural areas and integrate them with the city's broader green-blue infrastructure strategy.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

# Enabling practices and partnerships

Although Zagreb cannot directly regulate agricultural emissions, it actively supports farmers and cooperatives in adopting climate-smart practices that reduce emissions and increase removals, including:

No-till and reduced tillage to preserve soil carbon;
Organic amendments and composting, replacing synthetic fertilisers;
Improved manure management, reducing methane leakage;
Agroforestry and hedgerows, boosting sequestration and biodiversity;
Efficient irrigation and water reuse, building resilience to drought.

These practices are supported by partnerships with the Faculty of Agriculture, the Zagreb Development Agency, and farmer associations, ensuring access to EU eco-schemes and technical expertise.

# Agriculture in the circular economy and resilience agenda

Agriculture connects directly to Zagreb's circular economy by transforming residues into compost, biogas, and soil enhancers, closing nutrient loops and linking peri-urban farms to urban metabolism. Agricultural landscapes provide adaptation co-benefits, buffering floods, enhancing biodiversity, and securing local food production. In this way, agriculture is not only a small emitter but a systemic enabler of resilience and sustainability.

# Residuals strategy for agriculture

By 2030, Zagreb's agriculture will emit  $\sim 12\mathrm{ktCO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ , all of which are residuals. These are neutralised through:

Soil carbon sequestration (cover crops, organic amendments, carbon farming);
Agroforestry and peri-urban tree planting integrated with farmland;
Wetland restoration and blue-green infrastructure;
EU carbon farming schemes providing financial support and MRV systems.
Climate Neutrality
Action Plan
7

This dual role, as both a source of residuals and a provider of removals, makes agriculture strategically significant. By 2040, residuals are projected to decline to ~8 kt, and by 2050 the sector balances its emissions fully, becoming a net sink.

## Outlook

Agriculture's contribution is therefore not measured in tonnes alone but in its ability to link urban and rural systems, provide land-based neutralisation, and reinforce resilience and food security. By aligning with national legislation, leveraging CAP eco-schemes, protecting farmland through spatial planning, and promoting carbon farming, Zagreb ensures that agriculture supports both residual management and the city's broader net-zero commitment by 2030.

# 3.1.6 Residual emissions and removals outline – A structural component of Zagreb’s climate pathway

## Residuals as a systemic challenge, not a side issue

Zagreb’s pathway to climate neutrality is built on deep, front-loaded reductions: by 2030 the city cuts ~90% of emissions relative to the 2019 baseline, leaving ~293 ktCO₂e of unavoidable residual emissions. These residuals are not random “leftovers,” but the structural result of technological, economic, and biological constraints: transitional fossil back-up in district heating, incomplete private fleet turnover, industrial processes beyond city control, biological methane and nitrous oxide in agriculture, and methane from legacy waste management.

If unmanaged, these emissions would undermine the credibility of the 2030 neutrality target. For this reason, Zagreb treats residuals as a strategic category in their own right, not as an afterthought. Residuals are explicitly embedded into the Green General Urban Development Plan (Green GUP), the Green Deal Building Design Standards, and the city’s governance architecture, ensuring that neutralisation is spatially planned, technically standardised, and institutionally anchored.

## Anchoring residuals in spatial planning (Green GUP)

The revision of the General Urban Development Plan (GUP) is a cornerstone of the residuals strategy. The new “Green GUP” operationalises neutrality by:

Designating green belts, agroforestry zones, and peri-urban corridors as verified carbon sinks. These areas serve both as buffers against urban sprawl and as active carbon-absorbing landscapes.
Embedding nature-based solutions (green roofs, permeable pavements, retention basins, wetland restoration) directly into land-use rules, so that every new development contributes to carbon sequestration and resilience.
Reserving space for bio-based industries and materials banks, linking industrial land use with carbon storage in construction materials.
Climate Neutrality
Action Plan

Integrating soil carbon management into zoning for peri-urban agriculture, ensuring that CAP eco-schemes and carbon farming projects are spatially aligned with the city plan.

Through these instruments, residual neutralisation is literally "written into the map" of Zagreb's future.

## Standards as guarantors of permanence and quality

Residual management is also codified in Zagreb's Green Deal Design Guidelines. These go beyond national minimum standards and require:

Mandatory climate proofing of all new projects, ensuring resilience and preventing "lock-in" of new emissions.
Integration of on-site carbon sinks (timber structures, green roofs, passive vegetation) as standard design elements.
Circular construction and bio-based materials, turning the building stock into a carbon storage asset rather than a source.
Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) and EU taxonomy alignment, ensuring that removals will be permanent, verifiable, and financially credible.

These standards ensure that neutralisation is not speculative but embedded into regulated construction, renovation, and infrastructure practice.

## Institutional architecture and governance

Residuals are governed through the city's Climate Cockpit. Residuals are not outsourced but integrated into the city's monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) system, ensuring:

Annual residual emissions inventories by sector (built environment, transport, industry, agriculture, waste).
MRV protocols for removals aligned with the forthcoming EU Carbon Removal Certification Framework.
Climate Neutrality
Action Plan

Cross-departmental ownership: spatial planning, utilities, waste operator, environment, and finance all share accountability.
Public transparency: residuals and removals tracked on a public dashboard alongside emissions reductions.

This governance model ensures no "hidden offsets", but transparent, accountable neutralisation of residuals.

## Financing residuals through mainstream investment

Residual management is financed as an integral part of Zagreb's climate investment strategy, not as an add-on:

EIB framework loans include financing for urban greening, waste infrastructure, and nature-based measures.
Cohesion Policy 2021–2027 and RRF funds support carbon farming, wetlands, and the new CGO Resnik.
Private capital and ESCO models are mobilised for bio-based construction and materials banks.
Farmers and cooperatives benefit from CAP eco-schemes and carbon farming pilots, with the city facilitating uptake.

Residual neutralisation is thus structurally financed through the same channels as mitigation, ensuring permanence.

## Social and economic co-benefits

Neutralising residuals delivers more than carbon balance:

Jobs: forestry, agroforestry, regenerative farming, timber construction, waste-to-resource value chains, and nature-based solutions create local employment.
Resilience: green corridors, wetlands, and permeable surfaces reduce flood and heat risks.
Equity: peri-urban farmers gain new income streams from carbon farming; communities benefit from reduced landfill impacts and modern waste services.

0
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Urban quality: new green infrastructure improves health, biodiversity, and provides recreational opportunities.

## Outlook: phasing down residuals, phasing up local removals

Residuals are not permanent. By 2040, they shrink to ~158 kt; by 2050, only ~6 kt remain. At the same time, local removal capacity grows as forestry, soils, bio-based materials, waste valorisation, and blue-green infrastructure mature. By mid-century, Zagreb aims to cover all residuals within its own territory, phasing out reliance on certified EU removals.

## Future Detailing of the Residual Emissions and Removals Strategy

The City of Zagreb acknowledges that the Residual Emissions and Removals Strategy must continue to evolve to ensure long-term credibility. In future iterations of the Climate City Contract, the City will make explicit that all residual emissions will be fully compensated by 2030 and will provide a quantified assessment of each neutralisation option, including the expected potential of tree planting, kilometres of green belts, hectares of agroforestry zones, and other nature-based solutions. Timelines, responsible actors, and safeguards against carbon reversals (including design buffers and conservative accounting rules) will also be detailed. Finally, the City will clarify the circumstances under which certified removals may be used, ensuring transparency, permanence, and consistency with EU frameworks.

This ensures that neutrality is not only achieved in 2030 but sustained long-term, with residuals managed in a way that is spatially anchored, socially just, and institutionally credible.

The City of Zagreb recognises that several actions in this Climate City Contract are currently described at a programmatic level. In future iterations, the City will enhance the maturity and specificity of each action by defining concrete measures, spatial scope (e.g. number of buildings renovated, kilometres of transport corridors developed, locations of blue-green infrastructure etc.), implementation timelines, and responsible actors.

## 3.3 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

The performance will be tracked through a robust set of indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) in our Climate City Contract. That is essential for several reasons. Firstly, these indicators provide a systematic way to track progress towards climate goals, ensuring that the city remains on course to meet its commitments to greenhouse gas reduction, energy efficiency, and renewable energy adoption, as well as to increase resilience. Secondly, they enable the identification of gaps and areas for improvement, allowing for timely interventions and adjustments to strategies and policies, as the CCC is a "living" type of document. Thirdly, by monitoring adaptation efforts, the indicators help the city enhance its resilience to climate impacts, protecting both infrastructure and vulnerable communities. Moreover, governance and community engagement indicators ensure that climate action is inclusive, transparent, and backed by strong institutional support and public participation. Lastly, the continuous monitoring and reporting facilitated by these indicators

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

foster a culture of accountability and learning, helping the city to document successes, share best practices, and scale up effective solutions. In essence, these indicators are vital for turning climate commitments into tangible actions and measurable outcomes, driving sustained progress towards a sustainable and climate-resilient future.

The Climate City Contract (CCC) recognizes the importance of establishing both qualitative and quantitative indicators to effectively track the progress of the impact pathways and associated actions. Currently, while the outcomes and impacts identified in the CCC are not explicitly connected to specific actions or indicators, the direct and indirect impacts are provided for each individual measure.

The actions and measures outlined in the CCC are aggregated into short-term and long-term categories for a reason. For each action, a timeline is provided, ensuring clear milestones and deadlines for achievement. However, specific target values for indicators are not yet fully defined, and metadata for these indicators is still under development.

In future iterations, the city will continue to enhance these elements by associating each impact pathway with detailed, measurable indicators to track both early and late outcomes. The city will also define target values for each indicator, integrating the direct and indirect impacts more effectively into the monitoring and evaluation framework. The timelines for achieving these targets will be refined to allow for more precise tracking and accountability of the city's progress towards its climate goals.

Implementing the Indicators:

Baseline Assessment: A baseline will be established for each indicator to measure progress against initial conditions.

Data Sources: Reliable data sources will be identified for each indicator, such as municipal records, surveys, and external data providers.

Frequency of Measurement: The frequency of data collection and reporting for each indicator (e.g., quarterly, annually) will be defined.

Stakeholder Involvement: Stakeholders in the monitoring and evaluation process will be identified to ensure transparency and accountability.

Adjustments: The results of the monitoring and evaluation process will be used to make informed adjustments.

These indicators provide a comprehensive framework for tracking progress, evaluating outcomes, and facilitating continuous learning and improvement in implementing a Climate City Contract.

Integrated Climate Action Index - ICAI

IC AI

Climate Neutrality

Action Plan

#

The essence of our approach is the mainstreaming effect, so we will develop The Integrated Climate Action Index (ICAI) that should provide a comprehensive measure of how well climate change considerations are mainstreamed into city governance and practices. By assessing policy integration, budget allocation, institutional capacity, project implementation, public engagement, and monitoring and reporting, the ICAI should capture the multifaceted nature of mainstreaming climate action. This indicator will help us to identify strengths and areas for improvement, promoting a holistic approach to building climate resilience and reducing emissions.

# Integrated Climate Action Index (ICAI)

The Integrated Climate Action Index (ICAI) measures the extent to which climate change mitigation and adaptation actions are embedded across various sectors and levels of city governance, policies, and practices. The following segments and specific elements will be monitored to quantitatively and qualitatively determine the development of the city's energy and climate policies. To this end, data will be gathered from municipal records, policy documents, budget reports, project evaluations, and stakeholder surveys. Progress reports will be developed based on the collected data, and conclusions on the overall process will be derived from them.

# Integrated Climate Action Index (ICAI): Operationalizing climate mainstreaming across Zagreb's governance system

The city of Zagreb is advancing a bold transformation toward climate neutrality, but the pathway to 2050 cannot be defined solely by infrastructure and emissions figures. It must also be supported by a governance architecture that embeds climate action across all city functions. This recognition lies at the heart of the Integrated Climate Action Index (ICAI), a framework developed to measure, monitor, and drive the mainstreaming of climate mitigation and adaptation into the city's operational core.

Unlike conventional metrics focused solely on project outcomes or emissions inventories, the ICAI is designed to answer a more structural question: to what extent is climate action integrated into the everyday machinery of city planning, policy, finance, and public engagement? The ICAI captures this by tracking performance across six dimensions: policy integration, budget allocation, institutional capacity, project implementation, public
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

engagement, and monitoring and reporting. Together, they provide a comprehensive picture of how climate considerations are operationalised, not just adopted, within the governance system.

This governance-level approach directly supports Zagreb's Climate City Contract (CCC) and aligns with emerging EU methodologies that place increasing emphasis on mainstreaming. It also reflects Zagreb's active participation (through REGEA) in European initiatives like the NECPlatform and INPLAN, both of which emphasize systemic governance transformation as a condition for effective local climate action.

# Mainstreaming through policy and planning Instruments: The INPLAN Framework

Zagreb's ICAI is explicitly shaped by the principles of the INPLAN project, a European initiative coordinated by REGEA (North-West Croatia Regional Energy and Climate Agency), aimed at supporting local and regional governments in integrating energy and climate objectives into spatial planning processes. INPLAN recognises that without binding spatial, financial, and sectoral instruments, climate plans risk remaining aspirational.

The ICAI builds on this logic. It tracks the number of city policies and regulations that include explicit climate mitigation and adaptation targets, and how these are reflected in Zagreb's urban development plan (GUP), transport strategies, housing codes, and public procurement rules. It also monitors whether energy and climate goals are cross-referenced in land-use documents, aligning with INPLAN's emphasis on vertical coherence between SECAPs and formal planning.

Zagreb has committed to ensuring that climate action is no longer treated as a standalone document or department, but as a cross-cutting obligation embedded into all levels of planning, reflected in how zoning decisions are made, where infrastructure is built, and how resilience is mapped into city growth.

Financial governance and budget Alignment: EU Taxonomy in Practice

ICAI

Climate Neutrality

Action Plan

O

One of the ICAI's most strategic functions is to connect climate action with municipal finance. As public investments grow in size and ambition, especially under the EU Green Deal and Mission framework, Zagreb is using the ICAI to track the share of city budgets dedicated to climate-related priorities, and whether they are aligned with the principles of the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities. It is going to be in focus from 2026 – 2028 to fully test it in cooperation with Ministry of finance.

This alignment ensures that public funds are not only spent with environmental objectives in mind, but also meet the evolving regulatory standards that define what is considered "green" at the EU level. The ICAI thus acts as a bridge between the city's capital planning and the EU's climate-aligned finance mechanisms. This is particularly important as Zagreb increasingly draws on blended financing models, including EIB framework loans, RRF funds, and other innovative means of financing.

By tracking climate-tagged expenditures and applying a taxonomy lens, Zagreb ensures its investments are future-proof, bankable, and aligned with investor expectations for climate performance. This also supports mainstreaming at the budgetary level, reinforcing climate as a criterion not only for what projects are done, but how they are selected, appraised, and justified.

# Institutional capacity and system learning: NECPlatform as a Catalyst

Zagreb's commitment to mainstreaming climate governance is further strengthened through its involvement in the NECPlatform project through REGEA, which supports the development of national energy and climate planning platforms through multilevel coordination. The NECPlatform approach is rooted in the belief that cities must be equal partners in national climate strategies, and that policy alignment across governance levels is essential to successful implementation.

The ICAI reflects this by measuring not only the presence of climate teams within city departments, as well as the transition team, but also the frequency of interdepartmental coordination, the presence of climate focal points, and the number of staff receiving climate-related training. These are key institutional conditions for delivering integrated climate

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

action, and the basis for participating meaningfully in national and EU platforms like NECPlatform.

Additionally, the ICAI includes monitoring and reporting functions that reflect NECPlatform's push for robust, multi-level data ecosystems. It tracks the city's production of integrated climate action reports, performance reviews, and its contributions to national and EU-level monitoring. This strengthens Zagreb's ability to communicate its progress, influence upstream policies, and ensure its local achievements are reflected in broader climate reporting frameworks such as the EU's Governance Regulation (Regulation 2018/1999).

# Social ownership, public engagement, and institutional reflexivity

Mainstreaming cannot happen without social legitimacy. The ICAI thus places special emphasis on public engagement, recognising that climate policy must be co-owned by citizens and stakeholders. It tracks the number and diversity of consultations on integrated climate action, and evaluates the quality of citizen participation in areas like mobility transition, energy use, green space planning, and climate adaptation.

By capturing both quantitative outreach metrics and qualitative dimensions of public trust and empowerment, the ICAI helps the city ensure that climate mainstreaming is not only a technocratic process, but a democratic one. It supports new forms of participatory governance, from living labs to digital co-design tools, reinforcing the CCC principle that climate transformation must be inclusive and just.

From governance gaps to institutional strength: A mainstreaming diagnostic tool

Ultimately, the Integrated Climate Action Index serves as both a diagnostic tool and a learning system. It enables Zagreb to assess where climate action is strong, where it is still siloed, and where deeper integration is required. Its indicators provide actionable feedback on how climate goals are embedded into the planning, budgeting, staffing, and public engagement practices of the municipality.

More than a compliance mechanism, the ICAI supports a governance transformation, one that aligns climate ambition with institutional practice. Through its connection to EU Taxonomy finance rules, INPLAN's spatial integration guidelines, and NECPlatform's multi-
Climate Neutrality
Action Plan
C

level policy coherence, the ICAI ensures that Zagreb's climate governance is not only well-intentioned, but also operational, scalable, and verifiable.

By building this governance infrastructure for climate mainstreaming, Zagreb is not only enhancing its ability to deliver on its Climate City Contract, it is becoming a European frontrunner in systemic climate governance.

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

Mainstreaming mitigation and adaptation activities into our governance processes is essential for effectively addressing climate change and building resilience. By integrating climate considerations into urban planning, policymaking, and decision-making at all levels, we will ensure that climate actions become embedded within the fabric of municipal governance. We will focus on the following strategies for mainstreaming mitigation and adaptation activities into our city governance and driving systemic transformation towards sustainability and resilience.

## Institutional Integration

We will create a supporting Climate Action Core group: a dedicated climate action task force within the municipal government structure that will have a role to support sectorial departments in their responsibility for climate initiatives and will ensure coherent and coordinated action across departments. These Core groups will oversee the development and implementation of climate policies, coordinate interdepartmental collaboration, and provide technical expertise and support to all departments. However, climate change mitigation and adaptation are the responsibility of all sectorial heads of departments, and the ultimate responsibility lies with the mayor.

Climate Impact Assessments and climate proofing: Integrating climate impact assessments into the decision-making processes of city departments ensures that climate considerations are systematically evaluated and incorporated into policy development and project planning. By assessing the potential climate risks and opportunities associated with proposed actions, we will make sure that we can make informed decisions that enhance resilience and reduce vulnerability.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# Policy Integration

Climate Action Plan is in constant iterations, as is the Climate City Contract: Developing comprehensive climate action plans that outline mitigation and adaptation strategies across all sectors of city governance provides a roadmap for mainstreaming climate action into municipal policies and programs. These plans set clear targets, prioritise actions, and identify the roles and responsibilities of different city departments in achieving climate goals. We have them in place already, but our approach is that as soon as we finish one, we start over again. Climate is changing rapidly – so should we and our work, in a disruptive manner that will help us adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects.

Climate-Smart Regulations: Embedding climate-smart regulations into city ordinances, development strategies, urban development plans, zoning codes, and building standards ensures that new development projects adhere to sustainability principles and resilience standards. By incorporating requirements for energy efficiency, green infrastructure, and climate resilience into regulatory frameworks, cities can promote sustainable urban development and reduce emissions. We are introducing above national level standards, as the national ones are insufficient to get where we want.

# Financial Integration

Climate Budgeting: Allocating dedicated funding streams for climate mitigation and adaptation activities within city budgets will ensure that resources are available to support climate action initiatives. Climate budgeting integrates climate considerations into financial planning processes, prioritises investments in climate-resilient infrastructure, and enhances accountability for achieving climate goals. Our goal is not to have separate budget lines for climate actions, but rather for all our budget lines to be assessed in relation to greenhouse gas emissions and climate proofed. Only that will allow us to break the silos and allow for full climate change mainstreaming. Typical current budget rules are limiting, so we will, in cooperation with the national level, develop new classifications with incorporated monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.

# Innovation in finance

Financing climate action in cities is a critical challenge that requires innovative approaches to acquire the necessary resources for mitigation and adaptation initiatives. Traditional
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

funding mechanisms will not be sufficient to meet the scale of investment needed to effectively address climate change. We will have to undertake innovative financing mechanisms that will enable us to finance climate action projects, accelerate implementation, and achieve our sustainability and resilience goals.

We will explore and further utilise:

European structural and investment funds: We have successfully been using these funds, both in a centralised and decentralised manner. Allocations on the national level for energy transition and climate change adaptation are sustainable so there is a strong potential to leverage our fund in a blending manner.

Funds of Investment and Development Banks: As we are in the process of developing the Climate City Contract, we are also arranging the first tranche of the EIB framework loan, which will dominantly be directed to decarbonisation and climate change adaptation activities. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is a major financial institution that provides loans, guarantees, and technical assistance to support projects that contribute to EU policy objectives, including climate action. On top of using the loans we are analysing options to utilise Climate Awareness Bonds (CABs) and Green Bonds, the EIB finances projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and enhancing climate resilience. These bonds are issued to raise funds specifically earmarked for climate-related projects, allowing investors to support sustainable development initiatives while generating financial returns.

# Green Bonds and Climate Bonds

Green Municipal Bonds: Issuing green municipal bonds will allow us to raise capital specifically earmarked for financing climate-related projects, such as renewable energy infrastructure, energy-efficient buildings, and public transportation systems, as well as adaptation projects. We believe that these bonds will attract socially responsible investors seeking opportunities to support sustainable development and climate mitigation efforts. We already have strong signals for that, as we are preparing for the first tranche.

Climate Bonds: Climate bonds as fixed-income financial instruments will help us fund projects that contribute to climate mitigation or adaptation objectives. Certified by
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

independent standards such as the Climate Bonds Initiative, these bonds provide transparency and assurance to investors regarding the environmental integrity of the financed projects, thus mobilising capital for climate-resilient infrastructure. Creating a portfolio of certified projects is the first step. Therefore, we are working on a methodology to label our projects as climate-friendly and resilient.

## Public-private partnerships (PPPs)

Performance-Based Contracts: Performance-based contracts between cities and private sector entities incentivise climate services and outcomes rather than pure ideas. Through mechanisms such as energy performance contracts and resilience service agreements, private partners assume the upfront costs of implementing climate solutions and are remunerated based on the achievement of predefined performance targets. We have experience with such contracting, and we will be utilising it on a larger scale.

## Climate Funds and Financial Instruments

Climate Resilience Funds: Establishing dedicated climate resilience funds provides cities with flexible financing mechanisms to address climate risks and vulnerabilities. These funds pool resources from various sources, including government budgets, philanthropic contributions, and international financing mechanisms, to support adaptation measures, disaster preparedness, and community resilience initiatives.

Green Revolving Funds: We plan to set up a Green revolving fund that will enable us to invest in energy efficiency and sustainability projects by recycling savings generated from the implementation of previous projects. As investments generate returns through cost savings or revenue generation, these funds replenish themselves, creating a self-sustaining mechanism for financing ongoing climate action initiatives.

Innovative Financing Platforms – bringing citizens on board

Crowdfunding Platforms: We will offer certain projects through the Crowdfunding platforms that will enable us to raise capital from a large number of individual donors or investors to finance specific climate projects or initiatives, for example, for the photovoltaics projects on public buildings, which will also be covered through the mechanism we call the solar bonds.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

By tapping into community support and social networks, it is our idea to mobilise financial resources and engage citizens in the co-financing and co-creation of climate solutions.

Innovations in financing climate action are essential for unlocking the financial resources needed to address climate change effectively. By leveraging green bonds, public-private partnerships, climate funds, and innovative financing platforms, we will mobilize capital, accelerate the implementation of climate projects, and achieve sustainability and resilience goals. These innovative financing mechanisms will not only provide us with access to additional funding sources but also catalyse private sector investment, and citizens' participation and foster collaboration, driving the systemic transformation towards a low-carbon, climate-resilient future.

## Community Engagement

Community-Based Planning: Engaging communities in the planning and decision-making processes of climate action initiatives ensures that local knowledge and priorities are reflected in governance processes. We are already undertaking community-based planning approaches, and are planning to increase them in the future, as they empower residents to co-design and co-implement climate solutions, foster social cohesion, and build trust between citizens and government.

Climate Education and Awareness: We don't know a lot; we learn every day, and it is essential to raise awareness and educate citizens about climate change and its impacts. That will foster public support for climate action and encourage individual behaviour change. Climate education programs, public outreach campaigns, and community events will provide platforms for dialogue, knowledge sharing, and collective action on climate issues.

## Mainstreaming mitigation and adaptation activities

Mainstreaming mitigation and adaptation activities into city governance processes is essential for catalysing transformative change towards sustainability and resilience. By institutionalising climate considerations, integrating climate policies into city planning and regulations, aligning financial resources with climate goals, and engaging communities in decision-making processes, we will be able to effectively address climate change and build a more sustainable future for all.
Ecosystem development -- mission-based approach

Innovations and cooperation are at the core of our approach. The City of Zagreb is a signatory of both missions related to climate because we see mitigation and adaptation as two sides of the same coin. Unfortunately, there has been a significant period when methods, tools and actions that were developed through different innovation projects were not serving any purpose, we lacked the follow-up. We have lately established a system in which we use the EU programmes (H2020, HE, LIFE etc.), technical assistance of the EIB ELENA and similar types of funding as leverage to develop and test the solutions that are embedded into our processes and upscaled, as they become the core of the transformational processes. They are the basis of our pathway towards climate neutrality and increased resilience. On that path, we have established successful cooperation with the national level ministries, through different projects and initiatives. We have successfully managed to create a national platform for dialogue on the National Energy and Climate Action Plan, a project led by our supporting agency -- the North-West Croatia Regional Energy and Climate Agency. It is a platform that gathers national-level ministries, cities and counties, academic communities, the NGO sector, and financial institutions and currently represents one of the best cases in Europe. As a result of the work and meetings on that platform, under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance Croatia, a national platform for sustainable finance of energy and climate actions has been set up. That platform will serve as a catalysing agent for innovation in finance for energy transition and climate change adaptation.

### Module C-2 Social Innovation Interventions

Recent developments in The City of Zagreb exemplify a concerted effort to involve a diverse array of stakeholders and the general public in the decision-making process, indicating an increasing dedication to tackling city challenges through collaborative and innovative approaches. Initiatives such as the eTransparency application have emerged as tools for enhancing governance transparency and accountability. By providing citizens with access to information about public spending, this application cultivates greater trust in public institutions and promotes citizen engagement. Furthermore, the Open Data Portal of the
City of Zagreb^{22} plays a pivotal role in advancing transparency and innovation. Serving as a centralised platform for gathering, organising, and disseminating open data from the City of Zagreb and its affiliated entities, this portal facilitates collaboration and innovation while driving positive social change and contributing to the city's holistic development.

The Climate City Contract (CCC) emphasizes a dynamic and ongoing approach to stakeholder engagement as an integral part of its development and implementation processes. For each individual measure outlined within the CCC, a dedicated portfolio of actions and stakeholders has been carefully identified and is actively being executed. This approach ensures that relevant actors are not only consulted during the initial planning phases, nor is this process solely connected to the development of the CCC, but are continuously involved throughout the lifecycle of the actions.

As highlighted on page 197, the establishment of a shared vision for a sustainable and climate-resilient city is central to the CCC. This vision, co-created with diverse stakeholder input, reflects the values and priorities of the community. Although specific examples of participants and mechanisms are not detailed in the document, it is important to underline that the process of engagement is iterative and adaptive. Stakeholders are engaged at multiple stages—planning, implementation, and monitoring—to ensure that their insights and expertise shape and refine each measure effectively over time.

By maintaining this continuous dialogue and collaboration, the CCC fosters accountability, inclusivity, and resilience in addressing the complex challenges of climate adaptation and sustainability.

We have added a description of one of the processes, the revision of the General Urbanistic plan (so called Green General Urbanistic plan), one of the cornerstones of our approach in horizontal measures on the page 73, in the section on explanation. We could do this for each measure and each action of the CCC AP, but the approach is always the same.

As an add on to the CCC development, City has parallelly been working on the development of the legally binding Plan for GHG emissions reduction, adaptation to climate change and ozone layer protection. This plan and the CCC are in the core the same, when it comes to measures, stakeholders and governance, with the main difference that CCC is much more ambitious in the level of decarbonization. The afore mentioned Plan has undergone
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

significant stakeholders consultation processes, including the public hearing and public consultations and was approved by the competent Ministry in charge for climate that also strengthens the position of the CCC.

In the discussions with relevant stakeholders (especially on the national level) it has come to the attention of the decision makers that CCC approach will be considered as a standard on national level for cities, as it brings huge innovation, especially in the domain of the economics and the investment plan, which our legally binding documents lack.

Our journey in the creation of the Climate City Contract is an evolving process that began with the establishment of a shared vision for a sustainable, climate-resilient Zagreb. This vision is continuously co-created with input from diverse stakeholders, reflecting the values and priorities of our community over time. Below are specific mechanisms and examples of ongoing stakeholder involvement:

Digital Engagement Platforms: The Zagreb Smart City Hub serves as a dynamic forum where stakeholders can continuously engage, share ideas, and provide feedback on the evolving needs of our city's climate initiatives.
Participatory Budgeting Sessions: Through our e-service platform, we conduct regular participatory budgeting sessions, allowing residents and local businesses to have an ongoing influence on how climate resilience projects are funded and prioritized. This continuous dialogue helps integrate evolving community priorities into our climate action framework.
Expert and Stakeholder Conferences: Annual conferences, such as the 2024 energy transition and 2025 conference on green infrastructure, serve as key moments for reflection and co-creation. These conferences synthesize inputs from ongoing workshops and forums, ensuring that our action plans remain relevant and effective.
Community Workshops and Forums: We hold workshops and forums across the city districts on a regular basis. These events are designed to capture a wide range of community inputs over time, ensuring that the voices of all community members, including underrepresented groups, are heard and considered in an ongoing manner.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Surveys and Public Consultations: We deploy surveys and public consultations periodically to gauge shifting public opinion and gather new suggestions on specific elements of the climate action plan. The continuous feedback received through these channels allows us to adapt and refine our strategies to meet emerging challenges and opportunities.

This description underscores our commitment to a participatory approach, demonstrating that the CCC is not a static document but a living agreement that evolves through constant stakeholder engagement. Our aim is to ensure that the CCC remains a collective covenant, co-created with the ongoing participation of the people of Zagreb.

In addition to these engagement strategies, we prioritize ongoing cooperation with key infrastructure stakeholders, including utility companies, transportation agencies, and urban planning entities. This partnership is critical as it ensures that our climate resilience initiatives are integrated with essential city infrastructure developments. Regular coordination meetings and joint planning sessions are held to align infrastructure projects with our climate action goals, allowing for seamless integration and mutual reinforcement of efforts. This continuous collaboration not only enhances the effectiveness of our initiatives but also ensures that our infrastructure evolves in a way that supports sustainable and resilient urban living.

The essence of transformation!

In the face of escalating climate change impacts, Zagreb has recognised the increasing and urgent need for transformative action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience. A holistic approach to climate action involves systemic transformation, addressing interlinked social, economic, and environmental challenges through integrated strategies. We have recognised that the creation of a Climate City Contract, a collaborative agreement between local governments, stakeholders, and citizens to pursue ambitious climate goals, is an effective mechanism to drive such a transformation.

O

# Understanding the Transformation!

We understand that systemic transformation entails fundamental changes across multiple interconnected systems, including governance structures, economic models, infrastructure, and societal behaviours. Rather than focusing on isolated solutions or incremental changes, systemic transformation targets the root causes of climate change and seeks to reorient societies towards sustainability and resilience. This approach recognises the complex interactions between human activities and natural systems, emphasising the need for integrated, long-term strategies that address systemic barriers to change.

# The Core Values of our Climate City Contract are:

# 1. Shared Vision and Goals:

Our journey in the creation of the Climate City Contract begins with the establishment of a shared vision for a sustainable, climate-resilient city. This vision is co-created with input from diverse stakeholders, reflecting the values and priorities of the community. Clear, measurable goals are then set to guide the city's climate action efforts, aligning with international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.

# 2. Participatory Governance:

We believe that effective governance structures are essential for driving systemic transformation. The Climate City Contract promotes participatory decision-making processes that engage citizens, businesses, civil society organisations, and local governments, all rounded around the Penta helix approach. By fostering collaboration and inclusivity, cities can leverage all stakeholders' collective expertise and resources to implement climate solutions. Several processes were, time-wise, aligned with the development of the Climate City Contract, the most important among them being the Development Strategy of the City and the new General Urban Development plan. In all these processes participatory governance was assured.

# 3. Integrated Planning and Implementation:

Systemic transformation requires integrated approaches to urban planning, policy-making, and infrastructure development. The vision of our Climate City Contract is to integrate
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

climate-related considerations into all aspects of city planning and decision-making, from land use and transportation to energy and waste management. We don't want to create more separate processes, our idea is to mainstream all aspects related to climate into all processes, thus breaking down the silos and fostering cross-sectorial collaboration that should enable synergies and co-benefits across different areas of action.

## 4. Innovation and Adaptability:

We will embed innovation and experimentation into our processes, and impose a disruptive way of working as business as usual will not work. That will allow us to navigate the complexities of systemic transformation. For years, we have been nurturing the culture of innovation, and now, this innovation will support the development and adoption of cutting-edge technologies, policies, and practices to achieve climate goals. At the same time, we will be working on increasing our adaptive capacity and responsiveness to evolving climate risks and uncertainties, building resilience into our planning and decision-making processes.

## 5. Equity and Social Justice:

Systemic transformation must prioritise equity and social justice to ensure that the benefits of climate action are equitably distributed across all segments of society. Our Climate City Contract promotes policies and programs that address systemic inequalities and empower marginalised communities, recognising that climate change disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations. We will build a more inclusive and resilient community by centering equity in climate action.

Active engagement with citizens and civil society organisations in the decision-making process regarding laws, regulations, policies, and strategic documents is facilitated through public consultation. Citizens can submit their proposals and feedback on draft regulations and strategic documents via online forms, thereby facilitating open dialogue and ensuring accountability. Coordinators for Consultation with the Interested Public oversee this process, ensuring effective communication between the government and the public.

Moreover, applications such as the Energy Atlas of the City of Zagreb²³ and the Energy Info Centre of the City of Zagreb²⁴ make significant contributions to the city's social innovation landscape. The Energy atlas focuses on promoting energy efficiency by providing information about natural gas, electricity, district heating, and water expenditure per year in the city districts. Similarly, the Energy Info Center of the City of Zagreb advocates for widespread solar panel installation, enabling citizens to easily evaluate the potential energy production from rooftop solar panels. This aids citizens in determining whether to proceed with installing solar panels on their rooftops, making the decision process faster and getting things done quicker.

In conclusion, the social innovation landscape in Zagreb showcases a dynamic interplay between stakeholders, policies, and practices, offering abundant opportunities to address city challenges. By fostering collaboration, transparency, and responsiveness to citizen needs, Zagreb can continue to drive positive social change and cultivate a more inclusive and sustainable urban environment.

# 5 An overview of catalytic Systemic Transformation Core Activities

## 5.1 National-level systemic actions

### 5.1.1 The NECPlatform project

**NECPlatform** (NECP)

**Why?** – In the first iterations of the NECP of Croatia, cities were not a part of the process, and a significant volume of activities is and will be carried out by them.

**Systemic transformation contribution** – Stakeholders around Penta helix (cities and regions, National level ministries, academia, NGO sector, business sector, and finance sector) are jointly gathered around the platform for dialogue.

**Impact** – cooperation that resulted in better versions of NECP, increased knowledge sharing activities, increased awareness of all stakeholders, identified gaps and concrete actions taken (Setup of National platform for sustainable financing).

**Stakeholders** – coordinated by North-West Croatia Regional Energy and Climate Agency, cities, ministries, academic and research organisations, NGO sector, and the finance sector.

### 5.1.2 National-level platform for sustainable finance

**Why?** – One of the key messages that came out as a result of the discussions within the NECPlatform for dialogue was that Croatia would have a significant gap in financing the energy transition and climate change adaptation and that that could have significant repercussions on the treasury in the years to come.

**Systemic transformation contribution** – Setup by the Decision of the National Government under the Ministry of Finance, with the support of the North-West Croatia Regional Energy and Climate Agency, the platform operates in a way that connects the stakeholders that are in need to finance their projects in the energy transition and climate change adaptation with the private capital institutions, development and commercial banks, investment funds, etc.
Climate Neutrality

Action Plan

It is a place for cooperation and building of trust. It also connects other relevant ministries so the horizontal cooperation necessary for systemic transformation is present.

Impact – So far, it has managed to connect the stakeholders in need of project funding with the fund's holders, and the future impacts could be substantial. Investors will gain trust in project pipelines as they will be qualitatively assessed.

Stakeholders – Coordinated by the Ministry of Finance in cooperation with North-West Croatia Regional Energy and Climate Agency, finance institutions, investors, Croatian National Bank, Croatian Development Bank, commercial Banks associations, cities, ministries, and academia.

# 5.1.3 City of Zagreb's systemic transformation activities

# 5.1.3.1 The INPLAN project

![img-23.jpeg](img-23.jpeg)

Why? – Spatial plans are a tool in the hands of local and regional governance that is a driving force for the energy transition and climate change adaptation.

Systemic transformation contribution – In the ecosystem in which national-level standards for energy transition and climate change adaptation are not as ambitious as needed, cities are using the improvements in spatial plans. They are executive-level documents that can impose the above national-level standards, thus allowing and enabling decarbonisation and resilience build-up. Spatial plans can, for example, ban the usage of natural gas in certain areas – an actual thing that happened in one district in Zagreb. That is a game changer with an enormous impact on GHG emissions removal. When appropriately paired with regulation for construction and reconstruction, the impact is significant, as it creates enabling conditions and removes barriers.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

![img-24.jpeg](img-24.jpeg)

Impact - Potentially the most significant one as it can impose above national-level standards. Facts like banning natural gas usage, usage of renewable energy for new build and reconstructions, mandatory amounts of green infrastructure etc. are executed through spatial plans of all levels.

Stakeholders - City of Zagreb, expert developers, academia, business sector, NGO, and citizens.

# 5.1.3.2 The CROSS project

![img-25.jpeg](img-25.jpeg)

Why? – We needed a systemic approach to building refurbishment through the setup of a functional OSS.

Systemic transformation contribution – we have developed the so-called “Green Deal Guidance” for building refurbishment and new buildings. The guidance is a follow-up on the work done through the interventions in spatial plan development. The guidance incorporates all EU standards and is aligned with the New Green Deal stipulations. It has financing and climate-proofing criteria built in. On top of the New Green Deal guidelines in the technical part, we are developing the buildings registry and feasibility studies, in the financial part we are aggregating projects and bringing in the innovation in financing through blending and usage of financial instruments. Innovation is developed in the public procurement domain as well, and green procurement will be the choice.

Impact – Possible significant impact and huge scale-up potential. The above national level standards are introduced, upgrade mechanisms are built, as well as financing criteria and climate proofing of projects – first in Croatia. The direct impact of the project is above 50 million EUR of investments, and indirectly, through the scaling-up process, the potential impact rises significantly.

Stakeholders – City, developers, companies, financial institutions, academia, and various experts.

### 5.1.3.3 The ZAGREEN project

![img-26.jpeg](img-26.jpeg)

Why? – Renewable energy sources coupled with integral energy refurbishment are rounding up the decarbonisation pathways.

Systemic transformation contribution – Building energy refurbishment coupled with on-site renewable energy production is a significant contributor to the decarbonisation process. We are using the technical assistance of the European Investment Bank through the ELENA facility and will be producing models and blueprints of tendering documentation (FS studies for energy management and EPC models, development of technical documentation for PV plants, and battery storage).

Impact – The direct impact of the project is above 85 million EUR of investments, 14,5 GWh of annual energy savings, and indirectly, through the scaling-up process, the potential impact rises significantly.

Stakeholders – City, developers, companies, financial institutions, academia, and various experts.

# 5.1.3.4 The digital Energy atlas of the City of Zagreb - where digitalisation meets energy transition

![img-27.jpeg](img-27.jpeg)

Why? – Data is crucial for energy transition and climate change adaptation, and when accompanied by the systemic GIS-based tool, it turns into a huge decision-making tool.

Systemic transformation contribution – The tool is GIS-based and contains a significant amount of data on various types of energy usage, physical characteristics, types, and number of users, among others. As such, it represents a powerful tool for planning and monitoring and a significant decision-making tool usage. The next step in the development of the tool is to upgrade it to the process of spatial planning and as a tool for systemic planning of green and blue infrastructure. This tool is an excellent example of the mitigation and adaptation synergy.

Impact – Direct impact is currently for the processes of energy monitoring and planning, but in the future, it will be developed into a decision-making tool that will also address climate change adaptation. Replication is possible and envisaged.

Stakeholders – City, developers, companies, academia, various experts, and development agencies.

# 5.1.3.5 PV Max project - significant deployment of PV powerplants

![img-28.jpeg](img-28.jpeg)

Why? – A couple of years back, the amount of energy produced by RES on public buildings was almost insignificant. There were different obstacles, ranging from legal barriers and administrative issues to undeveloped markets and a lack of capacities on all levels.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Systemic transformation contribution – It is an EIB ELENA project that tackles all issues of the significant PV power plant programme development, namely, technical, legal, procurement, and market-related ones. The approach has systemically transformed the process, and the rate of PV power plant installations on public buildings in Zagreb is growing significantly. It led to the setting up of an SPV owned by the City, with the only task of deploying as many PV power plants as possible.

Impact – Significant, both directly and indirectly.

Stakeholders – City, REGEA, Zagrebački sunčani krovovi, technical design and development companies, and market companies.

# 5.1.3.6 ActGreen – Activating green courtyards for carbon neutrality

Why? – Greening activities for public urban spaces should also be accompanied by greening activities for private/semi-private ownership areas, which constitute a significant portion of the city's territory.

Systemic transformation contribution – Involving a wide range of stakeholders in the process of expanding the green space system in the city, through the greening of residential and commercial building courtyards. Depending on the possibilities of each location, interventions in courtyards will include: removing impermeable surfaces and creating permeable areas (green spaces, permeable paving), installing reflective pavements, planting native trees and low shrubs, landscaping lawns, rain gardens, and biodiverse flower meadows, preparing beds for growing vegetables and herbs, installing green pergolas, seating elements, playground equipment, composters, solar-powered lighting, and insect/bird hotels/nesting boxes, as well as collecting rainwater for the maintenance of green spaces.

Impact – Expand the green system and carbon sink capacity in the city, improve the quality of life in areas with a pronounced heat island effect, and strengthen participatory approaches to climate activities.

Stakeholders – City, academia, various experts, business sector, development agencies, and citizens.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# 5.1.3.7 Climate proofing of infrastructure projects

Why? – The infrastructure we build or reconstruct now will remain for an extensive period. As climate change's effects will only worsen, we must ensure its sustainability.

Systemic transformation contribution – We have developed a methodology for climate proofing that is embedded into the strategic development processes and in the project development (design). In that way, we can ensure that our infrastructure will be resilient as the design and execution will reflect the climate risks and hazards. The process combines and unites climate change mitigation and adaptation. The systemic part lies in the scope and approach.

Impact – Direct impact will be seen through the increase of the resilience of the infrastructure and indirect impacts via the avoided losses and damage.

Stakeholders – City, developers, companies, academia, various experts, and development agencies.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

Our approach is on a disruptive side, as we believe that in the first phase, we need to do a significant work on mainstreaming the climate related actions into all governance processes that would allow us to avoid the creation of clima silo. Implementing early policy adoptions via a horizontal approach is crucial for mainstreaming climate action and setting a strong foundation for both mitigation and adaptation efforts. These policies integrate climate considerations across all aspects of urban development, ensuring that sustainability becomes a core component of city planning and operations. For instance, adopting stringent building codes and energy performance standards not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also enhances the resilience of buildings to climate impacts, making them more energy-efficient and better prepared for extreme weather events.

By climate-proofing the city budget and redesigning the city development strategy to fully integrate climate considerations, these measures ensure that all investments and development activities contribute to greenhouse gas savings and enhanced resilience. The program involves stakeholder engagement, policy review, training, pilot projects, and continuous monitoring and evaluation. These actions aim to achieve significant GHG savings, resilient investments, clear ownership and accountability, and a unified approach to climate action eliminating silos and fostering a culture where everyone participates as agents of change. These early policy measures will collectively mainstream climate action into the city's governance framework, creating a supportive regulatory environment that encourages sustainable urban development, reduces emissions, and enhances resilience to climate impacts. By embedding climate considerations into the city's core operations and planning processes, these policies ensure long-term sustainability and resilience, benefiting both the environment and the community.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments - City of Zagreb

The core disruptive measures developed to mainstream the climate actions into all governance processes are:

Spatial development plan revision that has energy transition and climate change adaptation standards built in;
Introduction of building standards that overcome existing standards (above national level) for renovation and/or City budget - climate monetised and climate proofed reconstruction of existing buildings and construction of new buildings;
Developed and implemented Green Deal Project Guidelines for drawing up technical documentation for construction and/or renovation of buildings;
Developed and implemented Climate proofing methodology for infrastructure projects reconstruction and development;
Redesigned City development strategy - no separate climate related action plans. Full mainstreaming achieved

The core technical measures are within the built environment, energy and transport domain and include:

Systemic refurbishment of the building sector in terms of decarbonization and climate proofing;
Decarbonization of the district heating sector and making it primary source of heat;
Increased production of energy from RES;
Decarbonization of the public transport.

# 4 Principles and process

In the City of Zagreb, we have undertaken a holistic and integrated approach to our Climate City Contract (CCC), ensuring that climate action permeates all levels of municipal operations and aligns with broader sustainability goals.

Starting with building a strong mandate, we've integrated the responsibility for climate action across all municipal departments, ensuring every sector contributes to our overarching climate objectives. The Mayor serves as the Chief Climate Officer, emphasizing climate action as a priority at the highest levels of city governance. We've fostered a multi-actor coalition by engaging diverse local stakeholders such as businesses, NGOs, academia, and community groups in collaborative dialogue and decision-making processes, but not solely for the purpose of development of CCC. This inclusive approach helps us ensure that a variety of perspectives and expertise are considered in shaping our climate strategy. Furthermore, we maintain a shared understanding and cohesive action plan with municipal, regional, national, and EU stakeholders through regular strategic dialogues and alignment with broader environmental policies like the EU's Green Deal.

In the co-design of our portfolio, we have meticulously integrated existing policies and programs with new or accelerated interventions by reviewing current initiatives and identifying gaps and opportunities for enhancement. As we take action, multiple initiatives have been launched following the CCC. These include projects aimed at reducing emissions, enhancing green infrastructure, and improving energy efficiency, climate proofing, decarbonization of the district heating, new efficient buses and trams etc. The implementation of these actions is under continuous review to assess their effectiveness and adjust as necessary to meet our climate goals.

For learning and reflecting, we have established robust monitoring and review processes within the CCC framework. These processes are designed to measure the effectiveness of our actions, facilitate regular updates, and ensure that our strategies remain responsive to emerging challenges and opportunities. One that must be

highlighted is the ICAI - The essence of our approach is the mainstreaming effect, so we will develop The Integrated Climate Action Index (ICAI) that should provide a comprehensive measure of how well climate change considerations are mainstreamed into city governance and practices, as described in the CCC AP. By assessing policy integration, budget allocation, institutional capacity, project implementation, public engagement, and monitoring and reporting, the ICAI should capture the multifaceted nature of mainstreaming climate action. This indicator will help us to identify strengths and areas for improvement, promoting a holistic approach to building climate resilience and reducing emissions.

Lastly, to make it a new normal, we are committed to embedding new approaches and innovations into the ongoing iterations of the CCC. This ensures that successful practices are institutionalized and form the basis for continuous improvement in our climate action strategies, helping Zagreb move towards becoming a climate-neutral city. We will review our commitments and actions on the yearly basis.

This comprehensive approach underscores our dedication not just to meet but to exceed our commitments to climate neutrality, ensuring that Zagreb is a sustainable, resilient, and thriving city for current and future generations.
