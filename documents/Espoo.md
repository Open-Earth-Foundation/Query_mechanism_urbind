# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

As one of the 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities in the EU Mission, Espoo is leading the city-wide transformation towards climate-neutrality by 2030.

Espoo's Climate City Contract identifies a portfolio of actions by the city and its stakeholders, impact pathways and investment plan in five focus areas: energy, transport and mobility, circular economy and sustainable lifestyle, land use and construction, and nature and biodiversity.

The city has called upon a wide range of partners representing business, academia and research and education sectors to join the work with their own commitments and action. By September 15, 2023, the Climate City Commitment has been signed by 22 stakeholders, and we are welcoming others to join later with their own climate commitments to reach the city's ambitious climate goal.

# 1 Introduction

The introduction should outline the local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and describe the gap it is addressing in broad terms.

# Introduction - textual element

Espoo is an innovation city committed to ambitious sustainability goals and inclusive city development. As Finland's second largest city, Espoo is one of the key actors contributing to regional and national targets of climate neutral Helsinki-Uusimaa region by 2030 and climate neutral Finland by 2035.

Espoo has grown and continues to grow faster than any other city in Finland facing a challenge of keeping the city growth sustainable. Despite the fast population growth, Espoo has already managed to start reducing not only the CO2 emission per capita, but also its total emissions, and has adopted ambitious measures to continue the reductions at an increasing pace.

Espoo's Climate City Contract identifies a portfolio of actions by the city and its stakeholders, impact pathways and investment plan in five focus areas: energy, transport and mobility, circular economy and sustainable lifestyle, land use and construction, and nature and biodiversity. Measures aimed at reducing electricity consumption, district heating and traffic emissions are the most critical. Transportation currently accounts for a third of CO2 emissions in Espoo, and with the rapid decarbonization of the energy production, the share is estimated to rise to 55% by 2030.

Espoo's approach to sustainability and climate action is to look for integrated solutions considering simultaneously the systemic effects on ecological, social, and economic sustainability. The 17 UN Sustainable development goals - including SDG13 climate action - provide us a framework to understand the highly interconnected aspects of sustainability. Espoo was one of the first cities to conduct Agenda 2030 Voluntary Local Review (VLR) in 2020 with more than 1,000 people participating in assessing the city's sustainability performance. This highlighted the interconnectedness of climate goals to other aspects of sustainability and the need to just transition in the spirit of « leaving no one behind ».

Espoo has been systemically working on climate issues for 15 years. In 2010, the city joined the Covenant of Mayors, and at that time, set the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions per capita by 28% from the 1990 level by 2020. This goal was already achieved in 2016. In 2017 the City Council set the ambitious goal of making the city climate-neutral by 2030. Next year Espoo joined the updated Covenant of Mayors and prepared Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) as the key instrument for implementing the agreement. SECAP outlined the key measures the city will take to achieve its climate-neutrality goal. The plan also includes a mapping of climate change risks and vulnerabilities, adaptation measures, emission calculations, emission reduction scenarios and impact estimations of measures.

The commitment to climate-neutrality holds strong in the new Espoo Story, the city's strategy, approved by the City Council in 2021 outlining climate-neutrality by 2030 as one of the seven key targets for the whole city organisation for the council term 2021-2025. Its implementation is supported by Sustainable Espoo Programme, a strategic cross-sectoral programme owned by the mayor and led by a high-level steering group to lead long-term, goal-oriented systemic development towards a climate-neutral city. To deliver these goals, Espoo is co-operating with universities, research organisations, innovation actors, businesses, and citizens to produce innovative solutions that cut down emissions in Espoo and have a positive carbon handprint. Espoo has included climate action in the strategic agreements signed with local stakeholders to get the whole community behind commonly shared goals.

Espoo's Climate City Contract has been built upon this background of orchestrating a climate neutral and smart city in a multilevel collaboration. The climate action portfolio builds upon the actions identified in SECAP and Sustainable Espoo Programme. New scenarios that identify possible pathways to climate-neutral city have been developed during the process of preparing the Climate

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

City Contract. Climate budget and investment plan as well as city-wide roadmap to climate-neutrality are being developed in collaboration with different departments of city organisation as well as the innovation community, private sector, third sector and citizens. The city has called upon a wide range of partners representing business, academia and research and education sectors to join the work with their own commitments and action. To succeed in the ambitious goal of climate-neutrality, Espoo needs to engage whole community in finding new technological, nature-based, governance, and social innovation solutions. Therefore, co-creation, collaboration and innovation are at the heart of Espoo's Climate City Contract.

# A-1.2: Emission factors applied

The calculation of greenhouse gas emissions is based on the international city level Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC). It is based on the methodology and calculation parameters of the IPCC national emission inventories and the emission factors of Statistics Finland's Fuel Classification.

The emissions calculation takes into account the three main greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The results are expressed in terms of CO2 equivalents, where methane and nitrous oxide emissions are converted into a quantity of CO2 equivalent to their global warming potential and added to the CO2 emissions. In addition F-gases are manually added to mission calculations from SYKE's data (Finnish Environment Institute). Therefore we do not have the information of the distribution of emissions between different gases. The access to this data is a need for future improvement.

More detailed methodology is described in section A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory and emissions gap calculations.

|  Primary energy/ energy source | Carbon Dioxide (CO2) | Methane (CH4) | Nitrous Oxide (N2O) | F-gases (hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons) | Sulphur hexafluoride e (SF6) | Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)  |

GHG Emission reduction scenarios 2025, 2030 ja 2035

Pessimistic scenario that assumes no new emission reduction measures are planned or implemented in the city. In this scenario, the city's emissions performance is affected by factors such as the city's growing population.

Climate-neutral Finland 2035 scenario that assumes Espoo's emissions development will be affected by climate policy measures and policies at national level. The scenario also takes into account the growth of the city and the impact of EU legislation.

Climate-neutral Espoo 2030 scenario that assumes the city's emissions development is influenced not only by national policies but also by climate actions taken by the city and its partners, such as Fortum and HSY.

Additional actions that have been identified during the CCC process and show the potential for reaching the climate-neutrality goal by 2030. The implementation of these actions has not yet been agreed upon in the city's political decision-making process.

# Trend of GHG emissions in Espoo

Espoo's emissions per capita have been decreasing since 2008 and, compared to year 1990, were halved for the first time in 2020. Fast population growth poses a challenge to cutting down total emissions, but investments in low-carbon energy production have turned the curve down since 2012. The most rapid positive changes have occurred in district heating. In 2022, the emission per capita were the lowest in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area for the seventh consecutive year, 2.9 tonnes CO2 eq. Due to the city growing, Espoo's total emissions (897 kt in 2022) are however still long way from the city's climate-neutrality goal. Therefore, ambitious climate actions, especially in the domains of electricity consumption, district heating and transport, are still needed. Since 1990, total emissions have decreased by  $15\%$ .

In 2022, the energy crisis caused by Russian's war of aggression against Ukraine increased Espoo's emissions compared to the previous year by  $8\%$  for the first time in 10 years. The temporary increase in emissions was caused by the district heat emissions increasing by 30 per cent from the previous year, which in turn was caused by the end of natural gas imports from Russia. This led to a situation where energy production purchases were primarily driven by price and availability. In district heat production, natural gas was replaced with other fossil fuels increasing the heating emissions.

After heating, the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions are electricity consumption and traffic. The overall consumption of electricity decreased by about one per cent and electricity consumption in housing decreased by as much as seven per cent compared to 2021. Electricity consumption in electric heating, services and industry increased by two to three per cent. The decrease in electricity consumption in housing is largely due to the high price of electricity and the successful campaigns that encouraged residents to reduce their consumption.

# Geographical boundaries

Espoo's emission calculations include the whole city geographic area. The city covers  $528~\mathrm{km}^2$  with a land area of  $312~\mathrm{km}^2$ , 58 kilometres of coastline, 165 islands, 100 lakes and Nuuksio national park in northern Espoo. Forests occupy nearly  $60\%$  (18,700 ha) of Espoo's land mass. Of these, a relative large proportion, some 2,300 hectares, is protected.

With a population of 305 274 (2022) Espoo is the second most populous city in Finland. Espoo is a network city with five urban centres connected by rails. Tapiola, Matinkylä-Olari and Espoonlahti are located by the West Metro, and Leppävaara and Espoon keskus by the City Rail Link. Increasing the efficiency of cross-town transport services in the capital region, the Jokeri Light Rail line will connect the metro and the City Rail Link in 2024. Rails also connect Espoo to other parts of Helsinki Metropolitan area.

# Greenhouse gas emissions calculation method of the baseline inventory

The calculation of greenhouse gas emissions in the metropolitan area is based on the international city-level calculation standard Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC). It is based on the methodology and calculation parameters of the IPCC national emission inventories and the emission factors of Statistics Finland's fuel classification.

The emissions calculation takes into account the three main greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The results are expressed in terms of CO2 equivalents, where methane and nitrous oxide emissions are converted into a quantity of CO2 equivalent to their global warming potential and added to the CO2 emissions.

The focus of the calculation is on the greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption. The inventory includes emissions from the following activities in the metropolitan area: heating of buildings, electricity consumption, transport (cars, ports, local trains, trams and metros), waste and waste water treatment, agriculture, and process emissions and fuels from industry and machinery.

The scope of the calculation is GPC scope 2 (energy emissions are calculated on a consumption basis; national grid electricity). Air transport, shipping outside ports and adjacent areas, and indirect emissions from food production and the manufacture of consumer goods (scope 3) are not included in the metropolitan area data and Espoo is calculating them separately.

The scope 1 and 2 calculation model was developed for the emissions calculations of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area Climate Strategy 2030 in 2007, based on the Kasvener model of SYKE and the Association of Finnish Municipalities. After the publication of the strategy, the calculation was further modified with regard to the calculation of the national emission factor for electric heating and electricity consumption. After the name of the Climate Strategy Steering Group, the method has been called the Hilma model.

#

In 2016, the Hilma model was further developed for the emission factors for electricity, heating and heating energy consumption, non-road machinery and waste management. Emissions from agriculture and composting continue to be calculated using Kasvener.

Greenhouse gas emissions for the previous year for municipalities in the metropolitan area will be published in the spring when the final data for road transport are available. This preliminary data will be supplemented slightly during the year so that the final results will be updated in the following year's reporting.

## Main principles of the calculation

### Heating of buildings

Heating of buildings is divided into district heating, oil heating, electric heating and geothermal heating.
Emissions from cogeneration (CHP) are calculated using a benefit-sharing method, where the benefits of cogeneration are allocated to each energy product. The fuels and emissions of cogeneration are allocated to electricity and heat in proportion to the fuel consumption of their alternative sources.
Heating energy consumption is considered as a five-year rolling average, no heat value adjustment is used.
The energy consumption of individual heating (other than district heating) is estimated on the basis of the number of square metres of floor area and the heating demand for each year, as provided by Statistics Finland's building stock statistics.

### PRIMARY DETERMINATION

Separately heated floor square metres; data from the previous year are used.

### FINAL DATA

Building stock statistics
Electricity emission factors

### Electricity consumption

Electricity consumption is divided into electricity for heating (electric heating and geothermal heating) and electricity for consumption.
Emissions are calculated using the national emission factor. The factor is calculated by dividing the emissions from electricity production in Finland by total consumption. Imported electricity is considered emission-free.
A separate emission factor is calculated for heating electricity, which is higher than other electricity consumption. Until 2005, the factor was constant, after which it was calculated to change in line with the emissions from total electricity consumption in Finland.

### PREVIOUS DATA

Emissions from electricity generation in Finland using the benefit-sharing method; estimated on the basis of emission data calculated using the energy method and historical data.
Share of heating electricity in Finland's electricity consumption estimated on the basis of historical data.

### FINAL DATA

Climate Neutrality Action

Plan

Road transport emissions within municipal boundaries by vehicle and road type from VTT's Lipasto system.
Electricity consumption of commuter trains is allocated to rail municipalities on the basis of population. The emissions of rail transport (commuter trains, metro, trams) are calculated using the emission factor for electricity consumption.
For port emissions, Port of Helsinki's own calculation is used and emissions from small boats are calculated using the Lipasto calculation model based on Trafi's registration data.

## PREVIOUS DATA

Electricity consumption of commuter trains; data from the previous year are used.

## FINAL DATA

Commuter trains

## Industry and machinery, included in transport sector

Data on industrial fuel use from VAHTI.
In addition, "excess" light fuel oil is calculated; the estimated consumption of oil heating and industrial light fuel oil consumption is subtracted from the amount sold in the municipality during the year.
As regards machinery, all petrol-powered machinery is taken into account, except snowmobiles and professional ATVs and chainsaws and bushcutters. Emissions from the national TYKO database based on population for municipalities.

## PRIMARY DATA

Industrial fuels; data from the previous year are used.

## FINAL DATA

Watch figures
Other light fuel oil; consumption for oil heating

## Waste management

Emission data for landfill and waste water treatment are obtained directly from the installations.
Emissions from biowaste and sludge composting are calculated by Kasvener.
Emissions from power generation at waste water treatment plants are included in the waste treatment emissions.

## Agriculture

Emissions are calculated at Kasvener based on Luke's municipal agricultural land and livestock statistics.

## PREVIOUS DATA

Data from the previous year are used.

## FINAL DATA

Agricultural area and number of livestock

## F-gases included

Espoo's basic calculation does not include F-gases (hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons), Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). F-gases are manually added to mission calculations from SYKE's data (Finnish Environment Institute) for 2022 baseline.

## Other remarks

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

Espoo does not have a significant amount of manufacturing industrial clusters, historical buildings or an airport. Therefore, emissions of IPPU and Sulphur hexafluoride and Nitrogen trifluoride are not included. As a further development scope 3 emissions should be considered in more detail, and with that development these emissions are more strongly included in the monitoring in the future.

There is no significant agriculture in the Espoo city area, which means that AFOLU emissions are very low. When looking at scope 3 emissions in more detail, these should be taken into account more strongly.

# Consumption-based emissions KULMA (not included in the tables)

The carbon footprint of Espoo resident's consumption (scope 3) emissions has been calculated twice, first time in 2020 and again in 2022 using Kulma model. The calculations were developed together and carried out with 19 other Finnish municipalities and an outside expert.

According to results, in 2022, the greenhouse gas emissions from Espoo's consumption totalled 9.07 t CO2e per capita. In 2020, emissions from consumption were 8.78 t CO2e. The carbon footprint of consumption consists of energy consumption, construction, mobility, food and the purchase of goods and services. The data sets from 2020 and 2022 are not fully comparable, as emissions caused by the construction of new streets, roads and bridges, and the impacts of free-time residences on consumption emissions were included in 2022 calculations for the first time to gain more comprehensive view.

Kulma model for consumption-based emissions differs slightly from the "Guidance on the baseline emissions inventory for the Climate-neutral and Smart Cities Mission" guidelines. Kulma calculations take into account supply chains and life cycle emissions to greater extent than the Mission guideline requires. The base methodology for the current area-based scope 1 and 2 (and scope 3 for waste) and consumption-based emissions calculations also differ slightly so they are not fully comparable. Consumption-based emissions are partly based on calculated averages, including eg. disposable income, and partly on actual consumption data eg. for food consumption from large operators.

The results of 2022 study are included as an annex:

# The future emission reduction scenarios

As part of the CCC process, Espoo has done extensive scenario calculations to find out what measures we can take to achieve climate-neutrality. The results of these scenarios and a description of the methodology are described in section A-2.2 overview: Emission gap and scenarios methodology.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

A-2.2 overview: Emission gap and emission reduction scenarios process &amp; methodology

As part of the preparation of Action Plan, the transition team of Espoo together with experts representing different city departments and stakeholders and with the help of external expert developed three scenarios to forecast future GHG emission reductions:

Pessimistic scenario that assumes no new emission reduction measures are planned or implemented in the city. In this scenario, the city's emissions performance is affected by factors such as the city's growing population.
Climate-neutral Finland 2035 scenario that assumes Espoo's emissions development will be affected by climate policy measures and policies at national level. The scenario also takes into account the growth of the city and the impact of EU legislation.
Climate-neutral Espoo 2030 scenario that assumes the city's emissions development is influenced not only by national policies but also by climate actions taken by the city and its partners, such as Fortum and HSY.

Climate-neutral Espoo 2030 scenario was chosen as the baseline scenario for CCC development. It is based on actions identified in 2019 SECAP and further developed with the city organisation, partners and stakeholders during the CCC process. More detailed descriptions of the actions are described in Part 5.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design and in B-2.2: Individual action outlines. While many of these actions have been previously planned for, they require continuous commitment and work by the city and its stakeholders and have therefore been included in the Action Portfolio.

According to Climate-neutral Espoo 2030 scenario, the city would in 2030 reach -72 % emission reductions compared to baseline year 1990 (that Espoo City Council has approved as a baseline for the city's climate neutrality target) and -65 % emission reduction compared to the newest emission data available (2022). While these reductions are substantial, they still fall short of the ambitious target of climate-neutrality. Therefore additional possible future actions were identified during the CCC process to demonstrate the potential pathways for reaching the climate-neutrality goal by 2030 and their impacts on emission reductions were studied in an additional update of the scenarios in August, 2023. Additional actions that have not yet been decided but would have significant emission reduction potential and bring us further in reaching our climate targets were identified and will be considered when developing future policies. However, it is important to note that the implementation of these actions has not yet been agreed upon in the city's political decision-making process and/or by stakeholders is therefore uncertain. All additional actions are included in Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design and in B-2.2: Individual action outlines under the label Additional actions.

Additional actions identified could achieve emission reductions in 2030:

80% reduction compared to 1990 emissions
78% reduction compared to 2022 emissions

The results of both Climate-neutral Espoo 2030 scenario and additional actions are presented in Table A-2.3.

All scenario calculations are based on the existing climate emissions monitoring methodology (described in A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory) and public data sources on the emissions impacts of the actions. A summary of the scenarios is presented in Table A-2.3 Emissions
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

reductions in existing strategies by 2030 (based on city's scenario calculations 2021). More extensive background material is available as an Annex, however only in Finnish.

Based on the scenarios, emissions will still be generated in 2030, especially from transport. While Espoo is aiming for fast uptake of e-mobility, in Espoo will still be petrol and diesel cars in traffic in 2030. The share of emissions from lorries will increase as emissions from other road transport decrease. There are also some inaccuracies in the calculation method that can be corrected in the next CCC rounds, for example the use of national emission factor for electricity instead of taking into account for example the use of emission-free electricity by the city and other local stakeholders.

The pathway for dealing with residual emissions and carbon sinks is described in more detail in the section B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions.

As a further note, F-gases are not included in the 2030 scenarios, because they are not included in our original baseline calculation. We are developing the calculation to include them in the future. F-gases are manually added from additional database to baseline, as explained in the section A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory and emissions gap calculations.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers – textual elements

## Energy systems

### Barriers:
National economic support for giving up oil heating or similar unsustainable technology may decrease compared to previous years
Learnings gained during the energy crisis of 2022-2023 be forgotten when energy prices decrease leading to less incentives for energy-savings
Investments to energy infrastructure and renewable energy production slow down because of financial insecurities
Energy system working at its limits because of rapid electrification (EV charging, local renewable production)
Under current legislation, the site where members of an energy community use electricity must be located in the same real estate or a comparable group of real estate hindering the development of decentralized energy communities that would distribute energy to public electricity network.

### Opportunities:
Electrification is important for reducing emissions in heat production. Electricity can be used to generate heat particularly with heat pumps that utilise waste heat.
Batteries and heat storages and flexible consumption of electricity and heat will allow for increased non-combustion-based energy production.

## Mobility and transport

### Barriers:
Modal split change needs behavioural change and that is difficult and slow.
Winter conditions lower the use of active transport modes (walking, cycling).
Charging infrastructure is a bottle neck in shift to e-mobility.
The city of Espoo consists of both high-density urban areas and rural areas, where implementing sustainable mobility and transport is more challenging.
Green transition needs investments and investors expect profits in the future. But for example, the demand of biofuels might be unsecure.
Negative attitudes by residents and/or policy makers towards measures that would restrict private car use or increase its costs (e.g. increasing parking charges or lowering speed limits on highways)

### Opportunities:
Improving the conditions for sustainable modes of transport by investing in infrastructure, prioritising sustainable transport modes in traffic management and developing public transport.
Active transport choices increase physical health and well-being. Urban environment that encourages people to walk, cycle and use public transport is attractive and safe.
Finland ranks in fifth place in the global e-mobility ranking by the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA). In Espoo, the share of electric vehicles is twice the national average. That makes Espoo one of the global and European frontrunners solving the systemic challenges on a way to full-scale low-carbon mobility, including tapping the full potential of e-mobility.

## Built environment

### Barriers:
Lack of knowledge and skills on low carbon construction and materials
Due to long time spans of urban development, the timing of investments can be challenging.
Traditional process of urban development has lacked the roles and capacities for steering and coordinating a new kind of co-creational urban development.

### Opportunities:
Provide guidance and tools on low carbon construction
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

ESPOO ESBO

Global resource scarcity and rising costs of building materials are encouraging the construction sector to develop circular economy solutions, such as reuse of building components and, for example, nature-based solutions in infrastructure construction
Open the development of city districts as innovation hubs for low-carbon and smart solutions; develop new cross-sectoral governance models

## Waste and circular economy

### Barriers:
New scalable technology solutions need to be created to make circular materials economically feasible compared to virgin materials.
Investments for research, innovation and pilots are required. It takes time before the old traditional linear business is replaced with the circular model, lack of funding and risk investment and the operational costs slow down the development and implementation.
For platform solutions, there is a risk of uneven cost and profit sharing. New ways of business collaboration and data sharing need to be created.
Legislation and policies change slower than innovations are created, which builds a barrier to scale the solutions to the market.
The lack of knowledge and negative attitude of the citizens and city employees to change for example procurement process and criteria or to assess the full life cycle costs of the purchases may affect the implementation. The change from investment to buy as a service requires changes also in the investment planning, processes and tools.

### Opportunities:
Developing Kera and Kiviruukki districts as circular economy development areas that bring together circular economy actors and allow for development of new products and services.
Circular economy improves the quality of life. A fair circular economy creates a sense of community and encourages creativity and prioritising experiences over material values.

## Green infrastructure &amp; nature-based solutions

### Barriers:
The population of the capital region is estimated to keep growing rapidly in the next decades, with a significant share of the growth pressure on Espoo. Preserving natural and green areas to ensure adequate carbon sinks and stocks while building homes and services for increasing population is a real threat.

### Opportunities:
Steer the necessary new housing as infill construction along public transport routes
Develop nature-based solutions for biodiversity and climate mitigation and adaptation

## Citizen engagement and social innovation

### Barriers:
Engaging the most vulnerable groups of citizens to not leave anyone behind in the transition to climate neutrality is a challenging task as those groups are as well often hard to reach or "passive" participants. Citizens might also lack knowledge about the sustainability themes in order to being able to participate in a meaningful way and make informed statements that have a real positive impact.
Facilitating social innovation by the city is desirable but requires many times a shift in mindset and changing official processes to being able to enable innovations borne in the local community. The city organization has a multi-faceted role towards its citizens as it increasingly wishes to be a partner and enabler but at the same time has the role of regulator to admit permits and supervising the state of the environment and land-area.
Limited citizen engagement resources and capacities within the city organisation. Participation and social innovation do not always have real impact on decision-making but might instead result in token participation without substantial impact. Data collected from citizens in surveys, queries, workshops or meetings by one city unit is not distributed to other units and therefore has limited impact.

### Opportunities:
Build capacity on citizen engagement. Move from consultation to partnership.

Use digital platforms to reach a wider audience and gather input from those who might not attend in-person events.
Bringing climate issues to participatory structures already in place in the city. For example, engaging vulnerable groups by working together with Espoo's elderly, disabled people and youth councils.

## Governance

### Barriers:
City sectors and departments working in silos that lead to lack of cooperation inside the city organization
Lack of time or resources by city employees to change and develop existing processes better take into account climate and sustainability goals
Heavy bureaucracy and limiting regulations
Resistance to change and negative attitudes

### Opportunities:
Develop collaborative governance and working methods between the city and different stakeholders, including companies, organizations, research institutions and universities, and citizens towards shared and common goals.
Create communication highlighting co-benefits and develop strategies that leave no one behind to enhance acceptability of climate action.

## A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

Espoo's climate goals cannot be reached by the city alone but require close co-operation with various stakeholders: private sector, academia, research and innovation actors, ecosystems and networks, other levels of government, other cities and citizens, NGOs and communities.

## Climate Policy Co-Creation

Espoo Story, Sustainable Espoo Programme and Climate-neutral Espoo 2030 Roadmap are prepared in co-creation with stakeholders, experts, scientists, and different citizen groups to ensure that climate actions are ambitious, feasible, effective and align with community values. Climate City Contract is used as a learning and impact-driven strategic tool complement these strategies guiding the transition towards net zero.

## Transparency and information sharing

Espoo's Climate Watch tool, espoo.fi website, city's publications and communications provide clear and accessible information about the current CO2 emissions, potential pathways to climate neutrality, and the impacts of various strategies.

## In-person engagement

Workshops, events, webinars, surveys, meetings and citizen panels provide platforms for dialogue and collaboration with different stakeholders, communities and citizens. Addressing concerns related to social and environmental justice enhance acceptability of the planned climate actions and ensures that effects on different communities, including marginalized groups.

## Online engagement platforms

Digital platforms, such as My Espoo on the Map and Espoo's new online participation platform to be launched in early 2024, reach a wider audience and gather input from those who might not attend in-person events.

## Education and outreach

Sustainability and climate issues are part of curricula at all levels of education in Espoo. HSY Climate Info, Sustainable Espoo, Villa Elfvik Nature House, libraries, cultural services and NGOs provide information and use climate nudging to empower citizens to make climate-friendly choices and behavior in everyday life.

Climate Neutrality Action

Plan

#

# Scenario planning

Collaboratively developed scenarios for achieving climate neutrality consider various strategies and technologies allowing city officials, decision-makers, and stakeholders to explore trade-offs and select the most suitable pathways.

# Development Projects

Sustainable Espoo Programme's project portfolio focuses on solving climate challenges step by step by co-creating local energy, transport, circular economy, built environment and nature-based solutions with research and innovation actors and companies.

# Climate Commitments

In 2015, Espoo and Fortum committed to joint development of climate-neutral district heating by 2030. This was followed by other commitments with the city's key partners, and in 2023, as part of the CCC process, the city launched new open call for commitments welcoming business, education and research partners to join the effort with their own climate actions.

# Climate budget and investments

Espoo's first climate budget makes the goal of climate neutrality more concrete and transparent for citizens, decision-makers and the whole Espoo community in the annual budget 2024 and 10-year investment plan. In addition, different funding sources, public-private partnerships and private investment are explored to contribute towards the ambitious 2030 goal.

# Citizen engagement

From consultation to partnership is the slogan that guides Espoo's approach and model to citizen participation. It describes the shift towards a more inclusive and participatory governance. For a long time already, residents have had an opportunity to provide feedback, take initiatives and participate in discussions and workshops, but in ways and processes defined by the administration. The way to move towards partnership-based participation is to give residents a more active role as experts, partners, and decision-makers.

Participation is based on the Espoo story and its targets, including that of climate-neutrality. A sustainable city is not made for the residents, but with the residents. Resident participation is strengthened by moving away from one-off consultations towards ongoing and planned involvement

and interaction in all city operations. Residents' volunteer work and expertise are considered as valuable resources and opportunities.

In Espoo, different ways for residents to participate and influence include:

Information Participation: Access to information and its production.
Planning Participation: Involvement in decision-making, both directly and indirectly.
Action Participation: Engaging in local activities and collaborative efforts.
Evaluation Participation: Providing feedback and contributing to assessments of services and activities.

Collaboration with residents and local stakeholders presents a unique opportunity for the city. It addresses challenges faced by residents while fostering trust and democracy. Leveraging new technology allows residents to be closer to administration, operations, and decision-making.

In 2022, a new resident participation group was introduced to strengthen the direct links between residents and Sustainable Espoo Programme that coordinates the CCC transition process in Espoo. Partner group that consisted of residents from diverse backgrounds meets regularly in facilitated co-design workshops focusing on different aspects of the city's sustainability and climate issues. The results of each discussion were brought to the steering group of Sustainable Espoo Programme and to Espoo's CCC transition team. The citizen group co-designed ideas of how residents could commit more to climate work in the city. The ideas produced by the citizen group were diverse; a combination of bottom-up and top-down measures as in the form if incentives and enabling as well as giving sanctions and steering citizen to behave and consume in a more climate friendly way, and engaging different groups and entities such as housing companies, NGOs and citizen groups. Climate neutrality goal should be integrated in all the interaction between the city administration and citizen as a shared goal, for example as a condition for participative budgeting projects and support for NGOs. The results are incorporated in the preparation of CCC and the learnings gained in working with such group and methods of co-creation will be incorporated in future projects and actions.

Citizen group also co-created a vision map of what kind of Espoo they would like to see by the year 2050, and it was characterized by circular economy solutions, climate neutral and climate positive transport and energy solutions, nature being present in the city and a strong sense of community.

# Take action

The participatory model for Espoo's climate neutrality work consists of raising people's understanding of the connection and contribution of their daily conduct to the climate change and ecological crisis and encouraging citizen to action by enabling and making it easier to choose more climate friendly options in their daily life. This will be implemented with providing education and information accompanied with inspiring examples, building enabling infrastructure such as bicycle lanes, accessible routes, e-charging stations and developing public transport and recycling facilities as well as integrating climate neutrality goals to all possible places of interactions with stakeholders such as permissions for organizing events or conditions for funding NGO's or cooperation with sports clubs – one already existing example being the agreement of sustainable land use in building a new city district in Kera area.

A new citizen panel specializing for sustainability and climate work is being planned with an idea of the citizen group acting also as change agents or change accelerators empowering their own networks. The city is also seeking actively new ways to empower and increase the citizen's sense of ownership of our environment and shared responsibility of all to take care of it in a sustainable way. Also, personal commitments of citizen on sustainable lifestyle will be increasingly encouraged with campaigns and using the existing national platform of "Commitment 2050". In Espoo city organisation, more than 200 commitments have been made by different city departments and in schools, sustainability commitment is an integral part of each school's curriculum.

New clean and climate friendly energy solutions for households must be affordable and accessible (as stated in SDG7). For example, climate friendly mobility must include options for all different user groups as promoting bicycling and walking as sustainable options – although very good and beneficial to health - at the same time can exclude people with moving disabilities. Therefore Espoo's cross-cutting principles of citizen engagement for climate neutrality are inclusiveness and equality, ensuring that no one is left behind. This will apply especially for vulnerable groups such as low-income families, elderly and disabled people, other minority groups and children and youth. Special attention will therefore have to be paid to incorporate equality factors in the climate work of the city, and this can be done for example by working together with equality, elderly, disabled people and youth councils of the city in addition to other outreach work.

Education is among the sectors that has greatest impact in the promotion of climate neutrality and sustainability in a systemic and long-lasting manner as it contributes strongly to the fact that children grow with a “citizenship skill” of climate friendly lifestyle. The SDG4 also recognises the importance of all learners acquiring the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development. In Espoo the ecological sustainability and climate neutrality is addressed in the curriculum of early childhood education and schools as part of the holistic sustainability framework. Apart from the teaching itself, this translates into participative action in schools and day cares for example in the saving and recycling materials, minimizing food waste, learning urban gardening, and strengthening the connectedness with nature.

Participation is a pre-requisite for sustainable cities and communities as it is also highlighted in the SDG11 for example with the notion of inclusiveness. Espoo is actively developed towards a more co-creative approach with willingness to engage citizens in partnership, doing together and supporting grass roots initiatives. The idea of developing the city not only for the citizen but with the citizen is the key to planning new climate action.

# 5 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B represents the core of the Action Plan, shaped by local authorities, local businesses and stakeholders, comprising of the most essential elements: scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, action portfolios and indicators for monitoring, evaluation and learning.

# 5.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Module B-1 "Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways" should list impact pathways, early and late outcomes and direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits) according to and adapted from the NZC Theory of Change and the AP Guidance – clustered by fields of action.

Note: Additional possible future actions were identified during the CCC process to demonstrate the potential pathways for reaching the climate-neutrality goal by 2030 and will be considered when developing future policies. However, it is important to note that the implementation of these actions has not yet been agreed upon in the city's political decision-making process and/or by stakeholders is therefore uncertain. Additional actions are presented in Impact Pathway and Action Portfolio in italics to separate them from other actions.

# 5.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

Module B-2 "Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design" should contain a project description for each intervention planned, including interventions by local businesses and industry, according to the template B-2.1, including actions those interventions targeted at enhancing carbon sinks to address residual emissions. Narrative analysis and comments can be provided in B-2.2. A summary of how residual emissions are addressed, should be provided in B-2.3.

Note: Additional possible future actions were identified during the CCC process to demonstrate the potential pathways for reaching the climate-neutrality goal by 2030 and will be considered when developing future policies. However, it is important to note that the implementation of these actions has not yet been agreed upon in the city's political decision-making process and/or by stakeholders is therefore uncertain. Additional actions are presented in Impact Pathway and Action Portfolio in italics to separate them from other actions.

B-2.1: Description of action portfolios - textual or visual

|  Fields of action | Portfolio description  |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  List of actions | Descriptions  |
|  Energy systems | E1: Espoo Clean Heat - replacing fossil fuels in district heating
E2: Reducing emissions in electricity consumption, oil heating and industrial fuels of housing, industry, and services
E3: Energy optimization and energy savings in city-owned buildings
E4: Enabling the increased electrification | The goal is an intelligently controlled energy system, which enables households and companies situated in Espoo to use reasonably priced and sustainable energy. In the production, consumption and distribution of energy, new operating models are applied, which will guide towards shaving consumption peaks and saving energy.

The energy sector currently produces the largest share of the city's climate emissions and in recent years has also produced the largest emission reductions. Most of these emissions come from district heating, and to address this, the city, together with energy company Fortum, has committed to carbon-neutral district heating by the end of this decade. The use of coal for district heating is due to end in 2025, while other renewable and carbon-neutral energy measures, such as phasing out oil heating and investing in solar panels, will also reduce climate emissions.

Developing a smarter and more flexible power grid through cooperation will provide the basis for achieving carbon neutrality in both district heating and transport. The city group's building stock has and will continue to set an example in the adoption of new energy solutions and the promotion of energy efficiency. Energy efficiency and energy saving play an important role in reducing the need for energy production, while bringing economic savings.  |

|  Mobility & transport | M1: Promoting walking and cycling
M2: Promoting the shift to and reducing emissions of public transport
M3: Reducing emission of car traffic | In Espoo, as in other Finnish cities, emissions from transport are a persistent challenge. To achieve the climate neutrality target, total transport emissions in Espoo must start to fall and solutions will be sought for sustainable mobility and transport throughout the city area. This requires both an increase in the share of sustainable transport modes (walking, cycling and public transport) and a shift from fossil fuels to fossil-free fuels. The increase of remote working helps to reduce the need to travel.

Espoo is promoting walking and cycling by both improving pedestrian and cycling infrastructure and services as well as promoting them as a desirable mode of transport in everyday life including commuting. The city is co-operating with companies and NGOs in the cycling field to improve residents' cycling and cycle maintenance skills.
In recent years, the city has invested heavily in public transportation infrastructure and investments will continue during the 2020s. The extension of the Western Metro (2022), the opening of the Jokeri Light Trail (2024), and Espoo City Rail Link (2028) are significant improvements to the capital region public transport system.

Espoo is steering new construction towards district centres and good public transport links. A more unified urban structure that relies on public transport will enable increasing the availability of sustainable modes of transport, because workplaces and services are close by or easily accessible via public transport.

In a shift to sustainable modes of transport, the biggest emissions reduction potential in increasing the trips made in public transport, because it's the most attractive alternative to private vehicles in longer journeys that cause greatest emissions. However, walking and cycling complement public transport and play an important role in social sustainability and bring multiple health and other co-benefits.

Espoo is Finland's leading city in the uptake of e-mobility and electrification of transport is estimated to have great potential for future emission reductions. The number of electric vehicles is constantly increasing, both in private vehicles, urban logistics and public transport. In the future, electric vehicles will enable energy storage and the optimisation of energy supply and demand. The shift to e-mobility requires close co-operation with the grid operators and charging infra providers as well as improvements in city procurement, permitting processes, urban planning, and land use solutions.

The use of biofuels is promoted by strengthening the conditions for the production and distribution of biogas. Espoo will also support the market with its own procurements.

The aim of the city is for all is for all residents to be able to make smooth and low-emission everyday journeys supported by well-functioning, low-carbon urban logistics. Developing Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) and Sustainable Urban Logistics Plan (SULP) in co-operation with stakeholders and citizens creates a traffic system that better addresses their needs  |

|  Built environment | B1: Developing Espoo's city districts as innovation hubs for low-carbon and smart solutions

B2: Promoting low-carbon construction and emission-free work sites | Espoo uses land-use planning to direct construction to centres and along good public transport connections in a way that is environmentally friendly and sustainable, to preserve carbon sinks and promote the use of public transport. Climate impact assessments are carried out in planning projects to assess the effects on climate emissions, carbon sequestration and adaptation to climate change.

Alongside land use planning, Espoo and its partners are testing and developing innovative incentives and commitments to support low-carbon and smart urban development, testing environments and investments in different types of city districts.

As Espoo's population grows, so does the need for construction. Espoo controls construction through land use management and builds public infrastructure. Both construction management and city's own construction are important tools that the city can use to promote low-carbon and circular solutions.

Resource wisdom and overall sustainability of construction will be achieved by promoting the use of zero-emission energy, energy and space efficiency, flexibility of conversion and the choice of sustainable building materials.

Emissions and other environmental impacts throughout the construction life cycle will be reduced, from the manufacture of building materials to the construction phase itself, from the use of the building to the recycling and reuse of materials and parts of the building once it has reached the end of its life cycle.

We are implementing the national green deal agreement towards emission-free construction sites. Its aim is to ensure that no fossil fuels are used on city's own construction sites after 2025. In addition, we will gradually move to lower-emission construction equipment and transport vehicles. We also promote emission-free construction sites on private developments through land use steering.  |

|  Waste and circular economy | W1: Reducing emissions from waste treatment

W2: Promoting circular solutions | Of the household waste generated in the capital region, 47 % in recycled. The rest is incinerated with energy recovery. Household waste do no longer end up in landfills. The goal is to increase the recycling of household waste to 60 % by 2025. This requires more effective and better sorting of the waste where is it is generated, so that more waste goes to recycling. By 2030, Helsinki Region Environmental Services HSY, the regional provider of waste management and water supply services, is committed to providing carbon-neutral water services and waste management.

In addition, Espoo is working to realise the circular economy by developing its own operations and the cooperation with companies and partners. The city is setting an example through its own actions, providing residents with services and guiding decision-making.  |

|   |  | Espoo promotes circular economy both through the development of its own processes and services, as well as working in cooperation with multiple partners to promote the shift to circular solutions in industry and providing better shared and circular services to residents.

In the city's own operations, circular economy is promoted in construction and demolition, efficient use of space, reuse of materials and promoting sustainable procurement practices. In construction, circular solutions include the reuse of wooden elements and metal structures. In the food system, nutrient cycling is important and can be improved, for example, through agricultural land regeneration. In transport, circular solutions include the recycling of batteries for electric cars, biogas from bio-waste and car sharing. Climate friendly meals and food wastage reduction in city's food services promoted in order to reduce consumption-related emissions.

City districts of Kera and Kiviruukki act as circular economy development zones, bringing together circular economy actors and serving as piloting platform for future-proof solutions. Espoo strives to be an appealing area for circular economy business as well as collaboration related to research, development and innovation (RDI).  |

|  Green infrastructure & nature-based solutions | G1: Directing city growth to built-up areas and preserving carbon sinks

G2: Fostering biodiversity and nature-based solutions in urban development | Espoo is an exceptionally green city, where forests cover nearly 60 % of the city's surface area. The goal is to preserve carbon sinks when possible, to offset the residual CO2 emissions in 2030. In addition, Espoo's goal is to be a pioneer in reconciling the needs of a growing city and protection of biodiversity. We are finding ways for the urban development to foster, revitalize and increase biodiversity to achieve not only our climate goals, but also the ambitious goal of no net loss by 2035. Espoo's nature conservation measures include a plan to support existing protected areas and supplement the nature conservation network regionally and qualitatively.

Decisions on the city's land use are made by means of zoning. Espoo is investing in infill development and steering construction towards district centres and already built-up areas to conserve carbon sinks and carbon stocks, biodiversity and natural values.

However, as the city grows, some new development will inevitably take place on existing green spaces. When planning for new development, especially in forested or marsh area, we assess the impact of the plan on carbon sinks and stocks. We are also actively developing emission calculation tools and methods for land use planning to get a better understanding of the impact of land use on our climate goals. In addition, we promote the deployment of the green factor tool that increases the greenery in zoning projects.

While conserving and protecting natural and green areas both within and outside the city's nature reserves is of foremost value, technical green structures such as green roofs, decks and green walls are an important additional way of increasing urban greening in dense urban centres. Espoo promotes the construction of green roofs and steers their  |

|  Action outline | Action name | E1: Espoo Clean Heat - replacing fossil fuels in district heating  |
|   |  Action type | Technical intervention  |
|   |  Action description | The production of district heat generates the biggest share of Espoo's current emissions. The joint Espoo Clean Heat goal of Espoo and the district heating provider Fortum involves transitioning to fully carbon-neutral district heat production during the 2020s. The use of coal for energy production will be discontinued in 2025.

The district heating system is undergoing a major transformation to replace fossil fuels with smart and flexible solutions that are largely based on waste heat utilization, renewable electricity, heat pumps and electric boilers, and heat storage solutions such as accumulators. Artificial intelligence optimizes the operations of the entire system.

Part of the solution will be a globally unique cooperation project in which Microsoft will build a new data centre in Hepokorpi, Espoo, and Fortum will build a connected large-scale waste heat unit that utilizes the data centres excess heat in the district heat network. This is the world's largest recovery project for data centre waste heat. The emissionless waste heat produced by the data centres will cover about 40 per cent of the heat demand of the 250,000 district heat users in Espoo, Kauniainen and Kirkkonummi by the end of the decade.

All the electricity used by the data centre area and, therefore, all the waste heat created will be emission-free. The recycling of waste heat will replace coal and decrease the use of gas in the production of district heat.  |

Physical / spatial intervention  |
|   |  Action description | Energy efficiency will be improved, and the use of renewable energy increased in different types of city districts considering their special characteristics. This includes residential areas, commercial areas, industrial areas and workplace areas that differ from one another by building type, functions and density, among other factors.  |

|   |  | In the climate-neutral Espoo scenario it is expected that oil-heated buildings will switch to other forms of heating as follows: single-family and terraced houses mainly to heat pumps and blocks of flats, service buildings and industrial buildings, about half to heat pumps and half to district heating.

The city will promote this systemic change with the development of district-level energy solutions combined with energy guidance and steering. District development will involve extensive cooperation between different sectors. The action considers Espoo's different district types, the collaboration of various energy forms, and the promotion of the usage and sharing of data.

In addition, Espoo will promote the development of new functional and economic models and services to increase local renewable electricity production and energy efficiency measures through extensive cooperation. These include trying out and piloting energy communities across property boundaries and surveying investment models that promote energy efficiency and energy communities from the perspective of the city, private operators and residents.

Advice and guidance are essential when transitioning towards low-carbon energy and new flexible and economical operating models. The goal is that every person in Espoo has good opportunities to make sustainable choices in their everyday life and influence their surroundings in energy-related matters. The city will contribute towards this systemic change by providing information and encouraging citizens, housing companies and business to choose sustainable solutions to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions.

Additional actions identified during the CCC process (potential future actions or actions not yet included in current emission inventories or scenario calculations):
• Large operators utilizing certified green electricity: The City of Espoo does not own an energy company, so the most significant opportunity to influence the electricity market is to purchase certified emission-free electricity. Espoo City Group uses CO2 certified electricity. However, this is not currently reflected in the emissions calculation, but the share of electricity consumed is calculated according to the national average. Additional action scenario takes into account the actual emissions from the Espoo City Group's electricity consumption making visible the impact of city's commitment to purchasing certified green electricity.
• Encouraging residents to buy certified green electricity. The scenario estimates that 10% of people in Espoo would buy green electricity in 2030. City's role is to promote this by providing information and communication.
• Increasing the production of solar electricity. It is estimated that 0.6 GWh of solar electricity will be added in Espoo by 2030.  |

|   |  | In addition, city-owned rental housing company Espoon Asunnot has joined energy efficiency agreement for rental housing companies and also aims to reduce total energy consumption by 7.5 per cent by the end of 2025 compared to 2015.

Energy savings are also achieved by modernising city premises and street lighting and by replacing old light sources with led technology. This has reduced the energy consumption of lighting on city premises by around 4 %.

Espoo and Espoon Asunnot will continue to use zero-emission electricity in all our city buildings. The origin of electricity is guaranteed by guarantees of origin. Gasum purchases emission-free and carbon-neutral certified electricity for the City of Espoo's electricity portfolio on the electricity market. Both the city and the rental housing company also uses Fortum's EkoPlus supplement, which guarantees that district heat is produced from 100% renewable or equivalent energy sources.

In addition, Fortum is implementing a heating optimisation service (Smart Living) in approximately 116 properties, which aims to ensure continuously stable conditions in the buildings and optimise the control and energy efficiency of the heating systems and equipment in the buildings. In addition, the aim is to facilitate building maintenance and technical service, for example through remote management, proactive alarms and automated data analysis, and to enable users to monitor and report on the electricity, heat and space conditions in the building. To launch the service, more than 4,000 temperature and humidity sensors were installed in mainly around 110 day-care centres and schools in 2020. The information from the sensors and the weather forecast will be used to control the heating of the property. The service will help to improve indoor temperature uniformity, improve the energy efficiency of the buildings and reduce heating costs and emissions.

Espoon Asunnot builds the capacity and knowhow of active residents through annual trainings. The energy expert trainings focus on the basics of energy and water consumption in properties and how to save energy. The aim is to highlight aspects through which residents themselves can influence the reduction of energy consumption.  |

|   |  Action description | Espoo aims to phase out fossil fuels for district heating by 2029. The resulting increased electrification of Espoo's district heat production, combined with an increase in electric mobility and other electricity consumption, will also require the development of Espoo's electricity distribution network. This will ensure that the network will remain reliable for Espoo's residents in the future as the energy transition progresses.

To this aim, City of Espoo has signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the electricity distribution company Caruna. The aim of the cooperation is to support Espoo's growth and carbon neutrality goals with a strong electricity network that meets the energy needs of the future and enables clean energy solutions for Espoo's residents and businesses. The co-operation includes promoting energy storages, electric transport, and the use of renewable energy.  |

|   |  Action description | Espoo is developing a more walkable urban environment. We bring together the knowledge of the elements of walkability and livability of urban space for planners. We will identify the characteristics of urban space that influence walkability, so that they can be used in the design and construction of a walkable city. We will identify target areas for pedestrianisation in urban centres, where we will focus on pedestrianisation. We will compile a map of special accessibility areas, i.e. areas where accessibility is particularly important, to share information with planners.  |
|   |   |  We are constantly developing our walking and cycling route network. When building a new street network, our aim is to include the necessary walking and cycling routes and grade separations. Missing routes are being constructed along existing streets. The existing routes are constantly being renovated and their traffic safety is enhanced.  |
|   |   |  We will improve the flow and safety of cycling by converting cycle paths into one-way cycle lanes and improving cycle parking. We will equip all new cycle parking facilities with secure frame-locking racks.  |
|   |  | We have identified 2050 target network for cycling, with an intermediate goal of half of the target network to be ready by 2030. It describes the key cycling routes in Espoo and includes the high-quality routes, called ‘bicycle corridors’ and regional routes defined at regional level. The network is complemented by the main routes serving Espoo’s internal cycling traffic.  |
|   |  | The construction is a long-term effort. Most of the target network is existing combined pedestrian and cycling routes. For many parts, the routes in the target network already exist, but their quality level does not meet the targets set. The target network also presents entirely new connections or connection needs to be studied during further planning. Some of the target network will be constructed in connection with other street, road and traffic projects, and part will be carried out as independent cycling projects. Half of the target network (60 km) is estimated to be ready by 2030.  |

In Espoo, there are 110 stations. The all-season pass (seven months) costs 35 euros making it a very affordable option for most citizens. Also daily and weekly passes are available.

To further promote walking and cycling, we communicate to residents, partners and the Espoo community about sustainable transport and the impact of personal mobility choices on climate emissions. We offer cycling courses for adults who did not learn to ride a bicycle as a child. Our communication aims to provide information on the opportunities to make sustainable mobility choices in everyday life. We are testing ways to support companies that provide bicycle maintenance and repair services.  |

|  Action description | Espoo is steering new construction towards district centres to create a more unified urban structure that relies on public transport. In recent years, the city has invested heavily in public transportation infrastructure and investments will continue during the 2020s. The extension of the Western Metro (2022), the opening of the Jokeri Light Trail (2024), and Espoo City Rail Link (2028) are significant improvements to the capital region public transport system.

Western Metro (2022)

An extension to subway system has been one of the biggest investments in public transport in the Helsinki capital area during the 2010s and 2020s. West Metro construction project (21 km) was completed and commuter traffic began on phase II, the Matinkylä–Kivenlahti section, in December 2022. Phase I consisted of constructing the Ruoholahti–Matinkylä section, on which commuter traffic began in November 2017.

Länsimetro Oy is a limited liability company that is jointly owned by the cities of Espoo and Helsinki. Länsimetro Oy’s task is to build, own, maintain and develop the West Metro system, tracks and stations. After the construction project ended, the focus of Länsimetro’s operations shifted from construction to metro infrastructure ownership. As the owner of the metro infrastructure,  |   |

Jokeri Light Rail (2024)

Jokeri Light Rail line is being built between Itäkeskus in Helsinki and Keilaniemi in Espoo. The light rail will replace trunk bus line 550, which is the busiest bus line in the Helsinki region. Jokeri Light Rail will increase the reliability, capacity and passenger comfort of transverse public transport. The operations will begin in 2024.

Jokeri Light Rail will be implemented with the alliance model. This means that the client organization formed by the cities of Helsinki and Espoo will be combined into one organization, together with the planners and the implementers.

New housing and workplaces are planned to be built along the Jokeri Light Rail line in Perkkaa, Otaniemi and Keilaniemi, among other areas. Thanks to the proximity of services and the fast light rail, residents will have less need to use their own car.

City Rail Link (2028)

The City Rail Link and the Turku rail yard project will be the first phases of the new high-speed rail link between Helsinki and Turku. The City Rail Link will further improve public transport connections in the capital region, especially in the developing Espoon keskus and the rapidly growing Leppävaara, also supporting the transformation of the Kera area. The objective is to have the final, legally valid plans at the beginning of 2025.

The railway line’s construction planning, construction, and commissioning will take place in 2025–2031. Once completed, the high-speed rail link between Helsinki and Turku will create a common commuting area for 1.5 million people. The City Rail Link will considerably promote the sustainable development of Espoo’s five urban centres and be an important step towards emission-free transport.  |

Currently, one-fifth of Espoo residents' journeys are made by public transport. Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) is responsible for the organisation of public transport, such as planning, operation, timetables, the journey planner and the ticket system.

The number and share of electric buses is growing quickly in the public transport. Electric buses are essential in reaching the goal of cutting emissions from public transport in the Helsinki region by more than 90 percent from 2010 levels by 2025. The electric buses used on HSL's services must be powered by electricity that is sustainably generated in the Nordic countries, for example, by means of wind, water or solar power.

Plan

|   |  | In 2023, there will be 316 electric buses in the Helsinki Region. In 2025, about half of the buses HSL orders will be electric, which means about 650 buses.

The City of Espoo is responsible for the construction and maintenance of public transport infrastructure, such as terminals and stops. The city will design park&ride facilities for cars and bikes along public transport routes. The customer experience of intermodal parking will be improved by investing in guidance and information on intermodal parking.

The city will provide sufficient and high-quality cycle parking at rail stations. We will identify the demand for bicycle parking at the busiest bus stops and, where possible, install frame-locking bike racks at bus stops.

New transport services will support the use of public transport, walking and cycling and enable sustainable choices in everyday life. This requires continuous development work with businesses, HSL and other cities.

Espoo Disability Council has a special working group to work on issues related to accessibility in built environment and public transport. Espoo Elderly Council influences the planning, preparation and monitoring of the city's activities important to older people's well-being, health, inclusion, living environment, housing, mobility or coping with daily activities.

**Additional potential future actions not yet decided:**
• **Construction of Matinkylä-Leppävaara express tramway:** The Espoo Master Plan 2060 will define a public transport implementation programme, one part of which may be the construction of Matinkylä-Leppävaara tramway. The magnitude of the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of the Matinkylä-Leppävaara tramway can be estimated from the project appraisal of the Jokeri Light Rail tramway currently under construction. Jokeri Light Rail will increase the number of public transport trips by about 4 900 per day in 2030. The modal shift from diesel buses to trams is projected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from transport by 4 kt per year in 2030. The length of the Jokeri Light Rail is estimated to be about twice as long as the Matinkylä-Leppävaara tramway, which means that the maximum magnitude of the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions reduction of the Matinkylä-Leppävaara tramway could be about 2 kt per year, or about 2 kt CO2 eq.  |

Other intervention  |
|   |  Action description | The emissions of car traffic (private cars and logistics) are reduced by investing in the distribution infrastructure of alternative energy sources and streamlining transport and parking arrangements. We enable renewable fuel distribution stations in land-use planning. We develop park-and-ride facilities and services for public transport and develop and expand parking facilities for shared cars in public areas.

Espoo is Finland’s leading city in the uptake of e-mobility and electrification of transport is estimated to have great potential for future emission reductions. The number of electric vehicles is constantly increasing. In the future, electric vehicles will enable energy storage and the optimisation of energy supply and demand. The shift to e-mobility requires close co-operation with the grid operators and charging infra providers as well as improvements in city procurement, permitting processes, urban planning, and land use solutions.

Espoon Asunnot housing company offers its residents the opportunity to charge their electric or hybrid cars at Espoon Asunnot properties. At a resident’s initiative, a remotely controlled smart unit capable of slow charging will be installed on the existing heating pole.

The city of Espoo, based on dialogue involving experts from different city departments, will implement common policies and targets on how to develop the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. The work will include the guidelines for the city’s own properties, for parking companies owned by the city in public areas and for parking spaces in Espoon Asunnot housing company. The document will provide guidance for future public procurement, help to measure the uptake of e-mobility in the city and support the implementation of the Clean Vehicles Directive.

The City of Espoo will raise awareness among residents about e-mobility. The city will create information material and increase communication to Espoo residents to make it as easy as possible for housing associations and their decision-makers to install electric car charging infrastructure and raise awareness on the national subsidies available for charging infrastructure.

The use of biofuels is promoted by strengthening the conditions for the production and distribution of biogas. Espoo will also support the market with its own procurements.

In addition to local actions, the emissions of car transport will be influenced by EU and national regulations. Increasing the fuel distribution obligation is estimated to reduce emissions from road transport by 0.7%.  |

To provide a breeding ground for new research, design, and innovation in sector integration of energy and mobility, the city of Espoo in cooperation with Aalto University, VTT and other actors is introducing a new testing platform in the Otaniemi science community. OPULI is a platform, innovation environment and Living Lab for clean (professional) transport and energy business. It combines business intelligence with research activities. Collaboration will take place between different companies, research institutes and the public sector.

Additional potential future actions not yet decided and/or not included in previous scenario calculations:

Reducing speed limits on motorways from 120-&gt;100 km/h and 100-&gt;80 km/h
Reducing the speed limit to 100 km/h on motorways in the Espoo area that currently have a speed limit of 120 km/h (about 9 km) and to 80 km/h on roads with a speed limit of 100 km/h (about 25 km).

Faster uptake of electric cars
The number of electric cars in Espoo is expected to grow faster than earlier forecasted. The socio-economic level of Espoo's population is one of the highest in Finland. This is one of the reasons why the growth in the number of electric cars in Espoo has been fastest out all big cities in Finland in recent years. In addition, Espoo and its partners have invested in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and will continue in the future to enable an optimistic growth scenario for electric vehicles. National policies such as subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles and positive tax treatment have contributed to the growth in the number of electric vehicles.

Setting an environmental zone for lorries on 60 % of streets
Ban the use of fossil fuel trucks on parts of Espoo's streets. Diesel trucks would switch to renewable diesel, reducing CO2 eq emissions by 100% (tailpipe emissions). Gas trucks would switch to biogas, reducing CO2 eq emissions by 100% (tailpipe emissions).

New scenario calculations also take into account the negative effect on emission reductions of lowering the renewable fuel distribution obligation in national regulation. In the new calculation it is assumed that the share of renewable fuels in 2028-30 will remain the same as now planned for 2027, i.e. 22.5%, compared to 34% as was previously forecasted.

|   |  Action description | Espoo's districts will be used as pilot environments for companies and research institutes to develop sustainable smart, and scalable urban solutions. Districts will be used as development and pilot environments for companies and research institutes developing sustainable solutions.

The city acts as an orchestrator bringing together actors from small start-ups to global companies, universities, and research institutions to find the most impactful solutions. The role of the city is to enable the development and ensure that the work is targeted at the most important development challenges of each diverse district from densely built-up urban areas to smaller village-like centres and areas that are undergoing urban transformation.

The focus area for green transition in Espoo and example of an area under major urban transformation is Kera, a former industrial and logistic district that will be developed into a new city center and forerunner in sustainable city development, circular economy, and digitalization through multi-stakeholder co-operation. The City of Espoo and private investors are constructing services and homes for 14,000 future inhabitants. District development is aimed towards resource-wise construction, innovative and low-emission energy solutions, and new digital services and applications such as a Nokia-led unique network of smart street poles, which provide a platform for new data-driven services. The city acts as a facilitator as well as an ecosystem orchestrator and brings the area's residents, landowners, companies, and other development partners around the same table to develop the area together. A commitment for close cooperation, reaching carbon neutrality by 2030, and the use of significant circular economy solutions has been made between the stakeholders. First pilots in Kera started already in 2019, and construction will begin by 2024.  |

The learnings from Kera will be used to benefit the development of other parts of the city as well, such as Leppävaara, Espoo Centre, Finnoo, Kivenlahti, Keilaniemi, and Viiskorpi. Without sophisticated digital design tools, such as BIM (building information modelling) solutions, and harmonised information management practices, it would be nearly impossible to carry out complex and evolving urban development projects like those in the Kera district.

Espoo 3D city model and digital platforms enable local project managers to integrate diverse stakeholders using shared virtual environments. These virtual platforms enable stakeholders to observe and analyse alternative design solutions for supporting the requirements of functional and sustainable urban districts. Furthermore, the digital platforms allow project managers to engage in dialogue with residents to understand specific needs. These may include the requirements of individuals with reduced mobility or insights into designing and locating services within developing city districts.  |

|   |  Action type | Technical intervention
Physical / spatial intervention  |
|   | Action description | Espoo uses land-use planning to direct construction to centres and along good public transport connections. The city also finding ways to reduce the adverse climate effects of its own construction of buildings and infrastructure, by refurbishing existing building stock, and through construction management.

Goals of new construction and renovation:
• New construction and renovation guidance take into account sustainable development and CO2 emissions.
• New sites constructed by the city and by Espoon Asunnot are planned for A energy class.
• The refurbishment of existing building stock aim for 30 % improvement in energy efficiency.
• The possibilities of heat recovery of geothermal, solar energy and waste energy as well as wooden construction are evaluated on a site-by-site basis.
• The goal is for 10 % of the new buildings’ energy consumption to be produced with renewable energy produced on site (solar electricity, geothermal heat, wind power).

With the help of climate-wise control of construction - multi-objective optimization - the carbon footprint and total costs during the entire life cycle of the buildings are assessed and affect the planning phase. The operating model opens up new opportunities for optimizing energy use in support of the city’s climate goals. Optimization also contributes to the construction of safe and healthy buildings. The chosen solutions are data-based and can be justified transparently and clearly. Optimization also covers material choices.

|   |  | • Developing emission calculations as part of the assessment of the effectiveness and costs of infrastructure construction
• Promoting circular economy of infrastructure construction with more sustainable procurement criteria for materials
• Implementing the national green deal agreement towards emission-free construction sites. Its aim is to ensure that no fossil fuels are used on city’s own construction sites after 2025. In addition, we will gradually move to lower-emission construction equipment and transport vehicles.
• Paying attention and compensating the effects that large impermeable surfaces such as roofs, streets and parking facilities have in the natural circulation of water and their retention or absorption capacity.
• Evaluating the effects on carbon sinks in the planning of significant new construction areas
• Developing circulation of construction and demolition materials

The city is also preparing for the new national construction law that will enter into force in 2025 and bring numerous new obligations to promote low carbon and circular solutions. These include, for example, the calculation of the carbon footprint and the emission limit values for buildings, the preparation of a material passport and statement, mandatory demolition mapping in all demolition sites, as well as digitization of building information and an information model-based building permit.  |

|   |  | The emission level indicator includes company-owned and controlled ghg-emissions (Scope 1 and 2) and emissions from main outsourced activities (selected scope 3 emission sources.) Scope 1 and 2 sources include the emissions from landfills (CH4), wastewater treatment (CH4, N2O) and composting plants (CH4, N2O) as well as the emissions from fossil fuels and energy use (CO2). Emissions from outsourced activities are mainly related to energy use in various material handling and transport tasks. Approx. 85 % of these total emissions are related to waste and wastewater treatment -tasks, only 15 % are energy related ghg-emissions.

Landfill operation activities such as surface structure and gas collection design as well as the energy recovery from landfill gas is one of the key elements to reduce the climate impact in waste handling. In addition, developing the biological treatment of biowaste (digestion & composting operation) in future will increase the energy recovery from biowaste and reduce the ghg-emissions from the treatment. Research on nitrous oxide in waste water treatment (N2O)-occurrence, reduction methods and process optimization possibilities is also one main focus areas in carbon neutrality programme. The energy use of HSY’s facilities and company owned vehicles relies strongly on renewable energy sources (biogas, biofuels, green electricity). HSY has been using EKOenergy labelled, 100 % renewable electricity since 2015.  |

|   |  Action description | Espoo promotes circular economy both through the development of its own processes and services, as well as working in cooperation with multiple partners to promote the shift to circular solutions in industry and providing better shared and circular services to residents.

The main goal of circular economy is to use natural resources in a sustainable way, generating as little waste as is possible. In addition to daily products and services, the entire city, including its services and districts, operates in a sustainable manner. Products and materials remain in circulation for as long as possible, when goods and their components are reused and materials are recycled into raw materials for new products. For example sharing, repairing, reusing and reuse of materials are means of the circular economy to prolong the service life of products and materials.

At the end of 2020, we signed the European circular economy commitment Circular Cities Declaration and follow its ten objectives to promote circular solutions:
Establishing clear circular economy goals and strategies
Raising awareness of circular practices
Engaging local stakeholders
Embedding circularity principles in urban planning and asset management
Leveraging public procurement
Applying economic incentives to encourage circular behaviour
Fostering an enabling local regulatory framework  |

Monitoring the progress made
Reporting on progress

In the city's own operations, circular economy is promoted in construction and demolition, efficient use of space, reuse of materials and promoting sustainable procurement practices. In construction, circular solutions include the reuse of wooden elements and metal structures. In the food system, nutrient cycling is important and can be improved, for example, through agricultural land regeneration. In transport, circular solutions include the recycling of batteries for electric cars, biogas from bio-waste and car sharing.

Espoo strives to be an appealing area for circular economy business as well as collaboration related to research, development and innovation (RDI). City districts of Kera and Kiviruukki act as circular economy development zones, bringing together circular economy actors and serving as piloting platform for future-proof solutions.

The city aims to strengthen and promote the collection and processing of significant local material flows in accordance with the principles of circular economy, and thus the cycle of materials can be steered towards the most valuable use in terms of achieving carbon neutrality.

**Helsinki Region Environmental Services HSY**

HSY's goal is to promote the circular economy of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area. In practice this means, that:
• HSY will act as a coordinator, developer and influencer through information in regional circular economy cooperation.
• HSY will promote the nutrient cycling and sludge recovery, and add circular economy aspects to our procurement and construction projects.

HSY's goal is to increase the household recycling rate up to 60% by 2025 and reduce the amount of mixed waste in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area and Kirkkonummi. Increasing the sorting of biowaste is of central importance to achieving the goal. In practice this means, that:
• HSY will enhance the collection and treatment of biowaste, and develop new recycling services to residents.
• HSY will encourage and advise residents to sort household waste.  |

| B-2.2: Individual action outlines |

| Action outline | Action name | G1: Directing city growth to built-up areas and preserving carbon sinks |
| Action type | Nature-based solution |
| Action description | Espoo is a green city, where forests cover nearly 60 % of the city's surface area. The city's goal is to preserve carbon sinks when possible, to offset the residual CO2 emissions in 2030. According to latest study on the subject, Espoo's carbon sinks were in 2021 large enough to offset CO2 emissions in 2030, if the emissions can be brought down according to target of 80 % reduction from 1990. Preserving this level of carbon sinks in a rapidly growing city is however a challenge that requires holistic solutions. The knowledge base on the amount and development of carbon sinks is constantly being refined and Espoo is actively involved in the development work. Carbon sinks are being addressed as part of Espoo's master plan, which aims for 2060. Carbon sinks will be considered in land use planning as part of the overall climate impact of land use.

Developing the data on carbon sinks is key enabler required for the city to plan holistically sustainable carbon measures that take into account the values of different green spaces and green structures, as well as the role of vegetation and soils in the carbon balance. For forest areas, the natural dynamics of forests and the decline in growth of ageing forests and the natural increase in carbon sequestration need to be recognised. At the same time, however, ageing forests serve their natural and recreational values. By steering measures in a direction that has a positive impact on the carbon balance, effectiveness in the built environment can be achieved quickly. To preserve forested areas that are important as carbon sinks, for biodiversity, and also as recreational areas, Espoo is investing in infill development and steering construction towards district centres and already built-up areas.

However, as the city grows, some new development will inevitably take place on existing green spaces. When planning for new development, especially in forested or marsh area, we assess the impact of the plan on carbon sinks and stocks. We are also actively developing emission calculation tools and methods for land use planning to get a better understanding of the impact of land use on our climate goals. In addition, we promote the deployment of the green factor tool that increases the greenery in zoning projects. |

Climate Neutrality Action
Plan

|   | Action description | Espoo's goal is to be a pioneer in reconciling the needs of a growing city and protection of biodiversity. In 2021 Espoo Strony, the city set a new ambitious goal of no net loss by 2035. It is a state where human activity does not decrease biodiversity or the benefits of nature to humans. To meet the challenge, the city is currently launching Nature-wise Espoo project that will help to find every way possible to secure and increase biodiversity in a growing city. Achieving a state of no net loss is based on a mitigation hierarchy where the goal is to always primarily avoid and minimise the loss of natural values. Negative environmental impacts can be avoided by, for example, directing construction away from valuable natural sites. If this is not possible, attempts to minimise the negative impact are made by e.g. planting trees and vegetation in the area which can be used to secure wildlife corridors. Wildlife corridors include all areas covered by vegetation which form a network between nature's core areas and allow various species to travel from one area to another. If the negative environmental impact cannot be avoided or minimised, the last resort is to offset it by improving natural environments elsewhere. In the Nature-wise Espoo project the city will for example: 11. assess Espoo's current city planning and biodiversity preservation practices 12. develop new tools that help take natural values into account during city planning and nature conservation 13. determine which natural sites in Espoo would benefit from restorative measures and if so, what kind of measures Participating in research projects and learning more about other cities' biodiversity restoration practices is important. The knowledge and results obtained during the project will be compiled into a Nature-wise Espoo roadmap which defines biodiversity preservation methods and actions. Inviting the whole Espoo community – the residents, associations, businesses and landowners – to participate will also be one of keys to success. Espoo has identified 23 sites to become nature reserves by 2030, at the rate of three new sites per year. While nature reserves can help to protect valuable habitats, sites or species, this alone is not enough to safeguard biodiversity. Espoo still has valuable nature outside protected areas. Less natural areas have many important functions: they provide ecosystem services, create ecological connectivity and provide habitats for many species. Therefore, in addition to the establishment of protected areas, the city is taking into account nature conservation as a whole, for example by ensuring ecological connectivity between areas. While conserving and protecting natural and green areas both within and outside the city's nature reserves is of foremost value, technical green structures such as green roofs, decks and green walls are an important additional way of increasing urban greening in dense urban centres. Espoo promotes the construction of green roofs and steers their design and implementation as a part of town planning, plot conveyance and building permit processes. We also analyse the possibilities of restoring habitats and increase the amount of protected natural areas.  |

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

Espoo's climate neutrality target, as approved by the city council, is defined as an 80% reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 level. The aim is that the remaining 20% can be sequestered in carbon sinks. Carbon sinks are growing carbon stocks, such as growing forests.

Based on Climate-neutral Espoo emission reduction scenario estimating the impacts of measures that have been co-developed between the city and key stakeholders, if all actions are completed, Espoo would achieve in 2030:

72% reduction compared to 1990 emissions
65% reduction compared to 2022 emissions

In summer 2023, the city developed a new scenario and analysis based on updated data and possible additional actions identified during the CCC preparation. Based on this, the city could achieve in 2030:

80% reduction compared to 1990 emissions
78% reduction compared to 2022 emissions

The remaining emissions are difficult to tackle and relate in particular to emissions from transport, logistics and private energy use, i.e. they are emissions related to consumption and individual choices that require even more collaboration with citizens and stakeholders and development of national and EU-level regulation. There needs to be a behavioural change and education to succeed in the sustainability transition. These are part of our Action Plan (A-3.3).

The amount of carbon sinks in Espoo was studied in 2021. Espoo's soil and vegetation carbon stocks and their growth, or carbon sinks, are at a relatively high level compared to many other European cities. The largest carbon stocks and sinks are in forest soils and vegetation. Forests, covering nearly 60% of the city's surface area, and protected areas are important carbon sinks for Espoo. According to the study, Espoo's carbon sinks were large enough to absorb 2030 greenhouse gas emissions, if they can be brought down to the target of 80% below 1990 levels. In other words, the sink would correspond to a remaining carbon sequestration of about 20%.

However, maintaining this high level of carbon sinks in the Espoo region will be challenging as the city grows and urbanises. Espoo's population is growing by an average of approximately 4,700 inhabitants per year. Growth will be directed mainly to already built-up areas, especially in city centres, and along good public transport connections. Densifying the spread out city structure will promote the use of sustainable transport modes and thus help reducing emissions from transport. In this way, even in a growing city, emissions can be reduced as much as possible while preserving a large proportion of carbon sinks and stocks.

The adequacy of carbon sinks is one part of land use development. Carbon sinks are being addressed as part of Espoo's master plan 2060 currently under development. The knowledge base on the amount and development of carbon sinks is constantly being refined and Espoo is actively involved in the development work.

In addition to city-wide inventories and actions, it is important to address the issue of preserving sufficient carbon sinks and possible carbon sequestration on national and regional level. Finland will inevitably incur a significant emissions debt in the 2020s, and sinks are in danger of falling short of targets. According Prime Minister Orpo's Government Programme 2023, the national government will influence the climate through effective emission reduction measures, increased carbon sinks and clean economy solutions. On the other hand, forestry is viewed from many perspectives in the government programme and maintaining the sufficiency of natural carbon sinks is challenging. The programme states that the government will actively promote the large-scale deployment of technological sinks in Europe and Finland, and that the government will set a target for significant deployment of technological sinks already in the 2020s. The government also aims to enable voluntary carbon reduction and carbon sequestration markets to operate in an incentive-based and transparent manner.

# 7 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for further refining the Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract.

# Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration – textual elements

Espoo's Climate City Contract has focused on building a strong mandate for climate-neutrality by 2030 with the city and stakeholders, identifying and understanding the interconnected systems that need to be activated to close the gap to net zero, and in co-creating a portfolio of direct and enabling actions with significant impact on city's climate emissions.

According to emission reduction scenarios, action portfolios and impact pathways developed during the CCC process, Espoo has the potential to reduced emissions to reach the climate-neutrality goal by 2030, but the work is far from over. Particular attention needs to be paid to emissions related to transport and mobility that will form the largest share of Espoo's future GHG emissions due to rapid decarbonisation of energy production. Some actions may still lack political will or public support, or be dependent on national regulation or mobilizing stakeholders, requiring continuous dialogue with local decision-makers, national authorities, and with citizens and stakeholders.

Transition to net zero and developing the next CCC are therefore seen as iterative processes. Next steps identified during the development of the Action Plan include:

Partnerships: Co-developing a joint working method with partners that have signed Espoo's Climate City Commitment with regular high and expert-level meetings and opportunities for co-creation and joint learning, and inviting new partners to join the work.
Dialogue with decision-makers and city departments: facilitating the ongoing dialogue between political decision-makers and city departments on climate pathways, actions and co-benefit to increase acceptability of climate actions.
Just transition: Workshops, events, webinars, surveys, meetings, and citizen panels provide platforms for dialogue and collaboration with different stakeholders, communities, and citizens. Digital engagement platforms will be used to gather input from those who might not attend in-person events Concerns related to social and environmental justice and for example energy poverty will be addressed to enhance acceptability of the planned climate actions and ensure that effects on different communities, including marginalized groups are taken into consideration. Espoo's population growth comes mainly from immigration and the share of citizens with immigrant background is estimated to continue to rise rapidly in the next years. Therefore, ensuring that these groups are included as actors of change for climate action is one of issues to be addressed.
Climate budget and investments: CCC Investment Plan forms the basis of Espoo's first climate budget to be included in the city's Annual Budget 2024 and 10-year investment plan. Climate budgeting makes the goal of climate neutrality more concrete and transparent for citizens, decision-makers and the whole Espoo community and will be developed in future budget rounds to gain more comprehensive and granulated view on climate investments and their impact. In addition, different funding sources, public-private partnerships and private investment will be continuing to be explored to contribute towards the 2030 goal.
Climate-neutral Espoo Roadmap and climate action portfolio: ambitious climate action portfolio identified in the CCC will be implemented solve climate challenges related to local energy, transport, circular economy, built environment and nature-based solutions step by step with Espoo innovation community and stakeholders. Climate-neutral Espoo Roadmap is prepared and climate measures updated simultaneously with CCC process to be approved by the City Board in 2023 and updated once in a 4-year council term.
Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) and Sustainable Urban Logistics Plan (SULP) will be prepared in 2024 to further address the emissions related transport, mobility and logistics

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

expected to form the largest share of Espoo's future GHG emissions. SUMP will form a strategic and integrated approach to dealing with the complexity of urban transport and a key instrument to fostering low-carbon, accessible, safe, and affordable mobility.

Scope 3 emissions: Espoo has already included actions related to reducing scope 3 emissions, for example those related to building, and will continue towards the goal of 1.5 degree lifestyle. The calculation methods for scope 3 consumption-based emissions will continue to be developed with research organisations, experts and other Finnish cities to allow for more accurate data and inclusion of scope 3 emissions to future emission inventories and scenarios.
National and international collaboration: Espoo will continue to work in close collaboration with NetZeroCities, Finnish national authorities and Mission Cities, other European cities and the Commission to develop and share learnings to support the 100 Climate-neutral Cities Mission goals.
Monitoring and learning: yearly monitoring and review with city organisation and stakeholders to follow up the progress our climate goals and actions and provide opportunities for joint learning and if necessary, identification of new actions and pathways to accelerate the effort.

Espoo's Climate City Commitment will be updated every two years in an inclusive process with city departments, stakeholders, and citizens following the support and guidelines provided by NetZeroCities.

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Introduction

As one of the leading European smart and sustainable cities, the City of Espoo is strongly committed to climate neutrality by 2030. In 2019, we prepared Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) as a key instrument for its implementation. In 2021, our ambitious climate target was further emphasized when selected by the Espoo City Council as one of the seven key strategic goals of our city strategy, the Espoo Story.

Our aim for the 100 Smart and Climate-Neutral Cities Mission is ecosystem-driven co-creation. Espoo is looking for the most impactful ways to cut emissions in cooperation with universities, research institutes, businesses, national and regional authorities, and citizens. As the largest innovation ecosystem in Northern Europe, Espoo is already an experimentation and innovation hub where smart, digital, and sustainable solutions of the future are being developed. Together with our partners we have created a strong overall vision and commitment to systemic change and are finding business-driven climate solutions that will create a positive carbon handprint and promote green growth both locally and globally.

In the past, Espoo has ranked number one in two sustainability benchmark studies of 145 European cities conducted by Tilburg University in 2016 and 2017. Our goal is to keep the growth sustainable also in the future. As the winner of the Intelligent Community of the Year award in 2018 and the Energy Globe World Award in 2019 and as a finalist in the European Capital of Innovation Awards in 2019, 2020 and 2022, we have been recognized as a global forerunner in smart city development and sustainability. We are actively sharing our knowledge and learning together with the European community through city networks such as Eurocities, ICLEI and URBACT and initiatives such as the Covenant of Mayors, Circular Cities Declaration and Local Green Deal.

Espoo and its partners are finding the most impactful ways to cut CO2 emissions at a rapid pace. The climate solutions in Espoo focus on emissions from energy, transport, land use, and construction. Highlights of our journey include carbon-neutral district heating for 250,000 end-users that will be produced during the 2020s and coal completely abandoned already by 2025. In addition, major investments have been made to new metro and tram connections to keep the city growth sustainable. An electric charging infrastructure is well under way to help to solve the challenge of cutting down private car emissions in a network city with five urban centres with relatively long distances. All new buses and vehicles in the city fleet are low emission models. City bike system brings co-benefits of cleaner air, health, and well-being. However, new solutions to bring down emissions particularly from transport and logistics, are still needed to reach the city-wide goal of climate-neutrality.

We are committed to building a city that is both sustainable and inclusive. Espoo hosts strategic cross-sectoral programmes that allow dialogue and co-creation between political leaders, city officials, research and innovation actors, citizen forums and NGOs. We are co-creating human-centric solutions that are ecologically, economically and socially sustainable and benefit diverse groups of citizens ensuring that no one is left behind. A thousand staff members, citizens and partners were engaged in reviewing Espoo's progress towards a sustainable future in our UN Agenda 2030 Voluntary Local Review in 2020. We are strongly committed to delivering the Cities Mission in an equally inclusive and participatory manner bringing the policy close to people.

Participating in the Mission is a way for us to accelerate local collaboration and action towards rapid decarbonization as well as to strengthen our role as an interesting piloting and innovation hub for low-carbon solutions in Europe. We are eager to learn and share our successes with others, together building the path for climate neutrality. As one of the Mission cities, we will focus on experimentation, co-creation and tangible results – together with the entire community.

In this commitment we outline and declare the fruitful collaboration with our partners towards climate-neutrality. City of Espoo has a unique way to develop together with different stakeholders: companies, civil society, and citizens. We see this Commitment and the Mission as an important tool to further tighten and strengthen this collaboration.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

The goal of the City of Espoo is to become climate neutral by 2030. To this end, we commit to delivering bold climate action that will enable us to achieve the indicated goal on time. We commit to do this in collaboration with the whole community, promoting innovation and sustainable growth, and in a fair and just way not leaving anyone behind.

Espoo City Council set the target of becoming a climate-neutral city by year 2030 in 2017. This commitment was further emphasized in 2021 in the Espoo Story, the city's strategy, that outlines climate-neutrality by 2030 as one seven key targets for the whole city organisation for the council term 2021-2025. As Finland's second largest city, Espoo is one of the key actors contributing to regional and national targets of climate neutral Helsinki-Uusimaa region by 2030 and climate neutral Finland by 2035. Climate actions have the potential to bring about multiple co-benefits such as improvements in public health, less air and noise pollution, increased energy security and reduced cost of energy, green and digital transition of local economy, job and value creation, and preservation of sufficient ecosystem services, biodiversity, and green areas.

Espoo's climate neutrality target is defined as 80% emission reduction compared to the base year 1990 level. The remaining 20% share can be absorbed in carbon sinks or compensated by other means. Carbon sink is a term used to refer to growing carbon stocks, such as growing forests. Compensation refers to emission reduction units procured from outside the city organisation's own activities to compensate for the remaining greenhouse gas emissions.

Espoo intends to address all Green House Gases (GHGs) and sectors and sources of emissions to reach climate neutrality by 2030 as defined by the Cities Mission. Our target includes scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as scope 3 emissions due to the disposal and treatment of waste and wastewater generated within the city boundary.

Espoo's climate ambition is supported by several partners and stakeholders. Espoo recognizes its role as a city in not only supporting its own climate actions, but partners' actions as well. All city units are committed to climate neutrality by 2030.

Espoo is proud to welcome committed climate partners from different stakeholder groups: business, education and research. Altogether x partners have signed the climate-neutrality commitment by 15 September, 2023 and y partners have attached their climate commitment appendix already and the rest are to hand in their appendices by 15 March, 2024. Espoo is working closely with stakeholders towards the year 2030 and has a continuous process to welcome new climate partners.

In fall 2022 Espoo conducted a scenario study to learn if current decided climate actions are enough to reach carbon neutrality by year 2030. This study showed that additional activities are needed especially in traffic and mobility sector and in lesser extent, also in the energy sector. In addition, Espoo has conducted two preliminary studies (2020, 2023) on how to count consumption-based scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. While these are not counted in the climate-neutrality target, the city is committed working towards reducing the emissions in sectors such as construction and public food services, and procurement of other goods and services.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

Espoo's strategic interventions focus on delivering systemic changes together with the whole community in five key areas. Actions in these sectors are estimated to have the largest potential for decarbonization as well as provide the important enabling measures needed for truly systemic change. These key priorities have been identified with stakeholders, partners, and citizens (see section 4).

## Energy systems

The goal is an intelligently controlled energy system, which enables households and companies situated in Espoo to use reasonably priced and sustainable energy.

Delivering carbon-neutral district heating by 2030 (Espoo Clean Heat).
Energy optimization, efficiency and savings in city's own building stock, housing, industry, and services.
Developing smarter, more flexible electric grids to provide the basis for achieving climate-neutrality in both district heating and transportation.

## Mobility and transport

The aim is for all is for all residents to be able to make smooth and low-emission everyday journeys supported by well-functioning, low-carbon urban logistics

Increasing the efficiency of the transport system in a network city with five urban centres connected by rails.
Promoting the shift to sustainable modes of transport (walking, cycling, public transport).
Speeding up the uptake of e-mobility, electrification of transport and the shift from fossil fuels to fossil-free fuels.

## Built Environment

Espoo's aim is to keep its fast population growth sustainable by directing new construction mainly to already built areas and along good public transport connections and to develop new low-carbon and digital solutions in close co-operation with diverse partners.

Developing the Espoo's diverse city districts in close co-operation with businesses and research and development partners to promote the introduction of smart and low-emission urban solution.
Land use planning, i.e. zoning and permitting act as enablers for sustainable mobility, zero-emission energy solutions and low-carbon construction.

ESPOO ESBO

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Cutting down emissions and reducing environmental impacts of construction throughout its life cycle in city's own construction and construction management. Implementing the national green deal agreement towards emission-free construction sites.

## Waste and circular economy

The goal is for Espoo to be a climate-neutral city that adheres to the principles of the circular economy in its own actions, is home to the best circular economy experts, businesses and research in the country and enables its residents to make sustainable choices in their everyday lives.

Promoting circular economy in construction and demolition, efficient use of space, reuse of materials, bio circular economy, sustainable procurement, and circular and sharing economy services offered to residents.
Developing city districts of Kera and Kiviruukki as platforms for circular solutions that provide research, development, and innovation (RDI) and business opportunities for circular economy actors.

## Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions

Espoo is an exceptionally green city, where forests cover nearly 60 % of the city's surface area. The goal is to preserve sufficient level of carbon sinks to offset the residual CO2 emissions in 2030. In addition, Espoo's goal is to be a pioneer in reconciling the needs of a growing city and protection of biodiversity.

Directing construction to already built-up areas to conserve carbon sinks, biodiversity and natural values.
Finding ways for Espoo's urban development to foster, revitalize and increase biodiversity to achieve the goal of no net loss by 2035.

In addition, Espoo will develop and implement activities such as citizen engagement, capacity building, and marketing and communications to support the systemic and behavioral change needed in the community towards the goal of climate-neutral city by 2030.

Significant co-benefits of the collaboration with different stakeholders are increasing vitality and well-being in general: co-creation and collaboration create shared understanding and vision. Espoo becomes more attractive and its citizens and other stakeholders feel sense on belonging. Pilot areas and test beds are agoras of fruitful collaboration with concrete results towards climate-neutral future. Forerunner atmosphere continues to entice new companies, capabilities connecting to high-quality learning, research and development opportunities in daycares, schools, universities and research institutes.

## 4 Principles and process

### Ambition and mandate

The Espoo Story is the city's strategy, a visionary narrative created together with city employees, citizens, communities, and companies. According to the strategy, Espoo wants to be the most sustainable city in Europe, now and in the future.

It is a strategic cross-sectoral programme owned by the mayor and led by a high-level steering group to lead long-term, goal-oriented systemic development towards a climate-neutral city. Since then, the city has carried out a high number of projects and activities all contributing to the systemic transformation. With this strategic and organisational backbone, we see the implementation of our Climate City Contract as a way to further accelerate local collaboration and action towards rapid decarbonization.

The transformation is supported by a team of 25+ experts working in the Mayor's Office Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Development. The team collaborates with the different departments of city organisation as well as the innovation community, private sector, third sector and citizens. In June 2023, the centre has joined forces with experts working on other cross-cutting, strategic issues such as digitalization, immigration, international relations, co-creation, citizen engagement, research, and data management to form a new Strategy and Development Unit providing even more coherent approach to address the systemic challenges of a growing city.

In 2023, Espoo is updating its Climate-neutral Espoo 2030 roadmap, prepared simultaneously with Climate City Contract, for the city council's approval. The documents bring together all existing policies, actions and programmes and identify actions to address the gap between those and the goal of climate-neutrality.

## Systemic innovation, collaboration and trust

With over 400 R&amp;D units, a top-level business, design and tech university, and a host of leading companies clustered in a small area, Espoo is one of the leading innovation capitals of Europe. The city, together with Aalto University and technological research centre VTT, forms a core that brings together all players – start-ups, students, top companies, researchers, and ordinary citizens – to create innovation for a better life.

We believe that tackling the climate crisis require truly radical creativity – a form of working where people from all walks of life collaborate to find new solutions to the large, systemic problems such as climate change. Collaboration and trust between the decision-makers, thinkers and doers from all industries and disciplines is our strength and the basis on which we are building our climate city contract.

We have already gained positive experiences with joint sustainability and climate commitments and strong partnerships supporting climate neutrality. In our flagship decarbonization project, Espoo Clean Heat, Fortum and the City of Espoo committed to transformation that will result in carbon-neutral district heating by 2030 in the region and transition to local self-sufficient heating on a large scale. In Kera district, sustainability partnership is consolidated with a commitment in the land use agreements, and in the Finnoo area, the constructors are committed to pioneering clean energy solutions. We will take learnings from these past commitments to provide support for experimentation and bring players together across organizational boundaries to open our urban environments as development platforms for new sustainable solutions.

## Open dialogue and co-creation

Espoo as a forerunner has been developing innovative ways for co-creation, open dialogue and multi-actor approach widely with stakeholders for sustainable development. Focus areas include smart energy, smart mobility, circular economy, city design and built environment. As a city, we commit to enabling co-operation, bringing together different actors and building project portfolios aimed at solving systemic challenges in the city piece by piece.

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

In this spirit, we have sent an open invitation to our partners to jointly draft Espoo's Climate City Contract and join the effort with their own commitments towards climate-neutrality. The work began in March 2023 with mayor's invitation. 'Let's create a climate-neutral Espoo together' high-level event drew together 70 representatives of the city and its partners. After that, the work has continued in one-to-one meetings and joint workshop. With our stakeholders we are co-creating a working method to support climate work collaboration with companies and citizens until 2030 and beyond.

In addition to dialogue on the local level, we work in partnership with other Finnish Mission Cities, the national government, communities in greater Helsinki capital and metropolitan area, and Helsinki Uusimaa Regional Council. Finnish Mission cities form a close-knit community supported each other and relevant ministries. The cities share and co-learn and work closely with national government to make sure the voice and needs of cities are heard when developing national regulation and support. The cities together with their local partners are key actors needed to deliver the ambitious Finnish national climate neutrality target of 2035.

From consultation to partnership is the slogan that guides Espoo's approach and model to citizen participation. It describes the shift towards a more inclusive and participatory governance. In 2022, a new resident participation group was introduced to strengthen the direct links between residents and Sustainable Espoo Programme. Partner group that consisted of residents from diverse backgrounds, including marginalized groups, met in facilitated co-design workshops focusing on different aspects of the city's sustainability work, including the preparation of Climate City Contract.

We are also developing ways to assess and monitor the climate actions and their impact, and to improve the quality of climate data continuously.

# Carbon footprint, carbon handprint and climate heartprint

In Espoo, we understand climate work as part of a bigger picture than emission reduction per se. We believe that climate work can have significant effect on how our city develops in the future and how we increase health and wellbeing, attract investments and talent, create new business opportunities and jobs, and help to develop attractive and safe neighbourhoods.

The partners we have invited to join our commitment are companies, universities and research actors that are located in Espoo and/or have a significant effect on our city's carbon footprint, carbon handprint or what we call the climate heartprint.

First and foremost is the carbon footprint. We need to continue the rapid decarbonization and cut our carbon footprint to reach the goal of climate-neutrality by 2030.

However, equally important goal for us is to increase the size of the community's carbon handprint, or in other words, contribute to the reduction in global emissions with the help of innovations developed in Espoo. Local actors such as universities, research organizations and businesses create innovations that are both sustainable and commercially successful, test and pilot them in Espoo, and then export the best solutions globally. This way, our positive climate impact can be much greater than our city's size.

In addition to footprint and handprint, we need a lot of other changes to happen in our community - changes in skills, capabilities, mindsets, and actions. To describe these, we have created a third concept called climate heartprint, which describes efforts in education, guidance, behavioural change, support and engagement, the effect of which may be difficult to count, but without our efforts will likely fall short.

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

We are committed to inclusive and just transition that leaves no one behind. We have engaged citizens in our climate action and the development of the city and it's districts - starting with the city strategy. Climate work is supported also by city's commitment to be a forerunner in localizing the UN Agenda2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with the key theme of "Leave no-one behind".

## Monitoring and joint learning

We commit to working in close co-operation with the Espoo community in delivering our Climate City Contract. We will invite the actors to regular joint dialogues, provide opportunities for joint learning and work together with our partners to further accelerate our joint impact.

Within the city organisation, we will monitor our progress in Sustainable Espoo Programme's steering group, that is formed half of political leaders representing all eight different political groups of the city council, and half sectoral leaders from the different departments of city organisation.

It will provide a platform for ongoing dialogue between political decision-makers and city department managers. The group is independent from city's normal hierarchical structure allowing for horizontal, silos breaking forms of governance needed for systemic change.

In addition, the mayor chairs an internal climate steering group that meets regularly to follow the work and share information between city departments.

We will have yearly monitoring and review process to see the progress our climate goals and actions. The Climate City Commitment will be updated every two years. The City Council will update the Climate-Neutral Espoo 2030 roadmap at least once in a city council term (4 years).

Joel Seppälä, Regional Manager in Espoo

Operations related to climate action:

Energy infrastructure: Electricity distribution

Existing collaboration with the City of Espoo and expectations for future collaboration related to climate action:

The electricity distribution operator in Espoo, today "Caruna Espoo Oy", has a long tradition of developing the energy infrastructure together with City of Espoo to provide sustainable growth in Espoo area. As a result of successful collaboration, the energy infrastructure is strong and reliable. Therefore, Espoo area is today able to take advantage of green transition and to give the world a perfect example of decisive climate actions.

In order to complete the decided climate actions and to provide sustainable growth in the future, Caruna expects intensive co-operation with City of Espoo and other relevant infrastructure providers to gather deep understanding of developing the infrastructure as a part of developing city for future citizens. Caruna, Fortum and City of Espoo have created a joint program named "Espoo Clean Heat" which aims to carbon neutral heat production in 2029.

The concrete actions in collaboration relate to improve city development to reserve the space required by the infrastructure to efficiently serve needs of the citizens. Efficient space management improve the investment efficiency which in the end reduce the cost burden to the end customers – that is, the present and future citizens. Improving the processes of city development also increase the attractiveness of Espoo and Finland as investment environment in terms of reliable and smooth processes.

**Operations related to climate action:**

SRV has a strategic programme called Lifecycle-wise Future. SRV develops building concepts focusing on minimising carbon footprint and maximising carbon handprint. The concept includes also urban green and biodiversity focusing on increasing human well-being in cities. The building concept includes energy system and building materials aiming for sustainable systemic change in the whole value change.

SRV has also developed its own construction operations, with all sites reaching net zero emissions as from the beginning of 2022. Last year, SRV was able to eliminate 75 per cent of all emissions during the year, and achieved net-zero emissions by compensating for the remaining emissions by planting trees as carbon sinks.

SRV also launched biodiversity targets and a long-term objective to be a carbon-neutral company by 2030. These are major steps towards a lifecycle-wise future. In addition, SRV updated its sustainability programme for 2023. The sustainability programme is based on the ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) framework and uses it to communicate its objectives in these three areas.

Existing collaboration with the City of Espoo and expectations for future collaboration related to climate action: Currently SRV and City of Espoo have a project based regular cooperation in city development. One of the recent activities is also a joint development meeting on low-carbon district as well as the development of biodiversity metrics in urban areas.

# National commitment to Climate City Contracts for EU Mission on Climate-neutral and Smart Cities

## Background for national-level participation in the mission

EU missions are a new collaborative approach developed under Horizon Europe to address some of the greatest challenges of our time. One of the five missions launched by the European Commission in 2021 is to “deliver 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030”, or the Cities Mission (referred to as the Climate Mission below). Based on an open call conducted by the Commission, six Finnish cities were selected to be among the 100 European cities participating: Tampere, Turku, Helsinki, Espoo, Lahti and Lappeenranta.

The six Finnish cities of the Climate Mission are committed to leading the way by being some of the first cities to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 and by acting as centres for experimentation and innovation. At the same time, the cities are supporting and promoting Finland’s achievement of the national goal of climate neutrality by 2035. According to emission calculations by the Finnish Environment Institute, the six cities were able to reduce their per capita $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions by an average of $47\%$ between 2007 and 2023.

Cities play a key role in achieving carbon neutrality, as their active climate work contributes directly to emission reductions in various sectors. Cities can actively influence the amount of their own greenhouse gas emissions (carbon footprint) and, in many ways, promote and accelerate emission reductions (carbon handprint) among residents, companies, communities and other stakeholders. Key areas in this include the energy system, transport, city planning, construction, carbon sinks and public procurement. Cities offer great opportunities for pioneering and innovation, as well as networks of operators. The largest cities also have significant in-house development resources, expertise and opportunities to invest in sustainable solutions and infrastructure.

The Finnish cities participating in the Climate Mission have prepared a Climate City Contract (CCC), which will be concluded with the European Commission. It is strongly recommended that Climate City Contracts be built on three levels, including the national level. In several other EU countries, the ministry level has entered or is entering into the Climate City Contract. The primary purpose of the national-level commitment is to better link national and city-level actions in climate policy through close vertical coordination. Thus, the mission provides a strategic alliance of climate work between cities and central government.

In order to stay on the emissions reduction path, we need more and stronger cooperation and partnerships between central government and cities. Traditionally, central government can support cities through legislation, economic steering measures or by sharing information and information steering. These can be strengthened and developed with new measures and tools to support and empower cities’ climate action. Through joint and systematic climate work, Finland can create a new competitive advantage and thereby improve the international competitiveness of our country. Environmentally sustainable solutions, the circular economy, energy efficiency, the transition to renewable energy and the related development work all create new innovations, jobs and export opportunities for Finland.

The Government Programme emphasises climate and energy policy and zero-emission solutions as well as co-operation for stopping the biodiversity loss. It places particular emphasis on the carbon handprint and nature handprint, which can be significantly
(4)

increased and promoted by concrete measures, as cities are export drivers and testbeds for smart climate solutions.

At the application stage of the Climate Mission, the national level was strongly involved in supporting the Finnish mission cities, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment drafted support letters for the Finnish cities that expressed interest in the mission. A national Climate Mission network has been established in Finland to bring all relevant actors to the same table for discussions, information sharing and cooperation. The network has also supported the Finnish mission cities in concrete terms by launching a co-creation project to support the cities' work. The aim of the project is to help, in a targeted way, the Finnish mission cities to prepare and carry out effective climate action, as well as to provide support for the joint preparation of the outputs required by the mission.

## Commitment of the national authority

*With this contract appendix, the national authorities undertake, within the framework of the Climate Mission, to contribute to the transformation of the cities into climate-neutral entities that use smart solutions for climate work by 2030. The national authorities strive to do this through their own national actions, which complement the actions of the cities themselves.*

An ambitious climate policy and investments in the green transition will strengthen the Finnish economy both immediately and in the longer term. Green investments will create work in Finland during the construction phase, but they will keep increasing the domestic value added even after their completion. In addition to the emergence of new production, the abandonment of fossil fuels will make the Finnish economy more domestic and also more stable and predictable in relation to the fluctuations of the global market.

According to the Finnish Climate Change Act, the national carbon neutrality target will be achieved in 2035. The climate emission reduction targets are 60% from the 1990 level by 2030, 80% by 2040 and 90–95% by 2050. The Climate Change Act identifies the significant role and obligation of cities and municipalities in achieving these climate targets.

According to the EU’s Effort Sharing Regulation, by 2030 Finland should reduce emissions from the effort sharing sector by 50% from the 2005 level. The Medium-term Climate Change Policy Plan (KAISU) will be updated during the term of Petteri Orpo’s government in accordance with the Climate Change Act. In connection with the update, the objectives for the different sectors and the necessary new measures will be reviewed.

## Measures of the national authority

The participation of national authorities through various measures includes direct and indirect actions in support of the mission cities. Here, support is understood in a broad sense and may take the form of, for example, policy support (parallel objectives and their reinforcement), the identification and compilation of existing initiatives in support of the Climate Mission (indirect funding), or the channelling of cities into possible financial instruments.

Some key measures of the national authority to support the Climate Mission cities in achieving their objectives in the coming years are presented below.

### Medium-term Climate Change Policy Plan

According to the Finnish Climate Change Act, the Government must adopt a Medium-term Climate Change Policy Plan (KAISU) each parliamentary term. The objective of the plan is the carbon neutrality of the whole of Finland by 2035. The preparation of the new Medium-term Climate Change Policy Plan has started with the updating of the baseline projections for different sectors. After updating the baseline projections, evaluations of the necessary
(4)

new measures will be made, taking into account the Government Programme. The emission reduction effects and financing needs of the new measures will be assessed at the same time. The planning of new measures will also take into account the situation and needs of cities with ambitious climate policies.

## Climate and energy strategy

A climate and energy strategy is being prepared. The strategy will cover all of the sources of greenhouse gas emissions (emissions trading sector, effort sharing sector, land use sector) and sinks (land use sector). The preparation of the climate and energy strategy emphasises emission reduction measures, a well-functioning energy market, clean electricity production and Finland's energy security as part of the sustainability transition. Impacts related to society and competitiveness are also at the heart of the strategy. Finland's goal is to increase its climate handprint and to advance its carbon neutrality through effective and sustainable means. A smooth permit process is a prerequisite for the creation of clean investments.

## Municipal Climate Change Solutions Programme

The Municipal Climate Solutions Programme accelerates, promotes and funds local climate work. So far, the programme has funded nearly 150 different climate projects around Finland, and it will continue until the end of 2024. The programme has brought the climate work of municipalities and regions to the centre stage of the preparation and implementation of national climate policy.

## Agreements concerning land use, housing and transport

The agreement procedure concerning land use, housing and transport (MAL) with the seven largest city regions will be continued to strengthen the partnership between the government and the city regions in related matters. Agreements concerning land use, housing and transport promote a low-carbon and sustainable urban structure and transport system, the digitalisation of transport and the planning of residential areas and housing production to meet the need. The agreements ensure the prerequisites for the growth and accessibility of city regions through investments in infrastructure and housing production. A denser community structure makes it possible to mitigate climate change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of natural resources, as well as prevent the reduction of carbon sinks. The central government finances the state subsidies of agreements concerning land use, housing and transport.

## Ecosystem agreements

The main objective of ecosystem agreements is innovative and pioneering cities that, based on their strengths, take advantage of the opportunities offered by digitalisation, other new technologies and carbon neutrality in order to achieve sustainable growth. Approximately five (5) of the 16 city regions with ecosystem agreements have direct content in their agreement providing for the development of climate change mitigation and smart solutions. This makes ecosystem agreements one of the important government instruments to support the implementation of the Climate Mission, especially from the point of view of the carbon handprint.

## Business Finland/Decarbonized Cities Programme

The objective of the Decarbonized Cities Programme is for ten cities worldwide to significantly reduce their carbon emissions thanks to Finnish expertise by 2030. Competence in integrated system solutions is key to achieving this goal, and it will also give a concrete boost to the carbon handprint beyond the borders of Finland.

## Circular Economy Programme

The Circular Economy Programme aims at the sustainable use of natural resources. The network of expertise on the circular economy (KiSu) supports municipalities and companies in, for example, finding funding opportunities as well as through education and co-creation projects. Currently, ministries, research institutes, 20 municipalities and a number of regions
(4)

and key industries are preparing a proposal for a voluntary commitment to promote the circular economy. In this "green deal" process, they make assessments of future directions and goals and develop together the most effective measures to promote the circular economy. The objective is a circular economy commitment for the whole of Finland.

## Energy aid and energy efficiency

The objective of energy aid is to promote the development of new and innovative solutions for achieving a low-carbon energy system in the long term. Energy aid can be granted to companies and communities of all sizes, such as municipalities, parishes and foundations. Energy aid can be granted for investment or research projects that promote energy savings or efficiency in energy production or use. The aid is granted by Business Finland or the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.

## Networking to achieve sustainable and climate-neutral development

The government has launched networks to pursue carbon neutrality, which support and provide members of the networks with expert assistance, information and development ideas, as well as implementing the government's goals for strengthening a climate-neutral society.

Towards Carbon Neutral Municipalities (HINKU) is a network that brings together municipalities with ambitious aims to reduce greenhouse emissions, businesses that offer environmentally friendly products and services, and climate and energy experts. The HINKU network involves nearly 100 municipalities and five regions. The network shares information on best practices in climate change mitigation, supports municipal climate work and creates demand for climate-friendly products and services.

Finnish Sustainable Communities (FiSu) is a network of resource-smart pioneering cities and municipalities striving for zero emissions, zero waste and globally sustainable consumption. The aim of the network is to help develop new low-emission operating methods and solutions that build sustainable wellbeing and growth based on local strengths.

## Duration and nature of the commitment

The commitment is a cooperation document through which the government demonstrates its support for the work of the Climate Mission cities and the will to cooperate with the cities that have signed a Climate City Contract. It does not formally bind the parties, for example to funding. The commitment can be updated, if necessary, in addition to the updates of the cities' Climate Contracts every two years. This document serves as a contract appendix for the cities that have drawn up a Climate City Contract.

# Ilmastoneutraalit ja älykkäät kaupungit –missiossa solmittavien ilmasto-
kaupunkisopimusten (Climate City Contract) kansallinen sitoumus

## Tausta kansallisen tason missioon osallistumiselle

EU:n missiot ovat Horisontti Eurooppa –puiteohjelmassa kehitetty uusi yhteistyöhön perus-
tuva lähestymistapa, jolla pyritään ratkomaan joitakin aikamme suurimpia haasteita. Yksi
näistä EU:n komission vuonna 2021 käynnistämästä viidestä missiosta on "luoda 100 ilmas-
toneutraalia ja älykästä kaupunkia vuoteen 2030 mennessä", eli nk. kaupunkimissio
(jäljempänä ilmastomissio). Komission toteuttaman avoimen haun pohjalta 100 eurooppalais-
en osallistujakaupungin joukkoon valittiin kuusi suomalaista kaupunkia, Tampere, Turku,
Helsinki, Espoo, Lahti ja Lappeenranta.

Ilmastomission kuusi suomalaista kaupunkia ovat sitoutuneet olemaan edelläkävijöitä: saa-
vuttamaan hiilineutraaliuden ensimmäisten kaupunkien joukossa viimeistään vuonna 2030,
sekä toimimaan kokeilu- ja innovaatiokeskuksina. Samalla ne tukevat ja nopeuttavat Suo-
men pääsemistä kansalliseen tavoitteeseen olla ilmastoneutraali maa vuoteen 2035 men-
nessä. Vuosina 2007-23 nämä kaupungit ovat SYKE:n päästölaskennan mukaan pystyneet
vähentämään asukaskohtaisia co2-päästöjään keskimäärin 47 prosenttia.

Kaupungit ovat avainasemassa hiilineutraaliuden saavuttamisessa, sillä niiden aktiivinen il-
mastotyö edistää eri sektoreiden päästövähennyksiä suoraan. Kaupungit voivat aktiivisesti
vaikuttaa omien kasvihuonekaasupäästöjensä määrään (hiilijalanjälki), sekä monin tavoin
edistää ja vauhdittaa asukkaiden, yritysten, yhteisöjen ja muiden sidosryhmiensä päästövä-
hennyksiä (hiilikädenjälki). Keskeisimpiä osa-alueita tässä ovat esimerkiksi energiajärjestel-
mä, liikenne, kaavoitus, rakentaminen, hiilinielut ja julkiset hankinnat. Kaupungeista löytyvät
edelläkävijyyden ja innovoinnin suuret mahdollisuudet ja toimijaverkostot. Isoimmilla kaupun-
geilla on myös merkittävästi omia kehittämisresursseja, osaamista ja mahdollisuuksia inves-
toida kestäviin ratkaisuihin ja infrastruktuuriin.

Suomalaiset ilmastomissio kaupungit ovat valmistelleet ilmastokaupunkisopimusta (CCC),
joka solmitaan EU:n komission kanssa. CCC-sopimus suositellaan vahvasti rakennettavaksi
kolmitasoisena sisältäen myös kansallisen tason. Useammassakin muussa EU-maassa mi-
nisteriötaso on tullut tai tulossa mukaan sopimukseen. Kansallisen tason sitoumuksen peru-
sajatuksena on linkittää paremmin ilmastopolitiikan kansalliset ja kaupunkitason toimet toi-
siinsa läheisen vertikaalisen koordinaation kautta. Siten missio tarjoaa ilmastotyön strategi-
sen liiton kaupunkien ja valtion välillä.

Jotta päästövähennyspolulla pysytään, tarvitaan lisää ja vahvempaa valtion ja kaupunkien
yhteistyötä ja kumppanuutta. Valtio voi perinteisesti tukea kaupunkeja lainsäädännön avulla,
taloudellisilla ohjauskeinoilla tai jakamalla tietoa ja informaatio-ohjausta. Näitä voidaan vah-
vistaa ja kehittää uusilla toimenpiteillä ja välineillä, jotka tukevat ja kirittävät kaupunkien il-
mastotoimia. Yhteisellä suunnitelmallisella ilmastotyöllä Suomen on mahdollista luoda uutta
kilpailuetua ja samalla parantaa maamme kansainvälistä kilpailukykyä. Ympäristökestävät
ratkaisut, kiertotalous, energiatehokkuus ja uusiutuvaan energiaan siirtyminen sekä niihin liit-
tyvä kehittämistyö luovat Suomelle uusia innovaatiota, työpaikkoja ja vientimahdollisuuksia.

Hallitusohjelmassa korostetaan ilmasto- ja energiapolitiikkaa ja nollapäästöratkaisuja, sekä
luonnon monimuotoisuuden heikentymisen pysäyttämistä yhteistyöllä. Erityisesti painotetaan
hiilikädenjälkeä ja luontokädenjälkeä, jota kaupunkien toimilla voidaan merkittävästi
(4)

suurentaa ja konkretisoida, sillä kaupungit ovat älykkäiden ratkaisuiden testausalustoja ja viennin li-sääjiä.

Ilmastomission hakuvaiheessa kansallinen taso oli vahvasti mukana tukemassa suomalaisia missiokaupunkeja, ja työ- ja elinkeinoministeriö laati tukikirjeet missiokaupungeiksi Suomesta hakeneille. Suomeen on perustettu ilmastomission kansallinen verkosto, jonka tarkoituksena on tuoda kaikki asian kannalta tärkeät toimijat saman pöydän ääreen keskustelemaan, jakamaan tietoa ja tekemään yhteistyötä. Verkosto on myös konkreettisesti tukeneut suomalaisia missiokaupunkeja käynnistämällä yhteiskehittämisen tuen hankkeen kaupunkien työn tueksi. Hankkeen tavoitteena on räätälöidysti auttaa suomalaisia missiokaupunkeja valmistelemaan ja toteuttamaan vaikuttavia ilmastotoimia ja antaa tukea mission edellyttämien tuotosten yhteisvalmisteluun.

## Valtio-osapuolen sitoumus

Tällä sopimusliitteellä valtion osapuolet sitoutuvat ilmastomission puitteissa omalta osaltaan edistämään kaupunkien muutosta ilmastoneutraaleiksi ja älykkäitä ratkaisuja ilmastotyössä hyödyntäviksi vuoteen 2030 mennessä. Valtion osapuolet pyrkivät tähän omilla kansallisilla toimillaan, jotka täydentävät kaupunkien omia toimia.

Kunnianhimoinen ilmastopolitiikka ja vihreän siirtymän investoinnit vahvistavat Suomen taloutta sekä välittömästi että pidemmällä aikavälillä. Vihreät investoinnit luovat rakennusvaiheessa työtä Suomeen, mutta kasvattavat kotimaista arvonlisäystä, myös valmistumisen jälkeen. Uuden tuotannon syntymisen lisäksi fossiilisista polttoaineista luopuminen tekee Suomen taloudesta kotimaisemman ja myös vakaamman ja ennakoitavamman suhteessa maailmanmarkkinoiden heilahduksiin.

Suomen ilmastolain mukaan kansallinen hiilineutraaliustavoite saavutetaan vuonna 2035. Ilmastopäästötavoitteet vuoden 1990 tasoon verrattuna ovat -60% vuoteen 2030 mennessä, -80% vuonna 2040 ja -90-95% vuonna 2050. Ilmastolaissa on tunnistettu kaupunkien ja kuntien merkittävä rooli ja velvollisuus ilmastotavoitteiden saavuttamisessa.

EU:n taakanjakoasetuksen mukaan Suomen on vähennettävä taakanjakosektorin päästöjään 50 prosenttia vuoden 2005 tasosta vuoteen 2030 mennessä. Keskipitkän aikavälin ilmastosuunnitelma (KAISU) tullaan päivittämään Petteri Orpon hallituskaudella ilmastolain mukaisesti. Päivityksen yhteydessä tarkistetaan eri sektoreita koskevat tavoitteet ja tarvittavat uudet toimenpiteet.

## Valtio-osapuolen toimenpiteitä

Valtio-osapuolten osallistuminen eri toimenpiteillä käsittää suoraan ja epäsuoraan missiokaupunkeja tukevia toimia. Tuki käsitetään tässä laajassa mielessä ja sen muodot voivat olla esim. politiikkatukea (yhdensuuntaiset tavoitteet ja niiden voimistaminen), olemassa olevien aloitteiden tunnistamista ja kokoamista ilmastomission tueksi (epäsuora rahoitus), tai kaupunkien ohjaamista mahdollisten rahoitusvälineiden piiriin.

Alla on esitetty joitakin keskeisiä valtio-osapuolen toimenpiteitä, joilla tulevina vuosina voidaan tukea ilmastomissiokaupunkien tavoitteiden saavuttamista.

## Keskipitkän aikavälin ilmastosuunnitelma

Suomen Ilmastolain mukaan valtioneuvosto hyväksyy kerran vaalikaudessa keskipitkän aikavälin ilmastosuunnitelman (KAISU). Suunnitelman tavoitteena on koko Suomen hiilineutraalius vuonna 2035. Uuden Keskipitkän aikavälin ilmastosuunnitelman laatiminen on käynnistynyt eri sektoreiden perusennusteiden päivittämisellä. Perusennusteiden päivittämisen jälkeen tehdään arviot tarvittavista uusista toimenpiteistä hallitusohjelmakirjaukset huomioon ottaen. Samalla arvioidaan uusien toimien päästövähennysvaikutukset sekä
(4)

rahoitustarpeet. Uusien toimien suunnittelussa pyritään huomioimaan myös ilmastopolitiikallaan kunnianhimoisten kaupunkien tilanne ja tarpeet.

## Energia ja ilmastostrategia

Energia- ja ilmastostrategia on valmistelussa. Strategia kattaa kaikki kasvihuonekaasupäästölähteet (päästökauppasektori, taakanjakosektori, maankäyttösektori) ja nielut (maankäyttösektori). Energia- ja ilmastostrategian valmistelussa korostuvat päästöjen vähentämistoimet, toimivat energiamarkkinat, puhdas sähköntuotanto ja Suomen energiaturvallisuus osana kestävyysmurrosta. Myös yhteiskunnalliset ja kilpailukykyvaikutukset ovat strategian keskiössä. Suomen tavoitteena on kasvattaa ilmastokädenjälkeään ja edetä hiilineutraaliuteen vaikuttavin ja kestävin keinoin. Luvituksen sujuvuus on edellytys puhtaiden investointien syntymiselle.

## Kuntien ilmastoratkaisut – ohjelma

Kuntien ilmastoratkaisut – ohjelma vauhdittaa, edistää ja rahoittaa paikallista ilmastotyötä. Ohjelma on rahoittanut tähän mennessä lähes 150 erilaista ilmastohanketta eri puolella Suomea. Ohjelma kestää vuoden 2024 loppuun saakka. Ohjelma on tuonut kuntien ja alueiden ilmastotyön kansallisen ilmastopolitiikan valmistelun ja toimeenpanon keskiöön.

## MAL-sopimukset

Seitsemän suurimman kaupunkiseudun kanssa jatketaan MAL-sopimusmenettelyä, jossa vahvistetaan valtion ja kaupunkiseutujen välistä kumppanuutta maankäytön, asumisen ja liikenteen kysymyksissä. MAL-sopimuksilla edistetään vähähiilistä ja kestävää yhdyskuntarakennetta ja liikennejärjestelmää, liikenteen digitalisaatiota sekä tarpeita vastaavaa asuntokaavoitusta ja -tuotantoa. MAL-sopimuksilla varmistetaan kaupunkiseutujen kasvun ja saavutettavuuden edellytyksiä infrastruktuuri- ja asuntotuotantoinvestoinneilla. Yhdyskuntarakennetta tiivistämällä voidaan hillitä ilmastonmuutosta, vähentää kasvihuonekaasupäästöjä ja luonnonvarojen kulutusta, sekä ehkäistä hiilinielujen vähenemistä. Valtio rahoittaa MAL-sopimusten valtion osuuden.

## Ekosysteemisopimukset

Ekosysteemisopimusten päätavoitteena ovat innovatiiviset ja edelläkävijyyttä tavoittelevat kaupungit, jotka vahvuuksiensa pohjalta hyödyntävät digitalisaation, muiden uusien teknologioiden ja hiilineutraaliuden tuomat mahdollisuudet kestävän kasvun aikaansaamiseksi. 16:sta sopimuskaupunkiseudusta noin viidellä (5) on sopimuksessaan suoria sisältöjä ilmastonmuutosta hillitsevien ja älykkäiden ratkaisujen kehittämiseksi. Ekosysteemisopimukset ovat siten yksi tärkeä valtion väline tukea ilmastomission toteutumista erityisesti hiilikädenjäljen näkökulmasta.

## Business Finland / Decarbonized cities – ohjelma

Decarbonized Cities – ohjelman tavoite on, että vuoteen 2030 mennessä maailmanlaajuisesti kymmenen kaupunkia on suomalaisosaamisen ansiosta merkittävästi vähentänyt hiilipäästöjään. Osaaminen integroiduissa järjestelmäratkaisuissa on avain tämän tavoitteen saavuttamiseksi ja vauhdittaa konkreettisesti hiilikädenjälkeä myös Suomen rajojen ulkopuolella.

## Kiertotalousohjelma

Kiertotalousohjelmalla tavoitellaan luonnonvarojen kestävää käyttöä. Kiertotalouden osaamisverkosto (Kisu) tukee kuntia ja yrityksiä muun muassa rahoitusmahdollisuuksien löytämisessä, koulutuksella sekä yhteiskehittämishankkeilla. Parhaillaan ministeriöt, tutkimuslaitokset, kunnat (20 kuntaa) ja maakunnan sekä keskeiset toimialat laativat ehdotusta vapaaehtoisesta sitoumuksesta kiertotalouden edistämiseksi. Tässä ns. green deal-prosessissa tehdään arvioita tulevaisuuden suunnista ja tavoitteista sekä kehitetään yhdessä vaikuttavimpia toimia kiertotalouden edistämiseksi. Tavoitteena on koko Suomen kiertotaloussitoumus.

## Energiatuet ja energiatehokkuus

Energiatuen tavoitteena on edistää uusien ja innovatiivisten ratkaisujen kehittämistä energiajärjestelmän muuttamiseksi vähähiiliseksi pitkällä aikavälillä. Energiatukea voivat saada kaiken kokoiset yritykset ja yhteisöt, kuten kunnat, seurakunnat ja säätiöt. Energiatukea voidaan myöntää sellaisiin investointi- tai selvityshankkeisiin, jotka edistävät energiansäästöä tai energiantuotannon tai -käytön tehostamista. Tuen myöntää Business Finland tai TEM.

## Verkostoyhteistyö kestävän ja ilmastoneutraalin kehityksen saavuttamiseksi

Valtio on käynnistänyt hiilineutraaliuden tavoitteluun verkostoja, joissa tuetaan ja annetaan verkostojen jäsenille asiantuntija-apua, tietoa ja kehittämisideoita, sekä viedään täytäntöön valtion tavoitteita ilmastoneutraalin yhteiskunnan vahvistamiseksi.

Hinku (hiilineutraalit kunnat) verkosto on ilmastonmuutoksen hillinnän edelläkävijöiden verkosto, joka kokoaa yhteen kunnianhimoisiin päästövähennyksiin sitoutuneet kunnat, ilmastoystävällisiä tuotteita ja palveluita tarjoavat yritykset sekä energia- ja ilmastoalan asiantuntijat. Hinku-verkostossa on mukana lähes 100 kuntaa sekä viisi maakuntaa. Hinku-verkosto jakaa tietoa ilmastonmuutoksen hillinnän parhaista käytännöistä, tukee kuntien ilmastotyötä sekä luo kysyntää ilmastoystävällisille tuotteille ja palveluille.

Fisu (Finnish Sustainable Communities) verkosto on resurssiviisaiden edelläkävijäkaupunkien ja -kuntien verkosto, joka tavoittelee päästöttömyyttä, jätteettömyyttä ja globaalisti kestävää kulutusta. Verkoston tavoitteena on auttaa kehittämään uusia vähäpäästöisiä toimintatapoja ja ratkaisuja, jotka rakentavat kestävää hyvinvointia ja kasvua paikallisiin vahvuuksiin perustuen.

## Sitoumuksen voimassaolo ja luonne

Sitoumus on luonteeltaan yhteistyöasiakirja, jonka kautta valtio osoittaa tukensa ilmastomissio kaupunkien työlle ja tahtotilan toimia yhteistyössä ilmastokaupunkisopimuksen solmineiden kaupunkien kanssa. Se ei muodollisesti sido osapuolia esim. rahoitukseen. Sitoumusta voidaan tarvittaessa päivittää kaupunkien ilmastosopimusten päivitysten ohessa kahden vuoden välein. Tämä asiakirja toimii ilmastokaupunkisopimuksen laatineiden kaupunkien sopimusliitteenä.

# Consumption-based emissions, Espoo

Kulma-model, April 2023

SITOWISE Luke
# Introduction

In order to mitigate climate change, it is still essential to replace fossil fuels with renewable forms of energy and invest in energy efficiency and energy saving. In climate work, however, attention should also be turned to emissions caused by consumption.

According to estimates presented by the Finnish Environment Institute, it would be possible to achieve a 40-70 percent reduction in emissions by changing the consumption of services and products to low carbon alternatives. Reducing emissions from consumption requires socio-cultural changes in behavior, such as switching to a more plant-based diet. However, significant changes in consumption-based emissions also require changes in infrastructure and the adoption of technology.

Municipalities play a significant role in climate work together with the state level. Municipalities have the opportunity to support their residents make climate-friendly choices, for example by investing in public transport, school meals and offering low-emission district heating. In addition, communication and information sharing are ways that municipalities can use to make an impact.

# Kulma calculation model

## Calculation model and model development

The Kulma calculation model for consumption-based emissions divides emissions into five sectors: energy consumption, construction, transportation, food and goods and services. The sectors are further divided into more specific sub-sectors.

The calculation model developed in cooperation by Sitowise and Natural Resources Institute Finland is the first Finnish calculation model for consumption-based emissions, which has been comparably applied to a large number of municipalities. The calculation model was first piloted in a pilot project implemented in 2021. In the calculation round that ended in April 2023 consumption-based emissions were calculated for a total of 20 municipalities. The development of the model has been supported by a wide network of experts.

## Why consumption emissions should be monitored

A broader knowledge base of greenhouse gas emissions caused by activities of the municipality and its citizens helps municipalities plan and target climate actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and measure the effects of implemented actions.

Citizens are a significant and very important stakeholder group when municipalities strive for carbon neutrality. However, it is often the effects of climate measures taken by citizens that are excluded from sector-based emission calculations. Consumption-based emission calculation aim to meet this challenge.

In some municipalities consumption-based greenhouse gas emissions may be significantly higher than sector-based greenhouse gas emissions. Calculating consumption-based greenhouse gas emissions therefore complements the information provided by sector-based greenhouse gas emission calculations.

Figure 1: Sector-based and consumption-based emission calculations partially overlap. They are not alternatives to each other but complement each other and together provide a broader knowledge base of greenhouse gas emissions caused by activities of the municipality and its citizens.

# Overlaps and differences between consumption-based and sector-based calculations

When talking about municipal greenhouse gas emissions, we often mean greenhouse gas emissions calculated using sector-based, regional, calculation models. Sector-based calculation models mainly cover emissions caused by energy consumption within the municipality and waste management, as well as other emissions occurring within the municipality's geographical area. For example, emissions from agriculture and product manufacturing in the municipality are included in the calculation, regardless of where the products are consumed. When calculating consumption-based greenhouse gas emissions, the calculation includes all emissions caused by the consumption of citizens, regardless of where the consumed goods were produced. For example, emissions from food and goods consumed by citizens are included in the calculation, even if the production of the products takes place outside the municipality's or Finland's borders.

# TAUSTAA

Espoon tavoitteena on olla hiilineutraali vuoteen 2030 mennessä. Hiilineutraaliudella tarkoitetaan sitä, että kaupungin alueella syntyy vuoden aikana vain sen verran kasvihuonekaasupäästöjä kuin niitä pystytään sitomaan. Hiilineutraaliustavoite Espoossa tarkoittaa, että kasvihuonekaasupäästöjä vähennetään 80 prosenttia vuoden 1990 tasosta vuoteen 2030 mennessä ja jäljelle jäävä 20 prosenttia sidotaan hiilinieluihin tai kompensoidaan muilla keinoilla.

Ilmastotyönsä tueksi kaupunki kokoaa Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-tiekarttaa, joka kuvaa kaupungin oman sekä kumppaneiden ja asukkaiden kanssa tehtävän yhteistyön hiilineutraaliustavoitteen saavuttamiseksi. Tiekartta pohjautuu Kestävän energian ja ilmaston toimintasuunnitelmaan (Sustainable Energy &amp; Climate Action Plan, SECAP) ja Kestävä Espoo -ohjelmaan.

Tiekartassa otetaan lisäksi huomioon Espoon osallistuminen EU:n komission 100 hiilineutraalia ja älykästä kaupunkia 2030 mennessä -missioon. Mukaan valitut kaupungit toimivat kokeilu- ja innovaatiokeskuksina ratkaisuille, joiden avulla kaikki Euroopan kaupungit voivat saavuttaa samat tavoitteet vuoteen 2050 mennessä.

# YLEISTÄ

Osana Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-tiekarttatyötä kaupungin päästökehitystä arvioitiin kolmessa skenaariossa.

Pessimistinen skenaario, jossa oletetaan, että uusia päästövähennystoimia ei kaupungissa suunnitella tai toteuteta. Skenaariossa kaupungin päästökehitykseen vaikuttaa esimerkiksi kaupungin kasvava asukasmäärä.

Suomi 2035-skenaario, jossa oletetaan, että kansallisella tasolla toteutettavat ilmastopolitiikan toimet ja linjaukset vaikuttavat Espoon päästökehitykseen. Kaupungin kasvu ja EU:n lainsäädännön vaikutukset otetaan niin ikään skenaariossa huomioon.

Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-skenaario (HNE2030), jossa oletetaan, että kaupungin päästökehitykseen vaikuttavat kansallisten toimien lisäksi myös kaupungin ja sen yhteistyökumppaneiden, kuten Fortumin ja HSY:n, toteuttamat ilmastotoimet.

Skenaariolaskentojen oletukset on kuvattu seuraavilla kalvoilla. Laskentojen pohjana on hyödynnetty HSY:n tuottamia päästölaskentatietoja [1] ja niiden taustalla käytettyjä energiankulutuksen tietoja [2]. HSY:n tiedot olivat skenaariolaskentojen aikaan saatavilla vuoteen 2021 saakka.

Kaupungin päästökehitys on kunkin skenaarion osalta arvioitu vuosille 2025, 2030 ja 2035.

Skenaariolaskentojen tulokset esitetään osana Kausal Oy:n Espoon kaupungille tuottamaa ilmastovahti-palvelua (https://ilmastovahti.espoo.fi/). Skenaariolaskentojen toteutuksesta on vastannut Sitowise Oy.

# MENETELMÄ

Laadittava Hiilineutraali Espoo tiekartta 2030 pohjautuu Kestävän energian ja ilmaston toimintasuunnitelmaan (Sustainable Energy &amp; Climate Action Plan, SECAP) ja Kestävä Espoo -ohjelmaan. Kaupungin kasvihuonekaasupäästöjen kehitystä on edellisen kerran arvioitu vuonna 2018 laaditun Kestävän energian ja ilmaston toimintasuunnitelman yhteydessä.

Skenaariolaskentojen yhteydessä tuolloin tehdyt oletukset päästöjen kehityksestä on päivitetty. Esimerkiksi kaupungin väkiluvun kasvu on ollut vuoden 2018 arviota nopeampaa. Päivitetyt skenaariolaskennat eroavat toisistaan lisäksi käytetyn menetelmän osalta. Edelliset, vuonna 2018 lasketut skenaariot on tehty SECAP-menetelmään pohjautuen. Menetelmän sektorijako eroaa HSY:n käyttämästä sektorijaosta ja lisäksi teollisuus ja maatalous ovat SECAP-laskennan ulkopuolella. Lisäksi sähkön päästökertoimen laskenta eroaa menetelmissä toisistaan. HSY:n laskennassa käytössä on Suomen keskimääräinen sähkön päästökerroin, kun taas SECAP-laskennassa sähkölle hyödynnetään päästökerrointa, johon kansallisen päästökertoimen lisäksi vaikuttaa myös kaupungin alueella tapahtuva sähköntuotanto ja siitä aiheutuvat päästöt. Menetelmäeroista johtuen päästökehitys on HSY:n ja SECAP:n menetelmillä laskettuna erilainen, eivätkä skenaariolaskennat ja niiden tuloksetkaan ole suoraan verrattavissa toisiinsa.

Espoon SECAP-menetelmän mukaiset kasvihuonekaasupäästöt vuodelta 2020 laskettiin osana skenaariotyötä.

Syyskuussa 2023 päättyneessä päivitysössä skenaariolaskentoja täydennettiin lisätoimenpiteiden arvioinnilla.

# VÄKILUKU

Espoon väkiluku oli vuoden 2021 lopussa 297 132 asukasta ja 300 505 asukasta vuonna 2022. Kaupungin on arvioitu kasvavan myös tulevina vuosina. Skenaariolaskennoissa väestön on oletettu kaikissa skenaarioissa kehittyvän kaupungin tuoreen pitkän väestöennusteen perusvaihtoehdon [3] mukaisesti, jossa väkiluvun oletetaan kehittyvän seuraavasti:

2021: 297 132 asukasta

# KULUTUSSÄHKÖ

Kulutussähköön sisältyy muu kuin lämmitykseen (sähkölämmitys ja maalämpö) käytetty sähkö. Kulutussähköön sisältyvät siis myös julkisten toimijoiden ja yritysten, kuten Fortumin sähkönkulutus. Fortumin tuotannon sähköistyminen vaikuttaa siis arvioon kulutussähkön kehityksestä. Kulutussähköön sisältyy lisäksi HSY:n menetelmän mukaisesti sähköisten ajoneuvojen lataukseen käytetty sähkö. Liikenteen sähköistymisen vaikutukset näkyvät siis niin ikään kulutussähkön kehityksessä. Liikennesähkön erottaminen laskennasta on tulevaisuuden tavoite, mutta saatavilla olevan nykytiedon valossa sitä ei ole vielä mahdollista tehdä.

Kulutussähkön päästökehitystä arvioitaessa kehitykseen vaikuttavia tekijöitä ovat sähkönkulutuksen kehitys sekä sähkön päästökertoimen kehitys. Sähkön päästökertoimen kehitykseen vaikuttavat sähkön tuotantotavat. HSY:n päästölaskennassa sähkönkulutuksen päästökertoimena käytetään valtakunnallista päästökerrointa, johon vaikuttavat siis kaikkialla Suomessa tehdyt sähköntuotannon päästöjä vähentävät toimet, kuten esimerkiksi tuulisähkön ja aurinkosähkön tuotantomäärien kasvattaminen. HSY:n päästölaskennassa käytetty päästökerroin kulutussähkölle oli 169,7 t CO₂-ekv/GWh vuonna 1990 ja 79,2 t CO₂-ekv/GWh vuonna 2021.

Skenaariolaskennoissa kulutussähkön päästöihin vaikuttavien muuttujien on oletettu kehittyvän seuraavasti:

**Pessimistisessä skenaariossa** asukaskohtaisen sähkönkulutuksen on oletettu kehittyvän vuosina 2017–2021 toteutuneen trendin mukaisesti (–0,4 prosenttia per asukas per vuosi). Skenaariossa oletetaan, että kehitys jatkuu viimeisten vuosien mukaisena myös aikavälillä 2021–2035. Espoon väkiluvun kasvaessa sähkön kokonaiskulutus kasvaa vaikka asukaskohtainen kulutus hieman laskeekin. Kokonaiskulutuksen kasvu on kuitenkin muita skenaarioita maltillisempaa, sillä Fortumin tuotannon tai liikenteen ei oleteta sähköistyvän yhtä nopeasti kuin muissa skenaarioissa.

Kulutussähkön päästökertoimen oletetaan pessimistisessä skenaariossa pysyvän vuoden 2021 tasolla (79,2 t CO₂-ekv/GWh).

**Suomi 2035-skenaariossa** asukaskohtaisen sähkönkulutuksen oletetaan pysyvän vuoden 2021 tasolla. HSY:n laskelmien perusteella espoolaiset kuluttivat sähköä 5,8 MWh/asukas vuonna 2021. Energiatehokkuustoimien oletetaan skenaariossa hillitsevän kokonaiskulutuksen kasvua mutta kasvu on kuitenkin pessimististä skenaariota nopeampaa, sillä Fortumin tuotannon, liikenteen ja teollisuuden oletetaan skenaariossa sähköistyvän pessimististä skenaariota nopeammin. Kokonaiskulutuksen kehitykseen vaikuttaa muiden skenaarioiden tapaan kaupungin väkiluvun kasvu.

Sähkön päästökertoimen oletetaan Suomi 2035-skenaariossa kehittyvän Energiateollisuuden vähähiilisyystiekartan taustaselvityksen [4] vähähiiliskenaarion arvion mukaisesti seuraavasti:

: 59,4 t CO₂-ekv/GWh
: 34,7 t CO₂-ekv/GWh
: 10,0 t CO₂-ekv/GWh

**Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-skenaariossa (HNE2030)** sähkönkulutuksen oletetaan Espoossa kasvavan 3,4 prosenttia vuodessa sähkönjakeluyhtiö Carunan arvion mukaisesti [5]. Sähkönkulutuksen kasvu perustuu yhtiön arvioon asiakasmäärän kasvusta sekä liikenteen, lämmityksen ja teollisuuden sähköistymisestä. Sähkönkulutuksen kasvuun vaikuttavia merkittäviä tekijöitä ovat lisäksi Fortumin kaukolämmöntuotannon sähköistyminen sekä tulevaisuuden investoinnit Espoon alueella, esimerkiksi datakeskuksiin. Arviossa on otettu huomioon energiatehokkuustoimien vaikutukset sekä esimerkiksi lisääntyvän aurinkovoiman pientuotannon yleistyminen, jotka osaltaan hillitsevät kulutuksen kasvua.

Sähkön päästökertoimen oletetaan skenaariossa kehittyvän kuten Suomi 2035-skenaariossa.

# RAKENNUSTEN LÄMMITYS – KERROSALA

Rakennusten lämmityksestä aiheutuu merkittävä osa Espoon päästöistä. Vuonna 1990 rakennusten lämmityksen osuus kokonaispäästöistä oli 43 prosenttia. Vastaava osuus vuonna 2021 oli 45 prosenttia.

Rakennusten lämmityksen päästöjä arvioitaessa vaikuttavia tekijöitä ovat oletukset muutoksista kerrosalassa, lämmitystapajakaumassa, lämmitysenergian tarpeessa sekä sähkön ja kaukolämmön päästökertoimissa tapahtuvissa muutoksista. Espoossa kaukolämmön toimittajana toimii Fortum. Fortumin asiantuntijoiden näkemyksiä on hyödynnetty kaukolämmön tuotannon ja päästökehityksen arvioinnissa.

Nykytilassa rakennusten kerrosalan on oletettu vastaavan HSY:n laskentojensa taustalla käyttämää tietoa sähkö- ja öljylämmitettyjen kiinteistöjen kerrosalasta [6] sekä kaukolämmön piirissä olevien rakennusten osalta Tilastokeskuksen rakennuskantatilaston [7] mukaista jakaumaa rakennusten käyttötarkoituksen ja lämmitysaineen osalta. Rakennusten kerrosalan muutosta arvioitaessa on skenaarioissa käytetty seuraavia oletuksia:

**Pessimistisessä skenaariossa** rakennuskannan kerrosalassa tapahtuvat muutokset eivät vaikuta oletettuun päästökehitykseen vaan laskenta perustuu asukaskohtaisten päästöjen kehitykseen ja toteutuneeseen trendiin aikavälillä 2017–2021 sekä väkiluvun kehitykseen.

**Suomi 2035-skenaariossa** asumisväljyyden on oletettu pysyvän muuttumattomana aikavälillä 2021–2035. Oletus perustuu Espoon asunto-ohjelmassa esitettyihin tietoihin [8], joiden perusteella asumisväljyys Espoossa on pysynyt viime vuosina muuttumattomana. Asuinrakennusten kerrosalan kehitykseen vaikuttaa väkiluvun kasvu.

Muiden kuin asuinrakennusten osalta kerrosalan arvioidaan kehittyvän Uudenmaan kasvun vaihtoehdot-selvityksen [9] mukaista toimitilojen muutosennustetta noudattaen. Ennusteen perusteella liiketilojen kerrosalat kasvavat 0,7 prosenttia vuodessa, ja teollisuus ja liikennerakennukset 0,5 prosenttia vuodessa. Julkisten palveluiden rakennusten pinta-alan/asukas oletetaan pysyvän samalla tasolla kuin vuonna 2021. Toimistorakennuskannan kerrosalan oletetaan säilyvän ennallaan, eikä kasvua odoteta tapahtuvan.

Laskennassa oletetaan, että vanha rakennuskanta säilyy aikavälillä 2021–2035 ja uudisrakennukset vastaavat rakennuskannan lisäystä.

Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-skenaariossa (HNE2030) rakennusten kerrosalan oletetaan kehittyvän kuten Suomi 2035-skenaariossa.

# RAKENNUSTEN LÄMMITYS – LÄMMITYSENERGIA

Rakennusten lämmitys jakautuu edelleen kaukolämmitykseen, sähkölämmitykseen ja öljylämmitykseen. Kunkin lämmitysmuodon päästöihin vaikuttaa lämmitykseen käytetyn energian määrä. Ilmaston lämpenemisen arvioidaan vähentävän lämmitystarvetta tulevaisuudessa jonkin verran mutta merkittävämpi vaikutus on erilaisilla energiatehokkuutta parantavilla toimilla.

Pessimistisessä skenaariossa rakennusten lämmityksen energiankulutuksen oletetaan kaikkien lämmitysmuotojen osalta kehittyvän viimeisen viiden vuoden aikana (2017-2021) toteutuneen trendin mukaisesti.

Suomi 2035-skenaariossa rakennusten ominaislämmönkulutuksen oletetaan kaikkien lämmitysmuotojen osalta kehittyvän Suomen ympäristökeskuksen arvion [10] mukaisesti asuinrakennuksissa niin, että lämmönkulutus laskee 7,5 prosenttia vuoden 2021 tasosta vuoteen 2030 mennessä ja muissa rakennuksissa 11 prosenttia erilaisten energiatehokkuutta edistävien toimien myötä. Energiatehokkuuden kehityksen oletetaan jatkuvan samankaltaisena aikavälillä 2030-2035.

Keskipitkän aikavälin ilmastopolitiikan suunnitelman (Kaisu2) [11] mukaisesti öljylämmityksestä oletetaan luovuttavan 95-prosenttisesti vuoteen 2030 mennessä, ja luovuttavan kokonaan vuoteen 2035 mennessä. Pien- ja rivitalojen oletetaan lämmitystapamuutosten yhteydessä siirtyvän 100-prosenttisesti lämpöpumppuihin. Kerrostaloissa, palvelurakennuksissa ja teollisuusrakennuksissa oletetaan siirryttävän 50-prosenttisesti lämpöpumppuihin ja 50-prosenttisesti kaukolämpöön.

Olemassa olevan rakennuskannan osalta ei oleteta muita lämmitystapamuutoksia.

Uudisrakennukset oletetaan rakennettavan rakennusmääräysten energiatehokkuustavoitteiden [10] mukaisesti. Tämän perusteella pientalojen ominaislämmönkulutuksen arvioidaan olevan 115 kWh/m², rivitalojen 109 kWh/m², asuinkerrostalojen 66 kWh/m² ja muiden rakennusten 82 kWh/m².

Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-skenaariossa (HNE2030) rakennusten ominaislämmityksen kulutuksen oletetaan kehittyvän kuten Suomi 2035-skenaariossa.

Palvelurakennusten osalta oletetaan, että öljylämmityksestä luovutaan 100-prosenttisesti vuoteen 2030 mennessä kaupungin ilmastotoimien tavoitteiden mukaisesti. Muiden rakennusten osalta oletetaan Suomi 2035-skenaarion mukainen kehitys.

Uudisrakennusten ominaislämmönkulutuksen oletetaan kehittyvän PITKO-selvityksen [12] Jatkuva kasvu –skenaarion mukaisesti. Tämän perusteella pientalojen ominaislämmönkulutuksen arvioidaan olevan 66 kWh/m², rivitalojen 57 kWh/m², asuinkerrostalojen 57 kWh/m² ja muiden rakennusten 52 kWh/m².

Kaukolämmön tuotannon ja kulutuksen oletetaan Fortumin arvion [13] mukaisesti pysyvän nykytasolla, eli noin 2100 GWh vuodessa.

# RAKENNUSTEN LÄMMITYS – PÄÄSTÖKERTOIMET

Rakennusten lämmityksen päästöihin vaikuttavat merkittävästi sähkön päästökertoimen sekä kaukolämmön päästökertoimen kehitys. Näiden on arvioitu kehittyvän eri skenaarioissa alla esitetyn mukaisesti.

Pessimistisessä skenaariossa Kaukolämmön päästökertoimen oletetaan pysyvän vuoden 2021 tasolla (122,0 t CO₂-ekv/GWh).

Lämmityssähkön päästökertoimena käytetään kulutussähkön mukaista vuoden 2021 kerrointa (79,2 t CO₂-ekv/GWh).

Lämmitysöljyn päästökertoimen oletetaan pysyvän vuoden 2021 tasolla.

Suomi 2035-skenaariossa kaukolämmön päästökertoimen oletetaan kehittyvän Energiateollisuuden vähähiilisyystiekartan taustaselvityksen [4] vähähiiliskenaarion arvion mukaisesti:

2025: 96,9 t CO₂-ekv/GWh
2030: 65,4 t CO₂-ekv/GWh
2035: 34,0 t CO₂-ekv/GWh

Lämmityssähkön päästökertoimeksi oletetaan vastaavan kulutussähkön kerrointa vuosina 2025, 2030 ja 2035. Oletus kulutussähkön ja lämmityssähkön päästökertoimien kehityksestä samankaltaisiksi tulevaisuudessa perustuu sähköjärjestelmän muutoksen ja HSY:n asiantuntijoiden arvioon.

Biopolttoöljyn jakeluvelvoitteen ja kestävyyslain muutoksen [14] oletetaan vaikuttavan lämmitysöljyn päästökertoimeen. Tämän myötä lämmitysöljyn päästökertoimen oletetaan laskevan noin 9,7 prosenttia vuoteen 2028 mennessä.

Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-skenaariossa (HNE2030) kaukolämmön päästökertoimen oletetaan kehittyvän Fortumin arvion [13] mukaisesti:

2025: 40,0 t CO₂-ekv/GWh
2030: 6,0 t CO₂-ekv/GWh
2035: 6,0 t CO₂-ekv/GWh

Espoon kaukolämmön muutosmatka vuoteen 2029 on kuvattu seuraavalla kalvolla.

Lämmityssähkön päästökertoimen oletetaan kehittyvän kuten Suomi 2035-skenaariossa.

Lämmitysöljyn päästökertoimen oletetaan kehittyvän kuten Suomi 2035 – skenaariossa.

# LIIKENNE

Rakennusten lämmityksen ohella liikennesektori on Espoossa merkittävin päästöjä aiheuttava sektori. Vuonna 1990 liikenteen osuus kokonaispäästöistä oli 27 prosenttia ja vuonna 2021 osuus oli 35 prosenttia. Tulevaisuudessa liikenteen osuuden päästöistä voidaan olettaa kasvavan edelleen, sillä muun muassa rakennusten lämmityksen ja sähkönkulutuksen päästöt laskevat.

Espoossa liikenteen päästöt ovat käytännössä kokonaan tieliikenteen aiheuttamia. Raideliikenne on sähköistetty ja sitä käsitellään liikennesektorilla nollapäästöisenä päällekkäisen laskennan välttämiseksi. VTT:n LIPASTO-järjestelmän tietojen perusteella tieliikenteen päästöistä 59 prosenttia aiheutui vuonna 2021 henkilöautoliikenteestä, 9 prosenttia pakettiautoliikenteestä, 25 prosenttia kuorma-autoliikenteestä ja 6 prosenttia linja-autoliikenteestä [15].

Liikenteen päästöjen kehitystä arvioitaessa vaikuttavat muuttujat ovat tieliikenteen suoritteen kehittyminen sekä autokannan keskimääräisten yksikköpäästöjen kehittyminen. Yksikköpäästöjen kehittymiseen vaikuttavat merkittävästi biopolttoaineiden osuus sekä autokannan sähköistyminen ja luontainen uudistuminen.

Skenaariolaskennat on laadittu arvioimalla Espoon autokannan yksikköpäästökerrointen kehitystä kansallisen perusennusteen (2021) sekä HSL:lle tehtyyn tarkennuksen perustuen. HELMET-liikennemallin avulla taas on arvioitu tieliikenteen suoritteen kehittymistä. Skenaariot ovat syntyneet näiden arvioiden tuloina.

## Yksikköpäästöjen kehittyminen

Valtakunnallisen perusennusteen mukaan tieliikenteen yksikköpäästöt laskevat 32 prosenttia vuoteen 2030 ja 44 prosenttia vuoteen 2035 mennessä vuoden 2021 tasosta.

Biopolttoaineiden sekoiteosuus on vuonna 2029 ja sen jälkeen nykyisen lainsäädännön mukaisesti 30 prosenttia, kun se vuonna 2021 oli noin 18 prosenttia. Tämä vähentää päästöjä noin 16 prosenttia vuoteen 2030 ja noin 11 prosenttia vuoteen 2035 mennessä verrattuna vuoden 2021 tilanteeseen. Toimenpiteen vaikutus vähenee, koska polttomoottoriautojen määrä autokannassa vähenee.

Autokannan sähköistyminen, erityisesti henkilöautojen osalta, vähentää liikenteen päästöjä. Kansallisen perusennusteen mukaan sähkön osuus tieliikenteen energiankulutuksesta on vuonna 2030 noin 6 prosenttia ja vuonna 2035 noin 11 prosenttia.

Myös autokannan luontainen uudistuminen ja teknologinen kehitys vähentävät liikenteen päästöjä. Vuosittain noin 4–5 prosenttia autokannasta uusiutuu ja autokannasta poistuu vanhoja, suurempipäästöisiä autoja. Uudet fossiilisia polttoaineita käyttävät autot ovat myös jatkuvasti edeltäjiään vähempipäästöisiä mm. teknologisen kehityksen myötä. Erityisesti raskaaseen kalustoon kohdistetaan 2020-luvulla EU-tasolla sääntelyä, mikä parantaa niiden energiatehokkuutta merkittävästi. Vuoteen 2030 mennessä noin 18 prosenttia ennustetusta päästövähenemästä vuoden 2021 tasoon verrattuna johtuu autokannan luontaisesta uudistumisesta ja teknologisesta kehityksestä ja vuoteen 2035 mennessä noin 27 prosenttia.

# LIIKENNE – YKSIKKÖPÄÄSTÖT

Espoossa autokannan uudistuminen on hieman maan keskiarvoa nopeampaa. Sitowise arvioi syksyllä 2021 kansallisen perusennusteen (2021) pohjalta HSL-alueen yksikköpäästökertoimien kehittymistä vuodesta 2020 vuoteen 2030. Arvion perusteella yksikköpäästöt vähenevät:

Henkilöautoliikenteellä -35 prosenttia, lähtötilanne (2020) -5 prosenttiyksikköä alhaisempi
Pakettiautoliikenteellä -48 prosenttia, lähtötilanne (2020) -4 prosenttiyksikköä alhaisempi
Kuorma-autoliikenteellä -39 prosenttia. Kuorma-autoliikenteen osalta ei tehty eroja valtakunnalliseen keskiarvoon, sillä kuorma-autoliikenne liikkuu myös pitkiä matkoja ja autojen rekisteröintikunnat kertovat parhaiten pääkonttorin sijainnista, eivätkä liikennöintialueesta.

Linja-autoliikenteen osalta työssä arvioitiin erikseen paikallisliikenteen (HSL-liikenteen) yksikköpäästökerroin sekä muun linja-autoliikenteen kerroin.

HSL-liikenteellä yksikköpäästöt laskevat -74 prosenttia, kun kalusto noudattaa puhtaiden ajoneuvojen direktiivin mukaisia määräyksiä. Jos kalusto on 100 prosenttisesti sähköistä, yksikköpäästöt laskevat -100 prosenttia. Jos kalusto on 90 prosenttisesti sähköistä, yksikköpäästöt laskevat noin -94 prosenttia. HSL-liikenteen osuus on arvion mukaan noin 52 prosenttia kaikesta seudun linja-autoliikenteestä. Tässä laskennassa käytettiin oletuksena 90 prosenttisesti sähköistä kalustoa (-94 prosentin päästövähenemä).
Muun linja-autoliikenteen yksikköpäästöt laskevat -35 prosenttia. Laskennassa ei tehty eroja valtakunnalliseen keskiarvoon (riittäviä lähtötietoja ei käytössä, minkä lisäksi vaikutus kokonaispäästöihin hyvin pieni).

## Yksikköpäästöjen lisätoimet, fossiilittoman liikenteen tiekartta

Fossiilittoman liikenteen tiekartassa on tunnistettu keinoja liikenteen päästöjen vähentämiseksi. Samat toimet on huomioitu myös KAISU2:ssa [11]. Seuraavaksi on eritelty tieliikenteen suoritteeseen sekä yksikköpäästöihin vaikuttavat toimenpiteet. Tunnistetut toimenpiteet ovat täysin valtion toteuttamia toimenpiteitä.

|  Toimenpidekokonaisuus, yksikköpäästöt | Vaikutus 2030  |
| --- | --- |
|  Fossiilisten polttoaineiden korvaaminen | -0,9 %  |
|  Autokannan nopeampi uudistuminen | -0,9 %  |
|  Henkilö- ja pakettiautojen sitovat päästörajat | -0,7 %  |
|  Jakeluvelvoitteen nosto | -3,4 %  |

Fossiilisten polttoaineiden korvaaminen sisältää mm. lataus- ja jakeluinfrastruktuurin tukien korottamista sekä niiden rakentamisen velvoittamista.

Autokannan nopeampi uudistuminen sisältää mm. hankinta- ja konversiotukien jatkamisen. Romutuspalkkiokampanjoita sekä uusia hankintatukia.

Henkilö- ja pakettiautojen sitovat päästörajat ovat EU-tason toimenpide, jolla kiristettäisiin uusien autojen päästörajoja.

# LIIKENNE – YKSIKKÖPÄÄSTÖT

Nykyisen lainsäädännön mukaan biopolttoaineiden jakeluvelvoite nousee 30 prosenttiin vuonna 2029. Lisätoimenpiteenä jakeluvelvoitetta nostettaisiin 34 prosenttiin, minkä lisäksi se ulotettaisiin koskemaan myös maa- ja biokaasua.

## Yksikköpäästöjen lisätoimet, Espoon ilmastovahti

Espoon ilmastovahdin neljästä liikenteen kokonaisuudesta yksi (2.4) on autoliikenteen päästöjen vähentäminen, johon sisältyvät toimenpiteet ovat sähköautojen latausinfran kehittäminen kaupungissa ja Espoon Asuntojen kiinteistöissä, kaupallisten liikenteen latausratkaisuiden kehittäminen, pysäköinnin tehostaminen, päästöttömien polttoaineiden jakeluinfran kehittäminen, sähköautoilun edistäminen asukkaiden ja taloyhtiöiden kautta sekä tavaraliikenteen tehostaminen. Toimenpiteet ovat hyviä, joskin osittain niitä on toteutettava myös autokannan uudistumisen myötä. Myös olemassa oleva lainsäädäntö velvoittaa mm. kiinteistöjen sähköautojen latauspisteiden rakentamiseen. Tästä johtuen niille ei ole arvioitu erillistä lisävähenemää vaan näiden toimenpiteiden oletetaan sisältyvän HSL-alueelle tehtyyn ennusteeseen. Lisäksi joukkoliikenteen sujuvoittaminen sisältää sähköbussien määrän lisääminen, mikä niin ikään on otettu huomioon skenaarioissa käytetyissä yksikköpäästökertoimissa.

## Lisätoimet skenaarioissa

Lisätoimenpiteet on otettu huomioon skenaarioissa seuraavasti:

Pessimistinen skenaario: Ei lisätoimenpiteitä
Suomi 2035-skenaario: Kaikki fossiilittoman liikenteen tiekartan lisätoimenpiteet on toteutettu.
Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-skenaario (HNE2030): Kaikki fossiilittoman liikenteen tiekartan lisätoimenpiteet on toteutettu (Espoon ilmastovahdin toimenpiteiden vaikutukset sisältyvät käytettyihin yksikköpäästökertoimiin).

# LIIKENNE – SUORITTEEN KEHITTYMINEN

## Tieliikenteen suoritteen kehittyminen

Tieliikenteen suoritteen kehittymistä Espoossa on arvioitu HELMET-mallin avulla. Mallin avulla arvioitiin liikennemääriä ajoneuvoluokittain vuosille 2030 ja 2040. Espoon osalta liikenneverkossa olivat mukana seuraavat keskeiset hankkeet: länsimetron jatke Kivenlahteen ja liityntälinjastot, Raide-Jokeri, Kuurinniityn joukkoliikennekatu, runkolinjat 520 ja 530 sekä Espoon kaupunkirata. Lisäksi vuodelle 2040 tehtiin arvio, jossa oli mukana liikenteen hinnoittelun toimenpiteitä. Arviota hinnoittelun toimenpiteistä ei kuitenkaan lopulta hyödynnetty skenaariolaskennassa. Vuoden 2035 tiedot on laskettu mallinnuksen 2030 ja 2040 keskiarvona.

### Suoritteen kasvu-% nykytilanteeseen nähden

|   | Henkilö-autot | Paketti-autot | Kuorma-autot | Linja-autot | Yhteensä  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  2030 | +7,5 % | +19,5 % | +44,0 % | +1,0 % | +10,3 %  |
|  2040 | +35,9 % | +43,5 % | +50,8 % | +1,0 % | +36,7 %  |
|  2040, sisältäen hinnoittelun toimenpiteet | +17,8 % | +30,1 % | +52,4 % | +1,0 % | +20,3 %  |

Joukkoliikenneinvestoinneista huolimatta liikennesuoritteet kasvavat mallinnuksissa. Suoritteiden kasvuun vaikuttaa väestönkasvu, joka on otettu mallinnuksessa huomioon. Joukkoliikenneinvestointien takia suoritteet eivät kuitenkaan kasva niin merkittävästi, kuin ne kasvaisivat ilman niitä. Tämä johtuu kulkutapaosuuksien muutoksista. Jotta autoliikenteen suorite ei kasvaisi ollenkaan, tulisi kulkutapaosuuden vuonna 2030 olla 36,1 prosenttia (nyt 40,2 prosenttia ja ennustettu vuoden 2030 osuus 36,8 prosenttia) ja kestävien kulkumuotojen yhteensä 63,9 prosenttia (nyt 59,8 prosenttia ja ennustettu vuoden 2030 osuus 63,2 prosenttia).

### Kulkutapaosuudet

|   | Autot | Joukkoliikenne | Pyöräily | Jalankulku  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  2021 | 40,2 % | 17,8 % | 8,8 % | 33,2 %  |
|  2030 | 36,8 % | 20,1 % | 9,0 % | 34,1 %  |
|  2040 | 37,6 % | 18,7 % | 9,2 % | 34,6 %  |
|  2040, sisältäen hinnoittelun toimenpiteet | 34,5 % | 19,9 % | 9,6 % | 36,0 %  |

# LIIKENNE – SUORITTEEN KEHITTYMINEN

## Tieliikenteen suoritteen lisatoimet, fossiilittoman liikenteen tiekartta

Fossiilittoman liikenteen tiekartassa on tunnistettu keinoja liikenteen päästöjen vähentämiseksi. Samat toimet on huomioitu myös KAISU2:ssa [11]. Alle on listattu tieliikenteen suoritteeseen vaikuttavia keinoja ja niiden suuruusluokkia. Keinoissa painottuvat valtion tekemät toimenpiteet.

|  Toimenpidekokonaisuus, suorite | Vaikutus 2030  |
| --- | --- |
|  Liikennejärjestelmän tehostaminen | -2,8 %  |
|  Etätyön lisääminen | -0,9 %  |
|  Liikenteen palveluiden edistäminen | -0,9 %  |
|  Yhdistetyt kuljetukset | -0,2 %  |
|  Tieliikenteen päästökauppa | -4,5 %  |

Liikennejärjestelmän tehostamisen toimenpiteitä ovat kestävän liikkumisen edistäminen mm. kestävän liikkumisen suunnitelmien toimenpiteitä toteuttamalla, kävelyn ja pyöräliikenteen investointiohjelman toteuttaminen, suurten ja keskisuurten kaupunkiseutujen joukkoliikenteen valtion avustuksen korottaminen, liikkumisen ohjauksen valtion avustuksen korottaminen, mittojen massojen

täysimääräinen hyödyntäminen kuljetuksissa, väylien kunnossapidon parantaminen sekä logistiikan digitalisaation parantaminen.

Etätoiden lisääntymisen vaikutus on arvioitu puolivälin skenaariona koronapandemian aikaisen suurimman etätyöpiikin ja edellisen vuoden tason perusteella.

Liikenteen palveluiden edistäminen sisältää Liikkuminen palveluna –konseptin (MaaS, Mobility as a Service). Päästövaikutusarvio perustuu kansainvälisiin selvityksiin.

Yhdistetyt kuljetukset vähentävät pääasiassa tavaraliikenteen päästöjä pitkillä, Suomen sisäisillä matkoilla. Toimenpiteen vaikutus Espooseen on keskimääräistä pienempi.

Tieliikenteen päästökauppa olisi joko EU:n tai Suomen tasoinen järjestelmä, jossa polttoaineen hintaan lisättäisiin päästöoikeuden arvo.

## Tieliikenteen suoritteen lisatoimet, Espoon ilmastovahti

Espoon ilmastovahdissa on kolme kokonaisuutta, joiden avulla pyritään vähentämään henkilöautoliikenteen suoritetta: raideliikenteen lisääminen (2.1), kävelyn ja pyöräilyn edistäminen (2.2) sekä joukkoliikenteen sujuvoittaminen (2.3). Ensimmäisessä tunnistettuja toimenpiteitä ovat Raide-Jokerin käyttöönotto, Länsimetron rakentaminen ja kaupunkiradan rakentaminen. Kaikki nämä toimenpiteet sisältyvät HELMET-liikennemallilla tehtyyn ennusteeseen. Lisäksi toimenpidekokonaisuuteen kuuluu ESA-oikoradan suunnittelu, mutta sitä ei ole huomioitu skenaarioissa, sillä se on vasta suunnitteluvaiheessa eikä tarkempi rakentumisaikataulu ole tiedossa.

# LIIKENNE – SUORITTEEN KEHITTYMINEN

Kävelyn ja pyöräilyn edistämiseen liittyvä kokonaisuus sisältää toimenpiteitä kävelyn olosuhteiden parantamiseksi, pyöräilyn edellytysten parantamiseksi, kestävästä liikenteestä ja liikkumisesta viestimiseksi sekä lasten ja nuorten kestävän liikkumisen edistämiseksi. HELMET-liikennemalli ei ota huomioon kävelyn ja pyöräilyn edellytysten parantamista, joten toimet on skenaariolaskennassa arvioitu erillisinä toimenpiteinä. Pääkaupunkiseudulla noin 2 prosenttia henkilöautoliikenteen päästöistä syntyy 1–2 km pituisilla automatkoilla ja noin 8 prosenttia 2–5 km pituisilla automatkoilla, henkilöautoliikenteen synnyttäessä noin 60 prosenttia tieliikenteen hiilidioksidipäästöistä. Kaikkia lyhyitä henkilöautomatkoja ei saada korvattua kävelyllä tai pyöräilyllä, mutta karkean arvion perusteella kolme neljästä matkasta voitaisiin korvata kestävällä liikkumismuodolla. Tällöin toimenpiteen vähennyspotentiaali olisi noin 4,5 prosenttia. Tästä osa sisältyy fossiilittoman liikenteen tiekartassa arvioituun, liikennejärjestelmän tehostamisen (–2,8 prosenttia), jolloin Espoossa olisi kaupunkirakenteesta johtuvaa lisäpotentiaalia noin 1,7 prosenttia.

Ilmastovahdissa esitetyt joukkoliikenteen sujuvoittamisen toimenpiteet ovat pitkän tähtäimen joukkoliikennekäytävien suunnittelu, liityntäpysäköinnin kehittäminen, uusien kestävien liikennepalveluiden kehittäminen sekä joukkoliikenteen sujuvuuden varmistaminen. Isojen raideinvestointien valmistumisen myötä nämä ovat erittäin tarpeellisia toimenpiteitä, jotta ennustetut käyttäjämäärät toteutuvat. Näin ollen voidaan katsoa, että tämän kokonaisuuden toimenpiteet ovat jo mukana liikennemallilla tehdyssä arviossa.

## Lisätoimet skenaarioissa

Lisätoimenpiteet on otettu huomioon skenaarioissa seuraavasti:

Pessimistinen skenaario: Ei lisätoimenpiteitä
Suomi 2035-skenaario: Kaikki fossiilittoman tiekartan lisätoimenpiteet.
Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-skenaario (HNE2030): Kaikki fossiilittoman tiekartan lisätoimenpiteet, minkä lisäksi Espoon oman ilmastovahdin mukaiset kävelyn ja pyöräliikenteen edistämisen toimenpiteet.

# TEOLLISUUS JA TYÖKONEET

Teollisuuden ja työkoneiden osuus Espoon päästöistä on pieni. Vuonna 2020 osuus oli noin 1,5 prosenttia. Sektorin päästökehitykseen vaikuttavat teollisuudessa käytetyt polttoaineet ja työmailla käytettyjen bensiinikäyttöisten työkoneiden polttoaineenkulutus. Skenaarioissa teollisuuden ja työmaiden päästöjen on arvioitu kehittyvän seuraavasti:

**Pessimistisessä skenaariossa** päästöjen oletetaan pysyvän vuoden 2020* tasolla asukaskohtaisesti tarkasteltuna. Kaupungin väkiluvun kasvun ja kasvavan rakennustarpeen myötä päästöjen oletetaan kasvavan aikavälillä 2021-2035.

**Suomi 2035-skenaariossa** päästöjen oletetaan kansallisten politiikkatoimien tuloksena laskevan teollisuudessa 53 prosenttia vuoteen 2035 mennessä. Työkoneiden päästöjen oletetaan laskevan 20 prosenttia. Päästöihin vaikuttavia toimia ovat muun muassa kevyen polttoöljyn bio-osuuden jakeluvelvoitteen kasvu, työkoneiden taloudelliset ajotavat ja EU-tason politiikkatoimet (mm. Stage-asetuksen ja päästökauppajärjestelmän kehitys). Oletukset perustuvat Keskipitkän aikavälin ilmastopolitiikan suunnitelmaan, KAISU2 [11]. Muutos on laskettu viimeisen viiden vuoden päästöjen keskiarvosta, sillä vuosittaiset vaihtelut sektorin sisällä ovat olleet suuria.

**Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-skenaariossa (HNE2030)** teollisuuden ja työkoneiden päästöjen oletetaan laskevan hieman Suomi 2035-skenaariota nopeammin kaupungin toteuttaminen toimien ansioista. Kaupunki muun muassa kilpailuttaa infraurakat Päästöttömät työmaat green deal-sopimuksen mukaisesti ja edistää vähähiilistä rakentamista kaavoituksen keinoin. HNE2030-skenaariossa teollisuuden päästöjen oletetaan laskevan Suomi 2035-skenaarion mukaisesti 53 prosenttia ja työkoneiden 50 prosenttia. Muutos on laskettu viimeisen viiden vuoden päästöjen keskiarvosta, sillä vuosittaiset vaihtelut sektorin sisällä ovat olleet suuria.

*Laskennassa on hyödynnetty vuotta 2020, sillä HSY:n vuoden 2021 tiedoissa on havaittu mahdollista epäjohdonmukaisuutta.

# JÄTTEIDEN KÄSITTELY

Jätteiden käsittelyn päästöt sisältävät kaatopaikkasijoituksesta, kompostoinnista ja jätevedenkäsittelystä aiheutuvat kasvihuonekaasupäästöt. Espoossa jätteiden käsittelyn päästöjen osuus kokonaispäästöistä oli vuonna 2021 noin 3 prosenttia. Jätehuollosta Espoossa vastaa HSY. Sektorin päästöjen kehityksestä eri skenaarioissa on oletettu seuraavasti:

**Pessimistisessä skenaariossa** jätteiden käsittelyn asukaskohtaisten päästöjen oletetaan pysyvän vuoden 2021 tasolla. Sektorin päästöjen oletetaan kasvavan aikavälillä 2021-2035 kaupungin väkiluvun ja tästä johtuvan jätteen määrän kasvun myötä.

**Suomi 2035-skenaariossa** jätteiden käsittelyn päästöjen arvioidaan laskevan 4 prosenttia vuoden 2020 tasosta vuoteen 2030 mennessä. Samankaltaisen päästökehityksen arvioidaan toteutuvan myös aikavälillä 2030-2035. Oletus perustuu Keskipitkän aikavälin ilmastopolitiikan suunnitelmassa (KAISU2) esitettyihin arvioihin [11].

**Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-skenaariossa (HNE2030)** jätteiden käsittelyn päästöjen oletetaan laskevan 68 prosenttia aikavälillä 2021-2030, minkä jälkeen päästöjen oletetaan pysyvän vuoden 2030 tasolla. Arvio perustuu HSY:n asiantuntija-arvioon [16] jätehuollon päästöjen kehityksestä. Kaupungin toteuttamia toimia ovat mm. valtakunnallisen kiertotalouden green deal -sopimuksen toteuttaminen, muovin lajittelun tehostaminen, rakennus- ja purkumateriaalien kierron edistäminen sekä kiertotalouden tavoitteelliseen kehittämiseen sitoutuminen. Viimeisen 10 vuoden aikana Espoon jätteiden käsittelyn päästöt ovat laskeneet 42 prosenttia. Erityisesti kaatopaikoille sijoitettujen jätteiden päästöt ovat laskeneet.

# MAATALOUS

Maataloussektorin kasvihuonekaasupäästöjen laskenta perustuu Espoon alueen maatalousmaan pinta-alatietoihin ja kotieläinten lukumäärätietoihin, jotka Luonnonvarakeskus tuottaa [1]. Maataloussektorin päästöt Espoossa ovat hyvin pienet. Vuonna 2021 maatalouden osuus kokonaispäästöistä oli noin 0,1 prosentin luokkaa. Sektorin päästöjen oletetaan kehittyvän tulevaisuudessa seuraavasti:

Pessimistisessä skenaariossa maatalouden päästöjen oletetaan pysyvän muuttumattomana aikavälillä 2021-2035.
Suomi 2035-skenaariossa päästöjen oletetaan laskevan 11 prosenttia vuoden 2020 tasosta vuoteen 2035 mennessä. Oletus perustuu Keskipitkän aikavälin ilmastopolitiikan suunnitelmassa (KAISU2) [11] esitettyihin oletuksiin.
Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-skenaariossa (HNE2030) maatalouden päästöjen oletetaan kehittyvän Suomi 2035 -skenaarion oletusten mukaisesti.

# SKENAARIOIDEN TULOKSET

Arvioitujen kolmen eri skenaarion perusteella päästöt Espoossa kehittyvät seuraavasti:

Pessimistinen skenaariossa Espoon päästöt laskevat vuoden 1990 tasosta 24 prosenttia vuoteen 2025 mennessä, 25 prosenttia vuoteen 2030 mennessä ja 23 prosenttia vuoteen 2035 mennessä. Skenaarion mukaisen päästökehityksen perusteella Espoon päästöt olisivat 817,6 kt CO2-ekv vuonna 2035, eli lähes samalla tasolla kuin vuonna 2021.

Suomi 2035-skenaariossa Espoon päästöt laskevat vuoden 1990 tasosta 38 prosenttia vuoteen 2025 mennessä, 58 prosenttia vuoteen 2030 mennessä ja 73 prosenttia vuoteen 2035 mennessä. Jotta 80 prosentin päästövähennystavoite toteutuisi vuonna 2035, tulisi päästöjen laskea skenaarion mukaisen kehityksen lisäksi vielä 78,7 kt CO2-ekv.

Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-skenaariossa (HNE2030) Espoon päästöt laskevat vuoden 1990 tasosta 50 prosenttia vuoteen 2025 mennessä, 72 prosenttia vuoteen 2030 mennessä ja 81 prosenttia vuoteen 2035 mennessä. Päästövähennystavoite (-80 %) toteutuu siis vuoteen 2035 mennessä HNE2030-skenaarion mukaisella päästökehityksellä. Jotta tavoite toteutuisi jo vuonna 2030, tulisi päästöjen laskea arvioidun lisäksi vielä 83,0 kt CO2-ekv vuoteen 2030 mennessä.

Skenaarioiden tulokset on esitetty kuvassa 1. Kuvassa on esitetty arvioidut päästöt vuosina 2025, 2030 ja 2035 kussakin skenaariossa sekä toteutuneet päästöt vuosina 1990 ja 2021. Skenaariolaskentojen tulokset on lisäksi koottu taulukoihin 1-3.

# LISÄTOIMENPITEET

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
# LISÄTOIMET PÄÄSTÖVÄHENNYSTAVOITTEEN SAAVUTTAMISEKSI

Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030 -skenaarion mukaisella päästökehityksellä saavutetaan asetettu 80 prosentin päästövähennystavoite vuoteen 2035 mennessä. Jotta tavoite saavutettaisiin jo vuonna 2030, tulisi päästöjä vähentää skenaarion mukaisen päästövähennysarvion lisäksi vielä 83 kt CO2-ekv vuoteen 2030 mennessä.

Hiilineutraaliustavoitteen saavuttamiseksi arvioitiin neljän liikenteen lisätoimenpiteen ja kolmen energiankulutuksen päästöihin vaikuttavan lisätoimenpiteen päästövähennyspotentiaalia.

Arvioidut liikenteen lisätoimenpiteet olivat:

Nopeusrajoitusten alentaminen Espoon alueen maanteilla
Sähköhenkilöautojen määrän nopeampi kasvu
Ympäristövyöhykkeen asettaminen kuorma-autoille
Matinkylä-Leppävaara pikaraitiotien rakentaminen

Arvioidut energiankulutuksen päästöihin vaikuttavat lisätoimenpiteet olivat:

Kaupungin alueen suurten toimijoiden siirtyminen sertifioidun vihreän sähkön käyttöön
Asukkaiden innostaminen sertifioidun vihreän sähkön ostoon
Aurinkosähkön tuotannon lisääminen

Lisätoimenpiteiden päästövähennyspotentiaalin arvioinnin lisäksi tarkasteltiin hallituksen jakeluvelvoitelain muutosesityksen vaikutuksia liikenteen päästöihin Espoossa. Esityksessä ehdotetaan muutettavaksi uusiutuvien polttoaineiden käytön edistämisestä liikenteessä annettua lakia. Ehdotuksen taustalla on pääministeri Petteri Orpon hallitusohjelman kirjaukset jakeluvelvoitteesta sekä uusiutuvista lähteistä peräisin olevan energian käytön edistämisestä annetun Euroopan parlamentin ja neuvoston direktiivin (EU) 2018/2001 täytäntöönpano.

Lisätoimenpiteiden arvioinnin tulokset on esitetty taulukoissa 4 ja 5. Tiettyjen lisätoimenpiteiden laskennassa käytettyjä oletuksia on mahdollista muuttaa, mikäli taustatiedot päivittyvät. Muutokset taustaoletuksissa vaikuttavat luonnollisesti toimenpiteiden arvioituun päästövähennyspotentiaaliin.

Tunnistettujen lisätoimenpiteiden toteutuessa täysimääräisesti nykyoletusten mukaisesti saavuttaisi Espoo hiilineutraaliustavoitteensa vuoteen 2030 mennessä. Hiilineutraalius saavutetaan tunnistetuilla lisätoimenpiteillä, vaikka hallituksen kaavailema muutos jakeluvelvoitelakiin toteutuisi. Mikäli jakeluvelvoitelain muutos ei toteudu ja jakeluvelvoite säilyy ennallaan, vähenisivät Espoon päästöt 83 % vuoden 1990 tasosta vuoteen 2030 mennessä. Jakeluvelvoitelain muutoksen toteutuessa on päästövähenemä tavoitteen mukainen 80 % vuodesta 1990 vuoteen 2030.

# YLEISTÄ

Kaupungit ja kunnat ovat avainasemassa Suomen pyrkiessä hiilineutraaliksi vuoteen 2035 mennessä. Kaupungit toimivat paikallisen ja alueellisen ilmastotyön alustoina ja mahdollistajina, vauhdittajina ja katalysaattoreina. Kaupunkien vastuulla ovat esimerkiksi kaavoitus, alueidensa maankäyttö, liikennesuunnittelu ja vastuu julkisista hankinnoista. Ilmastonäkökulma tulisi huomioida kaikissa näissä.

Valtaosa ilmastotoimenpiteistä vaatii investointeja. Jotkin toimenpiteet puolestaan vaikuttavat käyttökustannuksiin. Useat toimenpiteet, kuten esimerkiksi energiatehokkuusinvestoinnit kuitenkin tuottavat kustannussäästöjä pidemmällä aikavälillä tarkasteltuna. Joidenkin toimien osalta kustannussäästöt näkyvät lähes välittömästi. Ilmastotoimia toteuttamalla voidaan myös suojautua äkillisten, odottamattomien ja vaikeasti ennustettavissa olevien muutosten vaikutuksilta, kuten esimerkiksi fossiilisten polttoaineiden hinnanvaihtelulta.

Ilmastotyölle ja laajoille toimenpidekokonaisuuksille on haasteellista määritellä kokonaishintaa. Useiden toimenpiteiden toteutusratkaisut ja käytettävä teknologia tarkentuvat tulevien vuosien aikana. Lisäksi esimerkiksi polttoaineiden ja materiaalien hinnat voivat vaihdella merkittävästikin. Toisaalta on myös haasteellista arvioida kustannuksia sille, että ilmastotyötä ei toteutettaisi.

Osana Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-tiekartan taustatyötä tehtiin laadullinen arvio kaupungin ilmastotoimien kustannuksista. Arvion tavoitteena oli tuottaa tietoa eri toimenpiteiden kustannusvaikutuksista suhteessa toisiinsa ja tukea täten toimien priorisointia ja aikataulutusta. Arvion toteutti Sitowise Oy.

# MENETELMÄ

Osana Hiilineutraali Espoo 2030-tiekartan taustatyötä arvioitiin kaupungin ilmastotoimenpiteiden toteuttamisen kustannusvaikutuksia. Arviossa tarkasteltiin kaupungin ilmastonmuutoksen hillintätoimien investointi- ja käyttökustannuksia neljässä kaupungin ilmastotoimenpiteiden teemakokonaisuudessa:

Energia
Liikenne
Maankäyttö ja rakentaminen
Kiertotalous ja kestävät valinnat

Kunkin teeman alle sijoittuvien 3-4 toimenpidekokonaisuuden investointi- ja käyttökustannukset arvioitiin kokonaistaloudellisesti. Toimenpidekokonaisuuksien kustannusvaikutusarviot yhdistettiin arvioon kokonaisuuksien päästövähennysvaikutuksista. Päästövähennysvaikutusten arviointia on peilattu HSY:n tuottamaan päästölaskentaan, mutta vaikutuksia on arvioitu myös HSY:n alueellisen päästölaskennan ulkopuolelle jäävien päästöjen, esimerkiksi rakentamisen, hankintojen ja kulutuksen päästöjen osalta.

Kustannusvaikutusarvion tulokset on esitetty kuvassa 2 ja arvion taustatiedot kunkin toimenpidekokonaisuuden osalta taulukossa 6-9.

Lisätoimenpiteiden kustannusvaikutusarvioiden tulokset on esitetty taulukoissa 10 ja 11. Lisätoimenpiteitä on arvioitu toimenpidekohtaisesti.

|  1.1 | Hiilineutraaliin kaukolämpöön siirtyminen | 3 | Toimenpidekokonaisuuden investointikustannukset tulevat olemaan merkittävät. | -1 | Päästökaupan vaikutuksesta johtuen päästöttömät energialähteet tulevat olemaan käyttökustannuksiltaan fossiilisia halvempia. | 4 | Lämmityksen päästöjen osuus Espoossa on merkittävä. Kaukolämmön päästöjen osuus Espoon kokonaispäästöistä vuonna 2021 oli 31 prosenttia, joten päästövähennys-potentiaali on merkittävä.  |
|  1.2 | Uusiutuvan energian lisääminen | 2 | Uusiutuvan energian tuottaminen rakennuskohtaisesti ja fossiilisista luopuminen eivät ole isossa kuvassa investointikustannuksiltaan merkittäviä. | 0 | Paikallisiin päästöttömiin energiamuotoihin investoiminen pienentää käyttökustannuksia. Kokonaisuuteen sisältyy toisaalta päästöttömän sähkön hankintaa, mikä lisää kustannuksia. Tämän johdosta kokonaisvaikutus käyttökustannuksiin on arvioitu neutraaliksi. | 3 | Fossiilisista polttoaineista luovutaan kaupungin ja Espoon Asuntojen kohteissa, eli vain pienessä osassa kaikista rakennuksista. Kaupungin ja Espoon Asuntojen rakennuskannassa hyödynnetään jatkossakin päästötöntä sähköä, tämä ei siis aiheuta lisäpäästövähennyksiä.  |
|  1.3 | Energiatehokkuuden parantaminen | 2 | Toimenpiteet koskevat pääasiassa kaupungin omia ja Espoon Asuntojen rakennuksia. Toimenpiteet kattavat siis vain pienen osan rakennuskannasta, eikä niiden kustannusvaikutus ole merkittävä. Peruskorjausten yhteydessä tehtävä energiatehokkuuden parantaminen ei välttämättä kasvatta kustannuksia merkittävästi. | -1 | Energiatehokkuus-toimenpiteet vähentävät energiantarvetta jonkin verran. | 3 | Energiatehokkuustoimenpiteillä on huomattava päästövähennysvaikutus. Toimenpiteet koskevat pääosin kaupungin ja Espoon Asuntojen rakennuskantaa. Lisäksi kokonaisuuden toimia on kohdennettu kaavoituksen keinoin pääosin uudisrakentamiseen, jossa potentiaalia on olemassa olevaan rakennuskantaan nähden vähemmän.  |

|  2.1 | Raideliikenteen lisääminen | 3 | Raidehankkeiden investointikustannukset ovat suuret. | -2 | Kokonaisvaltaisesti tarkasteltuna raideliikenteen käyttökustannukset ovat yksityisautoilun kustannuksia pienemmät. Pienemmällä infran ja kaluston määrällä pystytään kuljettamaan enemmän ihmisiä kuin henkilöautoilla. Raitiotien käyttökustannus on myös bussiliikennettä pienempi. | 2 | Raideliikenteen kärkihankkeilla pyritään vaikuttamaan kulkutapajakaumaan ja vähentämään henkilöautojen ajosuoritetta. Asukasmäärän kasvu puolestaan lisää liikkumista kaupungissa. Raideliikenteen käytön aikaiset päästöt ovat pienet verrattuna tieliikenteen ajoneuvoihin. HSY:n laskelma ei ota huomioon rakentamisen aikaisia päästöjä.  |
|  2.2 | Kävelyn ja pyöräilyn edistäminen | 1 | Investointikustannuksista merkittävimmät ovat pyöräverkon parantaminen ja laajentaminen. Kustannus ei ole valtava suhteessa raidehankkeisiin. | -1 | Pyöräily ja kävely ovat käyttäjälle halvin liikkumismuoto. Kokonaisuudessa ei suoraan viitata reittien ylläpitoon (esim. tehostettu talvi-kunnossapito), joten näitä vaikutuksia ei arvioitu. | 1 | Kävelyn ja pyöräilyn lisäämisellä vaikutetaan ajosuoritteeseen. Kävely ja pyöräily korvaavat kuitenkin pääosin lyhyitä matkoja, jolloin päästövähennyspotentiaali on muita tieliikenteen ajosuoritteeseen vaikuttavia kokonaisuuksia pienempi.  |
|  2.3 | Joukko-liikenteen sujuvoittaminen | 2 | Toimenpiteet eivät ole kustannuksiltaan merkittäviä suhteessa esimerkiksi raidehankkeisiin. | -1 | Joukkoliikenteen sujuvoittaminen tekee liikkumisesta halvempaa. | 2 | Joukkoliikenteen sujuvoittamisella pyritään vaikuttamaan kulkutapajakaumaan ja vähentämään henkilöautojen ajosuoritetta. Asukasmäärän kasvu puolestaan lisää liikkumista kaupungissa. Vaikutus päästöihin perustuu joukkoliikenteen houkuttelevuuden lisäämiseen. Päästövähennyspotentiaaliin vaikuttavat myös joukkoliikenteen käyttövoimat.  |
|  2.4 | Autoliikenteen päästöjen vähentäminen | 2 | Sähköautojen latausinfran ja päästöttömien polttoaineiden jakeluinfran kustannukset eivät ole valtavia suhteessa esimerkiksi raidehankkeisiin. | -2 | Sähköllä ja päästöttömillä polttoaineilla kulkevien ajoneuvojen käyttö-kustannukset tulevat olemaan bensa-autoja pienemmät. | 3 | Liikenteen päästöjen vähentämisessä on suuri potentiaali ja henkilöautojen kulkumuoto-osuus on suurin. Puhtaampiin käyttövoimiin siirtymisen päästövähennyspotentiaali on merkittävä.  |

|  3.1 | Kestävä kaupunki-rakenne | 2 | Kaupunkirakenteen tiivistäminen ja olemassa olevaan infraan tukeutuminen on yleisesti ottaen kustannustehokasta. Toisaalta tiivistävään rakentamiseen voi liittyä kalliita erikoisratkaisuja, jotka nostavat kustannuksia. | -2 | Tiiviin kaupunkirakenteen käytön kustannukset ovat per asukas pienemmät kuin hajanaisemman rakenteen, koska ylläpidettävää infraa on vähemmän. | 2 | Olemassa olevan kaupunkirakenteen tiivistämisen ja täydennysrakentamisen päästö-vähennyspotentiaali kohdistuu etenkin liikennesektorin päästöihin. Mikäli olemassa olevat lähipalvelut ovat toimivat ja riittävät, liikkumistarve on maltillinen ja toisaalta tiiviit alueet voivat tukeutua joukkoliikenteeseen.  |
|  3.2 | Ilmasto-vaikutusten arviointi | 1 | Investointikustannukset ovat vähäiset. |  | Ei käyttökustannusvaikutusta. | 1 | Hiilinielujen säilyttämistä tukemalla aikaansaadaan myönteisiä ilmastovaikutuksia, joskaan ei suoria päästövähennyksiä.  |
|  3.3 | Kestävän liikkumisen edellytykset | 1 | Katso kohta "kestävä kaupunkirakenne". Toiminnoiltaan monipuolisen kaupunkirakenteen luomiseen ei liity erityistä lisäkustannusta. | -2 | Katso kohta "kestävä kaupunkirakenne". Toiminnoiltaan monipuolinen kaupunkirakenne vähentää liikkumisen kustannuksia. | 2 | Katso kohta "kestävä kaupunkirakenne".  |
|  3.4 | Ilmastoviisas rakentaminen | 2 | Vähähiilinen ja kiertotalouden periaatteita noudattava infra nostaa rakentamiskustannuksia. Myös uudisrakennusten energiatehokkuuteen panostamisella on pieni kustannusvaikutus. | -1 | Energiatehokkaiden rakennusten käyttökustannukset ovat tyypillistä jonkin verran pienemmät. Vähähiilisen infran ylläpidon kustannuksiin liittyy epävarmuutta kokemustiedon puutteen vuoksi. | 2 | Toimenpiteet kohdistuvat etenkin infrarakentamiseen. Alueellisessa päästölaskennassa seurattavista päästöistä toimenpiteet vaikuttavat lähinnä työkoneiden päästöihin ja rakennusten energiankulutukseen. Vähähiilisen talon- ja infrarakentamisen tuottamat päästövähenemät näkyvät kulutusperusteisissa päästöissä.  |

|  4.1 | Kiertotalouden ratkaisut | 1 | Konkreettiset toimenpiteet (muut kuin selvitys ja viestintä luonteiset) ovat epäselviä. Investointikustannuksia on vaikea arvioida. | 1 | Kiertotalouden tukeminen vaatii (ainakin toistaiseksi) jatkuvia toimia, jotka aiheuttavat kustannuksia. | 2 | Materiaalien kierrätyksessä sekä uudelleenkäytössä päästövähennyspotentiaali liittyy paitsi siihen, että raaka-aineita kuluu vähemmän myös siihen, että esimerkiksi kuljetuksilta voidaan välttyä.  |
|  4.2 | Ilmasto-ystävällinen ruokailu | 1 | Toimenpiteiden valmistelu aiheuttaa vähäisiä kustannuksia. | 0 | Ilmastotietoiset ratkaisut Espoon ateriapalveluissa eivät aiheuta merkittävää vaikutusta käyttökustannuksiin. | 2 | Ilmastoystävällinen, kuten kasvispainotteinen ruokailu vähentää päästöjä suhteessa esimerkiksi lihapainotteiseen ruokavalioon. Päästöjen kannalta merkittävämpi vaikutus on ruokahävikin vähentämisellä.  |
|  4.3 | Harkitut hankinnat | 1 | Toimenpiteiden valmistelu aiheuttaa vähäisiä kustannuksia. | 0 | Etätulkkaus vähentää käyttökustannuksia. Vähähiilisten hankintojen kustannusvaikutukset ovat epävarmoja. | 2 | Kaupungin hankintojen päästöjen voidaan esimerkiksi Kulma-hankkeessa kootun tiedon valossa arvioida olevan suhteellisen merkittävät. Toimenpidekokonaisuuden nykyiset toimet pilotoivat hiilijalanjälkilaskentaa ja kehittävät hankintakriteerejä mutta, mikäli nämä saadaan tulevaisuudessa jalkautettua osaksi kaikkia kaupungin hankintoja on päästövähennys-potentiaali suurempi.  |
|  4.4 | Kestävä matkailu ja tapahtumat | 1 | Toimenpiteiden investointikustannukset ovat vähäiset. | 0 | Toimenpiteiden vaikutus käyttökustannuksiin on epävarma. Energiatehokkuuteen liittyvät toimenpiteet esimerkiksi voivat vähentää kustannuksia, kun taas osa vähähiilisistä ratkaisuista voi kasvattaa kustannuksia. | 1 | Matkailun päästöjen vähentämisen toimet allokoituvat osittain myös muille sektoreille. Toimenpidekokonaisuuden tarkkojen päästövähennyspotentiaalien laskenta vaatisi tarkempia hiilijalanjälkilaskelmia.  |
