# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses, and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

This Action Plan summarizes the climate work as resolved in the City of Turku Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan 2029 (SECAP) and as reported at the CDP-ICLEI common reporting framework. Due to determined climate work since 2009, the baseline emissions for 2020 are already at very low level. Despite this fact, emissions have to be further reduced more than 75% to achieve the 2029 carbon neutrality target, i.e. -90% compared to the 1990 level. The Action Plan aims at making a comprehensive review of Turku's climate policies, relevant stakeholders and expected challenges along the way.

# 1 Introduction

The introduction should outline the local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and describe the gap it is addressing in broad terms.

## Introduction - textual element

Turku aims to be carbon neutral by 2029 and climate positive from then onwards. The target of carbon neutrality by 2029 was decided by the City Council in the City Strategy on 16 April 2018. On 11 June 2018, the City Council approved the climate plan that adheres to the shared European (SECAP) model. The climate targets were further reinforced when the City Council decided on the revised city strategy on 14 February 2022 and the updated City of Turku Climate Plan was unanimously approved by the City Council on 16 May 2022. Over 80 experts from both the City Group and important stakeholders participated in the process of updating the Climate Plan and are also involved in the eight thematic advisory groups guiding the work.

The base year of the City of Turku Climate Plan is 1990 in accordance with the general baseline year of international climate policy. By year 2029 at the latest, Turku will reach carbon neutrality. This means that the sum of Turku's emissions, carbon sinks and potential offsets is zero or below. By 2029, emissions will be reduced by at least 90 per cent compared to the level in 1990.

In the City of Turku Climate Plan, emissions from monitoring year 2020 have also been reported in accordance with the requirements of the Covenant of Mayors. In the context of the Climate City Contract this data is used as the baseline. Compared to year 1990, emissions have already decreased by 59%. Emissions per capita in 2020 (2.6 t CO2-eq) were merely a third of the emissions in 1990 (7.8 t CO2-eq). Despite this fact, compared to the level in 2020, the emission reduction target set for the year 2029 is at least 75 per cent and emissions will continue to drop from 2029 to 2035. (N.B., the emission reduction target for the year 2029 is more than 80% compared to the level in 2019. However, newer baseline is preferred.)

On the basis of the scenario analysis, emissions per capita will be halved from the level in 2020 by 2025, and they will amount to 0.6 t CO2-eq in 2029, which is less than the emission level required by the Paris Agreement. The greatest emission reductions between 2020 and 2029 will be achieved by transitioning to carbon neutral electricity (112.5 kt CO2-eq), by using carbon neutral district heating (111.1 kt CO2-eq) and by reducing the consumption of fossil petrol and diesel (67.3 kt CO2-eq).

The impact of national measures (i.e., emissions reductions in existing strategies) and the impact of Turku's own measures (i.e., emissions gap to be addressed by action plan) are estimated to be equal. However, the national measures and Turku's own measures are mutually reinforcing and it's not possible to completely differentiate between the impacts of the two.

This Action Plan summarizes the climate work as resolved in the City of Turku Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan 2029 (SECAP) and as reported at the CDP-ICLEI common reporting framework. Turku joined the Covenant of Mayors in 2010 and has been reporting its progress annually through CDP since 2014.

Figure 1. Climate transition map following the NZC theory of change part 1.

City of Turku has been building a strong mandate for climate work since 2009 and nowadays there are various sustainable policies regarding climate, circular economy, and biodiversity. Ilmastojoukkue (Climate team) is a network for companies and organizations that facilitates co-operation and knowledge sharing in climate and sustainability work between different regional actors. Ilmastojoukkue has been operating since 2018. Ekotuki (Eco support) is a network that educates city employees in sustainability work, network has been operating since 2011.

The City of Turku acknowledges that understanding the system and challenges from multiple perspectives is very important in sustainability work. There are many different data sets that helps following the progress for example in emissions reductions.

Learning, reflecting and making it the new normal

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

Turku is active in regional, national and international sustainability networks. To make sure that sustainability work is coordinated well, there are many working groups that involve different departments of the city and stakeholders to work together in climate, biodiversity, circular economy and sustainable financing. The City of Turku has been working with local business clusters for climate and the plan is to deepen the co-operation in the future. There are already several ways to facilitate citizen participation in city's work, yet the climate ambassador network will be piloted to support citizens climate work in the future. The City is actively applying for project funding to pilot new sustainability means and currently the ongoing projects are making strong examples to make it the new norm (Figure 2).

Learning and reflecting happens annually through CDP reporting and an annually compiled climate report. The Climate Plan of Turku is updated every 4 years to adjust pathways to the carbon neutrality goal. Collective learning happens also through various trainings that intent to build the shared knowledge and capabilities to catalyse change – during 2023 EU taxonomy trainings have been organized for different city departments and sustainability trainings (ecosupport) for employees. In 2022 there were a sustainability course for regional companies that will be organized again in 2024.

Climate communication supports embedding the good practices. Digital platform for climate and sustainability knowledge is being developed in upcoming years to support the sustainability transitions in the city organization and in the region.

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

Final energy usage and GHG emissions by sector as well as by fuel type are presented in the above figures for the baseline year 2020 according to the data previously reported at the CDP-ICLEI Track. The emission factors have also been provided according to the Turku Climate Plan 2029, ANNEX 1: Description of the calculation method.

The emissions calculated using the SECAP method have been presented. In addition to on-road traffic, the transportation includes also other means of transport such as waterborne navigation. Aviation includes emissions from landing and take-off cycle. The waste sector includes emissions from historical landfills which have been estimated by using first-order decay model and are not directly linked to current activities. The F-gas emissions from industrial processes have been reported according to the ALas model provided by the Finnish Environment Institute. In Turku, other IPPU emissions are minor. The AFOLU sector includes the carbon sinks of forests on the basis of the calculation made by the Natural Resources Institute Finland. The negative value for 2020 shows that the emissions from other forests have been balanced by increased carbon storage in the city-owned forests which have been fostered prioritising climate impacts since 2019.

The graph shows the normalised emissions in Turku in 1990, 2015 and 2020, calculated using the SECAP method (excl. other transport sectors, waste, IPPU and AFOLU). The figures are shown heating degree day corrected so that they equate to the climatological normal period 1981–2010. The figure also includes the estimated development of emissions, carbon sinks and offsetting measures for years 2025, 2029 and 2035. The total emissions and targets are presented on the left vertical axis (kt CO₂-eq), and the emissions per capita are presented on the right vertical axis (t CO₂-eq per capita).

The attainability of the set targets has been examined through a scenario analysis. In the last figure (figure 7) the impact of Turku's own measures and national measures on emissions in Turku in 2029 are compared to the level in 2020, calculated using the SECAP method. In the context of the Climate City Contract, Turku's own measures are considered as the emissions gap to be addressed by the action plan. However, the national measures and Turku's own measures are mutually reinforcing and it's not possible to completely differentiate between the impacts of the two.

# A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers and opportunities – textual elements

The most challenging areas in our journey towards carbon neutrality and how we plan to solve them:

The transport sector will remain the biggest single emission source (although other energy consumption sources together still count the biggest share). Turku is taking measures to enable low-carbon transport system. Citizens engagement is crucial and require human resources and methodologies. Turku will not be able to tackle all the emissions alone. Mobility is a good example of where national and EU level actions e.g. tax measures, emission limits and funding have a significant role.

Big investments are needed in renovation of Turku’s building infrastructure. Financing is available, but challenges include capital costs and limited human resources. It is also important get the building owners and building users to take measures. Several investments needs and plans are currently competing with each other – regarding political acceptance/support – and possible insufficient funding for some Climate actions such as large-scale public transport investments could slow down the implementation of Climate Action. However, Turku’s financial position is relatively strong and availability and costs of external funding are rather good.

Data and digital technologies are needed to support knowledge-based policies and investment decisions.

Very complex working environment with various geographical and organizational boundaries generates a risk for implementation. Multisectoral expertise is needed to make efficient interventions. Green Procurement is being used as an effective means of Climate Action but needs still more efforts, the risk being the prevalence of old “business-as-usual” practices that may prioritize simple cost models over life-cycle and climate impact consideration. We need to keep on working consistently together across the city departments, subsidiaries and partners.

Availability of key personnel is important for continuity and success of the work. There is a growing demand of municipal climate experts and managers in Finland and emerging competition in recruitment. This can be addresses by e.g. long-term funding of the projects, sufficient number of permanent staff and long-term plans and contracts also for project staff as well as overall good HR policies.

Additional challenges are also the fragmented land ownership and lack of experience in nature-based solutions.

Political support for climate commitments in Turku is strong and shared, the Climate Plan has been adopted unanimously. However, the political environment has turned less favorable after the national elections. The local political environment is not heavily polarized, but there are different opinions on the level of ambition considering e.g. private car traffic. To minimize the risk also other benefits (economy, health) should be highlighted. Climate ambition is currently seen as a shared strategy of the city and stakeholders contributing to the competitiveness of the whole region.

Adequate involvement of the relevant state organizations is crucial and must be further emphasized during the next preparation steps. Turku has a track record of successful partnerships and stakeholder involvement. However, stakeholder relationships require constant facilitation and public opinions and media approaches may change over time – and political and opinion trends may also influence government policies and collaboration. Clear and active messaging and dialogue are key success factors.

Legislative requirements could complicate the implementation of the local compensation model and adversely affect carbon sinks. Research and active collaboration both nationally and in EU level is needed to minimize the risk. There are ongoing projects that develop the possibilities of carbon storages and capture in Finnish cities. Also, the Turku City Forest Management plan strengthens the carbon sinks in the forests owned by the city.

Social inequality and ageing people is a challenge for citizen engagement. Well-designed targeted services will be needed to tackle the risk. Equality and accessibility are key value for the city and for example the public transport is accessible to all. Turku is taking efforts to make sure that no-one is left behind in the green low-carbon transition. Circular Economy is developed as a means to provide meaningful approaches and practices to low-carbon living and business.

Extreme weather may make it more difficult to achieve e.g. energy efficiency and sustainable mobility targets. Adaptation to climate change must be considered alongside mitigation to minimize the risk. Adaptation is a binding part of Turku's Climate Plan, including the full assessment of risks, vulnerabilities and impacts following the European CoM Mayors' SECAP model. Ecological risks have been identified and actions prepared to address them.

Any disturbance in global stability (e.g. disease, refugees) could rapidly affect priorities. However, some climate actions are also precautionary measures (e.g. local renewable energy production). Changing weathers will influence local risk levels, for instance the temperature fluctuation at freezing point will cause more accidents and load on hospital and damage services.

Working in various local, national and international networks Turku can develop solutions and share ideas on topical challenges on reaching carbon neutrality.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

City of Turku is taking part in various international, national and regional networks that support reaching carbon neutrality. Also various working groups with city departments and relevant stakeholders in climate, circular economy and biodiversity are strengthening the cross-sectoral work on sustainability.

Ilmastojoukkue (Climate team network for regional companies and organizations) is runned by city of Turku and aims to accelerate green transition in the area. Network organizes frequent events where companies, industries, different organizations, city group's subsidiaries, universities and academia are welcomed to share and discuss topical themes in circular economy, climate and sustainability. Ekotuki (ecosupport) network is a sustainability network for employees of city of Turku.

There are various models in use to accelerate the sustainable lifestyles "1.5-Degree life" among the citizens. City already has in use participatory platform such as "voice your opition" Voice Your Opinion - Kerrokantasi (turku.fi) and participatory budgeting to mention few. In NZC pilot project Turku will be developing new ways of citizen engagement through climate ambassador network that will among other things facilitate co-creation of sustainable lifestyles in Turku.

Communication to stakeholders will in future happen through "Climate situation room" that is currently under development. However, there is an ongoing newsletter and various events organized by the city, where sustainability transition is being discussed with stakeholders and informed of. Participatory model of City of Turku aims to target all the systemic levels of city's climate work (represented with green balls in the picture 3).

Also new projects and pilots are often developed together with local universities and companies.

# 4.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

Module B-2 “Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design” should contain a project description for each intervention planned, including interventions by local businesses and industry, according to the template B-2.1, including actions those interventions targeted at enhancing carbon sinks to address residual emissions. Narrative analysis and comments can be provided in B-2.2. A summary of how residual emissions are addressed, should be provided in B-2.3.

|  B-2.1: Description of action portfolios - textual or visual Iris  |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Fields of action | Portfolio description  |   |
|   | List of actions | Descriptions  |
|  Energy systems | Carbon-neutral energy system | The heat, cooling, steam and electricity used in the Turku area will be produced in a carbon-neutral manner in 2029 at the latest (taking into consideration offsets within the energy system).  |
|  Mobility & transport | Low-carbon sustainable mobility | To reach the main targets of climate policy, the city will seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from street and road transport by at least 50% from the level in 2015 by 2029. Cycling and walking conditions will be significantly improved around the year. Public transport in Turku will be turned into a carbon neutral service by 2029. The transition to low-carbon vehicles and mobility services will be actively advanced. Housing, services, trading venues, workplace areas and infill construction focus areas will be placed in a way that they advance a city of walking, cycling and public transport.  |
|  Waste & circular economy | Circular economy transition | All city units and the Turku City Group’s subsidiaries seek to implement resource-wise approaches such as saving energy, advancing sustainable mobility, reducing material loss, fostering an operational culture that supports sustainable development and circular economy, and maintaining a reasonable consumption level in terms of natural resources. The aspect of circular economy will be taken into consideration in all construction work.  |
|  Green infrastructure & nature-based solutions | Strengthening biodiversity and carbon sinks | Biodiversity and the securing of ecosystems have a considerable impact on the mitigation of climate change and adaptation. According to the sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 30–50 per cent of land, fresh water and seas on the planet need to come under efficient protection or environmental rehabilitation to secure the functionality of ecosystems. Turku will seek to increase the carbon storage in the local vegetation and soil. Turku observes and participates in the development of new nature-based and technological solutions and develops collaboration with stakeholders.  |
|  Built environment | Sustainable urban structure and low-carbon construction | The urban structure affects emissions from energy, mobility, construction of infrastructure and pre-construction. The City of Turku will seek to minimise the carbon footprint of pre-construction, infrastructure building and housebuilding throughout the life cycle in an active and target-oriented way. The urban structure and construction also have a significant role in adapting to climate change.  |

The later outcomes will be that all electricity, heat, cooling and steam used in the area is produced in a carbon-neutral manner by 2029 at the latest taking into account internal offsetting within the energy sector.
A prerequisite for a climate-positive Turku is that renewable energy is produced not only for the city’s own needs but also to serve the needs of other areas.
New smart energy solutions are constantly developed, leading to an increased role of municipal residents in the energy transition.
New solutions, innovations and energy expertise are developed in collaboration with businesses. An operating environment that is appealing to businesses and support their operation is created.  |

By year 2029 at the latest, Turku will reach carbon neutrality. This means that the sum of Turku's emissions, carbon sinks and potential offsets is zero or below. Emissions will be reduced by at least 90 per cent compared to the level in 1990. From 2029 onwards, Turku strives towards an increasing climate positivity, which means that the sum of local emissions, carbon sinks and compensations is increasingly negative.

In order for Turku to reach carbon neutrality, carbon sinks in the area need to be increased. Increasing the ability of vegetation and soil to absorb carbon is an efficient and inexpensive climate measure that also has many other significant positive effects. The existing forests will be fostered prioritising climate impacts, biodiversity and recreational use. Incentives will be created for landowners to increase the carbon storage, for instance by developing the local offsetting system.

Pilot projects with research institutions are already going on. Turku observes and participates in the development of both nature-based and technological solutions and develops collaboration with stakeholders, observing and taking into use solutions that enable capturing of carbon dioxide.

As seen in the visualization above, there are various organizations and governance interventions that facilitate co-creation of the portfolio that brings together existing policies, actions and programmes with new or accelerated interventions in a set of transformative actions to achieve the 2030 goals. These interventions include various multidisciplinary working groups that work in implementation of Turku Climate Plan, biodiversity action plan, circular economy roadmap and climate budget. *Ilmastojoukkue* (Climate team network for regional companies and organizations) is run by city of Turku and aims to accelerate green transition in the area. Network organizes frequent events where companies, industries, different organizations, city group's subsidiaries, universities and academia are welcomed to share and discuss topical themes in circular economy, climate and sustainability.

The Climate Plan has been approved by Turku City Council as a binding document for the city group including subsidiaries. The implementation has been integrated into normal management procedures and is monitored by Turku City Council and City Board. The City Board is given a report on the implementation and development of the climate plan once a year as a minimum (in addition to the climate report given to Turku City Council). The attainment of the objectives set for 2021–2025–2029 will be checked each council term in connection with the updating of the climate plan.

The update and review work of the Climate Plan was carried out by a large Climate Coordination Group, which included over 80 experts from the City Group, research institutes, stakeholders and partners. The Climate and Environmental Policy Unit coordinated the work with additional support from outsourced experts. The Climate

Coordination Group is a significant gatherer of information and know-how, and therefore its activities have been continued even after the update work was completed to support climate work.

The Climate and Environment Policy Unit under the Mayor at the Central Administration with dedicated team of 10 persons is responsible for coordination of the climate work. In everyday work the team is supplemented by several decentralized experts in the fields of mobility, energy, finance, business, communications, EU policy, projects etc.

As outlined in the Mayor's programme 2021–2025, Turku will take and has successfully taken climate budgeting into use at the beginning of 2023. The climate targets have been taken into account especially in decision-making concerning land use, energy, construction and mobility and extensive training on EU taxonomy has been offered to these units. Where possible, the EU taxonomy will be taken into consideration when making investments, so that green funding can also be utilised. In investments and procurement, the City of Turku will seek to promote circular economy solutions and reduce consumption of natural resources.

Climate investments /climate budget is managed as part of the city's annual budget and planning. By 2029, the Turku Group will implement the largest investment program in its history (around two and a half billion euros), the effectiveness of which is crucial for the realization of carbon neutrality and the progress of the circular economy. In the Vähähiilinen kiertotalouskaupunki (VÄKI) project, climate budgeting is developed as a tool for the preparation, guidance and monitoring of the City Group's investment program, combining the implementation of climate goals and the circular economy.

The actions and investments of the city group will be updated annually as part of the yearly action and financial planning of the city. This process will utilize the regular administrative structures and processes of the city / city group governance plus will benefit from the support and insight from Climate Coordination Group.

The city has benefited from the shared European Covenant of Mayors methodology (member since 2010) and has more than halved the GHG emission from the level of 1990. The greenhouse gas emissions of Turku are calculated annually, using the local calculation method of the CO2 report, as part of the monitoring of the implementation of the city strategy and climate plan. The emissions are reported every other year to the shared European system using the SECAP method, where emission data based on the CO2 report is adjusted to meet the reporting requirements of the Covenant of Mayors. In line with the UN's requirements, the emissions are also reported annually through the global CDP (Disclosure Insight Action) system. The emissions calculation in Turku is in accordance with the UN global calculation protocol for cities.

Turku is the host for Union of the Baltic Cities Sustainable Cities Commission and active member in Eurocities and ICLEI (Mayor of Turku as Vice Chair of the European Regional Executive Committee and Vice-President in the global Presidium). Turku has been involved in city twinning projects within Europe and beyond, recently e.g. CoM Twinning Programme with Bologna, Green City Accord peer-learning programme with several European cities and IURC-EU-Japan cooperation with Nagano and Obuse. In addition, Turku has been involved in numerous international projects. Within country borders Turku is an active member in several networks, e.g. HINKU (https://www.hilineutraalisuomi.fi/en-US/Hinku), FISU (https://www.fisunetwork.fi/en-US/About_Fisu) and Six largest cities in Finland -network (https://6aika.fi/en/six-cities/).

In the Ilmastokaupunki's Hiilineutraalit Klusterit project (IKLU), cluster-specific cooperation was developed to promote emission reductions and strengthen low-carbon business in the companies and value chains of the top Health, Maritime, and Experience clusters in the region. In the project, the actors of the clusters were brought together and in the project they jointly communicated the climate work of the cluster companies, such as Bayer's achievement of carbon neutrality in 2022, the production of the carbon-negative movie 'Odotus' (Waiting), and the goals of Meyer's Turku carbon-neutral shipyard and cruise ship.

In terms of the Turku City Group's own buildings, new and innovative energy solutions will be actively sought. The level of ambition for new solutions is very high, and innovative solutions for the identified challenges will be sought through collaboration and by piloting. For example, Turku Student Village will be turned into an energy positive pilot area by year 2025 with the help of the EU Horizon funded RESPONSE project.

# C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions – textual and visual elements

Turku implements continuous open climate action where the Turku City Group is constantly planning, implementing and monitoring climate measures. Collective climate action is actively open to climate measures of businesses and communities, involvement by citizens, and development of new solutions in collaboration. Also, as a central part of Circular Turku Roadmap (approved by the City Board on November 22, 2021), we aim to ensure an equitable transition by rethinking how goods and services are accessed in the city, offering new means for participation and collaborative governance as well as creating employment opportunities in new sectors in the city.

Climate communication will be a collaborative effort involving the Turku City Group and collaboration partners. The objective is to consolidate the story of Turku as a nature and climate city that combines climate and circular economy solutions. Different communication channels will be used in a varied ways to reach all target groups. In addition to our Climate website one example is the annual Climate Forum, with content such as: presenting the main results of climate action and new openings, acknowledging praiseworthy actions and operators. We also hold dialogues with different target groups and partners to investigate what kinds of activities, participation and communication they would like to see in climate, nature and circular economy work, and then plan the next steps and actions together.

Communication will also be actively delivered regionally, nationally and internationally in different networks, where experiences of climate work are shared and climate solutions are developed in collaboration. The various target groups need to be provided with opportunities to participate in climate action, and we need to deliver communication that enhances participation. The climate plan is made available in both in Finnish and Swedish as well as in English. Turku also follows the European Accessibility Act so that digital services provided by the city would be easily accessible to all.

Opportunities to participate in climate action will involve the following:

## Residents

Encouraging residents to adopt a climate-friendly 1.5-degree lifestyle and creating the prerequisites for it through the Turku City Group's own climate measures and communication. City also has in use participatory platform such as "voice your opinion" Voice Your Opinion - Kerrokantasi (turku.fi) and participatory budgeting to mention few.
Using expertise in climate psychology to develop new and inspiring ways to participate in climate action, also taking into consideration the needs of different demographic groups.
Delivering empowering climate communication, taking into consideration the needs that different demographic groups have in terms of information – in particular, we must take into account that children and adolescents have the right to receive information suitable for their age to alleviate climate anxiety.

## Businesses and communities

Encouraging businesses and communities to join collective climate action through their own climate measures. These are gathered and shared on a platform on the climate-themed Carbon Neutral Turku-webpages.
Developing Turku Climate Team into a strong network that serves communities and businesses, implements and communicates climate, circular economy and nature measures and advances resource wisdom.

## Personnel of the Turku City Group

Communicating opportunities that staff and different units have in terms of climate actions and participating in climate work. Reinforcing ways to participate and creating prerequisites.
Implementing and developing Eco-support activity to help turn collective climate and environment objectives into practice in everyday life at workplaces.

In the NetZeroCities Pilot Cities Programme, Turku implements the 1.5-Degree City -project

The pilot strives to enhance a cross-sectoral climate work where the City Group, companies and citizens come together to achieve a common goal of carbon-neutrality. Goals of the project are to enable the needed systemic change triggering the development of technology, governance and policy, finance and business models. The city of Turku collaborates with the University of Turku to find science-based methods to accelerate climate neutrality through tested and innovative methods.

In practise, in the pilot Turku develops opportunities for residents to engage in climate work, supports companies' low-carbon business by continuing to develop the Climate Team, and creates a Climate Situation Room for Knowledge-Based Governance. The Climate Situation Room is an online platform that will display and monitor the climate work of the city group, companies, and citizens. Platform enables them to act in more systemic and cross-sectoral manner in climate work. Also, carbon footprint and handprint calculations are being developed and tested with companies and citizens.

In collaboration with the University of Turku's Department of Psychology behavioral science's know-how and "nudging" -method are applied to the work. The project encourages residents towards a climate-friendly life of 1.5 degrees with the help of dialogues, empowering climate-communications campaign, and a network of climate ambassadors, which consists of various role models from Turku that residents can relate with. Also, sustainable free-time mobility will be piloted with citizens. At the same time, the project supports the goals of climate communication and engagement that are all part of Turku's climate plan to get everyone involved in climate work.

Turku Student Village will be turned into an energy positive pilot area by year 2025 with the help of the EU Horizon funded RESPONSE project. Experience gained from the project's energy positive operating model will be utilised and applied, where possible, to other city districts in collaboration with the Turku City Group. One of the innovative elements applied in RESPONSE project is peer mentoring method. It comprises of a training of a group of voluntary mentors, who are all also residents of the positive energy district (PED) area. The aim is to better reach residents, increase their awareness and bring forth their insight from their own perspective. As residents of the PED area, the peer mentors have first-hand experience of the life in the Student Village.

# 1 Introduction

Explain your city's motivation to join the EU Mission “100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030” and highlight your city's present commitments to climate action. You may also want to include the aims of this document.

## Your text

Turku has been actively following and contributing to the preparation of the EU Mission “100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities” during the past years, and we are excited to be among the selected 100 mission cities. The City Board unanimously decided 7 December 2021 that Turku will participate in the Cities Mission. As a frontrunner city to develop the Climate City Contract, Turku would like to show leadership in climate action, receive support to reach our targets and share success with other cities and Europe in implementing the Paris Agreement.

The city of Turku has committed to reach climate neutrality by 2029 when the city celebrates its 800th anniversary, and to become one of the first climate-positive urban areas after 2029. This target was unanimously decided by the City Council 11 June 2018 § 142.

Turku’s Climate Plan 2029 follows the EU SECAP model and the progress is reported annually. The climate plan has been developed and is being implemented together with all societal actors: the city units, citizens and civil society, companies and academia. Turku challenges all stakeholder organizations to make a climate pledge and join Turku’s Climate Team community which has already over 120 members. In all climate work Turku relies on the most recent research data. The Climate Plan of Turku is updated each council term and the results of climate work are monitored annually with agreed practices put in place. Relevant EU, regional and national regulations are therefore monitored and taken into account in climate work when needed. Active collaboration with both national and international stakeholder groups strengthens the links between climate work and relevant policies.

The work has been successful: we have managed to reduce the GHG emissions already by 56 % from the baseline year 1990, while the city and the economy has grown. The climate plan was revised and once again unanimously approved by the City Council on 16 May 2022 § 103. The aim of the revised climate plan is to further strengthen the actions and to reduce the emissions together with the stakeholders. By 2025, emissions will be reduced by at least 75 per cent compared to the level in 1990. By 2029, emissions will be reduced by at least 90 per cent compared to the level in 1990 and any remaining emissions left will be entirely compensated (10 % of 1990 level at most).

The updated climate plan also engages citizens and stakeholders stronger in the climate work and puts emphasis on co-creating new climate solutions. The Mission is expected to support Turku in implementing the plan.

From 2029 onwards, Turku strives to be a climate positive area with negative net emissions. To achieve these goals Turku has decided (City Board 1.6.2020) to develop a local compensation model which aims at increasing carbon sinks in the area. Both nature-based and technological solutions will be considered.

In addition to reducing emissions in the Turku region, we also aim to reduce consumption-related emissions outside the area and to offer good climate solutions that can be used in an area wider than Turku. In line with Turku’s Mayor’s Program and the City Strategy, the city works also to strengthen biodiversity and advance the transition to circular economy.

The selection as part of the EU Mission will further strengthen Turku’s climate work and will provide new opportunities for the stakeholders in the Turku region to participate in European projects. The Mission will also support citizens’ and stakeholders’ opportunities to participate and influence.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Articulate your 2030 climate neutrality ambition, as expressed and defined in your Cities Mission Expression of Interest (EoI). This should include your ambition and commitment to a 2030 horizon as a whole city, as well as describe any exclusion areas and summarise how these areas would be addressed beyond 2030. (A more detailed plan for exclusion areas should be included in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.) Your 2030 ambition should be supported at a minimum by a Council decision, and it is recommended that it is also supported by a wider stakeholder group. We also recommend you list other co-benefits you aim to achieve when working towards the climate neutrality goal, like well-being, health, equity, justice, financial savings.

## Your text

Turku aims to become climate neutral in 2029 by the time the city turns 800 years old. From there on, Turku will be part of the world's first climate positive urban areas with net negative emissions. This target was unanimously decided by the City Council 11 June 2018 § 142, and the revised climate plan with even more ambitious climate goals on 16 May 2022 § 103. Our commitment to sustainability is very strong as it increases the competitiveness, improves the living surroundings and the quality of life. The 2029 climate neutrality goal covers the entire administrative area.

We are aiming at net-zero GHG emissions by 2029. By 2029 emissions will be reduced by at least 90 per cent compared to the level of 1990. Sectors, in which residual emissions cannot be fully adapted by 2029 are expected to be transport and stationary energy. Any remaining emissions left will be entirely compensated (10 % of 1990 level at most).

Increasing the carbon absorption capacity of vegetation and soil has been considered most affordable in terms of costs and it also has other significant positive effects. Turku has already updated the city's forest plan and increased the carbon sink of forests owned by the City of Turku. The City Board has also decided to introduce a local compensation model aiming at activating private landowners and companies to create carbon sinks. Both nature-based and technological solutions will be considered. These greening measures will also have several co-benefits for health and well-being of citizens as well as provide tools for adaptation to climate change.

City of Turku and the local stakeholders also see ambitious Climate Action as the basis for future livelihood and success of the whole area, including its businesses, universities and the whole innovation system. Thereby, our Climate Action is about a better future both locally in Turku and globally – and we aim at solutions and competencies that can be created in Turku and shared with cities in Europe and other parts of the world, in order to build a green low-carbon future together.

The national commitment of Finland is currently prepared, and it will be attached to Turku's contract by 13.10.2023.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

This is the core section of the Commitments document that should summarise at least 3 or 4 systemic strategic priorities that need to be implemented for your city to become climate neutral by 2030. These should be meaningful changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in your city, like decarbonising the heating system in the city or generating 100% energy from renewables. The individual commitments between your city and other stakeholders should address these key priorities and contribute to reaching them. The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan should describe all interventions, including those to reach your priorities as well as all further actions, in detail and describe how your city plans to implement them.

A carbon neutral energy system accounting for around 50% of current GHG emissions in Turku (2020). The heat, cold, steam and electricity used in the Turku area will be produced in a carbon neutral manner at the latest in 2029 (considering compensations). Progress: The share of renewable energy of district heating was 79.6% already in 2020. The share of renewable energy of electricity sold by Turku Energia was 90.5%.

Interventions:

Turku City Group develops the production and ownership of renewable energy in a way that the production serves an area wider than Turku and helps to turn Turku into a climate positive area.
Smart management and optimization of energy systems: Comprehensive energy system integration increases the availability of renewable energy, distribution flexibility and end-consumption efficiency. Energy systems are managed in their entirety by leveraging cooperation among actors in the field. Smart optimization and control enable energy efficiency across sectoral boundaries. Multidirectional, storing of energy and energy demand elasticities support better management of variabilities.
Utilizing waste heat regionally: Waste heat will be systematically recovered and reused to increase the efficiency of energy systems in Turku and reduce the need for additional thermal energy production. Heating networks will be diversified (low temperature, multidirectional, intelligent), making it easier to use waste heat. Thermal energy is stored locally and automation supports the smooth utilization of heat as quickly as possible and close to the source.
Facilitating cooperation with companies and citizens to optimize energy use: Residents and communities in the Turku region will have a better understanding of how their choices affect energy consumption. Communities play an active role in saving energy and investing in renewable energy solutions. Residents are offered comprehensive services and assistance to support this shift, from advisory services to equipment delivery, maintenance and financing.

Low carbon sustainable mobility which is currently approximately 25% of GHG emissions in the Turku area (2020). The share of walking, cycling and public transport will be increased through active measures. Developing public transport and increasing its use is important for reducing emissions from mobility. At the same time, reducing emissions from growing public transport is a significant and exemplary climate measure. Public transport in Turku will be turned into a carbon neutral service by 2029. In terms of urban traffic carbon neutrality will be reached already by 2025. Electrification of public transport is ongoing and one third of public transport is already operated by e-busses, covering around half of all the passenger journeys.

Interventions:

Reducing the need to move and prioritizing active mobility: The city will be designed for walkability. Public services and leisure activities can be reached through active mobility, which leads to healthier residents and a more livable city overall.
Making shared mobility the new normal: Shared vehicles complement the options available for resource-wise mobility. The transition from private to shared mobility will be easy and economically attractive because high-quality, competitive options and services that combine different modes of transport will be easily available to all Turku residents.
Supporting resource-wise logistics: Urban logistics will be emission free. Turku's transport procurement will be emission and noise free. Buyers of logistics services prioritize low-emission and resource-wise logistics solutions. The use of new logistics transport technologies that support efficiency will be easier and more common.

Sustainable urban structure affects both energy and mobility in the entire urban area. Sustainable urban structure has a positive impact on low emission energy and low emission mobility in the entire functional urban region. At the level of Turku urban region, the sustainable development of community structure is steered and advanced through the regional structural model (the Structural Model 2035 for the Turku Urban Region) and the MAL agreement (concerning land use, housing and transport planning) and programs, transport system work and transport system plan in collaboration with regional municipalities and the national government.

Turku City Group sets an example and creates the story of a carbon neutral Turku together. By acting responsibly, the City of Turku and Turku City Group's subsidiaries can significantly reduce the direct and indirect GHG emissions from their operation, demonstrate climate leadership and set an example. Simultaneously, they develop their operation, implement the Turku strategy and values, and create the story of a carbon neutral Turku together.

Strengthening carbon sinks by increasing the ability of the Turku area and region to absorb atmospheric carbon. Strengthening carbon sinks that absorb atmospheric carbon is a significant climate change mitigation measure. Without tree felling, the carbon absorption of forests in Turku already compensates for passenger car emissions in the Turku area. Increasing the carbon absorption capacity of vegetation and soil is affordable in terms of costs and it also has other significant positive effects. Turku also focusses strongly on biodiversity protection and nature-based solutions and aims to be a world's leading nature cities by 2030.

Interventions

Turku has already drawn up a forest plan for the years 2019-2029. The plan takes into account the fact that forests act as carbon sinks – and that they act as a site for recreational activity and significantly improve the well-being of the citizens and biodiversity. The forests are managed according to the principles of continuous cover forestry and no more than 40 per cent of the annual new growth is cut down. The plan covers 4,300 hectares forests owned by the City of Turku.

The City Board has decided to introduce a local compensation model aiming at activating private landowners and companies to create carbon sinks. Both nature-based and technological solutions will be considered.

Increasing awareness of the risks of, and vulnerabilities to climate change and planning and implementing measures to prepare for change.

Reinforcing such research, training and innovation activities in higher education institutions in Turku that help create climate and circular economy solutions. Enhancing climate expertise at all levels of education.

The city's actions stated above can reduce around half of the emissions, however the closer we get to the target, the more important becomes the role of citizens, private sector and national (e.g. transport) policies. Turku aims to engage all citizens and stakeholders in our journey to climate neutrality. Turku already puts lots of effort in engaging companies and organizations to make voluntary pledges and propose climate solutions which are registered and showcased on a public platform. The city and its subsidiaries encourage citizens to lead the 1.5 degree lifestyle by enabling sustainable choices and providing information e.g. on mobility, eating, consumption and energy and water usage. Turku tackles the scope 3 emissions by advancing transition to circular economy to achieve resource wisdom and co-creating solutions together with the companies, academia and citizens. Turku has also been piloting city level Scope 3 emission calculation including consumption-based carbon footprint.

Interventions:

Turku's goal for 2029 is to improve the resource wisdom of food systems "from farm to fork" in collaboration with different actors and consumers. Primary objectives include balancing

and closing nutrient cycles, strengthening markets for resource-wise food and shortening value chains. Ultimately, the city aims to reconnect consumers to food production in various ways, including through educational institutions and urban farms.

Turku's resource wisdom objectives for 2029 are to strengthen regional water systems cooperation in order to improve management of urban runoff, increase water reuse and recycling, and improve nutrient management. To achieve these objectives, Turku plans to intervene along the water lifecycle and link circular water solutions to climate resilience.
Turku's 2029 resource wisdom objective is to ensure that buildings, building materials, urban space and infrastructure are used and maintained in a versatile and multifunctional manner. In addition, the city aims to ensure that sufficient resources are available to monitor the embodied carbon and resource footprint of buildings, which would help ensure new construction design supports resource wisdom across the lifecycle.

# 4 Principles and process

Highlight the key principles that will guide your city as it implements its Climate City Contract, like accountability, transparency, or an open attitude to new approaches. The process should encompass principles like co-creation, innovation, multi-actor and citizen engagement, and should be systemic and demand-driven in nature. It should also be based on monitoring and joint learning. The Commitments Guidance document provides more specific guidance on how integrate these principles into your own process.

### Building a strong mandate and close monitoring of the process

Turku's advantage is that the climate work has been started early and there is strong political support for climate action. The Climate Plan has been approved by Turku City Council as a binding document for the city group including subsidiaries. The implementation has been integrated into normal management procedures and is monitored by Turku City Council and City Board. The City Board is given a report on the implementation and development of the climate plan once a year as a minimum (in addition to the climate report given to Turku City Council). The attainment of the objectives set for 2021–2025–2029 will be checked each council term in connection with the updating of the climate plan.

The update and review work of the Climate Plan was carried out by a large Climate Coordination Group, which included over 80 experts from the City Group, research institutes, stakeholders and partners. The Climate and Environmental Policy Unit coordinated the work with additional support from outsourced experts. The Climate Coordination Group is a significant gatherer of information and know-how, and therefore its activities have been continued even after the update work was completed to support climate work.

The Climate and Environment Policy Unit under the Mayor at the Central Administration with dedicated team of 10 persons is responsible for coordination of the climate work. In everyday work the team is supplemented by several decentralized experts in the fields of mobility, energy, finance, business, communications, EU policy, projects etc.

As outlined in the Mayor's programme 2021–2025, Turku will take and has successfully taken climate budgeting into use at the beginning of 2023. The climate targets have been taken into account especially in decision-making concerning land use, energy, construction and mobility and extensive training on EU taxonomy has been offered to these units. Where possible, the EU taxonomy will be taken into consideration when making investments, so that green funding can also be utilised. In investments and procurement, the City of Turku will seek to promote circular economy solutions and reduce consumption of natural resources.

Climate investments /climate budget is managed as part of the city's annual budget and planning. By 2029, the Turku Group will implement the largest investment program in its history (around two and a half billion euros), the effectiveness of which is crucial for the realization of carbon neutrality and the progress of the circular economy. In the Vähähiilinen kiertotalouskaupunki (VÄKI) project, climate budgeting is developed as a tool for the preparation, guidance and monitoring of the City Group's investment program, combining the implementation of climate goals and the circular economy.

The actions and investments of the city group will be updated annually as part of the yearly action and financial planning of the city. This process will utilize the regular administrative structures and processes of the city / city group governance plus will benefit from the support and insight from Climate Coordination Group.

The city has benefited from the shared European Covenant of Mayors methodology (member since 2010) and has more than halved the GHG emission from the level of 1990. The greenhouse gas emissions of Turku are calculated annually, using the local calculation method of the CO2 report, as part of the monitoring of the implementation of the city strategy and climate plan. The emissions are reported every other year to the shared European system using the SECAP method, where emission data based on the CO2 report is adjusted to meet the reporting requirements of the Covenant of Mayors. In line with the UN's requirements, the emissions are also reported annually through the global CDP (Disclosure Insight Action) system. The emissions calculation in Turku is in accordance with the UN global calculation protocol for cities.

# Climate City Contract accelerating the city's climate ambition

The Climate City Contract evaluation process will be carried out jointly with the City of Turku Climate Plan 2029 evaluation and updating. The monitoring and review process will then follow the same steps and the Climate City Contract will be revised and updated throughfully together with the Climate Plan 2029, every council term. Next update process will begin late 2024 and be ready by spring 2025. Also the development of climate budgeting and investment as part of the city's annual financial planning will give tools for evaluating, steering and monitoring of the implementation of climate goals on annual basis, in addition to the annual greenhouse gas calculation monitoring.

As part of the Climate City Contract (CCC) we are stepping up our climate actions and have included a large number of partners as signatories, committing to the shared goals and their respective climate actions (incl. Investments). Through the CCC we are also bringing more firmly existing policies and strategies together, such as climate plan and climate budgeting to enable more transparent, informative and cross-cutting interventions in the climate work.

As a result of Climate City Contract, the Finnish Mission cities have further deepened cooperation to find solutions to the shared challenges, such as reaching low carbon sustainable mobility and developing digital platforms for real-time data to enable good knowledge-based governance.

# Collaboration as the basis for finding new approaches and innovations

Turku aims to be carbon neutral by 2029 and climate positive from then onwards. 2029 is also a year when Turku will be 800 years old. A sustainable gift for the city would be attaining carbon neutrality.

The goal and its accompanying Climate Plan and Climate City Contract are bold and exemplary. The thrust is to inspire, encourage and support climate actions from all areas of the society - individuals, companies, city units, groups, businesses, civil society and so on. The plan was developed and is being implemented with the continuous input of all societal stakeholders and the Climate City Contract will support, enforce and raise the ambition of all relevant stakeholders even higher.

Climate solutions are actively developed in collaboration with other municipalities, areas and partners in regional, national and international collaboration as well as in projects and networks.

Turku has supportive and skilled local R&amp;I community contributing to the implementation of the climate plan. Turku has 2 universities, 4 universities of applied sciences and around 40 000 students. Universities have strong research and education programs focusing on sustainable development, climate science, clean tech and circular economy. Turku is a growing city and its economic sectors need new highly skilled workforce that can answer the megatrends of the future.

Turku University of Applied Sciences is owned by the city of Turku (91%) and cooperation is a natural part of our everyday operations. Most recently our joint focus has been in smart urban development, climate issues and technology.

The City of Turku collaborates closely also with other universities to incorporate academic insights into strategic development and decision-making. A unique collaboration platform is the Turku Urban Research Programme, a joint initiative between the City of Turku, the University of Turku, and Åbo Akademi University.

City of Turku collaborates actively and has been a partner in many projects together with national research institutes incl. Natural Resources Institute Finland, Finnish Environment Institute and Finnish Meteorological Institute. Recent example of collaboration is the Canemure project (https://www.hiilineutraalisuomi.fi/en-US/Canemure). City of Turku has also been contributing to RI supporting EU policy, e.g. assessment of spatial representativeness of air quality monitoring sites (JRC108791).

Turku was recognized as the world's 7th smartest city in the Future Today Institute's annual Tech trends report in 2019 and the leading city in Finland. Since 2018 Smart and Wise Turku has been one of the city's spearhead projects that has combined the strategic goal of carbon neutrality in 2029 with the Smart City concept. In addition, a joint strategy for sustainable urban development of the six largest cities in Finland (6Aika) and its projects have done extensive work towards smarter, more open and inherently human-centric cities. Abundant 4G and soon 5G network has been developed in partnership with Elisa teleoperator. Turku's new digital and data strategy is under development. It aims to advance further the knowledge-based decision-making and development of citizen and customer-oriented services. Turku has developed the city's own communication platforms to raise climate awareness, but in order to reach wide dissemination further and constant work needs to be done.

Turku is the host for Union of the Baltic Cities Sustainable Cities Commission and active member in Eurocities and ICLEI (Mayor of Turku as Vice Chair of the European Regional Executive Committee and Vice-President in the global Presidium). Turku has been involved in city twinning projects within Europe and beyond, recently e.g. CoM Twinning Programme with Bologna, Green City Accord peer-learning programme with several European cities and IURC-EU-Japan cooperation with Nagano and Obuse. In addition, Turku has been involved in numerous international projects. Within country borders Turku is an active member in several networks, e.g. HINKU (https://www.hiilineutraalisuomi.fi/en-US/Hinku), FISU (https://www.fisunetwork.fi/en-US/About_Fisu) and Six largest cities in Finland -network (https://6aika.fi/en/six-cities/).

In the Ilmastokaupunki's Hiilineutraalit Klusterit project (IKLU), cluster-specific cooperation was developed to promote emission reductions and strengthen low-carbon business in the companies and value chains of the top Health, Maritime, and Experience clusters in the region. In the project, the actors of the clusters were brought together and in the project they jointly communicated the climate work of the cluster companies, such as Bayer's achievement of carbon neutrality in 2022, the production of the carbon-negative movie 'Odotus' (Waiting), and the goals of Meyer's Turku carbon-neutral shipyard and cruise ship.

Participation of private sector in reaching the climate neutrality is crucial. Turku encourages all companies and organisations to join the city's "Climate team" by making a climate pledge. The climate actions are reported on the Carbon neutral Turku website and given visibility in the city's

communication channels. The Team includes already over 120 organisations. E.g. Turku Group subsidiaries' (energy, public transport, water) investments have big impact on GHG reductions.

Implemented examples include local energy companies' Turku Energia's and Turun Seudun Energiatuotanto's over 500 M€ investments in energy transition in 2014-2023, and the energy positive wastewater treatment company, Kakolanmäki Wastewater Treatment Plant. The share of renewable energy of district heating was 79.6% already in 2020. The share of renewable energy of electricity sold by Turku Energia was 90.5%. The utility companies are also participating in Turku's 1,5 degree life campaign engaging citizens to lead sustainable lifestyles.

In terms of the Turku City Group's own buildings, new and innovative energy solutions will be actively sought. The level of ambition for new solutions is very high, and innovative solutions for the identified challenges will be sought through collaboration and by piloting. For example, Turku Student Village will be turned into an energy positive pilot area by year 2025 with the help of the EU Horizon funded RESPONSE project. Experience gained from the project's energy positive operating model will be utilised and applied, where possible, to other city districts in collaboration with the Turku City Group. One of the innovative elements applied in RESPONSE project is peer mentoring method. It comprises of a training of a group of voluntary mentors, who are all also residents of the positive energy district (PED) area. The aim is to better reach residents, increase their awareness and bring forth their insight from their own perspective. As residents of the PED area, the peer mentors have first-hand experience of the life in the Student Village.

# In the NetZeroCities Pilot Cities Programme, Turku implements the 1.5-Degree City -project

The pilot strives to enhance a cross-sectoral climate work where the City Group, companies and citizens come together to achieve a common goal of carbon-neutrality. Goals of the project are to enable the needed systemic change triggering the development of technology, governance and policy, finance and business models. The city of Turku collaborates with the University of Turku to find science-based methods to accelerate climate neutrality through tested and innovative methods.

In practise, in the pilot develops opportunities for residents to engage in climate work, supports companies' low-carbon business by continuing to develop the Climate Team, and creates a Climate Situation Room for Knowledge-Based Governance. The Climate Situation Room is an online platform that will display and monitor the climate work of the city group, companies, and citizens. Platform enables them to act in more systemic and cross-sectoral manner in climate work. Also, carbon footprint and handprint calculations are developed and tested with companies and citizens.

In collaboration with the University of Turku's Department of Psychology behavioral science's know-how and "nudging" -method are applied to the work. The project encourages residents towards a climate-friendly life of 1.5 degrees with the help of dialogues, empowering climate-communications campaign, and a network of climate ambassadors, which consists of various role models from Turku that residents can relate with. Also, sustainable free-time mobility will be piloted with citizens. At the same time, the project supports the goals of climate communication and engagement that are all part of Turku's climate plan to get everyone involved in climate work.

The Pilot Cities Programme will also offer the opportunity to share learnings with other cities, building on each other's experiences, replicating and scaling solutions that work in similar contexts. This will ultimately lead to an accelerated transition towards climate neutrality across Europe.

# Climate work is open to all, and Turku encourages everyone to join in

Turku implements continuous open climate action where the Turku City Group is constantly planning, implementing and monitoring climate measures. Collective climate action is actively open to climate measures of businesses and communities, involvement by citizens, and development of new solutions in collaboration.

Also, as a central part of Circular Turku Roadmap (approved by the City Board on November 22, 2021), we aim to ensure an equitable transition by rethinking how goods and services are accessed

in the city, offering new means for participation and collaborative governance as well as creating employment opportunities in new sectors in the city.

Creating and telling our shared story of a carbon-neutral Turku requires that the entire city organisation as well as local businesses and residents are aware of the climate objectives and the measures needed to reach them. It's also important for everyone to be aware of how they can take part in climate action.

Climate communication will be a collaborative effort involving the Turku City Group and collaboration partners. The objective is to consolidate the story of Turku as a nature and climate city that combines climate and circular economy solutions. Different communication channels will be used in a varied way to reach all target groups. In addition to our Climate website one example is the annual Climate Forum, with content such as: presenting the main results of climate action and new openings, acknowledging praiseworthy actions and operators. We also hold dialogues with different target groups and partners to investigate what kinds of activities, participation and communication they would like to see in climate, nature and circular economy work, and then plan the next steps and actions together.

Communication will also be actively delivered regionally, nationally and internationally in different networks, where experiences of climate work are shared and climate solutions are developed.

The various target groups need to be provided with opportunities to participate in climate action, and we need to deliver communication that enhances participation. The climate plan is made available in both in Finnish and Swedish as well as in English. Turku also follows the European Accessibility Act so that digital services provided by the city would be easily accessible to all.

Opportunities to participate in climate action will involve the following:

## Residents

Encouraging residents to adopt a climate-friendly 1.5-degree lifestyle and creating the prerequisites for it through the Turku City Group's own climate measures and communication.
Using expertise in climate psychology to develop new and inspiring ways to participate in climate action, also taking into consideration the needs of different demographic groups.
Delivering empowering climate communication, taking into consideration the needs that different demographic groups have in terms of information – in particular, we must take into account that children and adolescents have the right to receive information suitable for their age to alleviate climate anxiety.

## Businesses and communities

Encouraging businesses and communities to join collective climate action through their own climate measures. These are gathered and shared on a platform on the climate-themed Carbon Neutral Turku-webpages.
Developing Turku Climate Team into a strong network that serves communities and businesses, implements and communicates climate, circular economy and nature measures and advances resource wisdom.

## Personnel of the Turku City Group

Communicating opportunities that staff and different units have in terms of climate actions and participating in climate work. Reinforcing ways to participate and creating prerequisites.
Implementing and developing Eco-support activity to help turn collective climate and environment objectives into practice in everyday life at workplaces.
