Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

The action plan of Lahti is based on the Climate Programme of Lahti, which was updated in 2023. Lahti aims to be climate- neutral for scope 1 emissions already by 2025 as intermediate step towards the Mission goal in 2030. Our approach covers sectors of climate governance, energy, transport, circular economy and sustainable consumption, carbon sinks and compensation as well as climate adaptation.

The Action Plan is developed jointly with wide group of experts in the city organisation and city's daughter companies, local authorities, local businesses and other stakeholders. Many of the stakeholders have signed the commitment and are responsible for actions in the portfolio.

Based on the emission inventories we have identified that the national policies and already secured local actions have significant impact but an emission gap of 82,9 kt CO₂ ekv remains to be filled by 2030. The biggest emission gap is in buildings but most challenging to cut are the emissions from road traffic. Hence, key priorities that we will focus on in the coming years are cutting the emissions of transport and further decarbonising the energy system. Challenges in these sectors require a systemic change not only from the city and other levels of governance but also behavioural change from citizens and strong participation of the private sector towards more sustainable consumption.

General systemic barriers for climate-neutrality were identified in climate governance, financing and behavioural change. Especially for transport the list of barriers to overcome is long and requires wide collaboration across levels of governance and participation of citizens. In buildings sector some actions in district heating, such as electrification and carbon capture can have huge impact in emissions. In road transport the emissions are scattered for vehicle and road types and a portfolio of actions is needed utilising different levers to enable a modal shift towards sustainable mobility and to accelerate the shift to electrification and low-emission fuels.

In Lahti emission inventories and monitoring of progress in climate actions is embedded in the city's annual reporting cycle. Similarly, the updating of the Climate Programme will be tide to financial planning to secure financing of all actions. The Action Plan will be updated in two years cycles.

# 1 Introduction

The introduction should outline the local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and describe the gap it is addressing in broad terms.

# Introduction

Lahti is a mid-size city with ca. 120 000 inhabitants located in inland Southern Finland, making it the 9th biggest city in Finland. The city area covers 135 km² with most inhabitants living within 5 km from the city center. Eastern parts of the municipality are mostly forest and farming land with large water bodies around the city area (see Annex 1 - Map of the city of Lahti). Since the 1950s the city grew significantly around increasing industry. The fast industrialisation did not happen without costs to local environment and since the 1970s the city has worked hard to take care of its environment with all stakeholders involved. As proof of Lahti's significant efforts in climate and environmental work, we were appointed as the European Green Capital for 2021.

Lahti has for long been the frontrunner in climate work among European cities, and climate-neutrality became a goal in the city strategy of Lahti in 2009 when the first emission reduction targets were placed. To highlight the importance of carbon-neutrality and ensure its realization in best possible way, it is integrated to other strategic goals of Lahti, such as vitality, public health, and biodiversity conservation through strong cross-sectoral programme work. The European Green Capital Year 2021 left a strong political legacy for the work ahead and has already proven that ambitious climate politics can attract new business, increase the vitality of the city, and improve the quality of life.

In October 2021 the newly elected city council confirmed our goal to be carbon neutral already by 2025 as the first big city in Finland. The target is based on production-based emissions accounted mainly in scope 1 (Greenhouse Gas Protocol). The city of Lahti has three official climate-related main targets, that cover all three scopes defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol:

City's own target: Carbon neutral by 2025, with 80% decrease in production-based emissions compared to 1990 and binding the remaining 20% to carbon sinks and compensation. In absolute terms, the target for 2025 is 216 kt CO2e (mainly scope 1).
As part of the national HINKU network (Towards Carbon Neutral Municipalities) Lahti targets to cut its use-based emissions by 80% by 2030 compared to 2007 levels (scopes 1 and 2).
Reducing consumption-based emissions by 50% by 2030, compared to 2005, as defined in the targets of Fisu network (Finnish Sustainable Communities) (scopes 1, 2 and 3).

The timeline for the three targets is shown in Figure 1.

To this date we have already cut our production-based scope 1 emissions by 64% since 1990. The most efficient emission reductions since 1990 have come from Lahti Energy abandoning the use of charcoal in the production of district heating in 2019. The most challenging sector, where emission rates have remained similar for decades is road transport. In 2021 almost half of Lahti's production-based emissions came from this sector. Current scenarios predict that climate-neutrality in scope 1 will not be reached until in 2026 or 2027. Although the original, very ambitious aim of meeting the target by 2025 may not be fulfilled, Lahti will still be the first big Finnish city to reach its own climate-neutrality target.

The scope 1 climate-neutrality target 2025 of Lahti does not exactly meet the Mission guidelines, but we can see it as an important milestone towards more ambitious targets. The target also includes a goal and plan for offsetting the residual emissions. We are also on a good way towards the Mission target 2030 and by 2021 have cut scope 1 and 2 emissions by 52%. In the CCC documents we use 1990 as the baseline and the latest emission data from 2021 as an intermediate check point towards climate neutrality. For our third target around consumption based emissions we have started regular emission inventories to better understand the material flows to and from the city to identify actions with most impacts. The ambition of Lahti goes beyond our current targets and year 2030 and we are in the middle of a process to define more ambitious climate and nature targets for the city. We will be ready to update our ambition in the updating cycles of the CCC.

Given our long journey as a climate pioneer, the lowest hanging fruits have already been picked and we are moving towards a more holistic approach and systemic change. Joining the EU mission “100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030” and developing this Climate City Contract gives Lahti a remarkable push towards these aims. It gives us more tools for tackling the most challenging remaining emission that still need to be reduced to reach climate-neutrality, while simultaneously creating new collaboration possibilities with local businesses, academia, and citizens. The key priorities that we will focus on in the coming years are cutting the emissions of traffic and further decarbonising the energy system. Challenges in these sectors require a systemic change not only from the city and other levels of governance but also behavioural change from citizens and strong participation of the private sector towards more sustainable consumption.

Lahti Climate Program sets 96 actions holistically across all three emissions scopes and six thematic topics towards climate neutrality. Each of the six thematic topics: climate governance, energy, transport, circular economy and sustainable consumption, carbon sinks and compensation as well as climate adaptation have more specific sub-targets that lead to sectors specific emission reductions and support systemic change inside and across the thematic topics. The Climate Program was approved by the City Board in June 2023, and the progress is being monitored and actions updated annually. Lahti's Circular Economy Roadmap and Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, which is prepared and updated along the city master plan, compliment the Climate Program. Our climate work has confluences and common targets with the regional programme "Nature Step to Health" and the new project "Lahti Living Lab - Nature Positive Life", which both see climate work as a lever to promote human health and biodiversity.

To reach the climate targets, it is necessary to make considerable investments by the city itself, its daughter companies as well as by other stakeholders such as inhabitants and the private sector. In addition to the city's own typical financial sources, a significant amount of national and EU funding is needed in the path towards net zero. The city of Lahti commits itself to deliver bold climate action that will enable it to achieve the indicated goal on time. This will be done in a fair and just way doing no significant harm and leaving no one behind.

The holistic approach ties the climate work to other strategic goals of the city, such as economic vitality, nature positivity and climate adaptation. Following the guidelines and actions to reach our climate-neutrality goal will bring us also multiple co-benefits, such as well-being and health of citizens. Reducing emissions in traffic will, for instance, lead to enhanced air quality. Similarly, changes in food systems or increased biking and walking can have positive impacts on both health and climate. The city of Lahti is involved in research and development projects regarding planetary lifestyle, which in turn can both have a positive impact on nature, citizens plus reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The city and the strategic partners have identified several co-benefits of climate work that can support the economic vitality of the region such as new possibilities for multistakeholder collaboration, new investments, financing opportunities, support for RDI-sector, new innovations and business opportunities leading to economic sustainability, improved economic competitiveness and employment. This all builds a common trust that Lahti region will succeed and flourish also in the future.

# 2 Work Process

This section should list the working steps carried out, for example along the NZC Climate Transition Map, or related steps planned as well as outline timeline and milestones for future iterations for the continuous development of the Action Plan.

# Work Process - combination of textual and visual elements

The Mission work and preparation of the CCC including the Action Plan was done jointly with the update of the city's Climate Programme. The work was carried out in May between 2022 and August 2023. The update was coordinated by the Environmental Development Unit which is part of city's Economic Development Services. The update process included background analyses and benchmarking of climate programs of reference cities, theme-specific workshops and ideation of measures, evaluation of the effects of measures and preparation of emission scenarios and with the parties responsible for specifying the measures. A total of approx. participated in the update 70 people from the city organization, group companies and local stakeholders. In addition, there were climate experts from Sitowise Oy supporting the process.

Below a process description is given following the climate transition map of NZC.

# Build a Strong Mandate

The city council and city board have given their mandate to climate work in Lahti by accepting the city strategy where climate neutrality was set as a goal, and by accepting the Climate Program that acts as a basis for the Action Plan. During the European Green Capital Year 2021, citizens of Lahti took

surveys regarding climate and environment work. The results showed that our city also has a mandate of our citizens when it comes to climate work.

Our transition team works on two levels as we have a steering group along with a working group of experts. The experts in the working group come from the key city departments of the city of Lahti, and involve people working on environmental policy, urban planning, housing and environment, transport and infrastructure planning. Other experts are invited to join the working group meetings based on the discussed topics. The steering group has members from the management level of the city of Lahti. In addition the largest city-owned companies are represented. We work closely with research institutes, technology sector, and welfare services in terms of low-carbon innovations and enhancing planetary lifestyle in Lahti, and thus have representatives from the universities, Wellbeing services of county Päijät-Häme and Technology Industries of Finland in the steering group.

Also the steering group of the city as well as the City board were regularly updated with the process and provided feedback to the process and substance. In addition the personnel of the unit of Environmental Development were involved in the process to provide feedback and ensure connections to other ongoing projects in sustainability sector such as Climate budgeting, Nature-Step to Health, Circular Economy Roadmap and Master Plan.

## Understand the system

To understand the system, where emissions stem from and where we can act to reduce them, emission inventory for 2021 was done by Sitowise with the CO2 report model. Inventory was done with the same methodology also for years 1990, 2010 and 2015. In addition to the regular inventories background information such as activity data and energy consumption data as well as reports from past and ongoing projects were collected to gain a more detailed understanding especially of the transport sector.

We utilized scenario work to understand how the global and national trends will affect the local emissions in coming years and assessed the emission reduction potential of the already set and secured actions. We also estimate the emission reduction potential and of suggested actions. Cost estimates were provided for most significant suggested actions.

Based on the information available, emission gap was calculated.

## Co-design a Portfolio

For the design of the Action portfolio was the knowledge of internal experts, stakeholders, academics and knowledge from pilot projects was utilized. The process began with thematic workshops were system information was discussed and ideas for actions collected from experts from city departments and daughter companies. Second round of meetings was organized with departments, teams and stakeholders, as they were able to design actions that they could take responsibility for. A second round of thematic workshops was organized with a larger representation from external experts and stakeholders to finalise the impact pathways and list of actions.

Two stakeholder workshops were organized for companies and organisations that could have larger impact emissions in the area. The participants provided feedback for the structure and content of the Commitment and many agreed to sign the contract as a partner of the city.

## Take Action

Our Climate Program lists actions to meet our climate neutrality target, along with a schedule for the realisation of actions. All actions will be taken into the online platform Lahti Environmental Watch (Lahden ympäristövahti). The persons responsible for actions will get notifications from the platform for regular updates on the progress of the actions.

Many of the actions scheduled for 2023-2025 are already ongoing, at least in planning/preparation phase. A big improvement for the preparation will be the introduction of climate budgeting in the

financial planning in 2024. Climate budgeting ensures that the expected investments and other costs will be brought to city budget timely to ensure the implementation in schedule.

The city is actively involved in research and development projects both internationally and with local academic partners LAB and LUT Universities. We collaborate and share ideas with other cities, mainly the other five Finnish EU mission cities and those that are also located in Päijät-Häme region.

Closing the emission gap will require actions, effort, and investments from all the partners involved in the contract. Collaboration between the city of Lahti and its stakeholders covers various aspects from ensuring sufficient labour force and knowledge, sufficient infrastructure, research collaboration. Holistic work of the whole ecosystem built around the actors involved in the cities mission is required for reaching the climate neutrality target. At the same time the holistic approach brings new opportunities for stakeholders and makes Lahti even more attractive for new investments and companies.

# Learn &amp; Reflect

The city of Lahti updates its Climate Program annually, and repeats the inventories for production-based and use-based emissions annually. We continuously monitor the realisation of actions listed in our climate programme and action portfolio via our online Lahti Environmental Watch (Lahden ympäristövahti) system. Our following steps are developing indicators for our actions so that their effects can be followed in an easier and more consistent manner.

Our plan is that the city's climate actions and the required financing are updated annually as part of the city budgeting process.

The transition teams will continue meeting regularly to follow the process and develop new ideas. We are part of many city networks allowing peer-learning from others. Many of the intervention identified in this plan, will enhance the communication and climate governance inside the city but also between stakeholders and different levels of governance. We continue to lead the decision making with knowledge gained from the scientific community and from our own monitoring and are ready to change course accordingly.

# Make it the New Normal

The climate work in Lahti, and the expertise of the local business sector and universities meet in the sectors of carbon neutral construction, circular economy, and low emission traffic. Clusters of local experts are built around these topics. The city provides platforms such as Pippo-Kujala smart-infra industrial estate and the carbon-neutral Ranta-Kartano district and neighboring sport arena where new technologies can be developed and piloted. Smart technologies, digitalisation, innovative and sustainable procurements and promotion of circular economy are among the key methods. Thus, we have a good and solid base for accelerating the change and making it a new normal. Nevertheless, trying to affect people's behaviour is a task with several challenges. The city of Lahti will be working on an interaction plan related to how its own climate work considers the stakeholders of the city, the residents, and the various departments inside the city to reduce the silo-structure in decision-making. The city of Lahti is also planning a project, together with LAB University of Applied Sciences, focusing on how to communicate the challenging actions that are needed for instance in transport sector in a way that they are more acceptable among local politicians and citizens. Communication plays a strong role in making it a new normal and is one channel of collaboration between the parties of this Climate City Contract. It is important to communicate the concrete actions that the parties of the contract make in their own part to show example to those who are not that far along yet with their climate work.

# Further action plan development and iterations

The Action Plan will be updated in two years cycles. In 2025 we hope to have made significant progress in energy and transport sectors. For years 2025-2030 our focus will therefore shift to the

topics of are agriculture forestry and land- use and waste management. We already have a list of action that are prepared and implemented around these topics. Especially AFOLU sector offers possibilities for climate adaptation, biodiversity work and offsetting of residual emissions.

We also continue to follow the progress of the climate work. In Lahti the emission inventories and monitoring of progress in climate actions are embedded in the city's annual reporting cycle. We continue to lead the decision making with knowledge gained from the scientific community and from our own monitoring and are ready to change course accordingly.

For the City of Lahti 1990 is the baseline used for calculating climate neutrality. This is the reference year stated in the city strategy and climate programme. However, in the tables below, mainly 2021 data is presented since this is the latest data available and more detailed than the 1990 data. For now, we handle 2021 data as intermediate datapoint towards climate neutrality. Emissions are calculated with Sitowise's CO2-report model. The model is based on the method used in the Finnish greenhouse gas inventory and therefore in accordance with the IPCC. For the best possible data we use local data sources where possible but for many sectors we rely on national statistics. The system boundary for this inventory is the geographical boundary of the city as presented in Annex 1 – Map of the city of Lahti, following administrative borders of the municipality.

# A-1.4: GHG emissions by source sectors

For the baseline emission inventory we report both 1990 which is the baseline and reference year used and named in the city strategy and 2021 which is the most recent data available.

Emissions are calculated with Sitowise's CO2-report model. The model is based on the method used in the Finnish greenhouse gas inventory and therefore in accordance with the IPCC.

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

## BACKGROUND

For the City of Lahti 1990 is the baseline used for calculating climate neutrality. This is the reference year stated in the city strategy and climate programme. Given that the Mission guidelines indicate the need to use latest available data as the baseline, we present here also the latest data from 2021. Information from year 2021 is also more detailed than the 1990 data. For now, we handle 2021 data as intermediate datapoint towards climate neutrality. For the best possible data we use local data sources where possible but for many sectors we rely on national statistics. The system boundary for this inventory is the geographical boundary of the city as presented in Annex 1 – Map of the City of Lahti, following administrative borders of the municipality.

## EMISSIONS TREND 1990 - 2021

In 1990 the total emission of Lahti were 876,3 kt CO₂e and in the latest calculations of year 2021 the total emissions were 418,2 CO₂e (figure 2). This means that between 1990 and 2021 we have been able to cut the emissions already by 52%. The emissions in Lahti reached their peak in 2010. The number of inhabitants has increased from 16272 in 1990 to 120 027 and the emission per capita have decreased from 6,1 to 3,1 t CO₂e (excluding industry and IPPU).

The change has mainly been due to changes in district heating (-70%) as the city owned energy company Lahti Energia Ltd quit combustion of charcoal in 2019 and has been able to decrease the emissions from combustion of waste and biomass with technical improvements. Also the emissions from separate heating, especially from oil heating have decreased in the past years as the city has been active to motivate industrial and domestic buildings to take energy renovations.

Also the emissions from electricity use have decreased significantly (ca. -60%), which is mostly due to changes in national electricity production.

The strong decrease in the industry emissions between 1990-2021 (-83%) is partly due to the decrease in industrial activities over long term but also due to changes in energy sources and energy efficiency. There are great examples of greening of industry in Lahti area, as companies have developed custom based low emission solutions based on energy efficiency and circular economy. The city owned energy company Lahti Energia Ltd has been an active collaborator and developer for the needs of industry as well.

On the other hand the emissions from transport, especially from road transport have decreased only moderately (-25%) between 1990 and 2021 despite of the ongoing processes to increase the share of sustainable mobility.

## CURRENT EMISSIONS

### Buildings

In 2021 buildings still make up the largest part of the emissions (figure 3). In Finland, a significant part of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions caused by the heating of buildings. In the emission calculations, the sector is divided for electric heating, geothermal heating, district heating and separate heating. Separate heating includes oil, wood and natural gas heating. The heating of buildings is affected by the annually changing heating demand. The heating demand in different years can be compared with the heating demand figure, which is calculated as the difference between daily outdoor and indoor temperatures.

District heating makes up 16% of the total emissions (figure 3). District heating is organised by the city owned company Lahti Energia Ltd. Lahti Energia has two combined heat and power plants (CHPs) using biomass and waste as energy source in combustion and gasification. The calculated
Lahti

O

emissions come from the gasification of waste in Kymijärvi II plant, whereas the combustion of biomass in Kymijärvi III plant is at the moment considered emission free. Lahti Energia has smaller plants producing district heating from gas and oil, which act as a reserve for extreme cold temperature conditions and operate only occasionally. In addition to combustion part of the district heat (16,9 GWh) stems from utilisation of wasteheat in industrial processes and waste waters. The shares of different fuels for 2021 are shown in figure 4.

Emissions from separate heating (16% of total emissions) include public, domestic and industrial buildings that are heated with oil, natural gas or biomass. In separate heating oil is still the most significant emission source in doemstic and industrial buildings. It seems possible to significantly reduce the emission from separate heating since the energy crisis of 2022-2023 with high energy prices and problems with availability of fuels.

## Electricity

Electricity use makes another 16% of the total emissions (figure 3). The emissions are calculated based on the average emission factor of the national grid supplied electricity. Emission factor of electricity consumption varies every year depending on, among other things the proportions of fuels used in the country, the availability of hydropower, the situation of the emissions trading market, imports and exports. From 2014 the emission factors has decreased from 131 to 74 t CO₂e/GWh in 2021. In terms of electricity production climate neutrality means more focus on renewable forms of energy, such as wind, water and solar power.

Lahti Energia produces electricity as a side product of district heating in its CHP plants but the company also owns significant portions of electricity production outside of Lahti area which is sold to the national grid. 93% of all electricity production owned by the company is fossil free (hydro, wind and nuclear power).

## Transport

The single largest emission sector is the road transport, which alone covers 37% of total emissions (figure 3). The emissions from waterborne traffic and railways are minor and the city has little impact on them, given that the rail traffic is operated by a state owned company and is electrified.

The detailed data and driving performance shows that 65% of the road traffic emissions stem from the roads that are not directly administrated or maintained by the city it self bu instead by the national road infrastructure agency. 60% of these emissions stem from the vehicles passing through the city area (CO2-report 2023).

% of the road traffic emissions are from passenger cars (roads and streets, figure 5). In the region of Päijät-Häme the electrification rate is still relatively low as only 16% of new vehicles are fully electric (compared to capital region where the ratio is 19%, Source: Traficom). Also the share of sustainable mobility in the region has remained low, and 71% of all journies are made with passenger cars (figure 6). Truck traffic on the roads is another important emission source (28% of road transport emissions, figure 5) since one of the main highways of the country passes through Lahti.

## IPPU

Industry and machinery covers direct scope 1 emissions from industry and machinery. This sector covers 5% of total emissions. The industrial emissions come from instance from industrial processes which require energy sources such as oil or natural gas. The machinery part includes also off-road vehicles and machines used for instance in agriculture, forestry and construction, mainly running on oil.

## Waste

The emissions from waste sector make up 2% of the total emissions. Waste management emissions consist of solid waste landfill disposal, plant composting and wastewater treatment. The emissions stem from waste management from the regional waste management center Salpakierto which is located in Lahti. The emissions from Salpakierto are calculated in only for the proportion of Lahti's
Lahti

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

inhabitants (51 % of the region). Currently 99% of all waste in Lahti are sorted and only 1% of ends up in landfill. The methane emissions can be further reduced by promoting organic waste.

# AFOLU

Agricultural emissions are caused by animal digestion, animal manure and arable farming. The most significant emission sources from agriculture are into the soil caused by the nitrogen added as fertilizer and the digestion of farm animals effluent. However, agriculture causes only minor part of the Scope 1 emissions in Lahti and the city has very little power to influence the production and emissions caused.

Land use in larger picture is important for the carbon balance of the city area through the LULUCF sector. Forestry is an important source of livelihood for the land owners of the region. The city owns only small part of the forest and its forests are already sustainably maintained and there are no financial profit expectations for the forests of the city organisation.

We have spatial inventories of the carbon sinks of the vegetation, carbon stocks of vegetation and soil, as well as emissions from soil of the city area from 2019 and 2021, but the results vary significantly from each others making them an unreliable data source. We have initiated a national support project (Kuntanielu 2022-2024) where the aim is to find a standardised way to measure the LULUCF emissions and sinks for all Finnish municipalities. We also collaborate with academic partners and consultancies to understand the importance of urban green in general and the impact of the land-use decisions of the spatial planning department of the city. We have plenty of actions devoted to the topic in our Climate programme under the topic Carbon sinks and compensation and aim and our goal is to have reliable inventory data by 2025.

# GHG DATA

Data presented in tables A-1.1 – A-1.4. originates from CO2 report 2023, an emission report that the consultant company Sitowise produces specifically for municipalities need annually. The methodology for CO2 report follows that of the national greenhouse gas inventory and IPCC. The calculations match quite nicely with the requirements indicated in the Mission Info KIT guidelines. Details on the data, calculations and exceptions are listed below. More specific background data is presented in figures 4-7 and data sources are marked in figure captions.

# GENERAL :

The emission inventory is more detailed on buildings and transport sectors since we have identified these as our main challenges and focus of climate work in the coming years. Sectors of waste, IPPU and AFOLU are at the moment not in the core of the climate work, since thy make up only marginal part of the total emissions. Since their portion and importance will increase as emissiosn decrease on other sectors, these sectors will be in focus in years closer to 2030.
Energy use: We do not have energy useage data available at the detailed level that the guidelines suggest. For instance we are not yet able to disaggregate electricity use for EVs and other uses. We will work on improving the data especially for the most relevant sectors, such as the Evs.
Activity data and emission factors: Detailed data for all emission sources not presented, as partly not available, partly confidential and partly difficult to track. We will improve the level of background data for the first update cycle of the CCC.
Scope 3 emissions: Information on Scope 3 emissions is rarely included. We have preliminary information on consumption based emissions from 2020 and 2022 (Kulma-calculations, Sitowise), which includes also Scope 3 emissions but these are not yet at the state to separate the data between scopes and match the Mission guidelines.

# BUILDINGS:

Electricity: national emission ratios have been used since it is not possible to calculate a local one since data is not available

Activity data on separate heating is based on national building registers. We are aware that the register is not fully updated for the past energy renovations where the source has been changed to low emission production (especially oil or electric heating to heat pumps). The register also does not account well if several modes of heating are used in one building.

AFOLU:
This is the direct emissions from agricultural production only, excluding forestry and land use change.
Emissions from machinery used in agriculture and forestry are included in the IPPU sector.
Activity and energy source data not available for this inventory, since the data is partly confidential. We will be able to provide more detailed data upon request.
Rough estimates for the carbon sinks and stock of the region exist but are not yet at the state to be included in the inventory

IPPU
The number includes the fuels used in industrial production, fuels for gasoline-powered machines and light and heavy fuel oil consumption. More detailed data especially for the part of construction sector will be needed in teh future to plan better targeted actions.

TRANSPORT
For road transport the data presented is collected by the national statistical institute and emissions are shown based on performance on roads in the area (and not on vehicles registered in the area)
Charging of EVs (scope 2) is included in electricity consumption

## A-2.2: Description &amp; assessment of policies

The city strategy is implemented through the programmes and action plans listed above. They cover several sectors and together help Lahti in its climate neutrality targets. The Climate Programme, SUMP and Roadmap for Circular Economy complete each other, so that the most relevant actions set in SUMP and Roadmap for Circular Economy will be followed annually together with the actions set in the Climate Programme. SUMP is also connected with the City Master Plan and is updated along the Master Plan cycle. Despite of all the actions identified in the programmes and accepted by the decision makers, many critical actions included in these existing strategies of the city are still in the planning phase and their funding is not secured. Hence, active work is needed from the responsible actors to ensure that the actions proceed from ideas to implementation and operation. This means for instance that the investment needs are brought timely into the city budgeting process and their importance is highlighted if they seem to fall out of the budget.

National level policies, such as the Climate Act and the National Climate and Energy Strategy form the basis and background for regional and local climate work. The regional work, especially via the Regional Council of Päijät-Häme is also very relevant, as it connects the municipalities and helps with coordinate climate work. The recently updated Climate Programme has several actions that deal with
Lahti

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

regional collaboration and development work. The Climate Programme has sub-targets and actions set for six different sectors: Climate governance, Energy, Transportation, Circular Economy and sustainable consumption, Carbon sinks and compensation, and Adaptation. All sectors are necessary for reaching the climate-neutrality target, but the most effective actions take place under the sectors Transportation and Energy. Even under those sectors, the emission reductions come from a combination of several different actions, rather than a single very efficient solution. As the emission reductions of transportation sector are the most challenging ones for practically all Finnish cities, national level policies are in the key role for making more progress. As for Carbon Sinks and Compensation sector, the national policies, similarly than the markets, are still rather new and constantly developing. We are following and participating in the development, but it is rather hard to predict how the national guidelines for instance for carbon offsets will turn out to be. It remains to be seen whether the offsets will be completely based on voluntary markets, or whether the State will regulate them somehow. Locally, we lack knowledge of who gets the benefit for carbon offsets and what counts as offset or emission reduction. If a private company plans to capture emissions from district heating so that the CO2 produced in combustion of biomass and waste is used for producing synthetic methane and hydrogen for traffic, it is uncertain whether this can be counted as emission reduction or offset.

Some actions and policies in the table above are still in the planning phase, such as the regional energy vision that would also support our local actions for energy efficiency and energy renovations. Collaboration and commitments from private sector are also needed for instance for creating fossil free construction sites, using fossil-free forestry machinery, and shifting to fossil-free production in industry. Other local implementation gaps exist in agriculture, which has limited possibilities to be regulated at local level, and in waste, where we need improved sorting and recycling, as well as capture of land fill gases.

# A-2.4: Description of the emissions gap

## CALCULATING RESIDUAL EMISSION AND EMISSION REDUCTION TARGET

For Lahti the residual emissions are calculated as $20\%$ of the 1990 emissions since this is how it is currently stated in the city strategy (175,26 kt $\mathrm{CO}^2\mathrm{e}$ in total emissions and 1,46 t $\mathrm{CO}^2\mathrm{e}$ per capita). Since we have long history in climate work, we are still somewhat tide to the already established
Lahti

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

practices in climate work at the local and national level and in city networks we belong to. 1990 is indeed an established emission baseline year for many forerunner cities in Europe.

Changing the baseline year, would significantly change the emission reduction target. If residual emissions were calculated as 20% of the latest emission inventory in 2021, they would be 83,64 kt CO²e (0,69 t CO²e per capita). We have already made many critical climate actions, especially in district heating, and managed to reduce our emission significantly more than many other Mission Cities. The target of 83,64 kt CO²e residual emission would be extremely challenging since the lowest hanging fruits with most impact have already been picked. We will be able to discuss need for changing the target and methodology when new city strategy is prepared in 2025, but for the moment and with the means available it would not be socially or financially sustainable to set such a target.

The sector level emission reduction targets are estimations of where we think we might have possibilities to get based on impact assessments of actions and emission scenarios.

# EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN EXISTING STRATEGIES

The emissions reductions in existing strategies are estimated to total 160 kt CO₂e by 2030 (figure 9). The estimations base on impact assessments and scenario calculations produced by Sitowise (figure 8). The emission reductions from existing strategies include national emission trend for included emission sectors and impact of local actions in Lahti that are in the strategies and their implementation is secured. These are often climate actions that have turned into established practices in Lahti, such as energy efficiency work in public and private buildings and part of the SUMP actions that are in the city budget.

On the other hand, impacts of actions listed in the city's strategies are not included in the "Emissions reductions in existing strategies" in case their implementation is not secured and they are not yet in the city budget or their external funding is still pending. These unsecured actions are therefore included in the Action portfolio.

The impact of national level emission scenarios in Lahti is estimated based on the climate law and national climate strategies. These were prepared by the previous national government. Scenarios need to be revised based on the plans of the recently elected new national government. For the moment the new government is committed to the national climate-neutrality targets, but for instance in road transport sector the national level emission reductions may not turn out as high and as fast as stated by the previous government.

# Buildings

Buildings sector is expected to see fast reduction in emissions in coming years especially as households and industry shift from separate oil and electric heating to sustainable heating alternatives. Recent problems in fuel availability and high electricity costs have accelerated this shift. The financial support from national government to energy renovations of private households and private sector is a strong driver for the change as well and we rely on this support from national level to meet our local climate goals.

In district heating utilising waste heat from wastewater management started in 2022 and its impact is included in the scenario along with other smaller changes in district heat production.

Also, the emissions from energy consumption are expected to decrease fast since the emission factor of consumed electricity in national grid decreases from 71 to 42 CO₂e/GWh by 2030. Since 2022 Finland no longer imports electricity from Russia and is forced to rely more on national production. The production of wind power is expected to increase from 8 TWh in 2021 to 30 TWh by 2030 and the nuclear power capacity has also increased since new reactor started to operate in 2023.

# Transport
Lahti

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

The emissions from road transport are expected to decrease significantly by 2030 following the national level transport policy including national actions such as tightening of the distribution obligation of fossil free fuels, but also market based trends such as accelerating electrifications of passenger vehicles.

Also, local actions included in the Lahti's SUMP, including gradual shift to low emission vehicles in public transport and improvement of cycling and walking infrastructure and city bike system are partly included in the estimations.

No big changes in emissions of rail and waterborne transport expected by 2030.

## Waste

In waste sector the emissions are expected to lower slightly by 2030 due to enhanced collection of domestic biowaste and textile waste. Targets for these are set in the national law.

## IPPU

In IPPU sector emissions are expected to decrease moderately by 2030 especially through electrification of machinery.

In AFOLU sector we do not estimate any changes in emissions by 2030, at least in the direct emissions of agriculture. Since 2021 the city offers farmers free education in climate friendly agriculture. Farms are also welcome to join the city as climate partners if they prove to operate in climate friendly manners. The land use change, which is not assessed in our emission inventory, the national goal is to increase the net carbon sinks of land use to meet the residual emissions at national level by 2035.

## EMISSION GAP

After accounting for the impacts from ongoing and secured future actions the estimated emission gap of 82,9 kt CO₂e still remains. This emission gap we will need to fill with local actions (figure 9).

## Buildings

For buildings an emission gap of 64 kt CO₂e remains. The highest additional potential is in district heating, which is organized by Lahti Energia. The company is fully owned by the city and have important role in our Climate Programme and Mission actions. With large investments in combustion plants in the near past, the company does not plan to quit combustion in the near future but there are possibilities to decrease the emissions for instance with additional electric boilers, season storages, waste heat utilisation and carbon capture techniques.

In separate heating the city has possibilities to accelerate the shift to low-emission heating by increased local advising. Even local incentives might be considered in case the national trend in energy renovations starts to slow down.

## Transport

The emission gap of 13,7 kt CO₂e in transport sector is the most challenging one to cover. Especially road transport is a huge challenge, since actions that are fast and easy are not foreseen.

Until now we have mainly used carrots to promote and facilitate a modal shift to sustainable mobility, but the results show only modest changes since the SUMP was introduced. Therefore, also actions that make private driving less attempting and less easy need to be considered. The city can also take a more active role in accelerating the electrification and the shift to alternative fuels (hydrogen and biogas) for instance by ensuring a sufficient network for distribution of alternative fuels and charging stations. Electrification of public transport is only a small step, since only 3% of the current road emissions stem from busses.

One of the most powerful actions would be to reduce speed limits on highways. Ca 65% of the remaining road traffic emissions are produced on the highways which the city does not administrate. Hence wide collaboration and support is needed also from the national and regional level.

# Waste

The waste management center of Salpakierto is an important actor in development of the waste management globally and its daughter company Labio, is one an important produced or biogas that is distributed to the national gas grid. However, given that the emissions from waste sector are already low, the city does not plan actions that would go beyond the obligation from national level in scopes 1 and 2. Therefore no emission gap is set for the waste sector.

# IPPU

For IPPU sector an emission gap of 5,2 kt CO $_2$ e remains. As low-emission technical solutions come available in the market, the city can facilitate the change by demanding low-emission machinery from its contractors. Joining the national Green Deal of low emission construction sites would also accelerate the change in Lahti area.

# AFOLU

Since the past local action for low emission agriculture have not provided significant emission reductions, the city does not plan additional actions for the agricultural production, but the carbon sinks of the local land use are involved in our plans for the offsetting of the residual emissions. This has been described in more detail in section B-2.3.

GENERAL BARRIERS
Lahti

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

# Climate governance

Many departments in the city organization deal with climate aspects, but to ensure sufficient resources across departments, and to mainstream it as a normal part of work tasks is a challenge of its own. Climate work should be tightly connected with financial planning. Although we are working on a climate budget in Lahti, the work is slow, as it has not been done before and requires extra work and development.

A general challenge still lies in committing to climate targets that are more ambitious, more expensive or more time consuming than the established procedures and national level requirements. A good example comes from construction sector. The expensive price of climate-friendly construction restricts the use sustainable options in city-owned facilities, as financial interests are often seen more important. It is also difficult to get options and candidates that are both sustainable and affordable in open construction and planning competitions. There seems to be a lack of ambition when it comes to tightening the regulation of local planning e.g., with land transfer agreement since the economic development is seen more important.

Another challenge lies in the coordination of climate work in the city. The climate experts are strategically well-placed in the city organization, their work is well-coordinated among experts, and it is discussed in steering groups. However, the flow of information does not always reach the middle stage managers, who often are not that aware of the scope and magnitude of climate work. There is also a need for a joint database and data management for supporting leading with data and data-based decision making. Different departments have plenty of relevant data, and a joint database would help in following and showing what kind of effects certain actions have on greenhouse gas emissions, and it could also provide info about the co-benefits of actions on, for instance people's health, air quality. Thus, it could help in getting political support for restrictive climate actions.

Deeper collaboration is also needed between different levels of governance. The cities can directly impact only part of the emissions in their area, and a lot of impact lies in the national level climate policies in national ministries. Until recently the cities were less involved in the national level planning and the climate work implemented in municipal level was poorly resourced by the government. The Mission work has started more intense collaboration between cities and ministries which we hope will make the national governance acknowledge that a large part of the national climate actions will be implemented at the municipal level, and we need to coordinate between the levels of governance to make the most out of it.

Also regional council has strong impact in the spatial planning and economic development of the region including the city and the collaboration on projects and joint visions and targets help municipalities to reach their climate targets. Lahti region currently lacks a shared vision for fossil free energy production, but the city has acknowledged the need for composing one. Together with local partners (Ladec, Regional council of Päijät-Häme) we aim to align an energy vision, and work for this will start in late 2023. The energy vision can help and act as a base for reports, research and development, as it will align what kind of renewable energy production we envision to have in our region in the long run.

# Financing

Barriers related to financing are presented in detail in Investment Plan A-3.1. In general, the city aims at decreasing its debt and cuts in the city budget are expected in the coming years. Therefore, alternative financial sources need to be identified. It becomes increasingly important that the needed actions are prepared well in advance and are ready to be included in the 3-5 planning cycle of the city budget. The climate budget will hopefully improve this process.

In general, too many actions and improvements are financed with project funding and long-term funding for scaling or maintenance is missing. Writing proposals and running projects on top of the daily work is considered exhausting by many experts.
Lahti

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

Barriers in financing are not only matter of the city as investments to climate friendly solutions are needed also by households and private sector. Here the capacity of national government to offer incentives comes important. The city can take an active role in ensuring that private sector and households have sufficient knowledge and capacity to deploy new technologies and apply for incentives available.

## Behavioral change

Making a behavioral change happen takes time, effort, and several forms of action. The city has been using carrots for long time to promote climate-friendly options for its residents but has seen the need to use stick as well. This has created a challenge also for the decision makers who generally are committed to climate work but may hesitate to make decision that cause any restrictions of their potential voters. We need to be able to show the co-benefits of sustainable lifestyle, and promote the aspects of health, economic savings, and the smooth and functioning daily life that an individual can also obtain. For more holistic work and co-creation of solutions, we need to engage local organizations, employers, and other actors as well as new types of experts in social sciences and service design.

## BARRIERS IN EMISSION SECTORS

## Buildings

In district heating the biggest barrier is the commitment to combustion with past investments. For the past decades combustion of waste has been a popular way to utilize the waste but given that this creates emissions in the energy sector there are national targets to increase the part of waste that utilized as material instead of combustion. This means that in the future the district heat production might rely even more on combustion of biomass, which although emission free at the moment, creates emissions in the LULUCF sector and is in conflict with the national climate targets. In Finland the price of the biomass has increased strongly since the imports from Russia stopped.

These conditions force energy sector to create pathways out of combustion or consider carbon capture and utilization or storage. In Lahti the energy producer is planning a collaboration with a private company to start CCU process where the emissions from combustion would be captured and utilized for production of synthetic methane for trucks. Although the process decreases emissions indirectly it seems that the Mission guidelines do not accept CCU as an emission reduction or offsetting action. This condition creates an unfair solution since the CCU is an expensive long-term investment with a huge climate impact but in paper the emission gap remains. If CCU is not accepted as emission reduction we may not meet the climate-neutrality target by 2030 since the emissions are already low and emission reductions of similar size would not be possible in any other sectors.

A barrier related to built environment lies in oil heating. It currently looks like oil heating is not replaced with other forms of heating in the speed that was assumed in our scenario. The scenario estimated that the current national actions and support would lead to abandoning oil heating by early 2030, but this seems to have been too optimistic. In principle, abandoning oil heating requires private households investing in new forms of heating. This is expensive, and in the current world situation not often a priority or an appealing opportunity for private households. We have experience from local projects and pilots trying to facilitate the energy renovation, but they did not provide any extra impact. The sector is developing in a fast pace due to its market-driven nature, and it is difficult to see where the city could act and how.

## Transport
Lahti

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

To reduce emissions from transport, we need increased ambition to support the use of public transportation, biking, and walking, as well as a quick renewal of the fleet of vehicles and their motive power.

Electrification and shifting to other alternative fuels would require quick renewal of the fleet. Renewal of fleet has generally been rather slow in Finland, partly as the taxation makes vehicles generally more expensive compared to other European countries. National incentives for this should be secured. To accelerate electrification of vehicles we need to understand the levers and the role the city can take in, for instance coordination of charging infrastructure. Similar challenges occur with biofuels, for which also the national distribution obligation plays a big role.

The current government of Finland has decided to withdraw the earlier plan to raise the distribution obligation. This has direct impact on the greenhouse gas emissions of road transport, which will not decrease according to earlier scenarios where the distribution obligation was estimated to be raised.

Reducing road transport within the city or lowering speed limits in the Päijät-Häme region would be efficient ways to reduce emissions from road transport. They are also more desirable options, than relying solely on the change of motive power. Majority of the road transport emissions come from drive-through transport, which the city cannot control much, but we can work on the transport within Lahti.

However, there seems to be lack of political will for any restrictions, which implies that a significant change is required in residents' behavior for making the change happen. Communicating about sustainable mobility starts with schoolkids who hopefully get used to active lifestyle, walking and biking. Such as change is slow and challenging and will not give instant results. Improving the services of public transportation could help in the change, but it is not cost-efficient. Experiences from other cities show that the budget for public transport would need to be multiplied to improve the level of service enough to attract new passengers. In the future smart mobility options might help, and for instance trial runs for robot buses are already taking place.

Investments required to build infrastructure supporting walking and biking are high. Financial limits in the city budget slow down also the long-term plans scheduled in SUMP (e.g. cycling target network not progressing as planned).

Improving the train connection to neighboring cities (e.g. Helsinki) could be a way to reduce road emissions. However, the rail transport is owned and coordinated at the national level. It is hoped that in the future the regions and cities would be allowed to purchase regional train connection from the national operator to improve the services. However, for instance doubling the train connections between Lahti and Helsinki during peak hours would require increased rail capacity also in Helsinki.

# IPPU

The possibilities of the city to influence the emissions from product use and machinery are limited. As low-emission technical solutions come available in the market, the city can facilitate the change by demanding low-emission machinery from its contractors, but until now, there are not always enough contractors whose machinery meets the requirements, and the development is slow. Joining the national Green Deal of low emission construction sites would also accelerate the change in Lahti area but there is fear of increasing costs.

# AFOLU

The possibilities of the city to have an impact on local production methods are limited. We can act on our own agricultural land, but as most of the agricultural land is owned by private farmers, the effect is small. We can also encourage people to acquire carbon farming methods, but their actual effect is difficult to estimate too. The emissions from agriculture are expected to follow the national trend in the future.

## Negative emissions, carbon sinks and offsetting

Cities need to develop and expand to attract new businesses and operators. Most of the times this leads to changes in land use, mainly logging of forests. Following this, carbon sinks and storages are lost. This loss could be partially compensated by supporting carbon sinks and storages elsewhere in the city area. However, markets, national level guidelines and regulation for such offsetting are developing slowly in Finland. It is unclear what kind of role municipalities could have in the offsetting market. Questions also arise of who should pay for compensation projects, and how to make sure that their benefits are real. Biodiversity aspect also needs to be considered when planning for compensation projects. Municipalities have little power to influence forestry business, local operators, and forest owners, although local, municipality-run compensation models with monetary incentives might become available within the next couple of years. We see carbon capture (CCS and CCU) as a possibility in the future, and are eagerly following how investments, national and EU-wide policies regarding the topic develop.

## A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

Participation of stakeholders and citizens is greatly important for the planning of the action portfolio as well as implementation of the action. A great part of the impact of the planned actions rely on the activity of the citizens ann companies. This is especially crucial for the actions in road transport where the city can provide infrastructure for sustainable mobility but in the end it is the citizen who decides whether they eill bike, walk, or take bus, or take their own car. A strong participation in the planning of mobility actions could help us to get also difficult actions accepted by the citizens and politicians.

Creating a participatory model for the climate work is a crucial action in the updated climate programme of the city. The city has several well working instruments for participation developed in urban plannig and strategy departments that could be better utilised in climate work. Strong participation is required by law in master plan and zoning processes. The participation processes developed in the Department of Urban planning creat basis for all participatory work at the city. Since these alraedy exist it makes sense to build upon them rather than creating our own processes. One of the first steps to do could be to establish a joint database for the data resulting from all the participatory work conducted in the city.

We have done a stakeholder analysis for the sustainability work of the city and identified &gt;100 important stakeholders or stakeholder groups for climate work. Below we list some of the key stakeholders the existing instruments that could be utilised for the climate participatory model.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways– textual and visual elements

We selected to build impact pathways for the most critical sectors of energy systems and transport. Since this is where there are most emission reduction needs, barriers and gaps in our understanding of the system and required needs. Action portfolios parts 1-5 stem directly from the Impact Pathway. Our action portfolio presented later includes actions also from other fields of action and we will continue building impact pathways also for those fields to check whether we have a full picture of the needs and are utilising all needed levers.

The Direct impacts as emission reduction are estimated based on impact assessments for most important actions (Sitowise, spring 2023). We were not able to provide emission reductions for all actions and for some they are difficult to estimate.

Many (but not all) of the actions are listed in the Climate Programme which was approved by the city board in June 2023. Hence, the actions have general political acceptance, but their implementation and funding is not secured until the single action are in the city budget or when alternative funding is secured. In the Action portfolio descriptions, we have marked what the current status of the action is (options: under preparation, political decision (included in existing strategy), funding secured (project funding secured or costs included in the City Budget), implementation, ongoing action).

# 4.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

Module B-2 "Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design" should contain a project description for each intervention planned, including interventions by local businesses and industry, according to the template B-2.1, including actions those interventions targeted at enhancing carbon sinks to address residual emissions. Narrative analysis and comments can be provided in B-2.2. A summary of how residual emissions are addressed, should be provided in B-2.3.

Assessment of the effects of climate measures is being developed so that resources can target effective and cost-effective actions.

The city develops climate budgeting, including an assessment of the economic effects of measures, the connection between the economy and climate work in financial planning and the communication about economic effects of climate work.

Subsidiaries report their emissions and prepare company-specific road maps towards carbon neutrality. The actions of the subsidiaries are linked to the goals of the city's strategy.

The city invites companies and other organizations to become climate partners of the city of Lahti. Climate partners commit to climate action and form an active network.

The city is developing a carbon handprint calculation, which will be used to show the effectiveness of city and region operators climate work outside the region.

Through an open challenge competition, effective emission reduction measures are sought in key areas in themes such as energy and transport.

We will improve the responsibility of events by developing advice and guidance.

Through the Nature Step to Health program, climate work is combined with nature work and health promotion.
The goal is that the diversity of nature is strengthened; Lahti residents are healthier and more active more; opportunities for recreational use of nearby nature are increasing. Emphasis from a climate perspective in exercise and nutrition.

In the recently updated Climate Programme of the City, we have devoted one sector for carbon sinks and offsetting with 19 actions for 2023-2030 to cover the residual emissions (20% from 1990 level). However, the plan does not exactly match with the guidelines of the Cities mission. According to our own target the 20% should be bound into sinks and, as the last option, compensated. We count also the already existing sinks into the 20% and not only the additional ones as instructed in the Mission Infokit for Cities. This is a common way of counting sinks in Finland, as about 75 % of the land area of Finland is covered with forests, and we have less possibilities to afforestation than many other countries in Europe. We consider the net sink, aka the difference between the sinks and sources instead of plain biological sink of vegetation and soil. Thus, the sources caused by logging or land use change are subtracted from the biological sink to get the net sink value.

As mentioned in section A-2.2., the national guidelines and policies regarding carbon sinks and offsets are still under development. There are yet no clear rules for how municipalities should proceed with carbon offsets. Lahti is a forerunner also in this topic as we are currently involved in a project where carbon offset guidelines for municipalities are developed. Developing the guidelines, as well as a local carbon compensation model, where the producers, buyers, and benefits of carbon offsets would remain in the Lahti region, are stated as acts in the Climate Programme. With the local carbon compensation model, we would have carbon credits produced and bought locally or regionally instead of having to buy them from outside of Finland. This way we could better control and follow the effects of the offset projects and keep the financial benefits in the region. We also want to tie biodiversity aspects into the model so that the chosen offset project would not endanger biodiversity, but support or even enhance it. The Climate Programme includes acts related to the target, that land use in the city should not cause net carbon emissions. The local offset model would help with this target too because the city needs to grow and land use change is inevitable. We also want to raise the share of construction that stores and binds carbon, as by increasing the use of wood and other suitable materials. One of such materials is concrete that functions as a carbon sink, which was recently developed by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. A pilot plant for manufacturing this carbon-negative concrete is in Hollola, a neighbouring municipality of Lahti.

# 6 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for further refining the Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract.

## Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration – textual elements

The climate neutrality for scopes 1 and 2 by 2030 is an ambitious challenge for all Mission cities but in Lahti we are on a good way towards the goal since we started early. The Mission work has already brought additional value to our climate work, especially through improved collaboration with a wide variety of stakeholders - which is also a requirement for getting to the goal.

In 2023-2025 our focus will be in energy systems, road transport and sustainable consumption. Improving climate governance, financing and stakeholder engagement are important levers to be utilized.

An important step considering all actions in the portfolio is climate budgeting, which we will introduce in the financial planning of the city in 2024. The preparation of the Investment Plan showed us that the connection of climate governance and financial planning, nor the reporting of investments to climate work is not as systematic as it could be and should be. For many actions the investment or operational costs have not yet been estimated. We also have critical knowledge gaps in climate impacts of planned actions. We have been well prepared for the big investments but given that the municipalities are expected to face financially tough years, climate budgeting can provide us a way to secure and schedule funding for all required actions in the portfolio.

Another important general step will be to improve the climate governance especially between the local, regional, and national level. Work with other Finnish Mission cities and the supporting national

ministries will be a good platform to improve the collaboration and understanding what is needed from each level of governance.

In buildings sector important investment decisions will be made especially in the district heating system, where electric boilers and utilization of CCU could provide massive reduction of emissions. In transport, high expectations are placed for the year of Sustainable Mobility in 2025 which will allow us to pilot several actions that could lead to significant emission reduction if scaled. The participation of citizens and other actors in the area is crucial for success especially in sustainable mobility. Therefore, communication and nudging towards sustainable consumption and lifestyles are necessary actions.

The Action Plan will be updated in two years cycles. In 2025 we hope to have made significant progress in energy and transport sectors. For years 2025-2030 our focus will therefore shift to the topics of are agriculture forestry and land- use and waste management. We already have a list of action that are prepared and implemented around these topics. Especially AFOLU sector offers possibilities for climate adaptation, biodiversity work and offsetting of residual emissions.

We also continue to follow the progress of the climate work. In Lahti the emission inventories and monitoring of progress in climate actions are embedded in the city's annual reporting cycle. We continue to lead the decision making with knowledge gained from the scientific community and from our own monitoring and are ready to change course accordingly.

# 1 Introduction

Explain your city's motivation to join the EU Mission “100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030” and highlight your city's present commitments to climate action. You may also want to include the aims of this document.

## Your text

Lahti has for long been the frontrunner in climate work among European cities, and climate neutrality became a goal in the city strategy of Lahti in 2009 when the first emission reduction targets were placed. To highlight the importance of climate neutrality and ensure its realization in best possible way, it is integrated to other strategic goals of Lahti, such as vitality, public health, and biodiversity conservation through strong cross-sectoral programme work. As proof of Lahti's significant efforts in climate and environmental work, we were appointed as the European Green Capital for 2021. The European Green Capital Year 2021 left a strong political legacy for the work ahead and has already proven that ambitious climate politics can attract new business, increase the vitality of the city, and improve the quality of life.

In October 2021 the newly elected city council confirmed our goal to be carbon neutral already by 2025 as the first big city in Finland. The target is based on production-based emissions accounted in mainly in scope 1 (Greenhouse Gas Protocol). According to the target Lahti should reduce its production-based emissions by 80% compared to 1990 and bind the remaining 20% to carbon sinks and offsets. To this date we have already cut our production-based emissions by 64% since 1990. One of the key factors for such high emission reduction is that the city-owned energy producer Lahti Energia abandoned using charcoal in district heating production in 2019. Nevertheless, the current scenarios predict climate neutrality will not be reached until in 2026 or 2027. Although the original, very ambitious aim of meeting the target by 2025 may not be fulfilled, Lahti will still be the first big Finnish city to reach its own climate neutrality target. We are also on a good way towards the Mission target 2030 and by 2021 have cut scope 1 and 2 emissions by 52%.

The recently updated Lahti Climate Programme has 96 climate actions targeting emissions across scopes 1,2 and 3 under following topics: climate governance, energy, transport, circular economy and sustainable consumption, carbon sinks and compensation as well as climate adaptation. Lahti is also developing a holistic programme and goals for a nature positive city, where climate actions are seen as one important element in addition to wellbeing of nature and humans.

Given our long journey as a climate pioneer, the lowest hanging fruits, such as abandoning charcoal have already been picked and we are moving towards a more holistic approach and systemic change. Joining the EU mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" and developing this Climate City Contract gives Lahti a remarkable push towards these aims. It gives us more tools for tackling the most challenging remaining emission that still need to be reduced to reach climate-neutrality, while simultaneously creating new collaboration possibilities with local businesses, academia, and citizens. The key priorities that we will focus on in the coming years are cutting the emissions of traffic and further decarbonising the energy system. Challenges in these sectors require a systemic change not only from the city and other levels of governance but also behavioural change from citizens and strong participation of the private sector towards more sustainable consumption.

We are currently developing environmental governance with specific focus on procurements, partnerships and connecting financial management to climate governance. We continue developing the online platform where climate work is monitored and communicated. We are ready to act also outside of the field of our direct governance engaging residents, private sector and other stakeholders and making climate-neutral actions the new normal in Lahti.

With this document Lahti, with its key partners, delineates the way for reaching the climate-neutrality target in a holistic way that enables systemic change. Local work force and knowledge, collaboration with research institutions and academia, and sufficient infrastructure in terms of energy, transportation and waste form an ecosystem, whose every component is crucial for successful execution of the EU mission. Not only do the companies support the city in its climate-neutrality target, but the city

supports companies with their innovations and investments and aims to enhance the use of local and sustainable producers in its own procurements.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Articulate your 2030 climate neutrality ambition, as expressed and defined in your Cities Mission Expression of Interest (EoI). This should include your ambition and commitment to a 2030 horizon as a whole city, as well as describe any exclusion areas and summarise how these areas would be addressed beyond 2030. (A more detailed plan for exclusion areas should be included in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.) Your 2030 ambition should be supported at a minimum by a Council decision, and it is recommended that it is also supported by a wider stakeholder group. We also recommend you to list other co-benefits you aim to achieve when working towards the climate neutrality goal, like wellbeing, health, equity, justice, financial savings.

Lahti is already committed to three climate targets:

) City's own target: Carbon neutral by 2025, with  $80\%$  decrease in production-based emissions compared to 1990 and compensation for the remaining emissions. This target was set by the city board in 2019 and included to the city strategy by a Council decision in 2022 (scope 1)
Lahti

Climate-Neutrality

Commitments

O

) As part of the national HINKU network (Towards Carbon Neutral Municipalities) Lahti targets to cut its use-based emissions by 80% by 2030 compared to 2007 levels (scope 1 and 2)

) Reducing consumption-based emissions by 50% by 2030, compared to 2005, as defined in the targets of Fisu network (Finnish Sustainable Communities) (scope 1, 2 and 3)

These targets cover all three scopes defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. While scope 1 includes direct emissions inside the geographic boundary of the city, scopes 2 and 3 cover indirect emissions. In scope 2 also grid-supplied power is included, regardless of where it is produced, and scope 3 covers the emissions that are generated outside of the municipality but result from operations that take place in the municipality, such as purchasing of goods, or food production.

Lahti Climate Program sets 96 actions holistically across all three emissions scopes and six thematic topics towards climate neutrality. Each of the six thematic topics: climate governance, energy, transport, circular economy and sustainable consumption, carbon sinks and compensation as well as climate adaptation have more specific sub-targets that lead to sectors specific emission reductions and support systemic change inside and across the thematic topics. The Climate Program was approved by the City Board in June 2023, and the progress is being monitored and actions updated annually. Lahti's Circular Economy Roadmap and Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, which is prepared and updated along the city master plan, compliment the Climate Program. The action portfolio was developed with strong participation and support from stakeholders especially from academia, city's daughter companies and private sector.

By 2021 we had already cut the production-based emissions from 1990 by 64%. We are also on a good way towards the Mission target 2030 and by 2021 have cut scope 1 and 2 emissions by 52%. A method for calculating the consumption-based emission is being developed and we have first estimations for the carbon footprint of the citizens from 2020 and 2021. The single most important action has been the city's investment in energy transition of district heating, and we quit burning charcoal in 2019.

Despite of the years of climate work and extensive action portfolio for the coming years, an emission gap of 82,9 kt CO₂e to climate neutrality as defined in the context of the city's Mission still exists. The most challenging sector is road transport. The city of Lahti commits itself to deliver bold climate action that will enable it to achieve the indicated goal on time. This will be done in a fair and just way doing no significant harm and leaving no one behind. The holistic approach ties the climate work to other strategic goals of the city, such as economic vitality, nature positivity and climate adaptation. Following the guidelines and actions to reach our climate-neutrality goal will bring us also multiple co-benefits, such as well-being and health of citizens. Reducing emissions in traffic will, for instance, lead to enhanced air quality. Similarly, changes in food systems or increased biking and walking can have positive impacts on both health and climate. The city of Lahti is involved in research and development projects regarding planetary lifestyle, which in turn can both have a positive impact on nature, citizens plus reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The city and the strategic partners have identified several co-benefits of climate work that can support the economic vitality of the region such as new possibilities for multistakeholder collaboration, new investments, financing opportunities, support for RDI-sector, new innovations and business opportunities leading to economic sustainability, improved economic competitiveness and employment. This all builds a common trust that Lahti region will succeed and flourish also in the future.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

This is the core section of the Commitments document that should summarise at least 3 or 4 systemic strategic priorities that need to be implemented for your city to become climate neutral by 2030. These should be meaningful changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in your city, like decarbonising the heating system in the city or generating 100% energy from renewables. The

individual commitments between your city and other stakeholders should address these key priorities and contribute to reaching them. The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan should describe all interventions, including those to reach your priorities as well as all further actions, in detail and describe how your city plans to implement them.

# Your text

Based on the emission data and estimated emission gap as well as the expertise among the partners, we identified three key priorities that need to be urgently addressed to achieve 2030 climate neutrality goal: cutting emissions of transport, decarbonising energy production and enabling sustainable consumption. Below we describe the need for systemic change in these sectors and a comprehensive list of planned actions can be found in Lahti's Action Plan Module B2.

# Cutting emissions of transport

In 2021 almost half of city's production-based emissions came from road transport. We estimate that the national trend in road transport emissions and the currently planned actions in the Climate Program and SUMP, such as low emission public transport and increasing the share of sustainable mobility can lead to reduction of 40 kt CO₂e, but is not sufficient for climate neutrality. An additional reduction of 13,7 kt CO₂e, is required to reach the Mission climate-neutrality target by 2030. That equals to a reduction of 35 % of the road transport emissions between 2021-2030. No single action can reduce the road traffic emissions enough and a systemic change with multiple levers are needed to enable the needed reductions. We also acknowledge that the city has somewhat limited possibilities to affect the emissions in road transport. Climate and transport politics and regulations at the national and EU level have a strong impact of the local transport emissions, especially the drive through traffic which covers 60% of the road traffic emissions in Lahti.

Lahti's Pilot City Project "Systemic Change Towards Sustainable Commuting in Lahti" is an important step towards understanding the complex patterns of urban mobility and identifying the most important levers to enable to change together with academic partners, health- and wellbeing authority, local business sector and other members of the mobility ecosystem in Lahti. In addition, we are planning a thematic regional year of sustainable mobility for 2025. The idea is to pilot and provide proof of concept for identified possible actions during this concept year and identify the best actions to scale up before 2030.

Most importantly we aim to accelerate the modal shift towards sustainable mobility. Our residents are used to relying on their private cars and COVID-pandemic has made public transport less attractive. To succeed with our climate-neutrality target, strong participative approach is crucial for the public to accept possible new regulations and start utilising new solutions. We need to improve conditions for biking and walking by putting more effort in the infrastructure, and by making them appealing choices also for those citizens who normally choose their own cars as a way of transportation. We expect the modal shift to take time and identify electrification of the road traffic as another key are of work for succeeding with our target. On one hand the city can accelerate the local shift in private cars by promoting available incentives for charging infra and ensuring sufficient public charging network. On the other hand, as one of the most important nodes in the national road network we can facilitate the national transition by supporting infra of charging stations for green mobility. The emissions from road transport have remained similar in Lahti throughout recent decades and it has, similarly than in most cities around the world, been difficult to reduce them. Yet, we believe that with collaboration, we can reach emission reductions. The city of Lahti and the stakeholders signing this contract can support their personnel in choosing other possibilities than private cars for commuting. Some stakeholders already provide their personnel monetary support for buying electronic bikes. The city of Lahti is also planning campaigns to inspire people to choose walking as a way of transport. The change does not need to be abrupt, rather than a smooth transition where one can begin with choosing other than their own car at least one day per week. In logistics we need to, together, ensure that the network of new motive power stations for instance for EV charging, renewable hydrogen, and methane, is sufficient. This encourages companies to invest in fleet using renewable power sources and aid in reducing emissions from logistic chains. The atmosphere among operators is already favourable to the change, and we are committed to grab the opportunity and work together with them to make it happen.

The city owned district heating company is one of the key actors of Lahti's climate work. It has already cut its emissions by 90% by shifting from charcoal to combustion of biomass and waste. Its new openings include a power to gas production utilising the CO₂ emissions of the existing biomass power plant. If successful, the latter would turn the city's district heating into a carbon sink and reduce the emission gap by 100 kt CO₂e by 2030. This collaboration is dependent on private sectors actors but also on funding from national government or EU and the investment decision is still to be made. Hence the city needs to be prepared for a plan B if needed.

Second important part of energy production is the separate heating. A cut of 80 kt CO₂e is expected as households and industry shift from separate oil and electric heating to sustainable alternatives. Recent problems in fuel availability and high electricity costs have accelerated this shift. The financial support from national government to energy renovations of private households and private sector is strong driver for the change as well and we rely on this support from national level to meet our local climate goals.

The city owned buildings are already part of the district heating network but we examine the possibilities for local energy production especially through solar energy in both old and new buildings. Energy efficiency is also important part of our climate work but since the district heating is already close to fossil free, it's direct impact on emissions are modest and the main motivations are financial sustainability and energy sufficiency.

Investments in wind and solar power and recognising the potential spots for power plants are also crucial in decarbonising energy production. Since the sector is developing fast now a regional cross municipal vision and plan for scattered energy production is much needed. We are also closely following the development of carbon capture techniques in energy and heat production.

# Enabling sustainable consumption

To restrict global warming to 1.5 °C compared to pre-industrial times, a systemic change is needed in how we live. Sustainable consumption of citizens is possible only if there are sustainable options for them to choose. This means, for instance, creating possibilities for more carbon-neutral private construction, as by supporting the use of wood and other materials with low carbon footprint. Moreover, more climate-friendly options need to be available in food, mobility, and consumption of other goods. Enabling sustainable consumption is cross-cutting topic which can impact emissions across emission scopes and thematic topics of climate work including transport and energy production as described above.

City of Lahti has been actively involved in developing calculations for consumption-based emissions, aka the carbon footprint, with consultation company Sitowise and researchers from the Natural Resources Institute Finland. The calculations include energy consumption, construction sector, transport, food, and other goods and services. In the latest calculations from 2022, Lahti's emissions were 7.2 t CO₂e per resident. An estimated 40-70 % reduction in consumption-based emissions can be achieved by choosing low-carbon options in the consumption of goods and services. According to the researchers developing the calculations, especially the food sector shows high potential for emission reductions. Plant-based and climate-friendly food and drink options should be available and promoted to citizens not only from climate, but also from their health aspects. Serving climate-friendly food first in line in self-service lunch buffet restaurants instead of leaving it to the end of line as last option, would make it easier for personnel to choose that option. If the kitchen personnel need more education for preparing tasty and climate-friendly food, that should be offered by the employer.

More sustainable logistic chains, as described above under Cutting emissions of traffic, have a direct impact also in making sustainable consumption possible. Circular economy is tightly tied into sustainable consumption, and Lahti with its stakeholders have tremendous opportunities to include principles of circular economy in their actions and investments even more than before. City of Lahti has recently published a roadmap to circular economy and aims to be waste free in 2050. The city follows and participates in research around the topic by for instance leading the StopWa project,

where the possibilities to use construction waste for stormwater management is studied. Due to the already made efforts, knowledge and needs in circular economy, Lahti region has potential to act as a hub for circular economy innovations.

## 4 Principles and process

Highlight the key principles that will guide your city as it implements its Climate City Contract, like accountability, transparency, or an open attitude to new approaches. The process should encompass principles like co-creation, innovation, multi-actor and citizen engagement, and should be systemic and demand-driven in nature. It should also be based on monitoring and joint learning. The Commitments Guidance document provides more specific guidance on how integrate these principles into your own process.

## Your text

Lahti has a long history of collaboration with different actors in both environmental and climate work. Thus, we are working as a strong team across sectors, within the city organisation and with stakeholders and key partners, to develop an effective Climate City Contract. With this contract the city of Lahti and its partners commit to collaboration, and mutual support regarding actions under the three key priorities set in section 3 of the contract. No specific emission reduction targets are required from partners, and no monetary obligations are involved. Part of the contract partners are, however, closely involved in the action portfolio. We commit in the common emission reduction targets as stated in this contract, and highlight that the Climate City Contract and participation in the EU Cities Mission can bring new funding and innovation possibilities for the stakeholders.

## Build a Strong Mandate

The city council and city board have given their mandate to climate work in Lahti by accepting the city strategy where climate neutrality was set as a goal, and by accepting the Climate Program that acts as a basis for the Action Plan. During the European Green Capital Year 2021, citizens of Lahti took surveys regarding climate and environment work. The results showed that our city also has a mandate of our citizens when it comes to climate work.

Our city strategy is based on sustainability as a whole, and we are committed to the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in terms of economic, social and economic sustainability. We let citizens take part in the decision-making, for instance via the Lahden Suunta master plan process. We provide guidance and advice for citizens and bringing topics into Partnership tables (Kumppanuuspöytä), which represent citizens regionally from different parts of city. The idea of Partnership tables is to include citizens more closely to the development and decisions regarding their own neighbourhood and everyday life.

Our transition team works on two levels as we have a steering group along with a working group of experts. The experts in the working group come from the key city departments of the city of Lahti, and involve people working on environmental policy, urban planning, housing and environment, transport and infrastructure planning. Other experts are invited to join the working group meetings based on the discussed topics. The steering group has members from the management level of the city of Lahti. In addition the largest city-owned companies are represented. We work closely with research institutes, technology sector, and welfare services in terms of low-carbon innovations and enhancing planetary lifestyle in Lahti, and thus have representatives from the universities, Wellbeing services of county Päijät-Häme and Technology Industries of Finland in the steering group.

Climate work is also a regional priority and the regional council of Päijät-Häme has set a regional goal for climate neutrality by 2030 and is currently transforming its climate road map in to a regional sustainability programme addressing holistically also biodiversity, climate adaptation, and wellbeing goals. This smooth regional collaboration is a huge asset for city's climate work and enables joint projects and actions and fast scaling of successful actions region wide. The council has provided City

of Lahti financial support for the coordination of the Mission work and is an active member of the transition team steering and working groups.

## Co-designing a Portfolio

The Climate Program of the city of Lahti, which acts as a base for Lahti's Action Plan, was accepted by the City Board in June 2023. The whole process of updating took almost a year and included hearing from and workshops with key city departments. Altogether approximately 70 people, who were either working in different city departments, or stakeholders participated in the update work. For the suggested list of actions the impacts on emissions and economics of the city were assessed to understand the remaining emission gap. The resulting scenarios indicated that most significant challenges are ahead especially in transport sector and somewhat also in energy sector. Achieving climate-neutrality in these sectors will require systemic change in the society. Further actions for the challenging sectors were identified in stakeholder workshops.

Lahti receives support for its local mission work from the consulting company Sitowise, in terms of compiling the Action Plan, Investment Plan, and the Climate City Contract. The Investment Plan is based on the Action Plan, and the financial administration from the City of Lahti supported and helped in this work. Sitowise is also involved in the national level support together with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development. The six Finnish cities chosen to EU cities mission have a network working together to form a strong shared understanding on a national level.

The emission calculations and scenarios until 2030 were also conducted by the consultation company Sitowise. The Action Plan itself was prepared with close help from Net Zero Cities City Adviser to ensure a smooth transformation of Climate Program into the Action Plan format. The steering group of the transition team follows the work done in the cities mission regularly.

Together with an expert from consulting company Sitowise, we organized two events for local stakeholders to create a multi-actor coalition of key partners for climate mitigation. The events were workshops, where stakeholders were working together on the commitments and gave their valuable feedback and improvements especially on the key priorities and strategic interventions, and the principles and processes defined in this contract. After these steps every stakeholder who signs the contract can stand behind the common commitments.

## Take action

Lahti has a remarkable history in climate work and has for long had targets regarding climate neutrality. Our Climate Program lists actions to meet our climate neutrality target, along with a schedule for the realisation of actions. We are also strong actors in circular economy, with an existing road map to circular economy including concrete targets and actions. The city is actively involved in research and development projects both internationally and with local academic partners LAB and LUT Universities. We collaborate and share ideas with other cities, mainly the other five Finnish EU mission cities and those that are also located in Päijät-Häme region. With such collaboration we could affect the sustainability of procurements in the cities, such as those involved in school transport.

The stakeholders involved in the Climate City Contract already consider climate, environment and responsibility from their own point of view. They may have their own emission reduction targets, which by no means contradict with the ones of Lahti, but support the common target. With Climate City Contract we take the next step towards climate-neutrality together with our key partners. Closing the emission gap will require actions, effort, and investments from all the partners involved in the contract. Collaboration between the city of Lahti and its stakeholders covers various aspects from ensuring sufficient labour force and knowledge, sufficient infrastructure, research collaboration. Holistic work of the whole ecosystem built around the actors involved in the cities mission is required for reaching the climate neutrality target. At the same time the holistic approach brings new opportunities for stakeholders and makes Lahti even more attractive for new investments and companies.

## Learn &amp; Reflect

The city of Lahti updates its Climate Program annually, and repeats the calculations for production-based and use-based emissions regularly. We continuously monitor the realisation of actions listed our Climate Program via our online Climate Watch (Ilmastovahti) system. Our plan is that the city's climate actions and the required financing are updated annually as part of the city budgeting process. We will update the Climate City Contract every two years. Our following steps are developing indicators for our actions so that their effects can be followed in an easier and more consistent manner.

## Make it a New Normal

The climate work in Lahti, and the expertise of the local business sector and universities meet in the sectors of carbon neutral construction, circular economy, and low emission traffic. Clusters of local experts are built around these topics. The city provides platforms such as Pippo-Kujala smart-infra industrial estate and the carbon-neutral Ranta-Kartano district and neighboring sport arena where new technologies can be developed and piloted. Smart technologies, digitalisation, innovative and sustainable procurements and promotion of circular economy are among the key methods. Thus, we have a good and solid base for accelerating the change and making it a new normal. Nevertheless, trying to affect people's behaviour is a task with several challenges. The city of Lahti will be working on an interaction plan related to how its own climate work considers the stakeholders of the city, the residents, and the various departments inside the city to reduce the silo-structure in decision-making. The city of Lahti is also planning a project, together with LAB University of Applied Sciences, focusing on how to communicate the challenging actions that are needed for instance in transport sector in a way that they are more acceptable among local politicians and citizens. Communication plays a strong role in making it a new normal and is one channel of collaboration between the parties of this Climate City Contract. It is important to communicate the concrete actions that the parties of the contract make in their own part to show example to those who are not that far along yet with their climate work.
