# Summary

This Action Plan is developed as part of the City Climate Contract, reflecting the City's ambition to become climate neutral. The Action Plan elaborates on the strategic priorities defined in the Commitments template and, following the action plan template, describes the current state of climate action in Liberec, including the GHG emission inventory. It outlines pathways towards climate neutrality by 2030, featuring a portfolio of actions aligned with these pathways, a section dedicated to monitoring, evaluation, and learning, as well as a list of governance and social innovations enabling climate neutrality by 2030. This document was developed with the engagement of various key stakeholders, including citizens. An integral part of the Action Plan is the investment plan, which details the financial resources necessary for its implementation and identifies the relevant financial stakeholders.

This Action Plan outlines the suggested pathways and actions required to achieve an 82% reduction in GHG emissions compared to the baseline year of 2019. These pathways align with the NZC Theory of Change, the city's emission inventory, other strategic documents, and public input. The Action Plan emphasizes the sectors of buildings and transport. Specifically, it highlights the need to enhance the energy performance of buildings (private, municipal, regional, commercial/industrial), phase out remaining coal boilers in households, and construct renewable energy sources, including large solar and wind power plants, and the installation of PV panels on building roofs. The concept of community energy must be further developed, in line with energy management and the decarbonization of the heating system. Additionally, the city must focus on transport electrification (both private and public) and support active mobility. The city's efforts should also prioritize capacity and capability building, networking, and learning.

A successful implementation of this Action Plan requires an increase in municipal capacity, both in terms of the number of employees and professionals involved, as well as an increase in investments in the climate transition. It is crucial to leverage both private and public resources and actively engage private actors and investors. The city is aware of the barriers and necessary steps, and this CCC Action Plan (Climate City Contract) will serve as a starting point and a tool for further facilitating cooperation with key stakeholders, including financial stakeholders.

At the end of this document, social and governance innovations that enable the successful implementation of the suggested actions are listed.

# 1 Introduction

The Action Plan is developed with the city's ambition to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, positioning Liberec as a pioneer in this field in the Czech Republic. This introduction outlines the complexity of the entire transition process, drawing on background data about Liberec and its strategic planning. It details the overall workflow, lessons learned, struggles and barriers encountered, and presents our vision, long-term goals, and areas of focus.

## Background information about the city in the context of climate neutrality commitment

Long-term vision of the city (stated in the master plan of the city from 2022):

Liberec, as a heart of the Czech north, economic centre, modern and innovative city using technological progress, ensuring best-quality housing and services, supporting active life including culture and sports, attractive for citizens, visitors and employers, city very well accessible, permeable and long-term sustainable, surrounded by unique mountain landscape with rich water sources, ensuring air protection and ready to adapt to climate change, city where everyone gets own space for self-realization and personal development, Liberec is where there is wellbeing for citizens and city prosperity in harmony.

## Administrative and political organisation of the city:

The city of Liberec is the main city of the Liberec Region, 5th biggest city in Czechia, located near to Poland and Germany, 90 km away from the capital city Prague, surrounded by forests and mountains. The city is spread over an area of 106 km² and with the population of 107 389 (31.12.2023). 35% of the city area is represented by agricultural land, forest land make up 40% of the city cadastral area. The city has 33 city districts and 26 cadastral areas. City (as NUTS 5: CZ0513563889) is a part of the Liberec region (NUTS 3: CZ051), where there the Regional Office of the Liberec region is a higher authority, Liberec is also a member of the Nisa Euroregion. The city of Liberec is responsible for self-government (self-governing community of citizens) which means city as a municipality is a public corporation with its own property and acts in legislative relations in its name and bears responsibility arising from these relations, and in delegated competence for the state administration.

When it comes to political organisation of the city, the main city representative is the mayor of the city (Ing. Jaroslav Zámečník, CSc.), the final decision-making power has the city council (which is based on the Act No 128/2000, Coll. on Municipalities). In the city council, there are 39 representatives both of leading coalition of political parties and opposition political parties (that signed the coalition contract for period 2022 – 2026). In coalition programme, there is, beside other, accent on solar panels installation on municipal buildings, accent on climate neutrality and community energy development. In the city board, there are 11 representatives (all representatives are also city counsellors) of leading political coalition. Their responsibilities (city council and city board) are based on the Act on Municipalities, which means that the city board is responsible for: management according to the
A

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

approved budget, fulfilling the tasks of the founder of legal entities and facilities, discussing and resolving proposals and comments of city council, establishment of commissions and professional working groups, etc. The city council is responsible for: approval of the municipal budget, approval of the development program of the city, decision making about establishment or dissolution of legal entities, decision about city's participation in companies and foundations, approval of binding decrees in matters of self-government, etc. Currently, besides the city mayor, there are 8 deputy mayors where each deputy mayor is responsible for a specific area and as a political leader in this field works directly with heads of relevant municipal departments. The following election for the city council will be held in autumn 2026.

City council has its own Committees, City board has its own Commissions (advisory bodies). Regarding the climate neutrality, the relevant ones are Commission for climate neutral city, Commission for Local Agenda 21, Commission for Smart City, Commission for Technical Services of the City, Commission for Municipal Forests, and Commission for Transport. Furthermore, there are Committees as: Financial Committees, Committee for Spatial Planning and Transport, Committee for Strategic Development, Committee for Education. Mentioned committees and commissions have the advisory role, they are expert and advisory bodies for city council/board representatives. Within the working process, city counsellors have regular meetings (both city board and city council), for each meeting are prepared materials by municipal departments officials/clerks, and these materials are discussed by propriate (regarding the topic of submitted material) committee(s) and/or commission(s) first. Usually, materials are discussed by specific city board commission, then are discussed by city board and when the city board approves it, the material is examined by city commission and approved by city council as final instance having a decision-making power.

Furthermore, for various city districts, there are Local Commissions (replacing former District Committees that can be established according to the Act No 128/2000 Coll., as an advisory and initiating body of the city council, which is decentralisation in case of self-government). Local Commissions are advisory bodies for city board, currently, these commissions are being established in accordance with new Principles for local commissions. Besides, there are professional working groups for diverse topics. These working groups are usually important in case of strategic planning, it is a way how to engage professional (mainly) and wide public to the process of strategic planning (strategic documents development).

# Key data on demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the city

Liberec is a developed and dynamic city with an industrial character, yet it offers extensive forests, water surfaces, and beautiful natural surroundings close to the city centre. This unique combination attracts visitors who come for skiing, hiking, cycling, and sightseeing, particularly to explore the city's architectural monuments. The architectural character of the city centre is still largely shaped by the major reconstruction that took place at the end of the 19th century, a period marked by significant cultural and economic growth in the city.

Regarding demographic data, Liberec shows a slight increase in both population and the average age of its citizens. Nearly 60% of residents have completed secondary education, placing Liberec among the leading regional cities in Czechia in this regard. Approximately 15% of citizens hold a university degree, which exceeds the national average. However, Liberec also has socially excluded areas—about 20 such areas across the city, typically represented by separate apartment buildings or small clusters of up to three houses. These areas are not spatially isolated but are economically disadvantaged. Approximately 6% of citizens are at risk of poverty and social exclusion, making this a visibly vulnerable group in Liberec. Additionally, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of migrants, particularly from Ukraine, as a result of the ongoing conflict.

In the field of housing, ensuring availability is becoming increasingly challenging and will require a conceptual and long-term approach. Currently, efforts are being made in the area of social housing. A sizeable portion of houses and apartment buildings (over 43%) were built before 1945, which poses challenges regarding energy efficiency. The low municipal ownership of housing apartments is also problematic, as it limits the capacity for social housing and reduces the city's ability to influence energy efficiency improvements. Additionally, the aging municipal housing stock leads to issues such as poor energy efficiency and, in some cases, unsafe conditions. Over the past 15 years, measures have been implemented to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions, including the replacement of old solid fuel boilers, thermal insulation upgrades, and improved lighting, supported by subsidies from the Operational Programme Environment and the (New) Green Savings Programme. Despite these efforts, there remains significant potential for further development of renewable energy sources (RES) in the city.

In the economic environment, despite the region's historically industrial character, the tertiary service sector now dominates, accounting for more than 60% of registered business entities. Industrial enterprises make up about 25%, while the primary sector—agriculture—constitutes only 2%. The largest companies in Liberec operate in the automotive, air conditioning, institutional healthcare, and construction sectors. Major employers include the Regional Hospital of the Liberec Region, Magna Exteriors Bohemia (automotive), DENSO Manufacturing Czech (automotive and air conditioning), and the Technical University of Liberec, among others. Liberec has two industrial zones where companies maintain close supplier-customer relationships and cooperate extensively. The labour market is characterized by a significantly above-average share of people employed in the manufacturing industry. However, the city's unemployment rate is above the national average. As the economic centre of the region, Liberec has a high rate of commuting for work and education. Liberec also shows strong potential in research and innovation, supported by its regional university, which includes various faculties and the renowned Centre for Nanomaterials (notably nanofibers). Expenditures in research and innovation have been trending upward over time. However, some weaknesses include a high dependence on manufacturing (indicating low diversification), a relatively high and persistent unemployment rate, a

significant number of immigrants with low educational attainment, and a limited transfer of research results into practical applications.

Regarding technical infrastructure and municipal property, Liberec faces several challenges. Some areas have technically inadequate water management infrastructure, and peripheral locations lack public water supply. Additionally, parts of the city have insufficient sewage systems, and the cost of water and sewage services is high. The city has a low share of locally generated electricity, leading to a high dependency on imports. Infrastructure for energy distribution and public lighting is underfunded, and the distribution network is not fully equipped to support individual electricity production and the development of electromobility. In terms of energy sources, about 70% of the electricity produced in the Liberec region in 2019 came from renewable energy sources: 27.1% from solar power, 27% from wind power, and 16% from hydropower. Nearly 80% of the region's total installed capacity is from power plants using ecological resources. The largest energy source in the area is the Teplárna Liberec heating plant, with an output of 12 MWh. The TERMIZO waste incinerator has an installed capacity of 2–3 MWh. Teplárna Liberec and TERMIZO constitute the most extensive central heat supply system, with TERMIZO being a highly efficient cogeneration source capable of providing heat for approximately 17,000 households through the central heat supply network. Over half of Liberec's heat is generated from waste energy, with a huge portion from natural gas. Notably, while natural gas plays a significant role in heat production across the Liberec region, the use of coal for heat production is negligible, which is a positive contrast to the Czech national average.

In the field of transportation, relevant data from the 2021 modal split survey conducted during the development of the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan shows that 40% of trips in Liberec were made by passenger cars, 26% on foot, and 12% by public bus transportation. Other modes had minimal usage: train (0.8%), motorbike (0.4%), taxi (0.1%), and e-bikes (1%). Compared to the overall situation in the Czech Republic, based on data from the Population and Housing Census, Liberec residents walk more than the national average. Regarding infrastructure for sustainable mobility, Liberec has one newly built P+R (Park and Ride) car park and a bike sharing system that includes e-bikes. The public transport bus fleet includes one electric bus and several CNG buses, which account for 36.2% of the fleet (source: 2022 annual report). Developing low-emission transport is crucial for the city's climate-neutrality goals. Therefore, expanding infrastructure for electromobility—covering passenger cars, public transport, and freight transport—is a current priority. The city is also increasingly focused on active mobility, ensuring that Liberec is fully and safely accessible on foot wherever possible. This involves improving public spaces, calming traffic in the city centre, and enabling the safe coexistence of all traffic participants. Efforts include building appropriate infrastructure such as sidewalks, smart and safe traffic signs, crossings, public transport facilities, and cycling lanes.

# Climate neutrality commitment and strategic planning

CCC Action Plan covers all city's existing climate action planning. The city's climate ambition is based on current strategic documents, plans, and vision, mainly on the master plan of the city, on the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan, The Local Energy Plan for the City and the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan. These documents contain measures related to pursuing the climate neutrality. In Liberec, above mentioned documents were developed or updated in a few last years, which was a wonderful opportunity to use both hard, primary, or secondary, data from related analysis, usually based on professional expertise, and "soft" data based on participation and engagement of public (citizens) and other stakeholders. It can be stated that the CCC Action Plan is an umbrella for all main strategic documents and as such replaces, and complements, SECAP - and goes even beyond its goal. CCC Action Plan brings together existing, ongoing, and planned efforts towards climate neutrality, beyond current commitments and besides these, there had to be set up additional measures and actions to be taken in following years (outlined in the action portfolio).

When developing several types of strategic documents, the city engages all key stakeholders, including citizens, municipal organizations, experts, and key players in relevant fields of action all over the city. This approach allows us to utilize data from public hearings, civic forums, surveys, and individual meetings.

In the City climate contract context, no city district was excluded, the whole territory of the city is included.

Moreover, many new challenges, opportunities, barriers, and gaps had to be considered and addressed to approach our climate neutrality ambition in a new way. Achieving climate neutrality is extraordinarily complex and requires intensive collaboration among all stakeholders, not only within the city but also beyond. This aspect of the process has been crucial and remains the most challenging for Liberec, both now and in the coming years.

Setting up fully functional, comprehensive, and mutual beneficial system of cooperation with all key stakeholders at local, regional, and national level is a goal that is crucial for the city in following months to be successful in the field of GHG emissions cut.

The city, as a municipality, was not accustomed to effectively cooperating and communicating with all key stakeholders. This means engaging in clear, genuinely participative, and regular collaboration—not just occasional interactions. Before we began working on this action plan, there had been little to no cooperation with most stakeholders from industry. Addressing this gap was a crucial first step in our mission. Recognizing this, we understand the need to build on the current system and evolve it into a truly comprehensive framework for cooperation, communication, education, and collaboration on common activities and projects. To achieve this, we plan to apply for the Enabling City Transformation Call with a proposal focused on building a system that strengthens commitment, increases

understanding and competence, and fosters collaboration across the city. Additionally, we are considering submitting a proposal under the European Urban Initiative's Energy Transition program.

## EU Mission – the opportunity for new-way thinking

Thanks to our participation in the mission, new opportunities and possibilities have emerged for the city, with this momentum accelerating as our work on the CCC progressed. These opportunities had three major features: First, as Liberec became more visible—being the only Czech city in the mission—many cities and institutions involved in research and innovation, both from Czechia and across Europe, approached us for collaboration. This opened the door to participation in various research projects, primarily funded by the Horizon Europe/2020 program. Before 2023, the city had never received direct support from the EU through Horizon funding. However, due to our involvement in the mission, we have now joined several research projects, including: Pilot city project “The Initiation of sustainable community energy for the city of Liberec” (as a lead partner of the consortium); ELABORATOR: Designing sustainable urban mobility towards climate-neutral cities (as a consortium partner); TURNAROUNDMONEY: Rethinking municipal finance (as a tested locality); CLIMATEFIT – Resilient Climate Financing and Investment Taskforces (as a tested locality) and other projects/calls/proposals that are currently under consideration.

Another positive impact on the city has been the overall strengthening of municipal capacity, particularly in terms of knowledge and finance. Thanks to the NetZeroCities platform, especially our city advisor, we received a wealth of information, knowledge, and experience through analytics, strategic documents, research works, online meetings, and informal chats with various experts across Europe. We were also provided with information about potential grant schemes, programs, and facilities to enhance our internal capacity in terms of finance and experienced professionals, as well as technical assistance. In this regard, we are interested in participating in the NZC Capital Hub to support the implementation of our City Climate Contract, specifically the investment plan, and to learn new financing methods and approaches to engaging various investors, including private and citizen capital. Our Pilot City project (Community Energy) has enabled us to achieve many synergies. Since the EU Mission does not allocate a specific budget for cities, we utilized the Pilot City budget to the fullest extent possible to increase the city's internal capacity and leverage overlaps. We successfully used the PCP budget and its outcomes to raise awareness about the EU Mission in Liberec and to generate interest among specific stakeholders. For example, community energy became a "tangible" project that initiated communication with vulnerable groups of citizens for both "projects." The PCP also played a significant role in engaging the industry and business sectors, where the clear benefits of community energy concepts facilitated easier communication at the outset. Additionally, we achieved synergies in collecting primary data for monitoring and analysis, which could be used for both "projects."

Another valuable aspect of this experience has been the opportunity to exchange and share our current knowledge in various specific fields, particularly related to our Pilot City project and the development of community energy. As a pioneer city in Czechia committed to climate neutrality, Liberec has attracted

attention. Given our membership in the National Healthy Cities Network and the Community Energy Union, we have been encouraged to share our experience and ambition in this field with other Czech cities. This is an ongoing effort that the city continues to pursue, with the support of the aforementioned networks and in collaboration with relevant Czech ministries. To further these efforts, it is essential to increase the municipal capacity within the transition team.

Following the above-mentioned experiences, searching for additional support at both regional and national levels has become a crucial part of our transition process. Recognizing the importance of this support was an "aha" moment for us. At the beginning of our mission participation, we sought to engage the Ministry of the Environment, which promised additional support in the form of higher subsidy ratios or interest-free loans to help us achieve our goals, provided we obtained the Mission Label. Throughout the past few months, we have communicated with various entities, including the CapaCities manager, the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic, CzechInvest, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and others. Despite numerous meetings, the recurring question was the specific form of support, whether through a particular project or a specific instrument to be tested. It took some time to realize that such support cannot be occasional; instead, it must be systematic, overarching, and cross-departmental. We also understand that cooperation with the national level must be mutual. This approach involves including ministry representatives in the entire co-creation process within the transition team. Since February 2024, the city has begun regular communication with the Ministry for Regional Development, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and the Ministry of the Environment. To influence relevant legislation, regulations, and strengthen the city's position in this field, Liberec also became a member of the Community Energy Union in 2023...

Last but not least, the entire CCC process has enabled us to strengthen our connections at the regional level. We began discussing potential collaborations and addressing capacity gaps, which led to ongoing communication with the Regional Development Agency, particularly in the fields of public education and energy. We also plan to submit a joint integrated project proposal under the LIFE programme, in collaboration with the Regional Office of the Liberec Region. The goal of this project is to build our capacities and hire specialists who would be shared between the municipal and regional offices (the Adaptation Coordinator for example).

In cooperation with all key stakeholders, key priorities for the CCC were identified. The focus areas include building refurbishment and the energy sector, the construction of renewable energy sources, the industrial sector, and transportation, with an emphasis on low-emission transport and active mobility support. Since Liberec is still at the beginning of its transformation process, collaboration with frontrunners is also crucial. In the city, this mainly involves the heating plant Teplárna Liberec and large industrial enterprises that are committed to achieving carbon neutrality in the future. Our flagship project centres on the initiation of energy communities within the city, as the sector of buildings and the production and consumption of renewable energy sources are critical according to the baseline emission inventory results. Alongside EPC projects currently under preparation, this initiative could yield significant and visible results for the city, helping to bridge the financial gap in the field of building refurbishment.

This Climate City Contract was developed as a living document that is supposed to be evolved, amended, and improved over time and other stakeholders will be joining this contract and commitment over time.

The city was at the very beginning of its climate neutrality strategic planning when it became one of the mission cities in 2022. Liberec has been a signatory of the Covenant of Mayors since 2016, and while the SECAP was developed afterward, noteworthy progress has been limited. Until now, the primary measures implemented have been on municipal buildings, focusing on those eligible for subsidy funding. These measures included insulation, overall building renovations, and modernizations aimed at energy savings, primarily in kindergartens and primary schools. Currently, several promising projects are either underway or in preparation, including community energy development initiatives such as the construction of a biogas station, EPC projects on municipal buildings, and the installation of photovoltaic systems on municipal building roofs. These projects, combined with EPC measures (energy savings initiatives), are expected to produce meaningful results. In addition, there is a focus on low-emission transport, particularly in connection with community energy development. Plans include the electrification of private passenger cars and freight transport, as well as the electrification of the public transport bus fleet. In addition to electric buses, a sizeable portion of the bus fleet will be powered by biogas produced at the biogas station.

At the beginning of the transition, it was essential to build a strong mandate for action, which took considerable time. A crucial step was appropriately engaging key stakeholders to share the municipal commitment and involve them in the action and investment plan, including their activities and budgets. We organized two roundtables to agree on key priorities and to secure stakeholders' involvement and interests. Following this, individual meetings were held with municipal deputies and key city stakeholders, allowing both sides to share their visions, discuss ongoing and planned projects, identify sources of funding, and address barriers and threats. Key priorities were further validated through two civic forums. Internally, for city employees involved in this process, a "Climate Fresk" workshop was organized to provide education in the field of climate. As we progressed, we reviewed all relevant projects, synergies, and complementarities to accelerate the city's green transition.

In spring 2024, we began deeper collaboration with the Ministry for Regional Development, focusing on mutual efforts, including the establishment of a national platform for Czech cities with climate neutrality ambitions. This process also involved the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports, and the National Healthy Cities Network. These institutions have connected the city with valuable professionals, other institutions, projects, and events. We plan to further advance this cooperation as specific projects are implemented over time.

## Next steps and outlook:

We need to focus on further development across multiple levels. Based on the results of the baseline emission inventory, our primary focus should be on the buildings and equipment sector. It is essential to define a long-term strategy for comprehensive building renovations to meet the requirements of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD IV) and achieve significant emissions reductions. Simultaneously, we must prioritize the construction of renewable energy sources, which also involves several layers of action.

Firstly, the city needs to strengthen its internal capacity, both in terms of financial resources and the professionals responsible for driving this development forward. Regarding the buildings sector, the city plans to:

use all possible funding sources relevant for buildings refurbishment and RES construction.
continue with EPC projects on municipal buildings;
use potential of Social Climate Fund fully
use other finance opportunities for renewables construction (including private investors and citizens' finance)

be focused on sharing all information with wide public, to continue working on long term renovation plan with public, to act as an advisory (technical assistance) body for public for free (to be a contact consultancy point)
to build knowledge, understanding and commitment among politicians, city hall employees and clerks, citizens, and other key stakeholders (improved decision-making based on complex knowledge, behavioural change)

learn how to attract private capital, use financial innovations, learn how to develop bankable project proposals and investment plans.
in this field we will use the potential of current projects and instruments fully, i.e. project TURNAROUNDMONEY, CLIMATEFIT, Initiation of Sustainable Energy Community for the City of Liberec, NZC Capital Hub, best practice across the Europe (NetZeroCities Portal)

build an innovative and Smart City environment in Liberec.
learn how to use and involve new and smart technologies, innovations,
follow good practice from abroad.
cooperate in this field with the Ministry of Industry and Trade, CzechInvest Agency and Technological Agency of the Czech Republic, innovative start-ups.
cooperate with the Technical University in Liberec as the main centre of science, research, innovation and education in the city.

continue to negotiate/cooperate with institutions at the regional level.
to work together on building internal capacity
to cooperate in the field of public education, raising awareness about climate-neutrality and promoting relevant projects for wide public in Liberec

to cooperate with the Regional Development Agency in the field of public education, raising awareness about climate-neutrality and promoting relevant projects for professional public and industry sector in Liberec

continue to negotiate/cooperate with institutions at national level.
to negotiate further support for the city in the field of buildings' refurbishment and RES construction finance,
to participate in design of new funding programmes and incentives as for example Social Climate Fund and instruments following future strategy on long-term renovation of buildings in the Czech Republic.

Furthermore, we are fully committed to supporting the establishment of a national platform for climate-neutral cities, following the European model and best practices. The city has communicated this initiative with relevant Czech ministries and representatives of the CapaCities project. Our focus is on strengthening the city's capacities, fostering mutual support and cooperation, and building a functional system that can be adopted by other Czech cities. Liberec, on one hand, requires additional support from ministries to enhance its capacity for implementing the CCC Action Plan. On the other hand, the city is ready to share its experience and knowledge with other Czech cities, helping them follow Liberec's example. Another key aspect of our cooperation with Czech ministries and related institutions involves negotiating amendments to legislation and regulations to better facilitate the climate-neutrality transition. Equally important is the need for systematic public education across the country. The current approach to educating young people must be revised to prioritize sustainability. Additionally, adult citizens should receive appropriate education in this area to fully understand the issues and make more sustainable decisions. This also applies to politicians and public administration employees, who must be adequately informed and trained to support this transition effectively.

In conclusion, we have determined that the crucial area of action is buildings and facilities. This means that the key stakeholders include building stock owners (primarily households, housing cooperatives, and industry), the Ministry of the Environment (responsible for subsidy programs in this field), the State Environmental Fund of the Czech Republic, and the Ministry of Industry and Trade, which is responsible for the long-term strategy of building refurbishment.

Regarding the current networking, both horizontal and vertical, it can be stated that future iterations of the CCC Action Plan will include more stakeholders (i.e., more signatories of the commitment) and provide more detailed information about the buildings sector. This will align with the forthcoming long-term strategy for building refurbishment, which must be shaped in accordance with the EU Directive and the new Social Climate Fund currently under development. Additionally, linked to the Action Plan portfolio and based on the aforementioned information, the financial sources will be further specified and detailed.

# 2 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

This part of the CCC Action Plan describes mainly results of GHG emissions baseline inventory. Our first emission inventory was calculated for SECAP development needs in 2018. This inventory was performed only for chosen sectors and on $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions. Emissions were calculated for sectors as municipal buildings, equipment/facilities; tertiary buildings, equipment/facilities; residential buildings; municipal public lighting; urban road transportation: municipal fleet, public transportation, private and commercial transportation (part of it – included roads owned by the city); urban rail transportation (tramways and local trains). This inventory was updated in 2022 and because of pandemic covid situation (to avoid the data distortion) the emissions were calculated for year 2019. Since above mentioned sectors and type(s) of GHG emissions were not complete for the CCC Action Plan scope, we needed to complete the baseline emission inventory, to complete sectors and types of GHG emissions. This inventory was calculated in 2023 and to be able to link this data with the data from updated SECAP, the inventory was calculated for year 2019. All mentioned calculations, observations and estimations were performed by the Enviros company that was an external advisory body in case of both SECAP and CCC development.

Regarding the final energy use by sources sectors, following tables shows the sector of Transport, detailed information on municipal fleet, public transport, and private and commercial road transport.

Table 4: Final energy use by source sectors - details on municipal cars

|  fossil fuel | 306 |  |  | 306  |
|  Biofuel | 18 |  |  | 18  |
|  Electricity | 0 | 30 | 0 | 30  |

It is obvious that municipal fleet needs to be completely renewed and electrified. There are still municipal cars using fossil fuels and we are aware that city needs to be frontrunner and good role-model in this field.

Table 5: Final energy use by source sectors - details on public transport

|  CNG | 8 782 | 0 | 0 | 8 782  |
|  Electricity | 0 | 6 380 | 0 | 6 380  |

The table detailing public transport indicates that the current fleet includes both diesel and CNG buses, with trams utilizing electricity. Regarding public buses, the city needs to continue greening its fleet by incorporating more low-emission vehicles. In 2023, electric buses were tested, but due to inadequate (slow) charging infrastructure and the city's hilly terrain, this option was not deemed effective. The city plans to continue using CNG buses, particularly since a biogas station will soon be operational in Liberec and will be connected to the main transport company via a community energy network. This approach has been assessed as the most effective way to reduce emissions in public transport.

The possibility of using hydrogen as a fuel for public transport was considered, but the technology is currently too expensive. Moreover, the challenge lies in the requirement to use only green hydrogen.

Table A-1.1 provides details on private and commercial road transport, showing that passenger cars powered by fossil fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, have a significant impact. Freight vehicles also contribute notably to energy use in private transport. It is crucial to continue the electrification of private vehicles and to support this transition by developing appropriate infrastructure. Additionally, engaging with industry and private companies is essential to address the electrification of freight transport. Public education plays a vital role in transforming decision-making processes toward more sustainable choices. We need to encourage citizens to prefer public transport and make conscious, environmentally friendly decisions.

Table A-1.3 shows that highest share of GHG emissions was produced in the sector of buildings. Higher use in scope 2 is caused by the use of electricity. In the sector of waste, there were calculated zero emissions because of used methodology where there since there is the incinerator in Liberec, emissions from waste are calculated in sector of buildings in total.

Above mentioned data are presented in a more details below:

* In 2000 there was not included transport on state and region-owned roads, only on local ones, and electromobility. Also only  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  was monitored, not other types of GHGs, the table still shows the difference, is relevant for comparison over time.

Following picture shows comparison of emissions level over time, in year 2019 compared to 2000.

# Assessment and description

The data presented above on emissions is a synthesis from the SECAP and the baseline emission inventory, which supplemented the SECAP results. Both sets of data and calculations are valid for the year 2019. The SECAP did not include all mandatory sectors and GHG types, necessitating the completion of the emission inventory. To maintain consistency and avoid data distortion caused by the impacts of COVID-19, 2019 was chosen as the best baseline year for this purpose.

When we examine the data, it is clear that the city achieved the goal set by the Covenant of Mayors, namely a  $20\%$  reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020 compared to the 2000 baseline year. A closer look at the reduction across all included sectors reveals that this decrease was primarily driven by changes in the household sector, as illustrated in the following picture.

# Picture 3: Final energy consumption in households (corrected to normal climatic conditions)

In recent years, many households have benefited from refurbishment subsidies aimed at replacing energy sources and insulating buildings, such as those provided by the Green Savings program and boiler subsidies for the replacement of solid fuel boilers. The boiler subsidies were particularly significant, targeting low-income households and covering a high percentage of eligible expenses. The supported types of heating systems included gas condensing boilers, electric and gas heat pumps, and biomass boilers. These initiatives were the primary drivers of emissions reduction in Liberec. Additionally, new housing construction and improvements in the energy performance of existing apartments have also contributed to the reduction in emissions in recent years.

Specific measures designed in households are presented by following table:

|  Measure | Implementation costs incl. VAT [thousand CZK] | Reduction of CO2 emissions in 2020 [t/y] | Reduction of CO2 emissions in 2030 [t/y] | Specific investments in emission reduction [CZK/t CO2]  |

The table provides a detailed breakdown showing that the most significant emissions reductions were achieved through thermal insulation of buildings, the exclusion of remaining coal boilers from households, the replacement of lighting with LED fittings, and the upgrading of domestic electrical appliances. Thermal insulation measures for residential buildings and family houses included improvements to the operational efficiency of heating systems and enhancements to the thermal resistance of key building structures. Moving forward, it is crucial to complete the refurbishment of the remaining buildings. The city should play an active role in this process by simplifying permitting procedures to the maximum extent, promoting awareness, and providing consultancy services to support residents in implementing these energy-saving measures.

Recent energy efficiency measures implemented in the housing stock have primarily focused on retrofitting existing panel housing through thermal insulation and window replacement. This effort has also extended to the retrofitting of older brick houses, funded mainly by the Czech Savings Bank and the Integrated Regional Operating Programme. Additional measures include thermal insulation and the use of renewable energy sources (RES) in family houses, supported by the New Green Savings Programme. Other significant initiatives include the retrofitting of heat sources, insulation and upgrading of heating systems, installation of building exchange stations, and enhancement of technical equipment. Furthermore, there has been support for new residential construction aimed at specific target groups, such as retirees, people in need, and youth leaving children's homes, ensuring these new buildings meet low-energy standards.

In addition to residential buildings, many municipal buildings, particularly primary schools, and kindergartens, were completely refurbished. This was made possible through subsidies from the Operational Programme Environment.

The following picture illustrates the energy performance of buildings based on their construction period, taking into account any retrofits that have been implemented. The potential for energy savings was calculated by comparing the specific energy consumption for space heating in existing buildings with the new standard requirements for thermal protection of buildings. The calculated heat consumption for

# Picture 5: Energy performance of buildings according to period of construction considering implemented retrofits

The potential calculation for 2030 comes from the assumption that buildings retrofits will meet the requirements of 730540-2:2011 CSN Standard and the legislative requirements for energy performance of buildings. According to the current legislation, as of 2021 building retrofits will require achieving cost-optimal specific indicator level, which complies with the requirement of 730540-2:2011 CSN Standard and legislative requirements for energy performance of buildings pursuant to Act 406/2000 Coll. as amended. We assume that in 2030 the buildings retrofits will have to meet the recommendation of 730540-2:2011 CSN Standard and the legislative requirement for energy performance of buildings. The specific indicators used for the reference are then correspond to these values.

The reduction in energy consumption in existing dwellings, resulting from decreased energy intensity, will offset the increase in energy consumption caused by new construction. The following figure illustrates the reduction in specific energy consumption per dwelling from 2000 to 2015.

There is a clear reduction in emissions in public transport due to the purchase of low-emission vehicles. However, this transition needs to be fully completed, with the transport company transforming its fleet entirely to zero-emission and low-emission vehicles. In contrast, emissions from private and commercial vehicles have increased, as the number of passenger cars continues to rise over time, with only minimal shifts in fuel types (electrification).

## 2.2 Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

Following part list all relevant policies, strategies, initiatives, or regulations at local, regional, and national level.

In general, there can be stated that when developing new local strategic documents, there is always paid attention to compliance both with regional and national documents and policies and sectoral strategies connections as well.

This CCC Action Plan aims to cover all valid strategic documents, current climate commitments and to be an umbrella document for the city's ambition to become climate-neutral city.

Module A-2 "Current Policies and Strategies" lists and assesses relevant existing policies, strategies, initiatives, or regulation at local, regional, and national level. Following table includes also the evaluation of the given strategy importance to the city climate commitment on a scale from 1 to 3, where 1 represents the lowest importance and 3 the greatest importance in terms of this document ambition.

In the field of suggested actions in relation to presented strategies, this part is developed in a more detail in the Module C-1. In general, there are many strategic documents aiming at the same problems, covering all fields of action. Overall problem is the phase of documents' implementation, which is a problem of available public and private funds deployment, financial innovation testing, developing investment cases, broad public participation including citizens' capital, issue of multi-level governance etc.

This assessment contributes to identification of the gap between the emissions reduction due to existing initiatives and the city's 2030 climate neutrality target. Filling this gap by identifying additional actions and levers to achieve the city's emission reduction target is the focus of this Action Plan.

The assessment of current policies and strategies offers hence a starting point for exploring the impact pathways (Part C).

When developing the CCC Action Plan, we revised all documents mentioned here, all relevant measures that have not been realized were moved to the CCC Action Plan portfolio, projects from SECAP, Local Energy Strategy and Integrated Territorial Investment Strategy. There can be stated that there is a common barrier for enabling successful implementation of those strategies and policies.
First, there is crucial to increase internal capacity of the city, both in terms of finance and number and quality of professionals working for the city. Currently, there is lack of finance for implementation of those documents, which is common situation for almost all cities and furthermore, Liberec is quite indebted city. In case of number of professionals contributing to strategic documents implementation, we already submitted the EUCF proposal to be able to pay for finance specialist who would help to implement the CCC Investment Plan. Furthermore, there is a new position of CCC coordinator, there will be new position of the Adaptation Coordinator, both of them will be  |

# A-2.1: Description &amp; assessment of policies

The above-mentioned tables show that policies, strategies and other related documents cover all important parts of this mission. There are many plans, sectoral documents and regulations at all levels following the EU principles and the overall focus. When developing strategic documents at the local level, quality of such documents has increased significantly over time, also the level of public participation in terms of professional public and broad public (citizens). Superior (regional and national) documents are followed as well. Problematic is their implementation because there is a lack of capacity in terms of funding and expertise, mainly at the municipal level.

## Municipal strategic documents:

All strategic documents are updated regularly and implemented via action plans. What is important for this mission is that all key strategic documents were updated quite recently:

Master plan for the city (2022)
Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (2022)
Adaptation Strategy (2023)
Integrated Territorial Investment Strategy for the Agglomeration of Liberec and Jablonec nad Nisou (2023)
Sustainable energy and climate action plan update (2022)

All those documents represent a basis for this Climate Action Plan.

In case of master plan, mitigation and adaptation activities are supported by these specific goals and measures:

**Specific goal: Urbanism and public space**

Increase in the city accessibility

**Specific goal Transportation and transport infrastructure**

Accessible, comfortable, and sustainable public transport
Support for cycle transport, cycle tourism and pedestrian transport
Support for electromobility and other alternative fuels
Education in the field of sustainable urban mobility

**Specific goal Technical infrastructure**

Effective development and management of public lighting, including light signalling equipment
Support for reconstruction, optimization and ensuring the efficiency of central heat supply system, construction in separate locations
Insulation of municipal buildings, support for energy-saving solutions, energy management development
Support for the development of renewable energy sources within the local energy sector (where there are supported activities such as municipal energy system re-design including management of energy consumption and its regulation, community energy projects based on renewable resources, maximum use of renewable energy sources in the city's public buildings, in municipal buildings institutions, city organizations and other subjects)

**Specific goal the Environment**

Strategic approach to environmental issues
Support for alternative energy sources, including decentralized energy production
The climate-responsible city (where there is included action plans implementation: climate, energy, blue-green infrastructure, sustainable mobility; new job positions, strategic decision making for the climate, creation of circular urban economy, ecological running of the city)

**Specific goal High-quality public administration/government**

Innovation implementation and optimization of processes, implementation of smart solutions and principles of smart city

# Legislation, regulation, and barriers at the national level:

Overall legislation in the field of climate transition is shaped on international agreements and conventions and the EU legislation as the Paris Agreement and the Green Deal for Europe, the Fit for 55 policy package. The most important above mentioned strategic documents for the national level are the National Energy and Climate Plan and National Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan. Like the EU, the Czech Republic is committed to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and as a part of the Climate Policy, has been set the goal of reducing the GHG emissions by 44 Mt by 2030 compared to 2005. In 2019, compared to 1990, GHG emissions were reduced by approx. one-third due to the abandonment of heavy industry in the 1990s.

In the field of energy, Czech Republic needs to approve its national **Czech Climate Law** following The European Climate Law regarding the target of reducing net GHG emissions by at least 65 % by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Czech Republic is committed to complying with the Paris Agreement; to be able to do so, we need to set up appropriate mechanism since decarbonisation is slow and inefficient now.

New climate law is under preparation now and should create clear and understandable conditions for counsellors and mayors, under which they will receive state support and will be able to co-design and co-decide on part of the investments. Decision making on climate investments will be brought closer to citizens. Other benefit is legal enforcement where courts can order authorities to act in accordance with the law and this is what new climate law will allow – since big problem in Czechia is that there are many strategic document but no one enforces them. It means Czech current obligations are not enforceable, this reduces legal certainty. In addition, we do not have a mechanism to invest about one trillion crowns meaningfully (allocation to reduce emissions. The law brings transparency to the fulfilment of climate goals, it will be clear to everyone who makes relevant decision about what and why, on what basis and what facts to take into account.

The law will indirectly support the development of renewable energy sources, but in itself does not change the necessity of assessing the impact of each project on the landscape and other components of the environment according to local conditions. This is regulated by other laws. Furthermore, this law will motivate the use of land in a way that ensures greater capture of carbon from the atmosphere, especially in forestry and agriculture. However, it will be necessary to revise the way the sequestration calculation has been done so far to incentivize, for example, sequestering carbon in the soil of old unharvested forests instead of growing wood for thermal power plants, which releases all the sequestered carbon back into the atmosphere.

In addition to the climate law, there would be useful to set up **a climate council**, an expert advisory body consisting of independent experts and professionals in science, energy, transport, society, and nature protection. Such council would help the government to develop the long-term goals and monitor emissions reduction. There is an ordinary understanding that major barrier for further development not only of RES is the absence of effective climate legislation that would ensure the fulfilment of European goals. The Climate Council would be able to monitor the fulfilment of the promised obligations, publish knowledge and scenarios in the area of reducing emissions and communicate everything with the public and the media. Such body would bring scientific patronage, now only for the government to review and assess plans, but also externally. Such council would be a kind of a mediator, a body that stands between all affected areas, it should provide advice as well as review decisions.

# Governance structure for the implementation of national energy and climate policies

The EU's climate and energy targets for reducing emissions, increasing the share of renewable energy sources, and increasing energy efficiency are also being written into Czech climate and energy

policies. The Czech targets are contained in the National Energy and Climate Plan, the State Energy Concept, and the Climate Protection Policy. These policies are now being updated and their objectives and direction must be implemented at all levels of government and the private sector. To effectively implement national energy and climate policies, there are several important bodies responsible for various activities related to adaptation and mitigation measures, strategic understanding, and investment support for transport, energy, climate protection, and the environment. These bodies include:

**Ministry of Environment**: This ministry is responsible for the preparation of the National Climate and Energy Plan and the Climate Protection Policy. It is also responsible for environmental protection, sustainable development, trading of emission allowances, adaptation and mitigation measures, measures related to energy efficiency, insulation of buildings, exchange of heat sources, RES, and low-emission transport.

**Ministry of Industry and Trade**: This ministry is responsible for the preparation of the State Energy Concept and energy law, also provides advisory services and support for the energy sector, and renewable energy sources (such as wind energy), work towards reducing dependence on fossil fuels and supports businesses.

**Ministry of Agriculture**: The policy of this ministry is focused on sustainable agriculture and forestry, which can have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions and the preservation of land as a carbon reservoir.

**Ministry of Transport**: This ministry's primary focus is to reduce emissions from transport and promote sustainable modes of transport such as development of the public transport.

## Decarbonization of building sector

The **buildings sector** is crucial to reducing emissions. Cities like Liberec must take responsibility and set an example as model investors and property managers by ensuring that their buildings are ecologically friendly. Systematic support for quality planning is a vital part of the decarbonization process, along with the preparation of sustainable public procurement practices. This includes promoting the use of natural, recycled, and other materials with a low carbon footprint. These efforts are influenced by Law No. 134/2016 Coll. on public procurement, which governs and impacts local procurement practices. At the legislative level, it is crucial to establish a predictable legal environment. This requires the timely and high-quality implementation of relevant directives, clear interpretation of EU Taxonomy rules, and adjustment of funding regulations for projects focused on energy efficiency and material conservation. To support these efforts, a sustainable materials database is currently being developed to help navigate the environmental impacts of materials used in the construction industry, including their energy efficiency.

On March 12, 2024, the European Parliament approved the revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), which is one of the flagship legislative acts for reducing energy needs in buildings. The Czech Republic now has two years to implement this directive, which will primarily involve amendments to Act 406/2000 Coll. on Energy Management and Decree 264/2020 Sb. on Energy Performance of Buildings. Currently, there is no comprehensive energy certification for all buildings, making it challenging to identify which buildings require renovation. As a result, the pace of renovations and the implementation of climate commitments will need to intensify, presenting significant challenges, particularly for lower levels of government.

The decarbonization of the building sector may be affected by:

High investment costs associated with the renovation of buildings;
Legislative barriers - obtaining a permit or announcing a building, fire safety regulations;
Unclear conditions for funding for low-carbon construction projects in relation to the EU Taxonomy;
Shortage of skilled labour and companies;
Poor material availability;
Preservation of buildings and heritage zones;
A

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

Energy price volatility (less motivation to carry out renovations);
Insufficient advice service/network on energy saving, renovation, and decarbonisation of buildings;
Insufficient flexible financial support for the development of the sector;
Emissions targets for buildings are not being met (unsatisfactory building quality, risks associated with lack of interest from building owners etc.);
Lack of availability and scalability of tools for environmental assessment of buildings;
The unavailability of data on the housing stock, as well as the lack of official data on emission intensities of sources (For decarbonisation planning and design of new buildings and for planning energy-saving measures in existing buildings, in addition to the available methodology, there is a need for up-to-date official information on the emission intensities of individual energy sources and guidance on how to calculate emission factors for future years).

## Decarbonization transport sector

The transport sector is responsible for approximately 16% of emissions in the Czech Republic. Unlike other sectors, transport emissions are on the rise, contributing to local pollution. The country is facing an increasing dependence on car travel, exacerbated by its dispersed settlement pattern, consisting of 6,254 municipalities, half of which have fewer than four hundred inhabitants. This diversity in settlement patterns puts pressure on transportation infrastructure, the availability of public transit, and increases reliance on car travel. The lack of compactness and the distance between cities further strain municipal and regional budgets, which must ensure the integration of transportation systems, particularly in providing regular services such as buses or trains. The primary methods for reducing carbon emissions in the transportation sector include promoting a modal shift, reducing the need for travel, and electrifying transportation. The legal framework influencing the development of transport infrastructure includes Act No. 361/2000 Coll. (the Road Traffic Act), Act No. 13/1997 Coll. (the Roads Act), Act No. 56/2001 Coll. (the Act on Conditions of Vehicle Operation on Roads), and Act No. 416/2009 Coll. (the Line Act, which focuses on accelerating the construction of infrastructure). Additionally, Decree No. 501/2006 Coll. sets general requirements for land use, including standards for parking areas, as outlined by the Czech technical standard for the design of local roads (ČSN 73 6110 - Design of Local Roads), which applies throughout the Czech Republic, except in Prague. The main strategic document guiding transport policy in the country is the "Transport Policy for 2021-2027," developed by the Ministry of Transport, with a focus extending to 2050. This document is crucial in shaping the future of transportation infrastructure and policy in the Czech Republic.

The concept of sustainable mobility plays a crucial role in transportation planning, grounded in the principles of sustainable development. It encompasses a range of mobility options, including walking and active mobility, public transport, bike-sharing, scooter-sharing, carsharing, and carpooling. At the national level, this concept is further developed in the "Concept for Urban and Active Mobility 2021-2030." Implementing this concept requires a place-based approach that takes into account specific territorial characteristics in local planning efforts, such as Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP), cyclo-generals, and plans for barrier-free routes. Biofuels, as a renewable alternative to fossil fuels, can also play a significant role in the transport sector. Selected parts of the "Fit for 55" package directly or indirectly influence the production and use of biofuels, including the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III). At the national level, the management of biofuels is governed by Government Regulation No. 107/2022 Coll., which outlines sustainability criteria for biofuels and mandates the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fuels, as well as by Act No. 201/2012 Coll. on Air Protection.

The decarbonization of the transport sector may be affected by:
A

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

More than 6.5 million registered vehicles and heavy reliance on individual car transport (behavioural aspects)
Very dispersed urban development with a low population per km2
Operation of inefficient transport links at a lower level (region/municipality), which carries a heavy financial burden;
Shortage of public transport drivers (long-term high employment rate int the Czechia, in remote areas)
Slow implementation of innovation and digitalisation in the transport sector
Insufficient professional capacity in the sector
Complicated and slow legislative permitting of infrastructure constructions, including land purchase (heavily urbanized area, complications in building permitting);
Increasing costs of fleet operation (in the future in relation to the implementation of ETS2)
The absence of a charging infrastructure as one of the key barriers to the development of electromobility;
The slow development of alternative fuels and the use of hydrogen in transport;
slow onset of electrification of transport;
The legal environment surrounding public procurement and concessions can pose challenges for transportation development in smaller municipalities;
Insufficient flexible financial support for the development of the sector

# The renewable energy sources development and the development of community and shared energy

Currently, renewable energy accounts for about  $17\%$  of the Czech Republic's total energy consumption, with  $6\%$  coming from photovoltaic (PV) and wind power plants (WPP). The vast majority of this renewable energy is derived from various forms of biomass. However, the Czech Republic is lagging in the construction of renewable energy sources (RES), and it is essential to accelerate this development. The energy crisis that began in 2021 has heightened the urgency to implement measures that enable effective decarbonization. In response, the country's energy legislation is being progressively amended. The first amendment, known as Lex RES 1, was passed to simplify the construction of renewable energy sources. At the end of 2023, Lex RES 2 was enacted, establishing rules for community energy and electricity sharing. The forthcoming Lex RES 3 will set out the regulations for energy storage and the aggregation of flexibility. These legislative changes will make it easier for households, local governments, and other entities to build renewable energy sources. They will also facilitate the establishment of energy communities and the sharing of electricity among participants, thereby promoting a more decentralized and sustainable energy system in the Czech Republic.

For the Czech Republic, the National Climate and Energy Plan, the State Energy Strategy and the Climate Protection Policy in the Czech Republic are essential documents. It delivers a plan that will lead to a major reduction in greenhouse gases and long-term climate neutrality by 2050. All these documents are currently being updated. These strategies will significantly influence strategic planning at the local level and the construction of renewable energy sources.

The construction of renewable energy sources may be affected by:

The opportunities involved in the planning and construction of the RES in Liberec and its surrounding areas may be affected by the upcoming so-called acceleration zones. The demarcation of suitable areas for RES in individual land-use planning instruments (updates of the Czech Republic's Land-Use Development Policy) will significantly (accelerate and simplify) the permitting process. It will be a renewable energy facility, such as solar parks or wind farms.
An amendment to Act No. 334/1992 Coll., on the Protection of the Agricultural Soil Fund is currently in the legislative approval process, which should also allow for the development of agrivoltaics.
A

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

The planning and permitting process for building renewables is very bureaucratically limiting and lengthy. This discourages developers and causes the failure to meet the targets of the RES construction.
The construction of renewable energy sources, such as wind farms, is not always well-received by the public. People may not want them built near their homes due to concerns about noise, impact on animals, and protection of the landscape. This is commonly referred to as the NIMBY effect. This problem goes together with an absence of public education at the national level, it is crucial to explain properly the current energy situation and the role of the RES construction. Citizens often speak out against the construction within the framework of landscape character preservation. It is necessary to emphasize the public interest in the construction that would maintain the current living standard.
It will be necessary to strengthen the grid for the wider development of RES, as well as the promotion of community and municipal energy. An energy data centre is planned to operate by 2026, which will make many of these activities more efficient and flexible.
In the case of the permitting process, as a part of the construction permitting procedure, the new Building Act and its amendment led to certain simplifications and digitization of the entire procedure, however, some barriers remain, for example, public access to proceedings, the possibility of appeal, etc. Long deadlines for decisions are even in conflict with the EU Council Regulation Nr. 2022/2577. In this context, it is necessary to draw attention to the act that the Czech Republic has not yet transposed the Directive Nr. 2019/944 On common rules for the internal electricity market, which includes the establishment of a so-called single point of contact among the requirements for simplifying the authorization processes. It is supposed to be an entity to which the applicant for the issuance of a permit for the generation of electricity from RES will submit one application and will not be forced to get other statements and approvals for the state administration body. The opportunity is the newly established Transport and Energy Building Office which was established on the basis of the amendment to the Building Act in 2023, this body should ensure the uniformity of the approach to permitting constructions and also sufficient expertise of the officials.
The adoption of so-called acceleration zones for the development of renewable energy sources (wind and solar), which are currently under drafting, will help to speed up and simplify the process of RES development. Depending on the importance of each zone, the state, regions, and municipalities will be in charge of defining the acceleration zones (this will not apply to NATURA 2000 areas, national parks, and some protected landscape areas).

## Decarbonisation of the industrial sector

The Czech Republic is a highly industrialised country. In 2021, the Czech industry produced thirty-one megatons of CO2eq, which represents about 24% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the Czech Republic. The production of emissions by these companies is limited by the market for emission allowances. The largest GHG emitters are the cement, whitewash, steel and metals, fertilizers and chemicals sectors, and related other manufacturing sectors. The industrial sector accounts for a significant share of the economy's gross value added. It also employs the largest number of people (about 28% of employment in this sector) and is well above the European average compared to other countries.

Modernisation of production is expected, in particular through gradual electrification, introduction of RES or use of hydrogen technologies. In the field of hydrogen use, the Czech Republic has its Hydrogen Strategy from 2021. Furthermore, it is envisaged to make production more efficient, implement modern technologies contributing to emission reduction and energy savings. Furthermore, the use of CO2 capture technologies and its further use or geological storage (i.e. carbon capture, utilisation, and storage) is envisaged. There are already small-scale projects here in the Czech Republic. The EU has produced the mechanism for a just transition, which is supposed to help Member States with a difficult transition both financially and technically. In the Czech Republic, it is implemented from 2021 as the Just Transition Operational Programme, which brings funding to three coal regions (Moravskoslezský, Ústecký a Karlovarský) to help them with their transition to a low-

carbon economy. The strategy for the three coal regions in the country is then addressed by the RE:START Strategy. The modernisation of industry (not only) for the whole country is then financed mainly from the Modernisation Fund, which is financed from emissions trading.

The decarbonization of the industrial sector may be affected by:

Insufficient investment in modern technologies
Insufficient electrification and deployment of renewables
Higher price of emission allowances
Historical context of industrial development in the Czech Republic
insufficient resources invested in education, science, and research in the field of modern technologies and development e.g. CCUS
Insufficient policies for further development of regions and economic transformation where heavy industry is located (so-called structurally affected regions)
Fear of job loss for many people in structurally affected regions

# The waste management sector

According to MOE data, the Czech population generated 39.9 million tonnes of all waste in 2021, including 1.6 million tonnes of hazardous waste and 38.3 million tonnes of other waste. Total emissions are around six million tonnes CO2eq of greenhouse gases, which represents about  $5\%$  of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the Czech Republic. The waste management sector is regulated in the Czech Republic by Act No. 541/2020 Coll., Waste, which is in accordance with Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste. An important objective is, in particular, to end landfilling of waste by 2030. The overarching document for this area is the Circular Czech Republic 2040 Strategic Framework approved by the Government in 2021, which also prioritizes ending landfilling, promoting recycling, waste prevention, and material reuse of waste, etc., the document also has an implementation plan. There is also a link to Act No. 254/2001 Coll., on Water, and related decrees and regulations, and Act No. 76/2002 Coll., on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control ensures water protection and purification. Water pollution is a long-standing problem in the Czech Republic. Other important Acts are 477/2001 Coll., on the packaging and 542/2020 Coll., on end-of-life products, 243/2022 Coll., on limiting the environmental impact of selected plastic products. From 2025, municipalities must sort at least  $60\%$ , from 2030 at least  $65\%$  and from 2035 at least  $70\%$  of mixed municipal waste. Methane reduction in the management of biodegradable municipal waste is also an important aspect.

The waste sector may be affected by:

Insufficiently interconnected sectors to fulfil the principles of the circular economy, connected with lack of comprehensive education and linkages between different sectors to apply circular principles;
Insufficient human capacity and innovation environment
Hygiene regulations (and standards) may also limit recycling and other related sectors related to waste and its careful use (single plastic use etc.);
Excessive bureaucracy and an unfriendly regulatory environment;
Insufficient incentives and price signals for companies and other sectors to recycle and reuse waste;
Continuous growth in the total amount of waste generated and an underdeveloped treatment market;
Insufficient control and monitoring (e.g. in case of landfill penalties, thorough recycling of building materials, etc.);
A

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

Producers are not sufficiently accountable for the production of their products and their future use;
Complex backup systems and incentive systems for their use are still lacking;
Lack of digitalization and monitoring of waste streams;
Lack of technological innovation (sorting lines, automatization, waste treatment).

# 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

Module A-3 “Systemic Barriers to 2030 Climate Neutrality” documents and describes the stakeholder system, mapping, and the whole ecosystem mapping and identification of systemic barriers and opportunities.

First, specific barriers and opportunities were identified for each sector. This mapping was developed in collaboration with municipal departments, and the consolidated results are listed in the table below. In general, the barriers and opportunities in Liberec are largely similar to those in other Czech cities, as the overall environment—comprising legislation, regulation, subsidies, and public mentality—is primarily shaped at the national level. However, there are also some local specifics unique to Liberec that have been considered.

|  Identifying specific barriers and opportunities for each sector  |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Sector | Barriers | Opportunities  |
|  1. Climate change
(mitigation/adaptation areas, meeting the climate goals) | 1.1 Lack of funding for adaptation/mitigation measures. In particular, the volatility of the subsidy environment, increasing administrative burden and demands on subsidy providing, and insufficient flexibility of financial support. (Ministry of Finance, Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of the Regional Development).
Complexity of implementation at the municipal level. Lack of knowledge of the environment and climate area (municipal level)
Shortage of experts and capacities, no funding for increasing overall capacities (all levels).
Unclear subsidy environment (local, regional level)
Unclear and complex legislative environment – at the national level (local level) | 1.7 Potential for financial support and grants (Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Regional Development - mobility, Ministry of Industry and Trade – climate positive infrastructure (wind power plants, CCUS), Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs – innovation projects ).
Provide methodological support for grant calls related to decarbonization measures. (Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of the Environment)
Clarify the offset schemes (possible by 2030) and create a legislative framework for emission offsets. (Ministry of the Environment).
Support CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage) through pilot projects. (Technology Agency of the Czech Republic).
Increased environmental awareness (Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Education, all levels).  |

|   | 1.6 Fear of control systems that hinder the implementation of innovative climate-friendly projects, etc. (local level). | 1.12 Setting up the monitoring and evaluation of the city's emission footprint, preparing adequate actions, mobilizing finances for the implementation of climate measures (local level)  |
|  2. Building sector and urban planning | 2.1 High costs of renovations and innovative technologies (Ministry of Finance, Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of the Regional Development).2.2 Shortage of environmentally friendly building materials (Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of the Environment).2.3 Higher regulation in the case of renovations - very strongly affects heritage sites and protected conservation areas where higher energy standards cannot be achieved (Ministry of Culture, National Heritage Institute, Department of Heritage Conservation of the City)2.4 The legislative environment and lack of regulatory plans complicate actual construction and urban planning. Currently allows rather non-compact and low-rise developments to be built, other rules make the building very expensive (e.g. number of parking spaces) and thus limit affordable housing, also building as energy-efficient housing (Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of the Regional Development).2.5 non-innovative, non-conceptual planning of buildings, without greenery, smart systems (air conditioning, etc.), | 2.6 Energy savings and reduced operating costs of buildings (Ministry of Industry and Trade).2.7 Increased property values and energy class of buildings (Ministry of Regional Development, Ministry of the Environment).2.8 Coordinate and determine the status of solutions and needs of construction material manufacturers (assess how prepared individual production plants are for decarbonization). (Ministry of Industry and Trade, Association of Building Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, Confederation of Industry of the Czech Republic)2.9 Build compact and multi-story buildings, thus not allowing wider development of the surrounding area (municipalities, individuals, companies).2.10 Greater emphasis should be placed on constructing green corridors in urban areas to eliminate heat islands. This includes building water features and fountains in public spaces to cool individual urban locations and districts. This effort can be led by municipal authorities, NGOs, and the private sector.  |

|   | and the use of quality materials (municipalities, individuals, companies). |   |
|  3. Transport and mobility sector | 3.1 Transport is a very energy-intensive sector, 93% of energy for transport in the Czech Republic comes from fossil fuels, and the Czech Republic has an old vehicle fleet (on average 16 years/car, around 6 million vehicles). Fleet renewal can be difficult.
High investment costs for infrastructure development (Ministry of Transport). Building new infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs), public transportation, and cycling paths requires substantial financial investment (other levels).
Need for extensive planning and regulation (Ministry of Transport).
Electric and hybrid vehicles are often more expensive upfront compared to conventional gasoline or diesel vehicles.
Attracting private investors can be challenging due to perceived risks and long return-on-investment periods associated with sustainable transport projects.
Building low- and zero-emission transport places heavy demands on the necessary raw materials (e.g. battery systems), which are imported from other countries, creating import dependency on other countries. | 3.7 Reduced greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution in the sector of mobility/transport: building low-emission rail transport, development of multimodal transport (carsharing etc.), and development of electromobility (Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of the Regional Development, regional transport structures - regions, associations of transport contracting authorities, etc.).
Extraction of lithium - the material for battery production helps eliminate dependence on its import (National level, ministries)
Improved public transportation and transport infrastructure (Ministry of Transport).
Increased use of cycling and walking (Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Health).
Promote favourable electric vehicle purchase (leasing) schemes for companies/individuals (Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Industry and Trade).
Improved quality of life in the city (reducing car pollution, car-free zones), and better urban planning – the city of short distances concept (Ministry of Health, Ministry of Regional Development, regions, municipal level, private sector).  |

In the sector of climate change, particularly in Liberec, there is significant potential for adopting novel approaches to capital planning, including the exploration of new financial instruments and grant schemes beyond traditional operational programmes. In recent months, we have started to embrace this original approach, gaining our first experience with Horizon funding, and successfully submitting a

8

proposal to the European Cities Facility to enhance our internal capacities. Regarding operational programmes, the most crucial ones are the Operational Programme Environment (OPE) and the Integrated Regional Operational Programme. However, a significant challenge is the relatively high municipal co-funding required for projects funded by OPE. Moving forward, we need to focus more on multi-source funding and the involvement of private capital, including investments from the industrial sector and citizen capital, to support decarbonization efforts.

In the field of buildings, there are several specific opportunities that could enable noteworthy progress in the coming years. The Social Climate Fund is expected to increase investments in building refurbishments, which are essential for improving energy efficiency. Additionally, a new Housing Strategy is currently under development, which will likely incorporate the ambition to make Liberec a climate-neutral city and ensure the implementation of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. For municipal buildings, a major opportunity lies in the concept of Energy Performance Contracting (EPC). Nearly 40 municipal buildings in the city have been selected for energy-saving measures, and solar panels will be installed on the roofs of some of these buildings. For privately-owned buildings, the development of community energy in Liberec and the establishment of a service and management organization for this community will have a significant impact. This organization will also be responsible for raising awareness about renewable energy construction and energy savings across the city. A manager will be appointed to handle communication with housing cooperatives regarding this agenda. Moreover, the use of new financial instruments is expected to increase the city's overall capacity. For example, EUCF funding is aimed at boosting energy savings in buildings and public lighting, which will further enhance the city's ability to achieve its climate goals.

Transport and mobility in Liberec is set to benefit from recent activities aimed at increasing traffic safety, particularly in the area of active mobility. Moving forward, the city's focus will be on electrification, encompassing private passenger cars, public transport, and freight transport. We currently have two projects dedicated to advancing this field, and our Pilot City project also focuses on this topic.

There is a strong connection to community energy development, where we are awaiting the final wording of legislation crucial for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. In addition to electrification, public transport will also rely on biogas produced by a new biogas station, further supporting our sustainability goals.

Energy sector is currently undergoing significant development, with a strong focus on the construction of renewable energy sources (RES) and community energy development. These efforts are expected to help address energy poverty, enhance energy independence, and improve energy security. This project, along with other related activities, is also contributing to the creation of new jobs in the renewable energy and construction sectors. Additionally, the establishment of a one-stop shop for housing is anticipated to raise awareness about climate neutrality and facilitate greater community engagement in achieving these goals.

In the sector of waste management, there remains significant potential for the reuse of materials and resources, including the testing of innovative technologies, particularly in connection with the production

9

of construction materials. Additionally, there is an opportunity to improve stormwater management in the city, which could further enhance sustainability efforts and resource efficiency.

**Industry and business** is a sector where significant changes can be expected. On one hand, this sector is driven by EU regulations; on the other, it involves following overall market trends and focusing on competitiveness (including the entire production cycle and CSR). In Liberec, we see enormous potential in developing cooperation with industry and business. Together, we can introduce innovative technologies to the city, collaborate in the field of public education, and use start-ups to test innovative technologies in municipal activities, etc.

In the area of land use, **nature, and biodiversity**, there is a significant opportunity through effective coordination between the CCC and the Adaptation Strategy. Furthermore, a municipal manual on public spaces has been developed, with a focus on green-blue infrastructure, which is expected to have a positive impact in this area.

Education and raising awareness are crucial for driving behavioural change. In this field, we plan to cooperate with many stakeholders at the local, regional, and national levels. It is important to educate the public, including professionals, to ensure that their decision-making aligns with the climate-neutrality ambition and contributes positively to the aforementioned fields of action.

The picture below illustrates our view of the overall environment relevant to the mission and our climate-neutral ambition. It represents the current situation and identifies the stakeholders that are most important at this stage. It is clear that this system will evolve as part of the learning cycle—new stakeholders may be identified, and there are existing stakeholders who still need to be engaged.

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)
The picture above presents the urban system in the context of its relationships at the regional, national, and European levels, and it also highlights the transition team involved in this process.

At city level, there are politicians, i.e. decision makers at strategic level, and various municipal departments working at the operational level. It can be stated that the city council holds decision-making power, with representation from both the leading political coalition and the political opposition. The city council has established various committees to discuss topics in more detail. In relation to the goal of achieving climate neutrality, the Commission for Climate Neutral City and the Committee for Smart City have been established. Additionally, in the context of climate neutrality, the Committee for Transport and the Committee for Local Agenda 21 are also important (including civic society and participation topics).

The Commission for Climate Neutral City is the most important body at the city level. It includes representatives from both the leading political coalition and the opposition, ensuring broad acceptance and effective decision-making. The commission brings together representatives from various fields of action: the energy sector and buildings (including the representative responsible for community energy development and the head of the board of Teplárna Liberec), civic society, a non-profit organization focused on climate neutrality (Rodiče pro klima, or Parents for Climate), the business sector, the Regional Office deputy responsible for the Environment and Agriculture for the entire Liberec region, and a research representative specializing in environmental studies, particularly anthropogenic pollution. This commission is responsible for discussing all topics and issues relevant to the city's participation in the EU Mission and its climate-neutral agenda. It works closely with the mission coordinator/climate specialist from the department of strategic development and subsidies.

In general, it is crucial to maintain a steady flow of information among all municipal departments and to ensure proper connections between them. Regarding climate neutrality, the most important cooperation involves the following departments: the Architecture Office of the City, the Department of Ecology and Public Space, the Economics Department, the Energy Management Department, the Public Property Management Department, the Department of Strategic Development and Subsidies, and the Department of Spatial Planning. At the beginning of the city's participation in the EU Mission, a specific training session on climate change, called "Climate Fresk," was organized for all municipal leadership and other relevant employees. This training proved to be highly effective. We plan to organize the Climate Fresk or similar educational sessions again for other city employees, as it is essential to raise awareness and commitment across the entire city hall (and beyond).

Furthermore, Liberec has a strong tradition of Local Agenda 21, which is connected to the city's participation in the Czech National Healthy Cities Network and its participatory budgeting initiatives. Regular citizens' meetings, Healthy Cities campaigns, and other events, such as European Mobility Week, are held annually. These activities include various inquiries and the creation of feeling maps to gather citizen input. Citizens are used to submit their projects (there are big projects in amount of around 80 000 EUR and various smaller projects in amounts around 8 000 EUR). The goal of this initiative is to engage citizens in decision-making about public spaces in Liberec, with the intention of improving and creating green public spaces that foster a sense of community and belonging. This, in turn, aims to revive public spaces, support the community, and promote active mobility.

In addition, there are various municipal organizations and institutions that are fully or partially owned by the city. These entities typically manage or own technical infrastructure and are responsible for social housing, other social services, culture, sports, and education (including kindergartens and elementary schools). In the context of climate neutrality, among the municipal organizations almost fully owned by the city, the most important is the public transport provider, Dopravní podnik měst Liberec a Jablonec nad Nisou (DPMLJ), which is fully responsible for ensuring public transport in the city.

Among the municipal organizations where the city has a minority ownership stake, the most significant are the heating plant Teplárna Liberec and the Regional Hospital Liberec. The heating plant, in particular, can be considered a frontrunner in the city's decarbonization efforts. Teplárna Liberec works closely with the city, with its head of board serving as a member of the Commission for Climate Neutral City. The plant is a key partner in community energy development, provides central heat supply to most households, and is also responsible for heating decarbonisation (GreenNet projects).

At the municipal level, other important stakeholders include the Technical University of Liberec, which plays a key role not only in research, science, and innovation but also in training and educating new professionals for the regional labour market. The university's involvement is crucial for fostering innovation and ensuring that the regional workforce is well-prepared to meet future challenges, particularly in fields related to climate neutrality and sustainable development.

Important stakeholders in the field of decarbonization also include those from the industry sector, particularly enterprises that have already committed to  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions reduction/cut, financial sector co-funding the future development etc.

Citizens play a specific and crucial role in achieving climate neutrality, as it is fundamentally tied to their daily choices and decision-making. This underscores the need for a shared vision and goals, which must be built on mutual interaction, communication, motivation, and public education. Within the CCC AP portfolio, citizens are also seen as building stock owners, making it essential to engage them in discussions about building refurbishment and the construction of renewable energy sources (RES). Additionally, there is a focus on addressing energy poverty and the risk of social exclusion, with vulnerable groups of citizens being a particularly important subgroup to consider in these efforts.

In the context of public administration, Liberec is the "capital" of the Liberec region and regarding this, important stakeholder is the Regional Office of the Liberec region. There are many natural ties and connections between the municipality and the region, and since Liberec is the largest city in the region, many projects and activities implemented by the Regional Office have a direct and significant impact on the city. This includes measures related to buildings, as the Regional Office is responsible for high schools and cultural buildings, most of which are located in Liberec. The city and the region cooperate in areas such as community energy and public education.

Another important stakeholder at the regional level is the Regional Development Agency, which is fully owned by the Liberec Region and operates as an "in-house company" with the aim of serving the region, its inhabitants, economic entities, and institutions. The Agency also oversees the business incubator Lipo.ink and a coworking centre. The city collaborates with this Agency primarily in the field of energy, working together on the regional "energy platform," as well as in public education and information sharing related to climate change and energy. We plan to further cooperate with the Agency in the area of public education and awareness-raising on energy issues, organizing workshops for the public.

At the national level, Ministry of the Environment, Ministry for Regional Development, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport are important players in the field of climate neutrality. At this level, there is crucial mutual support and cooperation. We have started to push cross-departmental cooperation and to discuss the initiation of the platform aiming at support of Czech cities pursuing the climate neutrality. This platform shall support Liberec and the city's role should be to share knowledge and experience among Czech cities. This task involves the Ministry for the Regional Development. With Ministry of the Environment, there has been discussed various subsidy titles and programmes since Liberec (and other Czech cities with climate neutrality ambition) needs to be provided by some supportive, specific conditions as higher percentage of subsidies, new subsidy titles etc. to enable reaching our goal. Ministry of Industry and Trade cooperates with Liberec in the field of innovation and smart solutions and regarding this, key role has CzechInvest: Business and Investment Development Agency.

Regarding topics relevant to climate neutrality, there are some state-owned enterprises that are also our stakeholders as for example Forests of the Czech Republic. Regarding the participation, public education and similar topics, there has very important role the National Healthy Cites Network (best practice transfer among Czech cities) that is a partner in the CapaCITIES project aiming and building capacities for the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities, beside mentioned network also various non-governmental organizations responsible mainly for raising awareness in public and pushing for legislation and administrative changes at the national level. Under these organizations fall for example The Community Energy Union (interest group bringing together professionals with a wide range of knowledge and experience), Hnutí DUHA – friends of the Earth of the Czech Republic, Climate Coalition (platform of Czech non-governmental non-profit organizations that deal mainly with climate and

environmental protection, mitigation and adaptation, social aspects of the climate crisis, development cooperation and humanitarian aid.

The EU level influences our ambition with the legislation and preparation of many grant titles, schemes, and programmes. Obviously, in general, there are European institutions building the environment in which we work and cooperate. Specific stakeholders are other European cities that are connected with Liberec in a certain way – we cooperate in case of specific research projects, in various twinning programmes, we share our knowledge and experience both regularly and occasionally. All these kinds of experience help to form our opinions, ways how to work and help to learn about new opportunities, possibilities, best practice solutions and ways of cooperation.

Follow-up information, based on above mentioned description of the system, are in following table listing key stakeholders mapping at the local, regional, national, and European level.

Each stakeholder is defined by emission domain, key factors, its influence on the city and its interests. Influence is valuated on a scale 1 – 3, when 1 represents incredibly low impact on the city, two represents average influence and 3 represents high impact on the city.

# 3 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B represents the core of the CCC Action Plan, shaped by local authorities, local businesses, and stakeholders, comprising of the most essential elements: scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, action portfolios and indicators for monitoring, evaluation, and learning.

# 3.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Module B-1 "Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways" lists and describes impact pathways, early and late outcomes, and direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits) according to and adapted from the NetZeroCities Theory of Change and the CCC Action Plan Guidance – clustered by fields of action.

List of impact pathways, selected from or inspired by the NetZeroCities Theory of Change, including early and late outcomes (strategic objectives) and levers of change structured along the fields of action.

Description of the impact pathways, summarising their relationship with the key priorities and strategic interventions and with the analysis developed in Part A, is fully in line with theory of change and transition map logic. Such impact logic (theory of change) is about multiple (transversal) levers (technological innovation and infrastructure; finance and funding; social innovation; democracy and participation; governance innovation; learning, capacities and capabilities building, enabling transformative change. Portfolio of Actions brings various early outcomes and later outcomes, which culminate into long-term impacts including direct benefits and co-benefits. These casual chains represent the so-called Impact Pathways.

Table B 1-1 lists all suggested pathways and covers all fields of action, aligned with the emission inventory results, as well as actions across various systemic levers. The proposed activities are linked to both short- and mid-term changes—i.e., early changes and later outcomes over a 3–4-year horizon. In addition to the direct impacts, such as emission reductions, there are also various indirect impacts (co-benefits) including improvements in citizens' health, quality of life, economic benefits through job creation, and financial savings.

The whole process of green transition of the city is built on several elements, none of which has more weight or priority, all of them must be implemented simultaneously and continuously. The points summarise the implementation and focus of the CCC Action Plan (reduce, replace, renewables, research, re-use, raise awareness) including monitoring, evaluation and a learning process and possible revision of existing measures (reflect, revise, repeat).

Taking into account the current situation in the city (the city's emission inventory and the measures set in the action plan), it is clear that it is necessary to improve the energy performance of buildings and guide society toward responsible and sustainable energy management in everyday processes, including sustainable consumption (REDUCE). At the same time, fossil fuels must be replaced with renewable energy sources, both in buildings and in low/zero-emission transport. Specifically, natural gas must be phased out in the buildings sector, and diesel in the transport sector (REPLACE). Fossil fuels should be replaced by renewable energy sources, with wind energy complementing solar energy (RENEWABLES) to achieve a balanced production profile in line with our commitment. Liberec will also support the city's innovation environment to test and apply new technologies and solutions, cooperating with key stakeholders and actively participating in international projects (RESEARCH). Additionally, the focus will be on the circular economy, sustainable consumption, and efficient waste management (REUSE).

A key part of the entire process is to inform, educate, and share experiences and good practices in order to promote the most desirable society-wide changes, influencing daily decision-making processes and choices in a more sustainable direction, ultimately leading to behavioural change. In addition to educating residents, it is equally important to continuously educate politicians, employees, and city officials so that their decisions and actions are based on comprehensive and high-quality information. Full understanding of the entire system strengthens the city's shared ambition and commitment to achieving climate neutrality (RAISE AWARENESS).

An integral feature of the city's transition is the cyclical process of continuous monitoring, evaluation, and subsequent revision of measures and activities to meet the city's goals (REFLECT). This process

can be summarized as an ongoing cycle centred on the implementation of the CCC Action Plan, reflection on achieved milestones, identification of new challenges, threats, and opportunities, and a learning process that helps to embed these changes as the new norm (REPEAT).

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

The suggested pathways are the result of a co-creation process with continual input. The foundation lies in the city's current strategic documents and action plans, which outline the overall vision and measures. Additionally, hard data from the emission inventory was complemented by feedback gathered through participatory/co-creation activities such as roundtables, brainstorming with key stakeholders, and civic forums. External advisory support also played a role, with a consultancy providing impact calculations and estimations for various measures and actions, based on data and input from the city and key stakeholders. We also utilized the NZC check, which provided valuable feedback.

Suggested pathways are in line with strategic priorities stated in the Commitments.

In the table above, specific pathways for all fields of action are described, including systemic levers, early changes, late outcomes, direct impacts, and co-benefits. Direct impacts were calculated for the outcomes in the fields of mobility and transport, as well as the built environment (which also incorporates some outcomes from the fields of energy and waste). All actions aligned with these suggested pathways are outlined below but in general, the aim is :

Transformation of local **energy** market, based on the RES (importance of RES construction, solar and wind power plants, biogas station construction), on decarbonisation of local heating system, development of community energy, importance of increase in capacity and financial resources for the actions implementation, strengthening cooperation and mutual learning with key stakeholders.
Development of low-emission and zero-emission **transport**, focus on electrification of private and public transport, active mobility, construction of appropriate infrastructure and services, connected with public space re-design.
Public education and various programmes in the field of **waste and circular economy**, which should be based on recycling and re-use and high-quality municipal waste management
High-quality maintenance of **green spaces** including forests planting on the cadastral area of the city, planting new greenery, appropriate water management
In the field of **built environment** to be focused on ongoing buildings' refurbishment, modernisation of lighting, appropriate energy management and successful implementation of EPC projects.
Long-term, sustainable system of education, cooperation, participation, and facilitation that involves all key stakeholders.

In conclusion, suggested pathways are fully in line with current state analysis of climate action and in line with Liberec 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments, including both strategic priorities and stakeholders involved.

|   |  Action description | Construction of three wind power plants of total capacity 16 MW within the city territory and other 160 - 220 MW outside the city territory. We are aware that this measure needs to be communicated with public very carefully to get their understanding and positive perception of wind power plants construction (we already consider specific participation methods for work with citizens in this field). Other barrier for implementation is sufficient funding, it is crucial to find partners from private sector. Also there might be some burdens given by spatial conditions of the city.  |

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

The following table shows the number of residual emissions.

|   | Emissions [t CO2eq] | Percentage  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Emissions in 2019 | 740 713 | 100  |
|  Emissions drop | 596 345 | 82  |
|  Residual emissions | 133 294 | 18  |

The structure of residual emissions by sectors is shown in the next table.

|  Sector | Residual emissions [t CO2eq] | Percentage  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Buildings | 48 592 | 36,6  |
|  Transport | 45 138 | 33,8  |
|  Waste | - | -  |
|  Industrial Process and Product Use (IPPU) | 23 531 | 17,6  |
|  Agricultural, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU) | 16 069 | 12  |
|  Total | 133 294 | 100  |

The largest share of residual emissions is from transport. These emissions are practically unavoidable for two main reasons. First, a significant portion comes from transit traffic (including a highway that passes through the city), which the city cannot eliminate. Second, it is unlikely that all car owners in the city will switch to electric or hydrogen vehicles before the end of their current cars' physical lifespan, which is typically around 18 years in the Czech Republic.

A similar share of residual emissions comes from buildings (and from energy systems due to the use of district heating). These emissions result from natural gas consumption in buildings across all sectors and district heat generation. There is not enough available biomass for biogas production, and increasing the share of hydrogen in natural gas pipelines would require technology changes and investments that are difficult to achieve within the given timeframe.

Emissions in the IPPU sector come from fluorinated gases used for production of cooling devices. The EU legislation requires use of coolants with lower GWP, but today's devices will be serviced still with the older coolants with higher GWP.

There are no significant changes in land use, so the emissions in the AFOLU sector will remain practically constant. The current afforestation of forests hit by the bark beetle will bring remarkable  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  sinks after some 15 – 20 years, when the new trees become big enough.

The carbonless future of the city relies on electrification and the use of green hydrogen. Since there are no viable options for significant carbon sinks within the city, we currently consider investing in corresponding  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions reduction in other regions as an acceptable option.
# 3.3 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

Module B-3 "Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning" contains a selection of indicators to monitor and evaluate progress along the selected impacts pathways and fields of action described in Module B-1. as well as a monitoring and evaluation plan, i.e., metadata on each indicator selected, in addition to milestones and timeline.

Monitoring involves the development and application of quantitative indicators to track and analyse a city's progress towards direct impacts (such as net-zero GHG emissions) and indirect impacts (co-benefits). It also includes the setup, management, and maintenance of data collection tools and infrastructure. Evaluation refers to the analysis and assessment of monitoring data against set goals, targets, and benchmarks, with the aim of determining the extent to which critical milestones, intermediate outcomes, and final impacts have been achieved. Learning is a structured and continuous process of reviewing and synthesizing information to generate real-time insights, helping cities understand which solutions are effective, in which contexts, for whom, and why. These activities generate evidence and knowledge, enabling reflexive governance and helping to correct or refine the course of action as needed.

The suggested indicator framework aligns with the impact logic presented in Picture 8, which focuses on multiple transversal levers that enable transformative change. The Portfolio of Actions generates various early and later outcomes, ultimately leading to long-term impacts, including both direct benefits and co-benefits. These causal chains form what are known as Impact Pathways.

We have selected specific critical outcomes to be evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative indicators. The overall aim is to regularly monitor and evaluate outcomes based on set milestones,

enabling a process of sensemaking and learning. This approach follows the logic of the transition map, where a crucial milestone is to learn and reflect—to update, amend, or change the pathways accordingly, or to make them the new normal. Monitoring and evaluation (both mid-term and ex-post) are essential, and based on these findings, we can learn and adjust our approach. For this reason, we have established appropriate indicators aligned with the suggested measures (pathways) described below. The climate coordinator holds primary responsibility for this process, but it also requires the involvement of the entire transition team, particularly when it comes to learning and revising the pathways.

For the next steps and continued development, it will be crucial to learn from and reflect on previous achievements and to share insights across the transition team. The cooperation of the entire team is essential for compiling data (monitoring and evaluation), as the project portfolio extends beyond just municipal property. The first target values for evaluation are set for 2026, marking the first milestone, followed by 2028 and 2030 as key target years. These milestones offer the opportunity to revise the City Climate Contract, Action Plan, and Investment Plan. It is clear that new possibilities and stakeholders (as co-signatories) will emerge throughout our work. Additionally, based on regular mid-term evaluations, we will be able to revise the Action Plan portfolio and adjust goals and pathways as needed to achieve climate neutrality.

Mid-term evaluation and revise of the portfolio will help with sensemaking across the city and will specify the range of public education and adapt decision-making in the city. In the end it should ensure the

implementation more resilient and impactful. The mission coordinator has the main responsibility for ensuring/coordination of the MEL activities in the city, for collecting the data from municipal resources, then there are some data, which need to be collected/calculated by the external consultants. Each biannual evaluation will be discussed within the transition team, focusing on potential or necessary amendments and updates to all relevant documents. In addition to regular evaluations, occasional changes may occur, such as the inclusion of new stakeholders or co-signatories. All evaluations will be presented to city counsellors, as the city council holds the final decision-making power to approve any amendments. The city board, headed by the deputy responsible for this field, bears the primary responsibility for implementation. Evaluations based on the established indicators will first be reviewed by the transition team and the Commission for Climate-Neutral City, and then submitted to the city council with appropriate recommendations for revisions, amendments, or changes to be approved. This process will involve three monitoring periods: 2024 – 2026, 2027 – 2028, 2029 – 2030.

When selecting the indicators, there had to be taken into account following questions:

What do we want to achieve? What are specific objectives and what are expected results given the suggested measures/actions?
the overall relevance compared to the difficulty to collect such data (in terms of money and time), what the suggested indicator measures: direct/indirect benefits, indicators' availability, synergies/complementarities with other projects (saving finance and time for collecting the data) etc.

In the table below, we outline our indicator framework, linked to the action plan portfolio and the scope of our commitment. Typically, a two-year data collection interval is suggested, but for some indicators, a four-year interval is more appropriate. While certain data can be collected, calculated, or estimated in-house, for GHG emissions (across various sectors), cities must hire external consultants. This is a significant barrier for all Czech cities, including Liberec, when it comes to strategic planning and MEL (Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning), as there is a notable lack of available data compared to other European cities. This issue needs to be addressed at the national level, as Czech cities require support in data collection. Hiring external consultants every two years for GHG inventory updates is costly. Such support should ideally come from a newly established national platform for future climate-neutral Czech cities. If this support is made available, we will be able to revise the data collection interval accordingly.

The cumulative of these emissions forms the sectoral emissions. It requires identifying which categories of the AFOLU sector are relevant for reporting purposes.

Cities should keep in mind that when a source/sink of emissions is included in the CCC Action Plan (either for emissions reduction or emissions compensation) both positive and negative emissions should be accounted for and monitored.  |

|  Definition | Annual local renewable energy production.
It can be inferred that this indicator will prove useful for tracking the impact of the installation and operation of renewable energy projects over time. It will allow for the analysis of the before and after situation, as following the installation and operation of renewable energy projects (or as the difference between the annual renewable energy generation related to the project compared to the BAU case.
It is possible to divide the annual total energy consumption compared to a previous baseline or inventory, and then multiply by it by 100 to express the difference/result as a percentage.  |

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part C "Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030" aims to outline any enabling interventions, i.e., regarding organizational setting or collaborative governance models or related to social innovations – designed to support the climate action portfolios (Module B-2) as well as aiming to achieve co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Module B-1). These interventions also address the identified opportunities, gaps and barriers identified in Module A-2 and A-3.

Liberec aims to build on its previous success, having been regularly honoured in the nationwide competition with the award for "Friendly City Hall Office." In recent years, the city's accessibility and openness, online communication, public involvement and participation, participatory budgeting, mobile application, interactive investment map, and the Citizens' Portal—an online platform for communication between the city hall and citizens on administrative matters—have been positively assessed.

# 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

This module details the city's governance innovations for achieving climate neutrality by 2030, describing innovations in institutional design, leadership, and collaborative and outreach processes, whether inter-organizational or internal to the key organizations responsible for the city's climate neutrality target.

So far, the climate agenda in Liberec is addressed at various levels, as previously mentioned. The final decision-making power rests with the city council, supported by relevant advisory bodies such as the Commission for Climate Neutral City. Mitigation activities are initiated and coordinated by the climate specialist (coordinator of the EU Mission), who is responsible for cross-sectoral coordination and works closely with the deputy mayor for energy and smart city, who holds political responsibility for the climate-neutral city. Given the complexity of the climate neutrality issue, other deputy mayors are also politically responsible, including those overseeing municipal housing and Local Agenda 21, architecture, public space and transportation construction, culture, education and tourism, spatial planning, property matters and sports, strategic development and subsidies, and technical infrastructure and IT, as well as social affairs. The city council holds decision-making power and is advised by the Commission for Climate Neutral City.

At the operational level, there are many departments involved, mainly the Architecture Office of the City, Department of Ecology and Public Space, Economics Department, Energy management department, Public Property Management Department, Department of Strategic Development and Subsidies, Department of Spatial Planning. All mentioned departments have their own role withing the climate-strategic planning and budgeting or within realization, implementation of measures and activities. Key stakeholders regarding mitigation activities are Teplárna Liberec (heating company), housing associations and cooperatives (buildings refurbishment), DPMLJ (transport company). Citizens are engaged in a form of participative budgeting and in case of various engagement instruments linked to the Local Agenda 21. All connections, including regional and national level, are described in module A-

Within the municipal structure, there is a missing position of the adaptation coordinator, in 2023 the Adaptation strategy was developed, but there is no one coordinating measures across relevant departments, as was mentioned above.

Governance innovation and a participative model will be crucial for the green transition in Liberec. The new governance model is designed to address identified barriers, with the most significant challenges being vertical links to other levels of government. As a result, we initiated discussions with regional and national authorities on climate neutrality and related tasks. The city must engage relevant organizations at both the regional and national levels and strengthen its internal capacities, both by increasing the number of professionals and enhancing knowledge. These efforts lead to governance innovation interventions, which are key to achieving the city's climate goals.

Besides the municipal level, the city was approached by the Ministry for Regional Development regarding the creation of a "national platform" for Czech cities with the ambition to become climate neutral. Currently, such a body or governance structure is missing, and it is necessary to establish one that supports Czech cities from a cross-departmental perspective and with shared responsibility. Liberec is sharing its experience from the Mission with the Ministry for Regional Development to help set up this body in a way that appropriately supports Czech cities. This support needs to be developed across various levels, including building internal capacities in terms of finance, knowledge, networking, and strategic planning, as well as addressing legislative and regulatory barriers and pushing for relevant amendments. Such a body would play an important role in further municipal development, and its establishment is expected to lead to governance innovations at the city level. This platform would serve as a key mediator between the city and the national level, introducing a new approach to cooperation with ministries and, importantly, a new way to share resources vertically.

Liberec also plans to collaborate with the regional office of the Liberec Region on this agenda, sharing employees to strengthen joint efforts. To support this, we intend to submit a common strategic integrated project proposal under the LIFE Programme. The project will likely focus on two key areas: nature and biodiversity, and clean energy transition, as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation. One of the anticipated outcomes of this project is the creation of a shared position for both the city and the regional office: an adaptation coordinator, which is currently lacking. This role would significantly improve the implementation of both the adaptation and mitigation strategies and enhance coordination between related activities.

In addition to the points mentioned above, climate mitigation policies should include specific conditions, rules, and requirements within municipal guidelines and directives. For example, these could apply to areas such as waste management and public procurement to ensure alignment with climate goals.

At the city level, there is a climate specialist/mitigation coordinator employed by the statutory city, working in the Department of Strategic Development and Subsidies. This department consolidates comprehensive knowledge of strategic documents, European programs, initiatives, and subsidy opportunities. The coordinator is responsible for cross-sectoral coordination, both vertically and horizontally. Within the city hall, their role involves integrating knowledge, activities, and resources from all relevant departments across the city to ensure cohesive climate mitigation efforts.

The coordinator is responsible for the city's climate ambition at the operational level

The decision-making power has a city council, coordinator is linked to the city council via deputy mayor for energy and smart city (one of city counsellors), who is primarily responsible for this agenda.

The deputy mayor is responsible for the city's climate ambition at the political level

City board has also established the advisory body “Commission for Climate Neutral City,” where deputy mayor is a commission chairperson. This commission meets usually twice a month, suggestions for each discussion are made by the chairperson and/or commission’s members and/or by the coordinator. All documents that are supposed to be submitted to the city council are discussed in the “Committee for Sustainable Development” (also advisory body) as well.

Mitigation and adaptation activities will be coordinated directly between the adaptation coordinator and the mitigation coordinator through the Commission for Climate Neutral City. Beyond the municipal/city hall level, the mitigation coordinator is responsible for managing communication and cooperation between the city hall and other key local stakeholders. Many of these stakeholders participate in various municipal committees, commissions (i.e., advisory bodies), working groups, or common projects. For example, an important stakeholder is the heating plant Teplárna Liberec, considered a frontrunner in the city's climate efforts. This organization is progressive and innovative, testing many pilot projects in the field of new technologies and approaches in energy and construction. The heating plant is a key consortium partner in the project to establish sustainable community energy in Liberec, with its head of board serving as a member of the Commission for Climate Neutral City. Conversely, city councilors are members of the supervisory board of Teplárna Liberec. Many connections with key stakeholders in the city are natural, mutual, and long-term, with many stakeholders connected to the city through partial ownership).

An important role will be played by the Community Energy Service and Management Organisation, which will be established in September 2024. This organization will create new job positions and serve as a "mediator" between the municipality/city hall and housing cooperatives. Since these buildings are crucial stakeholders in community energy development and have a specific ownership structure (requiring 100% approval from all owners), it is essential to communicate closely with them. Building trust and providing all necessary information for decision-making—such as details about benefits, costs, impacts, and co-benefits—will be key to fostering their participation.

Beside the municipal level, coordinator for mitigation has also connections to regional and national level.

# Participation of citizens

Public participation in all processes, including both the wider public/citizens and professional stakeholders, is a crucial aspect of governance in any city operating within a democratic society. Liberec recognizes this and continues to improve its participation methods, both in terms of the techniques used and the occasions on which they are employed. However, there is still a need to reach a broader audience, increase public interest and understanding, and build mutual trust (trust in our work, our knowledge, and opinions).

Within the CCC design process, we identified a strong potential for collaboration with the regional level—both with the professional public and citizens. This is especially relevant considering the responsibilities of the Regional Office of the Liberec Region in education and public education, as well as the focus of the Regional Development Agency. Additionally, we see great potential for joint activities in public education with the industry sector. By pooling our resources, we can reach a broader audience and use this opportunity to foster further cooperation beyond Corporate Social Responsibility.

In Liberec, various forms of citizen engagement and participation are used, particularly in strategic planning. However, as previously mentioned, there remains a barrier in achieving the desired level of feedback and responsiveness from citizens. This presents an opportunity to reassess and redesign the participation process, including the methods and channels used to reach citizens. It is crucial to assure citizens that their opinions are valued and will genuinely influence decision-making. To address this, the participatory method of a "citizens' assembly" has been under consideration. This approach ensures that citizens are provided with sufficient knowledge to fully understand the issue at hand. Moreover, it guarantees that if a certain level of agreement is reached (e.g., 80% of the citizens' sample), the city council must discuss or even approve the proposed solution. The method involves selecting a representative sample of citizens across the city. However, it is also recognized that this method is relatively expensive and time-consuming, both for the city hall in terms of preparation and for the participating citizens.

In general, there is a need to test new forms of participation where engaged citizens are first educated and more motivated to participate. When decision-making power is transferred from top to bottom, citizens should be provided with comprehensive background information. This is similar to the situation with city councillors, who must make decisions based on complete knowledge, including municipal barriers, and consider all interests (not just partial ones) to evaluate all facts and possibilities effectively.

Citizens are informed via various channels or in case of below mentioned events/opportunities:

Municipal newspaper
Social media (Facebook) and City Websites
Specific events (as European Mobility Week)
Various roundtables
Leaflets (for example in public transport, in city hall), brochures, etc.
Media (TV, radio, regional press)

Activities of mayor deputies, for example there are regular visits to the city's districts where citizens can meet deputies and discuss their local problems, the city mayor has meetings with citizens as well.

## More important are forms of active participation:

Local Committees can be established by citizens under the Act on Municipalities 128/2000 Coll. These committees serve as advisory and initiating bodies for the city council. They are authorized to submit proposals to the city administration regarding the development of specific localities and the municipal budget, provide feedback on proposals from the city management, and comment on citizen initiatives submitted to municipal authorities. Recently, the effectiveness of these committees has been questioned, and the opportunity for their full cooperation with the city hall has not been fully realized. To address this, a working group was formed to draft new rules for their operation and organization, with plans to transform them into local commissions.

Working groups are established when the city needs to address specific topics, particularly in the context of strategic planning. These groups provide the city with public opinions and expertise in various fields. Typically, professional working groups are formed, such as those involved in developing the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan or the Local Energy Strategy. Citizens are more actively engaged when developing the city's master strategic plan. For example, in the last update, the following working groups were formed: Education, Business and Employment; Social Services, Health and Safety; Sustainable Development; and Culture, Sports, and Tourism. The outputs—measures and projects included in strategic documents—are based on a combination of professional expertise, often through outsourced analysis, and public input, including opinions and desires. This process is significant because the CCC Action Plan serves as an umbrella document for all strategic plans of the city, with its outcomes rooted in existing strategic documents and action plans, reflecting previous work and public participation).

Participatory budgeting is a program designed to engage citizens in the budgeting process and improve their surroundings. A specific amount of money is allocated from the budget for citizen-driven projects. Residents submit their ideas and project proposals, usually through an online platform, allowing them to take an active role in shaping their community online (www.tvorimeliberec.cz). The allocated amount is increasing every year, there are three categories of projects – super-large projects up to 80 000 EUR, large projects up to 40 000 EUR, and small projects up to 16 000 EUR.

Healthy City of Liberec campaigns and events: Liberec is a member of the National Healthy Cities Network and participates in various international campaigns such as European Mobility Week and World Heart Day (in Liberec). The city also organizes events and campaigns focused on waste management and cleaning, such as Earth Day and "Let's Clean Up the Czech Republic" (part of "Let's Clean Up Europe"). Additionally, there is a public competition called "I Walk" aimed at promoting active mobility.

Community planning (social services planning) is planning of services in social area and the core of this planning is that social services can be openly and publicly planned and thus, they can fully meet the citizens' needs. This process is open and cyclical, anyone can participate, and there are mainly representatives of users, providers, contractors of social services. Community Plan is developed/updated for five years and for each year is prepared action plan. Besides, when occurs new topic in the city, new circumstances, everything is discussed in working groups where wide public participates or is represented by a mediator. Public is involved in working groups where there are following ones: WG for people with disabilities, WG for elderly, WG for mental health, WG for children and youth, WG for people at risk of addiction, WG for people at risk of social exclusion, people in crisis and without shelter, foreigners and minorities. These target groups are mainly represented by mediators which are usually workers of social services that are used to work with them on daily basis. This process is described in more detail below.

Surveys/questionnaires (online, in the newspaper) and feeling maps: when we want to reach, meet citizens' opinions/habits/preferences/choices, we often use various surveys (often connected with bellow mentioned feeling maps). Feeling maps are great instrument to connect opinions/problems/barriers/projects with specific locality in the city. Citizens can show where they sport, where they feel well, safe, where is wrong traffic situation, etc.

Civic forums that are held every two years, these forums are facilitated and focused on a few development areas of the city (economy, social services and health, environment and climate-neutrality, transportation, technical infrastructure, culture, education, and sports, etc.). Citizens are invited to share their priorities including barriers for further development, there are various „tables“ for each topic, all priorities and ideas are scored, and the score is validated via online survey to reach higher audience (more representatives of the city).

Interviews (in person or by phone), for example we used interviews in case of developing Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) or in case of parking in housing estates regulation design. In SUMP, there was paid attention to well set-up sample of citizens (age, gender, district). In the field of transportation as such, we plan to test new types of citizens 'engagement to the process of parking regulation design related to the ELABORATOR project (sustainable mobility towards the Climate neutrality).

Roundtables and workshops: roundtables and workshops are used to discuss specific problems/barriers/opportunities in case of specific projects or areas of municipal development. We use the National Healthy Cities Network representatives as facilitators, and we usually organize these roundtables and workshops for professional public – so far. Regarding the Climate agenda, we plan to organize workshops for professional public and for citizens in the field of energy to raise awareness and understanding about topics as energy savings, community energy and its benefits, energy poverty, technical and smart technologies, funding possibilities etc. Roundtables also serve as initiation of further communication with specific stakeholders.

Reminding strategic documents: when developing strategic documents, drafts are published online on the city's website or introduced publicly in person. This allows the public to review the core of the documents, including the vision and goals, and provide feedback on any missing elements or suggest amendments. In some cases, we maintain records of all public comments and provide statements on how those comments were addressed.

## Participation of vulnerable groups of citizens

A specific aspect of public participation involves engaging vulnerable groups of citizens. In Liberec, as in any city, these groups include people with disabilities, the elderly, children and youth, girls and women, carers, people at risk of addiction, those at risk of social exclusion, individuals in crisis or without shelter, foreigners, and minorities. These groups are often considered vulnerable in many situations, and their inclusion in public participation processes is essential to ensure their voices are heard and their needs addressed.

In general, a highly visible group in Liberec consists of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion, which is more economically than spatially driven in the city. These individuals often reside in socially excluded areas and experience a combination of various challenges. Within this group, a significant portion belongs to the Roma community living in Liberec. People at risk of poverty and social exclusion are often characterized by low educational attainment (elementary education), long-term unemployment, debt, dependency on social financial transfers, and/or being elderly, or having low competencies for managing life situations (such as individuals with mental illness). This group represents around 6% of the city's population, with about two-thirds of them being from the Roma community.

The participation of these vulnerable groups of citizens is both specific and complex. Within the CCC process, this topic was discussed with Daniel Amann (Transformative Learning Expert at The Democratic Society), the Social Department of the City Hall, the Housing Centre of Liberec, and representatives from the non-profit organization People in Need. The aim was to gain a comprehensive understanding of how to work effectively with vulnerable groups in Liberec, what key issues need to be communicated with them, and how best to reach them—through appropriate mediators and using effective communication channels.

Currently, at the municipal level, vulnerable groups of citizens are primarily engaged through the community planning process, which is a key priority in municipal governance and provides the main opportunity to reach these groups. In general, all citizens, regardless of ethnicity, gender, education, age, etc., are invited to participate in strategic city development, participatory budgeting, community planning, social housing discussions, and public consultations on specific projects.

Community planning is a collaborative process for planning social services. We have found that the most effective way to engage vulnerable citizens is through mediators. These mediators are typically social service providers, such as non-profit organizations or municipal/regional bodies, including the social department. These mediators work with vulnerable citizens on a "daily basis," which is crucial because their relationships are built on trust and understanding, a process that takes time. Despite these efforts, feedback, interest, and willingness from vulnerable citizens to participate in these processes remain lower than desired. The information flow commonly works as follows:

![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)

As mentioned above, feedback is not as high as desired, and many vulnerable individuals are not interested in participating in municipal processes. They are often preoccupied with their own challenging living situations and personal interests, and many feel powerless to effect change. However, participation in community planning has been effective, following a specific process illustrated in the picture above. Target groups, either independently or through mediators, join working groups that serve as both problem solvers and initiators in the community planning process. This allows the city to receive all necessary information, which is then passed to the Regional Office, the decision-making body for social services in the region. Apart from community planning, social housing in Liberec has also been successful. Social housing is a specific part of social services planning and operates similarly to community planning. It is a high priority in Liberec, with the Housing Centre of Liberec serving as a contact point for individuals and households in need of housing assistance, particularly low-income groups. The centre plays an important role in preventing housing loss and combating energy poverty. It works closely with relevant social service providers, and its core processes mirror those of community planning.

In recent years, the focus on energy, energy savings, and heat sources has gained increasing importance. The Housing Centre staff engage with vulnerable individuals and households to educate them on how to achieve energy savings through basic measures and controlled consumption, distributing leaflets to raise awareness. The Housing Centre has become a vital part of social services, and its team was honoured by the Czech Streetwork Association for their exceptional work and long-term contribution to society. Following discussions about engaging vulnerable groups of citizens in the CCC process, it became clear that the most effective approach is to communicate through "tangible" projects, such as community energy development, which offer clear benefits (e.g., lower energy costs). Additionally, we aim to build on the existing relationships between vulnerable citizens and the mediators who have already established trust and experience with them through social work. Strengthening these trusted relationships is crucial for further engagement.

We also recognize the importance of peer workers and consultants, who are often more effective at building trust with vulnerable citizens. The city's initial experience with peer workers came through crime prevention assistants and "janitors," who are peer workers assisting professionals in working with vulnerable groups as part of ongoing European projects.

In June, a roundtable and workshop were organized on the topics of energy poverty, building refurbishment, and community energy development. The event included participation from representatives of two ministries—Ministry of the Environment and Ministry for Regional Development—as well as representatives from the Technical University in Liberec, the Regional Development Agency, and other key stakeholders. The event began with an introduction to the concept of community energy, highlighting its benefits and its potential to address energy poverty and support the development of renewable energy sources. The Social Climate Fund was also introduced, with a focus on the opportunities it presents for refurbishing buildings for low-income households and supporting vulnerable users in public transport.

The workshop that followed was facilitated to encourage brainstorming and discussion on how to effectively communicate the impacts of climate change to vulnerable groups of citizens, and how to motivate low-income households to adopt new habits and make decisions that contribute to sustainability.

Given what was mentioned above, more governance and social interventions and innovations can be expected in the coming months and years. The understanding of the importance of public participation has been growing and is emphasized at many levels.

The following table presents the actions taken by the city so far, along with the governance changes initiated since joining the EU Mission and committing to climate neutrality. This commitment required the establishment of specific structures and systems to empower the city in this field and ensure that there are dedicated capacities and roles responsible for achieving the city's climate neutrality ambition.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

## Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iteration

The City of Liberec joined the Covenant of Mayors in 2016, but no significant progress had been made towards emission reduction at that time. By 2022, when we joined the EU Mission, we were still at the early stages, although some important steps had been taken, such as preparing EPC projects, refurbishing buildings, developing community energy, decarbonizing the heating system, and testing electric buses. We began exploring possibilities for constructing renewable energy sources, mapping areas available for solar and wind power plants, and identifying opportunities and barriers for the development of electromobility within the city. These efforts marked the start of our more focused approach to achieving climate neutrality.

When developing this CCC Action Plan, we utilized the current strategic documents and available data as much as possible. This Action Plan encompasses all our efforts, plans, and priorities to date and pushes them further, aiming to exceed previous ambitions by targeting an 80.7% emissions reduction compared to the 2019 baseline. In addition to other key municipal strategic documents—such as the city's master plan, the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan, and the Integrated Territorial Investments Strategy—this CCC Action Plan is anchored in the City Climate Contract Commitments.

In the City Climate Contract, there is stated the goal to cut the greenhouse gas emissions by 82% (which means cut by 596 345 t CO₂eq) by successful implementation of this Action Plan by 2030, with 18% of residual emissions to be compensated, where most will be cut in the sector of buildings, and in the sector of transport. Beside the emission reduction, there will be reached energy savings in the amount higher than 76,8 GWh.

Furthermore, in the Commitments part, there are defined four strategic priorities, as :

Increase in energy performance of buildings based on phasing out fossil fuels, buildings' refurbishment and energy management.
Independent, secure and self-sufficient local energy market based on renewable energy sources production and community energy sharing.
Electrification of private transport, low-emission public transport based on electrification and biogas.
Strengthening city capacity and capability, raising climate-neutrality awareness including participation, public education and facilitation, city networking and continuous learning

This CCC Action Plan is fully aligned with the Commitments and elaborates them into specific pathways and actions. The range of CCC Commitments' signatories is consistent with the key stakeholders mapped in this plan. The content was developed according to the NetZeroCities template, incorporating information on the current state of climate actions, including the GHG Baseline Inventory (baseline year 2019), an analysis and assessment of existing policies and strategies at the local, regional, and national levels, and a description of the need for action. It also identifies key opportunities and barriers related to legislation, policies, and strategies at the national level. These findings are summarized in the calculation of the emissions gap for 2030. Based on the analyses, systemic barriers and opportunities for various sectors are defined, stakeholders are mapped, and the overall environment for climate actions in Liberec is described. A key part of the plan outlines pathways towards climate neutrality in line with the Theory of Change, detailing early changes, late outcomes, direct impacts, and co-benefits. The suggested pathways are further elaborated in the form of specific actions (portfolio design). Additionally, the plan includes a summary strategy for addressing residual emissions.

In the process of developing the CCC Action Plan, we have learned several important lessons that must be considered moving forward. First, there is still insufficient cooperation with the private sector, even though the importance of private resources for the successful implementation of the action plan is clear. Additionally, the current system of public participation and engagement in climate-related activities is largely ad-hoc, and we need to establish a more systemic and sustainable approach to participation, communication, and education. The most crucial insight, and a key precondition for successfully implementing the portfolio of actions, is the need to increase the city's capacity and capability. We must enhance our financial resources, knowledge, and experience, which is closely tied to an effective system of evaluation, as outlined in the MEL section above. Responsibilities for CCC evaluation and future updates or amendments have already been defined. In line with the Transition Map, the goal of this system is to continuously improve all relevant processes through assessment, learning, updating, and making these improvements the new normal.

Overall, specific milestones have been established for each action defined in this plan. The primary challenges include bridging the financial gap and enhancing municipal capacity and capability. Thanks to the CCC's efforts, we have strengthened or initiated numerous connections with various stakeholders at both local and national levels. We recognize the importance of supporting the Ministry for Regional Development in launching a national platform for Czech cities with the aim of initiating their green transition. Liberec aspires to become a leader in the Czech Republic, sharing best practices and experiences in strategic and capital planning, and piloting new projects focused on climate neutrality.

So far, our most significant step has been initiating relationships with key stakeholders, primarily at local and national levels. Addressing the main barriers identified in the CCC Action Plan requires effective communication with specific ministries and networking to advocate for legislative amendments that support cities pursuing climate neutrality. We have successfully initiated discussions for further support from the national level for the City of Liberec. Through the CapaCities project, we have received support from the Czech National Healthy Cities Network in areas of participation and facilitation. In terms of increasing capability, we have been assisted with technical support from the mentioned ministries, which have connected us with important national and international partners and provided valuable information. A crucial step has been strengthening cooperation with key local stakeholders. Previously, many activities were conducted in isolation; now, we are leveraging our resources and capacities to create synergies for common projects. This collaborative approach is something we need to continue and develop further in the coming months. Another important step has been the utilization of new grant schemes and programs since 2022. Traditionally, we relied on operational programs focused on investments. However, since 2022, we have begun applying for Horizon and LIFE funding, and we plan to pursue additional programs related to innovative projects. These programs offer not only funding but also technical assistance, learning opportunities, and twinning. It can be stated that this change has transformed how we work and think about our activities and their funding, which is a crucial prerequisite for the successful further development of the city.

As mentioned in the CCC Action Plan and the Commitments section, these documents are 'living documents' that will evolve and improve over time, with more stakeholders, including financial ones, becoming engaged.

Regarding the next steps, they can be outlined as follows. However, we expect that many activities will be clarified, discovered, specified, and completed over time as we progress towards our goals and milestones and build new relationships and knowledge.

Increase internal capacity and capability, which is connected with a few milestones, closely connected to all points mentioned below.
Strengthening/raising wide public awareness, knowledge, understanding, strengthening commonly shared vision towards climate neutrality, which is also connected with increase in private capital/projects engagement (ongoing activity)
Regarding above mentioned information, important step is to establish sustainable, long-term, comprehensive system of cooperation, public education, awareness raising,

participation, facilitation with wide public (main focus on citizens, industry, professional public and politicians) – ongoing activity, we plan to apply for the Enabling City Transformation Call with this project, we already mapped key stakeholders for consortium establishment. Important part of that is to develop specific commitment between industrial zones in Liberec and the municipality. Furthermore, to use participatory methods to engage public in the wind power plants preparation, because in Liberec, wind power plants are not perceived positively by the public and it is necessary to work on this issue.

Strengthening current cooperation with key stakeholders in the field of common project increasing the capacity and capability, enabling reaching many synergies, building new relationships at local, national and EU level, connected with networking.

Maximization of the utilization of all EU funds and national funding programmes available, active searching for all the opportunities related to activities planned.

Focus on private capital engagement – connected to activation of key stakeholders mentioned above, mainly cooperation with two industrial zones and their activation, leading to increase in their capital involvement into climate actions. We plan to start with utilization of NZC Capital Hub (we have already prepared a project relevant, appropriate, for this assistance). Part of that is developing investment concepts for energy savings measures under the EUCF funding (2024 – 2025).

Testing new financial instruments, including NZC Capital Hub mentioned above, which is also connected with increase in (technical) knowledge in the field of developing investment plans, concepts (also with the utilization of NZC Capital Hub, PROSPECT+)

Building innovative environment, piloting innovative projects. Under this point, we aim to develop several specific activities. Given the importance of renewable energy source (RES) construction, we plan to implement a highly innovative project involving agro-photovoltaics (including retention tanks/ponds under the agro-photovoltaics on pylons) and community gardening. This project will integrate technology and social innovation and will be submitted under the European Urban Initiative – Energy Transition Call. Additionally, in spring 2025, we will explore the possibility of participating in PilotInnCities, a project led by the Ministry of Industry and Trade aimed at supporting smart cities through living labs. We are also considering various projects under Horizon calls.

All the activities mentioned above aim to support the successful implementation of actions suggested in the CCC Action Plan portfolio. Given the current state of development and our goals, we need to focus on the green transition of our local energy market, constructing renewable energy sources, phasing out remaining coal, refurbishing buildings, decarbonizing the local heating system, transitioning private and public transport to low- and zero-emission options, effective capital deployment and planning, and improving waste and public greenery management.

In conclusion, the successful implementation of this Action Plan is expected to result in a reduction of GHG emissions by 82%, equivalent to 596,345 tons CO2eq. Beyond emissions reduction, we must view the entire process as an opportunity to build a city that is sustainable, liveable, clean, and safe, while providing its citizens with excellent living conditions and improving their well-being. It is crucial to communicate this vision to the public clearly and effectively. Our goal is to become strong, sustainable, independent, and self-sufficient, to create new jobs, support local businesses and an innovative environment, and transform our perspective on opportunities and challenges. Together, we aim to drive a comprehensive behavioural change.

# 1 Introduction

Liberec is submitting this climate contract with the ambition to become a climate-neutral, resilient, sustainable, and friendly city. We aim to collaborate with all key stakeholders across the entire city, region, the Czech Republic, and the European Union. This initiative aligns with the city's overall vision as outlined in the Master Development Strategy of the Statutory City of Liberec 2021+, stated in 2022.

"Liberec, the heart of the north, is an economic centre and a modern, innovative city which takes advantage of technological progress. It offers full-fledged housing and services, promotes an active lifestyle rich in culture and sports, and it is attractive to citizens, visitors, and employers alike. Liberec is an easily accessible, walkable, and sustainable city, surrounded by unique mountain landscapes with rich water resources. It is dedicated to air protection and prepared for climate change adaptation. Here, everyone has space for self-realization and personal development. In Liberec, the well-being of citizens and the prosperity of the city coexist in mutual harmony."

# Why are we doing this?

Liberec aims to use this city climate contract to unite all key stakeholders necessary for the city's transformation. It serves as a means to facilitate and develop further cooperation and communication at all levels, leading to a commonly shared vision and increased climate actions in the city. This climate contract acts as an umbrella document incorporating all current municipal efforts, boosting them further and strengthening the city's capacity and capability to meet its goals.

The overall goal is not only connected to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, producing renewable energy, or achieving energy savings. Beyond these objectives, the main goal is to build a city that is long-term sustainable, liveable, clean, and safe, providing its citizens with good living conditions and improving their well-being over the long term. We aim to create a city that is independent and self-sufficient, generates new jobs, supports local businesses, fosters an innovative environment, and is open to change and new ways of thinking.

# What is behind this commitment?

This commitment builds on the city's participation in the Covenant of Mayors initiative, which began in January 2016. The core of this initiative is to implement specific projects aimed at achieving at least a  $40\%$  reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030. A portfolio of such projects and measures is covered by the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan, developed in 2018 and updated in 2022.

This action plan includes the city's previous activities, primarily focused on subsidy-funded projects aimed at energy savings in municipal buildings and some cross-border projects related to increasing climate resilience. After joining the Covenant of Mayors, the city's overall sustainability and resilience began to be more emphasized and reflected in its strategic planning. The Sustainable Energy and

Climate Action Plan was developed in 2018, followed by the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan in 2021, which focuses on calming the city centre, reducing car traffic, and promoting active mobility and public transport. In 2022, the Local Energy Strategy was developed, a crucial document for the city's transition and acceleration of necessary changes, especially in the energy sector and buildings. This strategy also emphasizes public education and awareness, municipal management, governance, and collaboration with key stakeholders. Concurrently, EPC projects and renewable energy construction began to be actively addressed. The Adaptation Strategy was developed and approved by the city council in 2023.

Following the aforementioned milestones, the city has decided to consolidate and umbrella these partial activities and projects under the EU Mission 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030. This initiative aims to declare the city's ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and commit to achieving climate neutrality.

Participation in the EU Mission brings many opportunities and benefits. The NetZeroCities platform has supported the city from the beginning, providing technical and methodological assistance tailored to its specific needs. Joining the mission also offers additional funding sources and strengthens the city's capacity. Moreover, the EU Mission provides significant networking opportunities, allowing Liberec to share best practices and cooperate with various actors at local, regional, national, and European levels. As the only Czech city participating in the EU Mission, Liberec has gained high visibility in the Czech Republic, improving its public relations, and negotiating position at both regional and national levels. This visibility promotes active mutual cooperation and additional support for Liberec.

An active approach within the city's green transition will naturally lead to more effective governance, built on a multi-governance approach and participation. It creates significant opportunities for building an innovative environment in Liberec, testing pilot projects in technological and social innovation, and implementing various SMART solutions across all areas.

Shortly after joining the EU Mission, Liberec began participating in international projects funded by the Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020 programs. This demonstrates a significant shift in the city's approach to international cooperation, project funding, sharing good practices, and learning. These projects have increased the city's internal capacity, both professionally and financially, and have established new links and partnerships with various public and private sector actors.

The complete process of preparing the strategic documents, which involved analysing the existing ecosystem of the city, relevant stakeholders, opportunities, and challenges, revealed that to successfully implement the action plan and achieve the set commitments and goals, it is necessary to strengthen the city's capacity in terms of expertise and finance. Additionally, it is crucial to enhance cooperation with key stakeholders (from both the private and public sectors, at horizontal and vertical levels) based on a vision shared and accepted by all.

We believe that even the small achievements reached so far represent a significant opportunity to accelerate future development and strengthen Liberec's overall position in the Czech Republic. Liberec intends to use its success and experience to inspire other Czech cities to follow its lead in the green transition by 2050.

Please note, this commitment outlines the city's ambition, goals, and methods to achieve climate neutrality. However, it does not constitute a legally enforceable commitment, either by the EU towards the City of Liberec or by the City of Liberec towards the other signatories of this contract. The contract is prepared in accordance with the requirements and methodology of the NetZeroCities Platform and will be submitted to the European Commission for validation.

It is clear that this contract will develop and change over time. Following monitoring and evaluation, some measures may be revised, new partnerships established, and new signatories added. Therefore, this contract is created as a living document, designed to evolve, and adapt in line with the development and needs of the city.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

This climate contract represents commitment to cut the greenhouse gas emissions by 82 % by 2030, with 18 % of residual emissions to be compensated.

The objective will be achieved through the implementation of the CCC Action Plan projects, where the portfolio of projects collectively meets the defined goal. The CCC Action Plan, which is annexed to this contract, has been prepared in full compliance with the methodology recommended by the NetZeroCities Platform. The commitment and measures cover the entire cadastral territory of the Statutory City of Liberec. The only sector not detailed in the preparation of the Action Plan is waste management. In the city's emission inventory, GHG emissions from waste are included in the buildings sector, in accordance with the recommended methodology, through the municipal waste incinerator located within the city's territory.

The sub-objectives are based on an analysis of the current situation, using both primary and secondary hard data, particularly from emission inventory outputs. It is evident that the vast majority of GHG emissions come from the buildings sector, especially households and industrial buildings. Therefore, it is essential to maximize the replacement of natural gas while increasing the consumption of electricity from renewable sources. The development of community energy will play a significant role in achieving this goal. Additionally, it is crucial to accelerate the development of low and zero-emission transport in the city. Key actions include the electrification of private transport (passenger cars and freight transport) and the electrification of public transport, in combination with biogas, supported by community energy engagement.

Cross-cutting measures related to public education and awareness-raising, aimed at promoting the desired behavioural change in society, are essential parts of our commitment. This includes establishing an effective system of cooperation and communication with all relevant actors from both the private and public sectors, at horizontal and vertical levels, and across ministries.

It is evident that new pilot solutions, innovative technologies, SMART solutions, and innovations within municipal capital planning and project financing will play a particularly important role in the entire transition process. Given the above, achieving this ambition must be interlinked to changes in municipal management and governance and its outward communications, including citizen participation.

The overall objective of this contract can be more specified, as follows:

Total GHG emissions reduction on the cadastral are of the statutory city of Liberec by 596 345 t CO₂eq, which means 82% reduction of emissions compared to 2019.
Offsetting residual 133 294 t CO₂eq GHG emission.

To achieve the long-term objective, the following medium-term objectives, which are cross-cutting and cross-departmental, need to be successfully implemented:

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

This section of the Climate Commitment defines four key priorities, areas that the city will actively focus on in the following few years. Suggested measures, projects, and activities to meet these priorities are detailed in the CCC Action Plan, which is annexed to this contract.

The strategic priorities of this commitment have been established in relation to the milestones in the process of shaping this contract, including the Action and Investment Plan. In mid-2023, the city's priorities were broadly addressed with the public. In June 2023, two roundtables were held for professionals, where the entire concept of the EU Mission was presented in the context of the city's activities and future projects. Key sectors for the city to focus on were discussed, along with potential future cooperation opportunities. Two civic forums were held in autumn 2023 to set priorities for the city's development, addressing various areas including climate neutrality and resilience.

Another key milestone for setting up strategic priorities was the development of the analytical part of the CCC Action Plan, particularly the emission inventory, which complemented data from the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan. The inventory shows that the majority of greenhouse gas emissions were produced in the buildings sector, particularly within households and industry. Another sector representing a high level of GHG emissions is transport, especially concerning private passenger cars and freight transport.

Last but not least, it is essential that we commit to activities related to awareness, public education, and establishing a functional system of cooperation and communication between the private and public sectors at the city, regional, and national levels. Given the range and depth of this commitment, the city must actively engage households and the local industrial and business sectors simultaneously.

In the light of above-mentioned information, the strategic priorities were set as follows:

BUILT ENVIRONMENT - Increase energy performance of buildings by phasing out fossil fuels, refurbishing buildings, and implementing effective energy management.
Support for complete refurbishment of buildings to improve their energy performance
Substitution of heating sources to reduce CO2 emissions, in particular displacement of natural gas and non-renewable electricity
Support for EPC projects, in view of above-mentioned principles
Promote construction of new buildings in line with the implementation of the new European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD IV) and trends in the construction industry.

ENERGY - Develop an independent, secure, and self-sufficient local energy market based on renewable energy production and community energy sharing.
Promote production of electricity from renewable sources, building photovoltaic power plants on the buildings' roofs, including the construction of large-scale solar parks, promoting the construction of wind power plants to balance the production profile of solar power plants

Developing the community energy in Liberec to achieve economic and social benefits as energy independence, security, and stability
Decarbonisation of the central heating system in connection with ongoing projects of the local heating plant
Heating sources replacement, phasing out natural gas and electricity produced from non-renewable sources
Support of new buildings construction in accordance with new EPBD IV and current trends on construction market
Addressing energy poverty in the city and position of vulnerable groups on the energy market.

# 3. TRANSPORTATION - Promote the electrification of private transport and develop low-emission public transport based on electrification and biogas

Electrification of private passenger cars and freight transport, support for projects and cooperation with relevant actors creating supportive environment to achieve this goal
Promoting low and zero emission public transport (electrification and biogas) in relation to existing EU regulation, related subsidies, and development of the community energy in Liberec.
Promoting active mobility, welcoming public space that is safe, permeable and allows different users to coexist.

# 4. CAPACITY BUILDING - Strengthen city capacity and capability by raising climate-neutrality awareness through participation, public education, facilitation, city networking, and continuous learning

Building internal capacities in the city, in terms of expertise of employees and officials working for the City of Liberec, while at the same time supporting and adequate structure and quality of relevant professionals/job positions in Liberec in line with current trends and labour market needs
Increasing financial resources for the implementation of the CCC Action Plan portfolio, where the purpose is to make the city's capital planning more efficient in general, to engage private investors, to use partnerships with private sector, to test new financial instruments
Address systematically awareness and information in areas related to climate change, across the city, within the municipality, at the political and operational level, in the case of professional public and citizens, civic society as well.

# 3 Process and principles

Liberec undertakes the entire process of fulfilling the obligations defined in this contract with reflect following key principles:

Climate Justice

Within the local context, it is necessary to ensure education is accessible to all, taking into account vulnerable groups, providing equal access to education, addressing energy poverty, and preventing related social risks.

Transparency

The entire process is fully transparent, with all documents published, including regular evaluations of progress. The wide public will be engaged in the process of any future amendments and changes toward the established goals.

Building and inclusive city ecosystem

It is necessary to build a functional city ecosystem based on multi-level governance and participation (co-creation) of all key stakeholders, including citizens, to contribute to a shared vision and its active support. An integral part of this is more coherent, targeted cooperation at the regional and national levels, promoting Liberec as a regional capital city and the only Czech city participating in the EU mission. This approach will also position Liberec as an innovative, experimental centre in the field of GHG reduction, allowing it to share experiences, knowledge, and results with other Czech cities.

Coordination of the climate commitment and the adaptation strategy commitment

The climate contract and related portfolio of projects primarily focus on mitigation measures, but these must be addressed in a coherent and coordinated manner with adaptation measures to increase the climate resilience of the city.

Support for innovation, pilot projects and SMART solutions

Liberec aims to build an innovative environment in the city to test and introduce new technological and social innovations and solutions that fulfil the Smart City concept. To achieve this, it is necessary to cooperate with key stakeholders, including institutions involved in supporting research, development, and innovations, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, innovative start-ups, industrial enterprises in the city, and other Czech and European cities through joint projects.

Continuous learning system based on regular monitoring and evaluation

The purpose is to continuously improve the entire transition process, which we see as a constantly repeating cycle. This will lead to the gradual incorporation of new activities, approaches, technologies, and solutions into the city's standard processes, making them the new normal.

With regard to above mentioned principles, goals, and content of the CCC Action Plan, the entire process – cycle – and important milestones of the transition can be visualized as follows:

![img-27.jpeg](img-27.jpeg)

The whole cycle and process of the city's green transition are built on several elements, none of which has more weight or priority; all of them must be implemented simultaneously and continuously. The points summarize the implementation and focus of the CCC Action Plan (reduce, replace, renewables, research, re-use, raise awareness), including monitoring, evaluation, a learning process, and revision of existing measures (reflect, revise, repeat).

Taking into account the current situation in the city (the city's emission inventory and the measures set in the action plan), it is clear that it is necessary to improve the energy performance of buildings and lead society in general towards responsible and sustainable energy management in everyday processes, including sustainable consumption (REDUCE). At the same time, it is necessary to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, whether in buildings or in low/zero-emission transport. In particular, natural gas must be displaced from the buildings sector and diesel from the transport sector

(REPLACE). Fossil fuels must be replaced by renewable energy sources, including wind energy in addition to solar energy (RENEWABLES), to achieve a balanced production profile in relation to our commitment level. Liberec will support the city's innovation environment to test and apply innovative technologies and solutions, cooperate with all key stakeholders, and actively participate in international projects (RESEARCH). At the same time, we need to focus on the circular economy, sustainable consumption, and efficient waste management (REUSE).

A key part of the complete process is to inform and educate, sharing experiences and good practices to promote the most desirable society-wide change in this area. This will impact daily decision-making processes and choices in a more sustainable direction, leading to behavioural change. In addition to the residents, it is equally necessary to continuously educate politicians, employees, and city officials to make decisions and take actions based on comprehensive and quality information. Full understanding of the entire system reinforces the city's shared ambition and commitment to climate neutrality (RAISE AWARENESS).

An integral feature of the city's transition is the cyclical process based on continuous monitoring, evaluation, and subsequent revision of measures and activities to meet the city's goals (REFLECT). It can be summarized as an ongoing cycle based on the implementation of the CCC Action Plan, reflection on achieved milestones, new challenges, threats, and opportunities, and the process of learning to make it the new normal (REPEAT)
