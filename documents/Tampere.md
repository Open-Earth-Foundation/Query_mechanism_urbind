# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

The City of Tampere has a very strong foundation for its climate work. Tampere started its systematic work to mitigate climate change in 2010. Since then, Tampere has been one of the national forerunner-cities in climate change mitigation and adaptation in Finland. The results have been quite remarkable.

City's main guiding tool for climate work is the biennially updated "Tampere Carbon Neutrality Roadmap 2030". The roadmap contains a comprehensive set of measures defined in cooperation with city's units and its subsidiaries. The roadmap also includes impact assessment for a wide variety of actions, including both emission reduction and cost estimates. The progress of climate work is monitored in the Climate Watch and the Climate Budget, which transparently communicate the city's climate work to citizens, politicians, private sector and other stakeholders.

Tampere has already reduced climate emissions from a 1990 baseline more than 30 % in absolute numbers and more than 50 % per capita. According to current action and projections, the roadmap can take us to 73 % reduction, when the target is - 80 % by 2030. As the results obtained so far indicate, the low hanging fruit to enhance climate change mitigation have been picked. Tampere has already successfully invested in renewable energy and the public transport system. At the time being the very difficult systemic challenges remain to be solved. The most difficult of them is the reduction of GHG emissions from transport. This will require a mix of systematic work jointly with the citizens, private sector and the authorities.

Therefore, Action Plan focuses on the emissions gap remaining after the roadmap. This leaves 7% of the baseline emissions to be addressed. Also, so far the roadmap has been focused on what the city organisation can do to reduce emissions. To achieve our goal, we also need to involve city residents, businesses and communities. The action portfolio in the Action Plan addresses what needs to be done in the future and with which stakeholders to cover the gaps. The actual co-creation will take place during future updates of the roadmap and through development projects.

Action Plan has identified systemic strategic priorities that need to be taken into account in addition to those already planned to reach the target:

) Boosting modal shift by co-creating actions with citizens and big employers to promote sustainable transport, and studying the public opinion.
) Transforming city logistics move to lighter vehicles and alternative propulsion by guiding.
) Promoting industrial electrification by communicating with big fossil fuel users to update projections and plans, implementing Green Deal for zero-emission construction sites and providing oil heating advice to SMEs.
) Providing energy advice and alleviating energy hardship/mitigating energy vulnerability by oil heating advice to private homeowners, developing financing models and piloting energy advice to people with potential energy hardship.
) Promoting smart energy systems and systems integration by preparing an energy strategy and an urban development platform.

In addition to the identified additional strategic priorities, we should focus on in the coming years, Action Plan contains our plan to:

Understand the system we're working in and cross the special barriers we have identified
Co-desing solutions with deeply committed but also recent stakeholders, specially citizens and companies in Tampere region
Take action combining the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap to measuring and estimating the results.

The costs of the additional prioritised measures identified in Action Plan could not yet be estimated and have therefore not been included in the Investment Plan. Investment Plan covers actions and

their costs that are already largely in the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap. Investment Plan summarises the financial resources planned for these actions, and the potential capital needed in addition to the planned costs.

Our aim is to integrate the Climate City Contract, the roadmap and the climate budget into a single process that will complement each other with each update, ensuring that Tampere is carbon neutral by 2030. In achieving the climate neutrality goal by 2030, the City of Tampere recognizes the importance of collaboration with citizens, businesses, and academia.

# 1 Introduction

## Introduction - textual element

The City of Tampere started its systematic work to mitigate climate change in 2010. Since then Tampere has been one of the national forerunner-cities in climate change mitigation and adaptation in Finland.

Reducing greenhouse gas reduction goals have been set by the City Council and the needed work has been manifested over the years in city's strategy documents. The "Sustainable Tampere 2030" guidelines accepted in the City Council 2018 set the objective for Tampere carbon neutrality by 2030. The current city strategy contains the city's carbon neutrality target for 2030 and related actions. Furthermore, carbon neutrality has risen to one of the four focus areas of the city strategy. This objective is reflected in the City Strategy which sets the objective of increasing the share of sustainable modes of transport by 5% by the end of the City Council's term of office (2021-2025).

The results have been quite remarkable. To summarize the results, we have achieved a 30% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (reference year is 1990) while the city population has grown from 173 000 to 250 000 or 45%. Subsequently, the per capita emissions have reduced more than 50%. Since these figures from 2021, the city energy utility has renewed its largest plant in 2022 which will bring a further 20% decrease in GHG emissions.

The city has from the start taken the stand that climate issues do not have a dedicated climate management subsystem but they and their advancement will take place within the city's existing management structures. This was more challenging in the beginning but has proven to be the right choice as climate issues are dealt within normal strategic, governance and financial processes. This has also enabled us to include more easily largest city owned companies including energy utility, housing companies, real estate firms and water utilities under the same strategic goals as rest of the city. Subsequently, most city-owned companies of climate relevance have calculated their carbon footprint and created their own, internal roadmaps how they will reach carbon neutrality by 2030. For the companies, setting these goals makes also business-sense.

City's main guiding tool for climate work is the "Tampere Carbon Neutrality Roadmap 2030". It contains all the implementation actions across the city including their carbon relevance as well as investments needed to carry them out. All city units from early-childhood education to street planning and school building prioritize annually from the roadmap the actions they will carry out that year and they will also reserve the required funding in their budgets. The results are then collated in "Climate Watuard" that is a transparent interface to city climate work open to all citizens, politicians, the private sector and other stakeholders. The roadmap is updated by city units every two years.

The climate budget is part of the Tampere City Annual Budget. The climate budget sheds light on where we are currently regarding our climate targets, where we should be and what is being done about it. Tampere was the first Finnish city to start developing this structure and incorporate it in the city financial processes and financial statements.

To include various stakeholders even more, the city has also initiated a Climate Partners network for regional companies. There are now currently over 100 companies in this network. Further, Tampere is active in national networks including but not limited to Finnish Green Building Council, the Climate Leadership Coalition network for professionals and other professional networks. Internationally, Tampere is actively involved in network and Horizon Europe projects and has received international recognitions for its climate work.

As the results obtained so far indicate, the low hanging fruit to enhance climate change mitigation have been picked. Tampere has already successfully invested in renewable energy and the public transport system. Renewables in energy production have grown from 5% to 55% and will soon be 70%. The per capita growth of energy consumption in heating and electricity has also stopped. It can

be said that most of the low hanging fruit as well as some of the heavy lifting is done. Thus, only very difficult systemic challenges remain to be solved. The most difficult of them is the reduction of GHG emissions from transport. This will require a mix of systematic work jointly with the citizens, private sector and the authorities.

No silver bullet is available: electrification of cars is not enough but a major model shift is needed in transport towards more sustainable future. To this end, the city has started a multi-year strategic programme that works with residents to empower them to change their mobility and consumption habits towards more sustainable alternatives. We try to find novel ways for doing this as traditional ways have not borne fruit anywhere.

The future looks bright. According to our impact estimates the latest update of the roadmap can lead to 73 % emissions reduction compared to 1990 while the goal is 80 %. In order to close the gap of the remaining 7 %, the modal shift in transport is needed. We can achieve this only with our citizens and various stakeholder groups in the coming few years.

# 2 Work Process

## Work Process - combination of textual and visual elements

In this chapter we describe our work process, according to the NZC Climate Transition Map (Figure 2.1). The City of Tampere has already made huge steps towards climate neutrality before becoming a Mission City. Here we describe how we have done it and what are the plans for future. We acknowledge that there is more work ahead in the future, and EU Mission work will be important in this.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 2.1. The NZC Climate Transition Map.

## Build a strong mandate:

The City's climate actions have been gathered into [the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap](the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap). The roadmap was created together with all the city's service areas, various units, public utilities, and city's companies. The Climate and Environmental Policy Unit coordinates the process and monitors the implementation of the measures. [The Climate Watch](The Climate Watch) service has been created to monitor the measures, where everyone can follow the implementation of the City of Tampere's climate work. The roadmap currently contains a total of 305 measures under six different themes: sustainable urban planning, sustainable mobility, sustainable energy, sustainable construction, sustainable consumption, and sustainable urban nature.

The City Board approved the roadmap on August 31, 2020, and the first update on October 3, 2022. The roadmap will be updated every two years and the next updating process for 2024 has already begun. The implementation of the roadmap is embedded into the City's strategic management systems as the City units include their climate actions from the roadmap to their annual service and financial plans, which will be officially monitored.

Tampere's climate budget and Climate City Contract's Investment plan combines climate work with the city's budget and financial statements. It is used to monitor the progress towards the climate neutrality target and the adequacy of implemented measures. At the same time, the goal of climate neutrality becomes more concrete in the annual budget. The climate budget provides information for decision-making and increases transparency for residents. Tampere's climate budget consists of two parts: the climate emissions budget, and the financial plan for climate actions.

The latest demonstration of city's commitment to net-zero ambitions, including citizens, is its latest development program "Climate Neutral Actions". Development programme operates at city district level and promotes change from a local perspective. It concentrates on changing people's mobility and consumption habits as well as enhancing conditions for circular economy. The program enjoys funding until 2025.

Besides citizen work, Climate Neutral Actions programme's aim is to support companies in climate and environmentally sustainable business and help them find new business opportunities through circular economy and carbon neutrality. One of the many forms of business collaborations is the Tampere Region Climate Partnership which has systematically involved companies, associations, and communities in pursuing a carbon-neutral Tampere since 2020.

Our aim is to integrate the CCC, the roadmap and the climate budget into a single process that will complement each other with each update, ensuring that Tampere is carbon neutral by 2030. In achieving the climate neutrality goal by 2030, the City of Tampere recognizes the importance of collaboration with citizens, businesses, and academia.

## Understanding the system:

We have identified systems through expert work, and workshops have also been held on these among other services in the context of the impact pathways. We have identified systems and linkages before, for example in our roadmap process, but the preparation of the CCC gave us a better understanding of the multiple systems and their linkages. For more information on these, see Chapter 3 for a discussion of the content of our portfolio, current policies, and strategies at local, regional, national and EU level. We strongly recognize the role of the city in this, and the engagement and commitment of stakeholders in our climate work.

## Co-designing the portfolio:

The process of preparing the Climate City Contract was carried out jointly at national and local level. The City of Tampere has been strongly involved in the Mission's national support network, participating in meetings and workshops with other Mission cities. Tampere also hosted a Mission meeting in connection with the Climate Change Conference in May 2023.

As we are already well advanced in our Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap work, and as mentioned before, it has been created in cooperation with the whole city organization and its subsidiaries, we focused our Action Plan work on identifying gaps and stakeholders. Because of this, we organized stakeholder workshops during the summer of 2023 within the city, involving key people from areas such as transport system planning unit and land use, in addition to climate and environmental policy. We also organized workshops to consider impact pathways, with a particular focus on transport, which is one of the main challenges for the City of Tampere in terms of reducing emissions.

We have also held discussions about the Mission with Business Tampere, which coordinates the Climate Partners network. We have also had close discussions with Tampere University and the Tampere University of Applied Sciences, and they also joined us as partners in this round already.

## Take action

We have had a Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap since 2020, and measures are being implemented across the city organization. The implementation of the measures is updated in the Climate Guard tool, which everyone can follow, i.e., the city's climate work is transparent both to citizens, politicians and private sector.

At the same time as the roadmap update process will start again in autumn 2023, the measures of the previous roadmap will be implemented. Our aim is to make the measures part of our core work. Some of the measures, for example in the building sector, are already in place and have reached their targets. 21% of the measures in the current roadmap are complete and only less than 10% have not been started. Most of the measures are at the implementation or planning stage (see fluge 2.2.).

# Learn and reflect

The City of Tampere updates the Tampere 2030 Roadmap every two years. The updates are accompanied by workshops and meetings to discuss how the roadmap could be developed. This autumn, we have also conducted customer feedback interviews with the people in the departments responsible for updating the roadmap in those departments. In these interviews, we looked at how we could improve the process ourselves.

One of the lessons we have already learned from the current Roadmap measures is that some of them are difficult to measure: they are ongoing, basic work and will never be completed. For example, improving public transport service levels is an ongoing effort, and much progress has been made in recent years. We will also clarify our objectives and measures. Some measures have multiple responsibilities, with no one person taking ownership of the measure. We will consider these with other units during the next round of updates.

We also intend to learn from others as the mission work progresses. For example, we have now had discussions with other Finnish mission cities, and shared lessons with each other.

# Make it the new normal

Our overall goal is to make climate work a new normal. For example, we have focused on a model of climate governance, which we are taking forward. Our roadmap measures are those that aim to become part of the core work of the city so that they do not need to be implemented separately. This is why we are constantly collaborating with other units. The intention is to extend this to businesses and other stakeholders in order to achieve our carbon neutrality goals. We are also working hard on sustainable lifestyles for residents, and our aim here too is to make climate action a normal part of everyday life.

In this CCC, we have identified our current gaps, which we will look to address in the next roadmap update process, which will start this autumn. Similarly, in the next CCC we will be able to update the measures of the new roadmap, as well as identify any gaps that exist at the moment. This will be repeated until 2030 (Figure 2.3). At the same time, we will implement our measures, as they are part of the annual plan of the services and the strategy of the City of Tampere. Our next steps are described in more detail at the end of the Action plan, in chapter six.

# 3 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

# 3.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

# A-1.5: Graphics and charts

The latest full Greenhouse gas inventory from Tampere is from 2021. Tampere has also reported fully to CDP platform since 2021. Thus, details of the emission calculations are not reported here, but the calculation excel sheet is attached to the Action Plan just as it is to the CDP-report.

Tampere follows up on the energy system separately from the emissions calculation, which is performed by an external partner. The full energy balance is done with few deviations the most important being that the energy use of road transport is based on fuel sold, whereas the emission calculations are based on a national model where the kilometres driven in Tampere are allocated there. Figure 3.1 presents the energy balance of Tampere from 2021. The current situation in 2023 has already changed significantly. The importance of natural gas has changed due to the war in Ukraine and subsequent embargos. The use of peat is quickly coming to an end due to a new biomass power plant that started producing energy in December 2022. The share of electricity being used for transport has yet to be estimated, but the share of electric cars is growing fast, so an estimate will need to be made in future balances.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 3.1. Energy balance of Tampere (all units are GWh). Total primary energy use is 6835 GWh, total end use is 6377 GWh. An amount of 174,8 GWh of district heating is sold to other municipalities, which causes some discrepancy here.

The main greenhouse gas inventory in Tampere is based on a national calculation that largely corresponds to GPC protocol for cities and thus accounts for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions within the geographical borders of the city. The total amount and per capita emissions are presented in Figure 3.2,

Both the emissions projection and climate budget are based on the same calculation method as the main greenhouse gas inventory. The climate budget, unlike the projection, is based on the target of -80 % by 2030 and states the maximum amount of emissions for each financial year that allows the city to achieve its carbon-neutrality target. The latest climate budget is presented in Figure 3.6.

A full picture of the current situation can be seen in Figure 3.7. Tampere is currently lagging behind the climate budgets of 2020-2021 but is likely to catch up by 2025 according to roadmap projections. However, there is still a significant gap projected at 2030. More information about the Climate Budget can be found in the link provided in Annexes.

Figure 3.7. Climate budget and realized emissions as presented in the financial statements 2022 of City of Tampere.

Tampere has not included scope 3 emissions in its reporting or climate targets yet, but has been actively involved in developing methods for their calculation. Figure 3.8 presents the consumption based emissions from 2020 and 2022 from a recently completed co-operation with an external consultant and several Finnish cities. As expected, the total of consumption-based emissions is about double the amount of geographic emissions since there is not much industrial operations in the geographical area of Tampere.

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

Emissions are presented in this Action Plan only as charts, but the details are openly reported to Carbon Disclosure Project -platform (CDP) since 2020. In this Action Plan we use emission calculations exactly as we use them in our local plans, objectives and management. For historical reasons, that does not include F gases, but now the data exists also for this sector and will be integrated soon.

# Methodology

Tampere has had a yearly climate emissions inventory drawn up since 2010 using a nationally comparable methodology called CO2-raportti (CO2-report). The method calculates emissions from the geographical area of City of Tampere. A detailed description of the methodology is linked in the annexes of this Action Plan.

The division of sectors differs slightly from the Common reporting Framework:

Instead of stationary energy, the inventory presents separately emissions for heating and electricity use in buildings. The emissions for heating and electricity consumption can be calculated with a very high level of accuracy due to availability of both consumption and production data. Thus heating is further divided into categories: district heating, separate heating (oil and gas), electric heating and ground source heat pumps (electricity use). Electricity is divided into industrial electricity consumption and other electricity consumption. All energy emissions cover scope 1 and scope 2 emissions.

Transport emissions in total is the same as CRF, but it is broken down to by vehicle type. This sector covers only road traffic since the emissions from air and water in Tampere are negligible. Rail emissions are included in the projections since the share of tram and local trains is growing. Transport emissions cover scope 1, electricity used to charge vehicles cannot be separated from stationary energy.

Waste sector is the same. The waste that is collected from households in the region can be accounted for, the emissions are divided to municipalities based on the number of residents.

IPPU-sector is called industry and work machines. It covers fossil fuel use in industrial facilities and work machinery. Tampere has next to no industry with climate emissions from product use.

AFOLU sector covers the emissions from agriculture. There is no national methodology for land use and forestry emissions to be broken down by region. This is the next gap to be covered in the inventory.

F-gases are calculated by SYKE, a national environmental research center. The numbers are not yet integrated into the basic inventory or the climate budget, but that will be addressed latest in 2024. The numbers are reported to the CDP platform.

# Working on scope 3

Tampere has started working on covering emissions occurring elsewhere due to consumption. The carbon footprint of construction from 2020 has been estimated earlier with an update to 2021 and 2022 being planned shortly. The results are seen in Figure 3.9.

There has been a common effort of several cities in Finland and the consultancy Sitowise Ltd to develop methods for calculating comparable consumption-based emissions for cities in Finland. The results from 2022 are visible in the Figure 3.8. These results show that the total emission just about double when emissions occurring elsewhere are taken into account.

# Baseline and current situation
TAMPERE
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
C

Tampere's baseline emissions are from 1990 as according to the Covenant of Mayors, which the city has joined already in 2009. The SEAP, SECAP, Carbon-neutral Tampere roadmap 2030 and Climate Budget are all based on this. As seen in figure 3.2, the baseline total of emissions is 1 300 000 t CO2e, which means that the residual emissions total in 2030 should be a maximum of 260 000 t CO2e. In per capita numbers, the baseline is 7,5 t CO2e and residual emissions an estimated 1,0 t CO2e, which is deemed to be less than our fair share by WWF in the One Planet City Challenge of 2021. Figure 3.4. shows are breakdown of emissions in 1990, which is not as detailed as the one from 2021 (Figure 3.3.) due to lack of granularity in data.

The latest emissions inventory is from 2021 and the total there is 898 000 t CO2e, which, compared to 1990, is a 31 % reduction in absolute emissions and 51 % in per capita emissions. Since the emission statistics come in very late, the actual situation has already changed in 2023. The local power utility has just completed an investment in a new, extremely efficient biomass power plant that allows ending use of peat in district heating. We estimate this reduces the emissions of the city by a total of about 20 % form 2021. So in effect, the reduction compared to 1990 is now around 45 % in absolute numbers.

Figure 3.5 gives a full picture of the emissions development in each sector from 2010 to 2020 as well as the emissions projection until 2030. More detailed analysis of the development of each of the sectors is included in the attached Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap pp. 20-22

## Climate budget and emissions projection

The latest version of the carbon-neutrality roadmap from 2022 included an update of the emissions projection. The results are presented in Figure 3.5. This projection includes assumptions for external changes such as the decarbonization of national electricity production, baseline projection for heating and electricity demand and an optimistic scenario of electric vehicles and biofuels.

In addition, the current development scenario includes such climate action that cannot be seen in the GHG inventories yet, but the investments have already been decided and are being implemented.

The roadmap scenario includes other actions from the roadmap that could be accounted for. The biggest remaining question marks are modal shift impacts of the plan, the actual emissions from existing landfills (as opposed to modeled) and the impact of actions by industrial players.

More detailed analysis of the projection and the remaining gap is also presented in the annexed Carbon neutral Tampere 2030 roadmap on pages 128-129 and its appendix 1 pp. 142-149.

Tampere sets yearly targets for each emission sector in the Climate Budget, which is a part of the annual financial planning and documents. This allows for transparency in how well the city is advancing towards its targets as well as an annual analysis of progress in each sector. The latest analysis from financial documents of 2022 can be seen in figure 3.6.

Figure 3.7 brings together all of the above: baseline, past and current emissions, climate budget and the emissions projection. As can be seen, Tampere can get very close to its target, but there is still clear gap that remains and it is the toughest change that still needs to happen.

## Residual emissions

The residual emissions for 2030 should be a maximum of 260 000 t CO2e. A breakdown of the target per sector is the target of the climate budget as in figure 3.6 above.

The remaining emissions from heating are based on predictions of how much of fossil fuels can be replaced in the sector by 2030. Residual emissions in district heating are mainly from waste incineration, where district heating can be considered waste heat usage. A small fraction of oil heating will likely remain in 2030 and the national legislation only demands a 10 % share of biofuel in it. Heating consumption is affected by increases in energy efficiency and renewal of the building stock.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Electricity emissions are calculated according to the national average production. It will be almost decarbonized by 2030 but an estimated 31 g CO2/kWh is predicted to remain. This is enough to reach the targets set in the climate budget.

Residual traffic emissions target is set according to the national target and made a little bit stricter since Tampere is a city with more potential for sustainable transport than small towns and rural areas. According to projections and analysis, it will be very hard to reach in a short amount of time. Even with very optimistic assumptions of the share of electric cars and biofuels, it is clear we need more efficient transport to reach the target. That means modal shift to sustainable modes and optimization of logistics as well as reduction of transport need through urban planning.

Residual emissions for industry and work machines is set according to current trends and national projections of industry emissions reductions. It might be possible to reach lower levels, if major industrial facilities will electrify their operations in time. Work machines are electrifying very slowly, so some level of residual emissions is likely.

Residual emissions from waste are set according to an estimation of how the emissions from existing landfills will gradually decrease. However, the emissions inventories from last years are far from the predicted trend. This needs to be studied more closely to see if the issue is with real emissions or the calculation. Other emissions from waste will be dealt with by 2025.

Emissions from agriculture are very small to begin with and the transition to more climate friendly methods is slow. The target is set as lenient and the projection is made based on current trends.

# A-2.2: Description &amp; assessment of policies

The Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap describes climate change mitigation efforts in the city. In total there are over 300 measures – and their number may develop according to needs - under seven themes. We have compiled the roadmap in close cooperation with the entire city organization. Each measure has at least one team that is responsible for its implementation. However, the roadmap does not follow the administrative structure of the city. Therefore, several bodies may be responsible for a given measure. The operating model ensures that the entire city organization is committed to the carbon neutrality target.

The aim of the roadmap is to reduce  $80\%$  of city's CO2 emissions from 1990 level by 2030. When setting the climate neutrality target, we have been aware of the Paris agreement emission scenarios and have set a significantly stricter target than the national one. This comparison is basically qualitative in nature since no detailed calculations have been made. While making our SECAP and
#

TAMPERE

#

this roadmap, we have made scenarios of climate emissions of the city with current developments and another one with roadmap actions. These scenarios are quantitative and fairly detailed. The roadmap is actually based on the work started in SECAP and currently, we focus on improving and updating the roadmap instead of SECAP.

The sustainable urban mobility plan (SUMP) reinforces and demonstrates the objectives set for mobility in the local master plan, the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap and other city's development plans. The key goal of SUMP is to instill the principles of sustainable urban mobility more prominently into mobility planning and decision-making. The sustainable urban mobility plan and actions have been drawn up for 2021-2024. The plan will be updated in connection with updates of the local master plan or earlier, if necessary, in case significant change needs arise.

The Strategic Local Master plan for main city area is periodically updated once every electoral term. In the most recent update, the themes of this plan are adaptation to climate change and development of the green environment. This plan is the second master plan to include a wide estimate of climate emission impacts. The residents can provide feedback on the plan online. In addition, four events are organized to give the residents an opportunity to ask questions and comment the plan.

The importance of climate change mitigation has been recognized in the Tampere city strategy as well. The focus of the theme "Carbon Neutral Actions" is on citizens and private sector. We have found a four-year development program to pursue the strategy. The aim of the program is to enable sustainable choices for everyone.

To conclude, we feel that our plans are quite advanced already, but we also need evaluation of the city's governance approaches to ensure the city's governance system truly is fit for the 2030 objective. For example, funding issues are a big challenge for us, and this is what we will be working on before the next CCC update to make up for the gaps. The City of Tampere is already engaged in codevelopment, but this needs to be continuously developed in a way that takes into account all citizens and businesses of different backgrounds.

The emissions gap has been presented here in a similar fashion as it is presented in the Climate Budget of Tampere. Thus the structure is slightly different to what has been proposed in the template.

Residual emissions consist of those emissions which can't be reduced through climate action and are being offset. Residual emission may amount to a maximum of 20 % as stated by the Mission Info Kit. Residual emissions are compared to 1990 as per the decisions made in Tampere when joining the Covenant of Mayors
Necessary reduction = Latest emissions – residual emissions offsetting.

# A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers – textual elements

As can be seen in Figure 3.6 of the climate budget, the sectors clearly lagging behind targets are district heating, traffic and waste. The emissions development in each sector is further analysed in the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap attached to this Action Plan.

**District heating** is not far behind its target, the reinvestments from fossil fuels to renewables and waste incineration has already taken place. The remaining use of fossil fuels for district heating is only for peak load times in very cold weather with no excess electricity production. On the other hand, combined heat and power production from waste remains base load for the district heating system. Merely improving energy efficiency or doing demand side management will not reduce these emissions. So the systemic barriers to overcome are:

Waste CHP emissions
Lack of demand side management in peak load times
Producing clean heat at peak load

In **traffic** emissions, the challenge is much bigger. The focus is on private cars and logistics as they cause more than 90 % of the emissions together with more than 60 % caused by private cars. Tampere has already made major investments in a tramway and service levels of public transport. The land use planning for residential buildings is also focused to public transport zones. The use of public transport is growing fast despite the adverse impact of pandemic times. According to projections, even very optimistic scenarios of electric vehicles and the nation mandated biofuel distribution share will not take us to the 2030 target, which is set at 115 000 t CO2e. Thus, it is necessary to reduce the amount of kilometres driven compared to current levels despite a significant population growth. The systemic analysis here becomes very complex. The main barriers identified are:

High persistence of having a private car and driving smoothly anywhere: the actions are necessary to make the most of sustainable mobility investments and make space on the road network for necessary driving.
Funding for necessary changes to existing road network to have space for sustainable transport: Tampere invests a lot to new residential areas as the population growth has only gotten bigger in recent years.
Funding the needed growth of public transport: the national government might not be willing to provide growing financial support for growing public transport operation.
Making choices in land use planning: Balancing different interests and needs in land use planning while making determined effort for reaching climate neutrality especially when it comes to traffic emissions is challenging. It is necessary to find ways to measure the impacts against each other.

More than 30 % of traffic emissions come from logistics. Tampere already has a logistics action plan for 2023-25. The climate aspect and especially the systemic aspect of logistics remains yet to be unpacked. It's important to start co-operation with private companies that are big employers and have big logistics needs (e.g. big grocery store chains and industry) to work on the traffic system transition together.

The challenge with **waste management emissions** is lack of reliable data. Based on the current emissions calculation method, the main part of emissions is existing landfills. It remains unclear if the reason for the high emissions is in the model or the data used for the model. The results are very different for different regions in Finland. Another indication of this kind of error is that the methane collected from the landfill is reducing faster than the calculated emissions. Otherwise many necessary emissions-reducing solutions have already been implemented in the waste sector:

Municipal biowaste is being treated to produce biogas for transport and fertilizer for farming, the biogas is used for transporting waste in the region

TAMPERE

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Wastewater treatment is being transferred to a new facility that is built underground to control emissions from waste water, the sludge will be treated to biogas and used for heat and power production for the facility
Landfills are no longer in use, all municipal waste that is not recycled is used as fuel in a combined heat and power plant
Biogas is collected from the existing landfill and used as fuel at the combined heat and power plant

In addition, a few sectors look fairly good on the climate budget, but have known challenges for getting to the target.

**Industry and work machines** emissions look good on the Climate Budget table, but are very dependent on big industrial facilities using fossil gas to produce heat. The challenge here is to find a technical solution that will not be too hard on the electricity production system. Work machines are the smaller portion, but the change also needs to happen. It starts with a national Green Deal for zero-emission construction sites. The city's own construction sites are a fraction of all construction in the city. But, by showing example and demanding a change in the technology the city can have a widespread impact.

At the moment **Oil heating** (more than 95 % of separate heating) looks like it might get to its target, but the situation could change. This sector has gained speed from financial support from the national government to private homeowners. The latest government has cut the support from future budgets, which might hinder the progress and lead to lagging behind from targets. The city provides support and advice to oil heaters but has no means to provide financial assistance. This is an important topic related to energy poverty. Some people cannot afford the investment it would take to lower the cost of daily energy.

The final systemic barrier is not directly related to emissions but **financing** the work that needs to be done both in investment and operations terms. Financing has been readily available and for the big investments Tampere has successfully applied innovative financing models. However, systematically following up and planning to the future for the climate action has not been done for very long. Changing ways of working and starting to document cost saving and measure sustainability impacts along with money takes time in a big organization. Financial barriers are further analyzed in the Investment Plan Module A-3.1 and Table 4

A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements
Figure 3.10. The Tampere climate stakeholder model brings together the main actors in society. For the time being the focus has been on the public sector, but it is increasingly clear that the contribution of businesses and residents is fundamental.

# Public sector sharing crucial data and goals

The most important field of stakeholders, at least for the time being, is the public sector, whose actors in different sectors and levels are central to the work. The City of Tampere is an active forerunner of the Tampere City Region. The eight municipalities in the region co-operate through a joint 2030 Roadmap for a Carbon Neutral City Region. The work is organized through national HINKU-network and follows the targets and framework of the network. The Council of Tampere Region holds the strategy work for the whole region. The Council also provides EU structural funds locally.

In close cooperation there is also the Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (ELY Centres) that leads the local Climate forum, providing a common network to share information about funding opportunities, local new research innovations, crucial data and local information about the local development scenarios of emissions and carbon sequestration. Environmental institutes like The Baltic Institute of Finland bring the civil society to discussion with the local governance.

# Circular Economy Networks

As an environmental institute for the circular economy there are publicly (municipalities) owned organizations promoting Circular Economy, these include Pirkanmaa Regional Council, Tampere City Region, Business Tampere, Ekokumppanit Oy/EcoFellows and especially its Circular Economy Project in Pirkanmaa region (main focus on the construction sector and industrial symbiosis). There is a good co-operation between public operators to work together and Pirkanmaa has been selected as one of the pilot regions in Europe in Circular Cities and Regions Initiative, CCRI (Circular Cities and Regions Initiative | Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (europa.eu)). Also other stakeholders, such as university of Tampere, private sector (Tampere Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, private companies) and the waste management company owned by 17 municipalities in Pirkanmaa Region are part of the circular economy network in Tampere.

At the national level [the Ministry of the Environment] and EU Mission support projects such as Climate Mission Finland 2030 and the [Net Zero Cities network](Net Zero Cities network) are naturally important stakeholders.

## Subsidiaries reach the companies

Of course, the private sector is also essential. The economic development agency [Business Tampere](Business Tampere) is owned by the City of Tampere. It is the link between the public and private sectors. Business Tampere promotes investments and creates an attractive environment for sustainable business in the region. The same applies to Ekokumppanit/EcoFellows from another angle. Ekokumppanit is also a subsidiary of the City of Tampere. It is counselling, training and offering expert services in the Tampere region to promote a sustainable lifestyle and business. The unique eco-partnership activities were launched in 2003, when the City of Tampere and its enterprises together with [Pirkanmaan Jätehuolto Oy](Pirkanmaan Jätehuolto Oy) established the company. The third owner of the company since the beginning of 2009 has been [Tampereen Energia](Tampereen Energia). Ekokumppanit belongs to the European network of energy agencies. It is also social enterprise and holds [The Finnish Social Enterprise mark](The Finnish Social Enterprise mark) to show the engagement to responsible business activities and the social good as a primary objective.

## The Climate Partnership actively engages businesses

Together with Business Tampere and Ekokumppanit the City of Tampere reaches for private companies. The Tampere region's climate partnership model (Ilmastokumppanit) is to involve companies and communities in the region in pursuing a carbon-neutral Tampere. The Climate Partnership is, as the name implies, a partnership; it is intended to benefit both parties to the partnership agreement. There are already 116 climate partners in Tampere Region. Kausal is an example of a company with which the City of Tampere work closely, for example in assessing carbon neutrality work.

## Explicitly and openly involving residents in climate work

The importance of citizens and the communities they form as stakeholders is increasing. The city is well into the process of changing the way it does things, now that it is realising that sustainable transport choices, for example, are residents' choices. The Carbon Neutral Actions development programme, one of the four priorities of Tampere's strategy, explicitly involves residents in climate work and openly develops with them ways in which citizens can build a good and sustainable everyday life. This will be done in partnership with communities and associations, but in three selected areas in particular. The aim is for public opinion to reach the point where sustainable choices become the choices of the majority. The aims and process of the programme is described in more detail in chapter 2.1.

## Strategic cooperation with academia and research

The stakeholder model also includes [the University of Tampere and Tampere University of Applied Sciences](the University of Tampere and Tampere University of Applied Sciences) with its students. The city is now to set a target for research community collaboration and hired resource to promote strategic partnerships between the city and the higher education community (TAMK and the university), including student cooperation, international cooperation, business cooperation and RDI. The City of Tampere has strategic collaboration agreement with two of its major research partners and climate action has been identified in them as one of strategic topic. The carbon neutrality work is also evaluated by the state-owned research institute VTT. Major barrier found here is strategic funding of processes.

## The media as a shaper of public opinion

The media is also a relevant stakeholder; local newspapers, especially [Aamulehti](Aamulehti), have a strong influence on public opinion. So do the regional radio, television and online operations of the [Finnish Broadcasting Corporation (Yle)]. The [Tampere.fi](Tampere.fi) website, as the city's information channel, is an opportunity to report on the progress of climate work without using the media as a tool. The social media channels of the city and its various communities also have a strong and human influence on the opinions and everyday choices of Tampere residents.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways– textual and visual elements

Tampere focuses on mapping the most critical impact pathways remaining in the way of reaching the carbon neutrality target in 2030. Figure 3.6 from the Tampere climate budget clearly highlights which sectors are notably falling short of their targets - specifically district heating, traffic and waste management. Urban development is included in impact pathway analysis due to its pivotal role in establishing a sustainable transport system. The emissions development in each sector is further analysed in the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap attached to this Action Plan.

District heating in Tampere is making impressive strides towards its target. The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources and waste CHP is almost done. The limited use of fossil fuels now primarily occurs during peak load times in very cold weather conditions. While local electricity production has decreased because of this transition, it's worth noting that national electricity production has seen substantial growth, particularly in the domains of nuclear and wind power. While local electricity production is a valuable addition to our energy strategy, it's important to note that there are no significant issues with a shortage of clean electricity supply, except during peak load times in extremely cold weather or in the rare event of electricity shortages in neighbouring countries.

As result, the energy system impact pathways are related to utilization of renewable energy sources in heating production, aiding housing companies in enhancing energy efficiency and implementing demand-side management measures within both the energy system and the built environment. Significant progress has already been made in the decarbonization efforts, particularly in improving the energy efficiency of housing company buildings constructed during the 1970s and 1980s. However, the primary focus has now shifted to buildings from the 1990s and the early 2000s, which were constructed before energy efficiency directives were put in place. Implementing demand-side management strategies for both heating and electricity will play a crucial role in reducing reliance on fossil fuel production during peak load times and maintaining stable prices for consumers.

Traffic emissions are key to achieving climate neutrality in Tampere and the most challenging system to change in a short period of time. The climate budget leaves a significant amount of the 2030 residual emissions to traffic due to the current slow development and the challenges in making the change happen. The complete impact pathway of transport system transition is very complex and thus very hard to present in one picture. So, the essential impacts are broken down to two parts. The first part is

included in Table B-1.1 with the possible paths of action and their impacts in the short and long term. The end part and a very essential part of the pathway is presented below in Figure 4.1.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 4.1 Transport system impact pathways part 2. The figure indicates the multiple benefits from reducing the use and number of private cars in the city as opposed to the few benefits from alternative propulsion and technology development.

Both alternative propulsion and reduction of total kilometrage of vehicles are vital to get to the targets and create a sustainable and safe traffic system. However, the alternative propulsion change is happening and being supported on the national level. The charging infrastructure seems to be progressing well on a free-market basis and is included in national regulation. However, the change to sustainable modes is very much up to the city organisation's work and decision making in urban planning, working with companies and citizens to co-create solutions and doing guidance for the new infrastructure and public transport options to be used more. Also, as seen in Figure 4.1 the local benefits to the people and the public sector are multiple when it comes to sustainable transport, whereas the benefits from propulsion change are scant.

Industrial emissions look to be okay, but a lot of the progress towards targets depends on one specific industrial facility. Tampere has not officially co-operated with the facility yet, but electrification of their operation by 2030 is already a part of their corporate responsibility plan. That will create a significant change in the energy demand when their load is likely to transfer from fossil gas to electricity. However, that should work well together with the growing production of wind power, if the electrification is combined with storage capacity.

# 4.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

# B-2.1: Description of action portfolios - textual or visual

Climate action has been taking place in Tampere for a more than a decade already. The latest update of Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap brings together all the climate action in City of Tampere and its subsidiaries. It includes 37 measure packages that contain a total of 305 smaller actions. Each package belongs to a theme and each of the 7 themes have their individual goals and indicators for progress (Figure 4.2). The roadmap was created together with the city's units, subsidiaries and public utilities. The last update to the roadmap was made in 2022, so this Climate City Contract action plan does not repeat the actions in the roadmap itself, which can be found as an annex.

However, many of the actions from the roadmap are covered in the Investment Plan. Module B-1 of the Investment Plan covers actions and their costs that are already largely in the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap. Tables 5 and 6 of the Investment Plan summarise the financial resources planned for these actions. Module B-2 of the Investment Plan includes the capital needed in addition to the planned costs. However, for most actions the capital needs cannot be accurately analysed at this stage.

Instead this action plan focuses on the emissions gap remaining after the roadmap. According to our projections, the roadmap can take us to  $-73\%$  of emissions compared to 1990. So  $7\%$  of the baseline emissions remain to be addressed. Also, so far the roadmap has been focused on what the city organisation can do to reduce emissions. To achieve our goal, we also need to involve city residents, businesses and communities. The action portfolio in this CCC addresses what needs to be done in the future and with which stakeholders to cover the gaps. The actual co-creation will take place during future updates of the roadmap and through development projects. The costs of these additional measures have not yet been estimated and therefore not included in the Investment Plan.

Figure 4.2 collects together the measure packages and themes and their goals in the Roadmap.
Figure 4.2 Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap themes, goals and measure packages updated in 2022.

The detailed analysis of remaining emissions by sector can be found in the annexed Carbon-neutral Tampere Roadmap pp 128-129 and its appendix 1 pp. 142-149. However, there is also a more practical approach to the emissions gap in the roadmap that serves as an action portfolio starting point. The specific emissions from each sector that remain to be addressed are identified in Figure 4.3.

# What steps to take to reduce the remaining 7%?

Emissions from traffic must decrease significantly faster, also including a modal shift to sustainable mobility
Deficit 20-40 kt CO2e
Oil consumption by industry, construction and other work machines (such as maintenance) must be reduced more rapidly
Deficit -17 kt CO2e
Oil heating must end both in residential and in industrial buildings
Deficit 7-10 kt CO2e
Emissions from existing landfills must be investigated more closely and mitigated
Deficit 10-35 kt CO2e
District heat production still needs more solutions to cut emissions
Deficit -8 kt CO2e

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

Tampere has decided to learn more about offsetting residual emissions until 2025 and then build a strategy for creating the market for reliable and permanent carbon removals. The compensation options available currently are not transparent enough.

The local carbon sinks could cover up to 30 % of the needed amount, but according to preliminary studies carbon sink amount varies a lot from year to year. The city owns a small part of forests in Tampere area, but the large part is privately owned and the city does not have means to regulate or guide their use.

Another option that is starting to look viable is local carbon capture. One company in the region produces biochar that can be used for example in green area construction to create carbon storage. Encouraging wood construction does the same. In addition the city has worked together with the power utility on feasibility studies for Carbon capture and use or storage in biomass and waste incineration plants. The future plan is to find viable options for storing carbon and creating synthetic fuels form the captured carbon with the help of renewable energy, biomethanation and hydrogen production.

# The Climate Neutral Tampere 2030 roadmap

The City of Tampere's biggest governmental intervention is the Climate Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap. The Climate and Environmental Policy Unit coordinates the process and monitors the implementation of the measures. The implementation of the roadmap is embedded into the City's strategic management systems as the City units include their climate actions from the roadmap to their annual service and financial plans, which will be officially monitored (Figure 5.1).

Figure 5.1. The City of Tampere's Climate Leadership Model.

# Climate Budget

Tampere's climate budget with the city's budget and financial statements. It is used to monitor the progress towards the climate neutrality target and the adequacy of implemented measures. At the same time, the goal of climate neutrality becomes more concrete in the annual budget. The climate budget provides information for decision-making and increases transparency for residents. Tampere's climate budget consists of two parts: the climate emissions budget, and the financial plan for climate actions.

# Climate Partners

The City of Tampere, Business Tampere and Ekokumppanit Ltd are coordinating the Tampere Region Climate Partnership model. A total of 116 companies, associations and communities are already involved. The Climate Partners themselves define their own organisation's climate change mitigation actions and targets. The Climate Partnership Network has meetings with content that supports companies in their climate work.

# Circular Economy (Advisory Board of Circular Economy)

Besides ambitious climate actions transition to circular economy is highly on the agenda of City of Tampere. Circular Economy has its dedicated Circular Economy Action Plan with four focus areas (the built environment in land use planning and construction, material cycles and waste management as well as the sustainable food system). In the climate neutral roadmap circular economy is included especially in "Sustainable consumption" part.

Promoting circular economy still suffers the lack of data on the consumption of materials, material flows and data on the use of natural resources. It can be foreseen though that the information on both CO2 emissions and on materials flows will be complemented within the coming years, as new legislation will require more detailed information. Through pilot projects and public procurement and their circular economy criteria the city of Tampere can influence the operating environment and the demand for green solutions (which private companies offer). This is also one of the most important interfaces of

cooperation between the private sector (companies) and the City of Tampere, in particular in the construction sector. This is why the City of Tampere has organized the Advisory Board of Circular economy, which brings together different stakeholders.

## School Meals Working Group

The FUSILLI (Fostering the Urban food System Transformation through Innovative Living Labs Implementation) project aims to develop and implement sustainable systemic solutions for food systems in cities and surrounding areas. The main objective is to remove barriers to the development and implementation of integrated, systemic food policies that support the transition towards sustainable food systems in urban, peri-urban and peri-urban rural areas.

As the project progressed, the need for a School Meals Working Group was identified, where different stakeholders could discuss about the issue. The working group will propose measures to promote school meals and food education, for example in school year plans, service contracts and student councils.

## Vulnerability Analysis

The City of Tampere wants to adapt to climate change in the best possible way. In its adaptation work, the city wants to take into account groups that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Therefore, measures to adapt and prepare for climate change will be designed in cooperation with vulnerable groups. Vulnerable groups have been identified as children and young people, the elderly and elderly, people with disabilities, people on low incomes, people with long-term illnesses and mental health problems, migrants and refugees. The results of the vulnerability analysis will be completed by the end of 2023 and will be used, for example, in the update of the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 roadmap.

# The Carbon Neutral Actions Programme

The Carbon Neutral Actions is a strategic development programme of the City of Tampere. The key aim is to support residents in changing their own consumption and mobility habits and ensure fair and equitable transition to a climate resilient society. The guiding principles and tools are co-creation and citizen participation, communication, use of data to support the change and broad collaboration with stakeholders. The goal is to identify and develop approaches that support citizens' own capability and motivation to change their consumption and mobility habits to make them more sustainable.

Development programme operates at city district level and promotes change from a local perspective. Three different city districts have been selected to focus on. Through citizen insight, targeted actions to promote sustainable lifestyles in these areas will be considered. The programme has recognized that people have different motivations to make sustainable choices and it uses different motivational profiles identified through the survey to empower citizens to change their habits.

Besides working with citizens and other local actors, the programme supports actors in city organization to recognize and respond to the need to support citizens in their change. See all programme's stakeholders in Figure 5.3.

# We Make Transition!

We make transition! (2023-2025) is a transnational project co-financed by the EU Interreg Baltic Sea Region Programme. The project has 11 partners from 6 countries and is coordinated by the Baltic Institute of Finland. City of Tampere participates in the project as associated partner being the main beneficiary of the project.

The project aims to strengthen societal resilience and eco-social sustainability by learning, adapting and piloting transition management methodology for engaging civil society and other innovation actors to co-create solutions for sustainability. City of Tampere focuses on finding new ways to foster biodiversity and sustainable lifestyle in urban environment in cooperation with civil society actors, such as NGOs, associations, social entrepreneurs, communities and individuals. Best co-created solutions will be selected and implemented during the project.

# Climate Justice Discussion Forum

The Forum supports the citizen participation in climate action and promotes their empowerment. By providing a forum to discuss climate action and the role of residents, the City of Tampere helps to increase understanding of the need for residents to play an active role and to motivate and support change in private arenas (indirect effects on emissions) to ensure fair and equitable transition to a climate resilient society. The forum will include people from different backgrounds, for example commissions and advisory boards of the citizens (e.g. the youth council, elder people's council, disability council), local NGOs and the University of Tampere.

# The Mobility Carbon Footprint Calculator
1

TAMPERE

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

Carbon footprint calculators help by steering people to change their behaviour. The City of Tampere has developed and published a free carbon footprint calculator for mobility in its city application. The project produces research information on how residents can be encouraged to use sustainable means of mobility. The calculator shows, for example, user's most common Mode of Transport and monthly carbon footprint. Every month you can aim for gold, silver or bronze level.

The city of Tampere receives valuable statistical information and an understanding of where and how the citizens move. In this way, services can be developed to meet the needs of residents. An individual user cannot be identified from the data.

## KELI – Promoting more sustainable mobility with the help of a carbon footprint calculator

The Keli project used a mobility carbon footprint calculator in the Tampere.Finland application to see whether it would be possible to motivate people to choose walking and cycling instead of driving by appealing to the health impacts of physical activity. Messages about the health benefits of everyday physical activity were sent to certain users. The results were compared to a control group of calculator users who were not targeted with health messages. The health content made people use the application more, but no potential changes in mobility habits were found during the test period. Even though the people's mobility didn't change during the project, it gave important information about the issue to the city.

## Tampere Cycles Project (2022)

The project aimed to improve cycling in Tampere opportunities and a visible campaign year for city bikes 2022. This increased the acceptance of cycling in the city. The project included "cycling agents". Every citizen who cycled during the winter was able to apply for the programme. Cycling agents monitored Tampere's cycle paths and reported on the condition of cycle paths, such as snow, slippery roads and icy pavements. As a result, the maintenance of the main cycling routes improved this winter.

## City Blues (Bluegreen nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and citizen wellbeing) Interreg project 2023-2026

In the project integrated nature-based solutions (NBS) are developed for urban flooding and stormwater management. Project involves local residents and stakeholders in planning, implementation, monitoring and maintenance of the selected area in Tampere, near lake lidesjärvi. The goal is to make the living environment for the inhabitants more inclusive, healthy, and attractive and to reduce pollution. The overall project aim is to support adaptation to negative effects of climate change and to improve green and blue infrastructure of densifying cities through integrated nature-based solutions (NBS) for urban flooding and stormwater management.

## 5.3 Module C-3 Financing of Action Portfolio

Module C-3 "Financing of Action Portfolio" should contain the list of action portfolios and interventions outlined in Modules B-2, and those from C-1 and C-2 with cost implication to provide a summary list of interventions that need to be unpacked in the Investment Plan.

# 6 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for further refining the Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract.

## Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration – textual elements

This Climate City Contract describes our current situation. Our current Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap shows a 7% gap between our current measures and achieving our carbon neutrality target. In addition, our current measures need to be accelerated to become a reality. This is a gap identified in the Action Plan and we will seek solutions to this gap in the next roadmap update process together with the whole city organization.

The roadmap's updating process has been planned in parallel with the preparation of the CCC. Updating the roadmap is a highly interactive process and has been designed with a strong focus on customer feedback from the city's units. The Climate and Environment Policy Unit will organize workshops for the roadmap's themes. These workshops will take place by the end of January 2024. After the workshops, each unit will be individually met, and the measures taken by each unit will be discussed at these meetings. Cross-pollination meetings will also be organized between the units.

As a newly identified need, we will also organize financing meetings with the management of the units, the economic unit, the city's finance manager and the project office to discuss the financing of the actions; whether sufficient own-financing is available to implement the actions or whether external funding or loans – be they national or European – must be sought. In this way, we aim to ensure that the measures are implemented and meet the Investment Plan's gaps.

All meetings will be held by mid-March, after which the Climate and Environment Policy Unit will start to compile the roadmap into a single document by the end of May. The roadmap will be finalized by the end of August 2024, and at around the same time data will already be collected for the next climate budget, taking into account the measures negotiated in the roadmap's financial meetings. The roadmap will go through the city's management groups and then to the city's board for approval. The final roadmap will be approved in autumn 2024.

The roadmap work will also involve an input from residents, as the Climate Neutral Actions development programme will organize a workshop in late September 2023 before the start of the roadmap's update process itself within the city. With the upcoming Vulnerability Analysis and also the City of Tampere's award-winning SUMP (Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan), we can learn lessons for the roadmap, on inclusion and equality.

We have also identified specific companies in the city with which a more strategic partnership would be relevant in climate work. These include a factory and large companies with the potential to influence the commuting of large numbers of people. Stakeholder engagement will play a key role in the coming years, and the Mission process will support this work.

Since the completion of the latest roadmap, we have responded to the gaps identified in the Action Plan and the Investment Plan. New rounds of updates both in CCC and roadmap will show more need for re-evaluation and gaps. The CCC will be updated in 2025, and to this point we have gained more business and citizen cooperation to implement the Action Plan in collaboration with the Climate Neutral Actions development programme.

While updating the roadmap and later the CCC, actions will be implemented continuously. The Climate and Environment Policy Unit will monitor this by requesting regular updates to the Climate Watch service. We have identified a need for meetings to jointly review the progress of measures within the themes when the roadmap's updating process is not running. These will be held a few times a year.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Along the way, we will learn and ensure the planned implementation of measures to achieve carbon neutrality in Tampere by 2030. To do this, we need cooperation, into which we will focus on in the coming years. We will also engage more Tampere-based companies as our Mission Partners.

The CCC-process has already shown that we have gaps in our climate work. We need support for these and rethinking of the city's governance approaches. For example, funding issues are a big challenge for us, and this is what we will be working on before the next CCC update to make up for the gaps. The City of Tampere is already engaged in co-development, but this needs to be continuously developed in a way that takes into account all citizens and businesses of different backgrounds.

# 1 Introduction

Explain your city's motivation to join the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" and highlight your city's present commitments to climate action. You may also want to include the aims of this document.

## Your text

The City of Tampere joined the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" because we want to be part of the Mission Cities Initiative. Together, a large group of cities can make a difference in Europe and this can benefit other cities around the world, and we want to be part of the change. EU Mission will help us to make connections, get new perspectives and ideas, and get sparring support from experts. We hope the Climate City Contract process and the Mission Label will help mobilise more funding and finance which is needed to make an impactful change.

Mission label will also bring important recognition for the climate work we are already doing, while sharing our lessons with other cities. The label gives us a mandate around what we do, encouraging all businesses and citizens in the Tampere region to join us in working towards a carbon-neutral Tampere.

Tampere aims to be climate neutral by 2030. This means that Tampere will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent compared to 1990 levels and that the remaining 20 per cent will be compensated for example, by increasing carbon sinks, such as forests and green areas. The climate neutrality goal has been explicitly stated in the city strategies and mayoral programs since 2017.

Tampere has a continuous tradition of sustainability and climate work since first citizen engagement actions in the 1990s. The climate neutrality goal has been explicitly stated in the city strategies and mayoral programs since 2017. A detailed Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 roadmap with 305 tangible actions, as well as emission impact and cost estimate evaluations, has been created through active citizen and stakeholder engagement and cross-sectoral cooperation. The roadmap and its latest update in October 2022 have been approved by the City Board. The plan will be regularly updated and monitored through an open platform, Tampere Climate and Environmental Watch.

The results of the climate work done in Tampere have been significant. To summarize the results, we have achieved a 30 % reduction in absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (reference year is 1990) while the city population has grown from 173 000 to 250 000 or 45 %. Subsequently, the per capita emissions have reduced more than 50 %. Since these figures from 2021, the city energy utility has renewed its largest plant in 2022 which will bring a further 20 percentage points decrease in GHG emissions.

The roadmap contains major actions such as investments in renewable energy and smart solutions in district heating, including carbon capture and storage studies, and saving energy by replacing outdoor lighting with smart LEDs and energy retrofitting of the city's service buildings. The construction of the tramway and the conversion of bus fleet to low emission will enable more sustainable mobility. Our city-owned public utility and service companies are committed to the climate neutrality goal.

People-centred housing, sustainable mobility, smart energy systems, circular economy, and green and blue infrastructure, as well as co-creation with citizens, are at the core of our flagship urban investments, such as the new Hiedanranta city district. We also use data- and AI-driven solutions to develop smarter and more sustainable urban infrastructure and public services.

Our annual climate budget is an important climate governance and transparency tool, which as part of the official financial statements makes visible the progress towards climate neutrality and the financial resources allocated for the measures.

Climate-Neutrality

Commitments

Achieving the above climate vision requires a change in our ways of doing and thinking in all spheres of urban development and urban life, and determination for working together. Citizen empowerment, human-centered actions and co-creation are at the core of our climate policy and all related actions. We are co-creating a climate neutral city and a just and resilient urban future for Tampere together with our citizens,

The development of the CCC and the process it incorporates has already shown that we have gaps in our climate work. We need support for these, and a rethinking of the city's governance approaches. For example, funding issues are a big challenge for us, and this is what we will be working on before the next CCC update to make up for the gaps. The City of Tampere is already engaged in co-development, but this needs to be continuously developed in a way that takes into account all citizens and businesses of different backgrounds.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Articulate your 2030 climate neutrality ambition, as expressed and defined in your Cities Mission Expression of Interest (EoI). This should include your ambition and commitment to a 2030 horizon as a whole city, as well as describe any exclusion areas and summarise how these areas would be addressed beyond 2030. (A more detailed plan for exclusion areas should be included in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.) Your 2030 ambition should be supported at a minimum by a Council decision, and it is recommended that it is also supported by a wider stakeholder group. We also recommend you to list other co-benefits you aim to achieve when working towards the climate neutrality goal, like well-being, health, equity, justice, financial savings.

## Your text

The City of Tampere aims to be carbon neutral by 2030. This means that greenhouse gas emissions in the city area will be reduced by 80% compared to 1990 and the remaining 20% will be offset. Achieving this target will require a reduction in climate emissions, in particular from construction, housing, transport, energy use and consumption. The city's climate measures have been compiled in the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 roadmap, a long-term plan. The implementation of the roadmap measures can be monitored on the Tampere Climate Watch.

Our sector-specific vision for 2030 includes the following:

The city will grow primarily into public transport zones and regional centres, the modal share of sustainable modes of transport will be 69%
New construction will be at zero-energy level, and the carbon footprint of housing small
Renewable energy will amount to 80%
Consumption will be sustainable and the circular economy functioning
Urban nature and structures will bind carbon

According to the roadmap impact analysis, the city's measures will achieve a 73% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It has not yet been possible to assess the impacts of all measures. The most important factors that remain excluded from assessment are the measures whereby we can affect the mobility choices of local residents through instruments such as town planning and transport system development.

Achieving the above climate vision requires a change in our ways of doing and thinking in all spheres of urban development and urban life, and determination for working together. Citizen empowerment, human-centered actions and co-creation are at the core of our climate policy and all related actions. We are co-creating a climate neutral city and a just and resilient urban future for Tampere together with our citizens, communities, universities and companies. The Mission Label will be a big part of the achievement as well.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

# Co-benefits:

By working together to create a carbon-neutral city, we will also increase equality, safety, health, a welcoming and vibrant city, among other co-benefits. Mitigating climate change helps prevent habitat loss, while diverse, thriving nature helps adapt to climate change and acts as a carbon sink. These two should always be promoted simultaneously.

Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions often lead to health benefits. Lower levels of air pollutants improve air quality and reduce respiratory illnesses, and increased use of electric vehicles and public transportation reduce noise pollution, improving the quality of life for residents. Climate-friendly urban planning leads to more walkable cities, better public transportation, and increased green spaces, improving the quality of life for urban residents. Investments in public transportation and active transportation options can reduce traffic congestion and thus improve mobility in cities.

Climate actions are often economically profitable because those often result in cost savings; higher investment costs often pay for themselves quickly. Furthermore, climate actions drive innovation, fostering the development of new technologies and solutions that can have broader applications beyond just mitigating climate change thus boosting local economy. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy can create new job opportunities in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and other green and digital sectors, contributing to employment and economic growth. Investments in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency can reduce the dependency on fossil fuels, enhancing energy security and reducing exposure to energy price fluctuations.

In some cases, it is possible to monetise the economic benefits of the actions. A monetary assessment may increase the acceptability of measures by allowing their multiple benefits to be monetised, for example in a cost-benefit analysis. The City of Tampere's Investment Plan assesses the wider economic impacts of the city achieving its target of sustainable mode share by 2030, separately assessing the economic costs and benefits to the city organisation, citizens, and wider society (see IP Table 7). This has been done because mobility and modal shift have been identified as the key and most difficult elements to achieve the carbon neutrality target. The results also include the monetisation of indirect benefits, such as health benefits.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

This is the core section of the Commitments document that should summarise at least 3 or 4 systemic strategic priorities that need to be implemented for your city to become climate neutral by 2030. These should be meaningful changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in your city, like decarbonising the heating system in the city or generating 100% energy from renewables. The individual commitments between your city and other stakeholders should address these key priorities and contribute to reaching them. The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan should describe the all interventions, including those to reach your priorities as well as all further actions, in detail and describe how your city plans to implement them.

## Your text

Tampere is experiencing a rapid population growth (245 000 inhabitants in 2021 vs. estimated 280 000 in 2040). This means major urban investments during this decade. We want to make sure all our investments and policy interventions contribute to climate neutrality and ecologically resilient urban biodiversity. Our overall vision is to ensure sustainable growth of Tampere without compromising health and well-being equity and urban biodiversity of the city.

Tampere's climate neutrality goal is defined as an 80% reduction from the 1990 emission level while offsetting the remaining 20%. The importance of climate change mitigation has been recognized in the Tampere City Strategy. One of the four focus areas set out in the City of Action Strategy published in 2021 is Carbon Neutral Actions. Among the goals of this focus area is a 60% emission

Commitments

reduction from the 1990 level by the end of this council term (2025). In addition to the strategy, commitment to the climate neutrality goal is part of the Mayor's Programme for 2021–2025. According to the Mayor's Programme, the measures set out in the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap will be implemented.

To pursue the strategy Tampere has established a four-year development programme, called Carbon Neural Actions, which focuses especially on citizens and private sector. The aim of the program is to enable sustainable choices for everyone. The Carbon Neutral Actions is one of the three new development programmes for the Council period and contributes to each of the four priorities of the strategy. The programme is a continuation of the Sustainable Tampere 2030 programme, which was in place during the 2017-2021 council period. The key aim is to support residents in changing their own consumption and mobility habits and ensure fair and equitable transition to a climate resilient society.

The City's climate actions have been gathered into the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap. The roadmap was created together with all the city's service areas, various units, public utilities, and city's companies. The Climate and Environmental Policy Unit coordinates the process and monitors the implementation of the measures. The roadmap currently contains a total of 305 measures under six different themes: 1. sustainable urban planning, 2. sustainable mobility, 3. sustainable energy, 4. sustainable construction, 5. sustainable consumption, and 6. sustainable urban nature. Each measure has at least one team that is responsible for its implementation. The operating model ensures that the entire city organization is committed to the carbon neutrality target.

In addition to the citizens, we have identified specific companies in the city as critical stakeholders necessary to bring about accelerated change. These include a factory and large companies with the potential to influence the commuting of large numbers of people. Stakeholder engagement will play a key role in the coming years, and the Mission process will support this work.

Tampere already has a very strong foundation for its climate work and the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap already contains a comprehensive set of measures and their impacts. The progress of climate work is monitored in the Climate Watch and the Climate Budget. The CCC's Investment Plan summarises the costs of these measures up to 2030. However, the Action Plan has identified systemic strategic priorities that need to be taken into account in addition to those already planned to reach the target:

) Boosting modal shift by co-creating actions with citizens and big employers to promote sustainable transport, and studying the public opinion
) Transforming city logistics move to lighter vehicles and alternative propulsion by guiding
) Promoting industrial electrification by communicating with big fossil fuel users to update projections and plans, implementing Green Deal for zero-emission construction sites and providing oil heating advice to SMEs.
) Providing energy advice and alleviating energy hardship/mitigating energy vulnerability by oil heating advice to private home owners, developing financing models and piloting energy advice to people with potential energy hardship.
) Promoting smart energy systems and systems integration by preparing an energy strategy and an urban development platform.

# 4 Principles and process

Highlight the key principles that will guide your city as it implements its Climate City Contract, like accountability, transparency, or an open attitude to new approaches. The process should encompass principles like co-creation, innovation, multi-actor and citizen engagement, and should be systemic and demand-driven in nature. It should also be based on monitoring and joint learning. The

## Your text

In Tampere, we have understood that achieving climate neutrality by 2030, and ensuring a just and inclusive urban climate transition, requires new ways of engaging citizens and making their sustainable choices as easy as possible. The transition must be socially justified and meaningful to people. By 2030, everyone in Tampere has to able to live a climate resilient lifestyle and make climate friendly choices best suited for oneself, regardless of one's socioeconomic situation, neighbourhood, age, gender or health. This requires strengthening of cultural sustainability of our climate action. It means keeping everyone on board and working seriously towards cohesive and sustainable communities and the social and ecological change.

Tampere aims to be transparent with its climate work. Our roadmap's measures can be followed in our Climate Watch service, where all the measures are listed, and progress is followed. All the citizens can follow Tampere's climate work process.

Tampere has a dedicated team in charge of citizen participation and engagement. Many climate-related citizen engagement activities have been carried out in collaboration with them. Furthermore, in the city strategy 2021-2025, one of the four focus areas is Carbon Neutral Actions. In collaboration with academia, we plan to build an understanding and communicate the benefits and impacts of daily, realistic climate actions and make them more attractive for citizens and businesses. This programme is organizing co-design and co-creation activities, dialogues, campaigns, and courses for citizens including youth. Our ambition is just transition to climate resilient society, where everyone can lead a change toward climate neutral future.

The key aim is to support residents in changing their own consumption and mobility habits and ensure fair and equitable transition to a climate resilient society. The guiding principles and tools are co-creation and citizen participation, communication, use of data to support the change and broad collaboration with stakeholders. The goal is to identify and develop approaches that support citizens' own capability and motivation to change their consumption and mobility habits to make them more sustainable. With the City of Tampere's award-winning **SUMP** (Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan), we can also learn lessons for other plans, such as the roadmap, on inclusion and equality.

The City of Tampere wants to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the best possible way. The city wants to take into account groups that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Therefore, measures to adapt and prepare for climate change will be designed in cooperation with vulnerable groups. Vulnerable groups have been identified as children and young people, the elderly and elderly, people with disabilities, people on low incomes, people with long-term illnesses and mental health problems, migrants and refugees. The results of the vulnerability analysis will be completed by the end of 2023 and will be used, for example, in the update of the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 roadmap.

The City of Tampere is also launching Climate Justice Discussion Forum in the fall 2023. This discussion forum is bringing together residents and other stakeholders to be set up to support the Carbon Neutral Actions development programme, with the aim of ensuring that the programme's interventions are fair and take account of the different opportunities for different types of people in Tampere to take carbon neutral actions.

Besides citizen work, Climate Neutral Actions programme's aim is to support companies in climate and environmentally sustainable business and help them find new business opportunities through circular economy and carbon neutrality.

One of the many forms of business collaborations is the **Tampere Region Climate Partnership** which has systematically involved companies, associations, and communities in pursuing a carbon-neutral Tampere since 2020. Currently, 116 organizations have joined the CP. The climate partners define their own organization's climate actions and goals related to climate change mitigation and

they focus on e.g. energy savings, energy efficiency, environmental friendliness in procurement, waste management or staff engagement. The climate partners receive information on climate issues, get support, gain visibility, with opportunities to present their own activities and attracting new customers climate resilient life regardless of the neighborhood they are living in or their life situation.

During the CCC process we have identified specific needs for closing our current gap. We will find solutions to this during our next Climate Neutral Tampere 2030 roadmap's updating process, which starts in the autumn of 2023 and will be ready in the autumn 2024. During the process, we will have dialogues and workshops within the whole city organization and subsidiaries. We have also identified the importance of companies in the city with which a more strategic partnership would be relevant in climate work. These include for example a factory and large companies with the potential to influence the commuting of large numbers of people. Stakeholder engagement will play a key role in the coming years, and Mission work will support this work. We will also deepen our cooperation and co-creation processes with academia and citizens during the next two years. By the next CCC update we will have more signatories in our commitment plan and together with our stakeholders we will achieve the climate neutrality target.

## Short introduction of Tampere University

Tampere University is one of the most multidisciplinary universities in Finland. We bring together research and education in technology, health and society. The University is known for its excellence in teaching and research, and it collaborates with hundreds of universities and organisations worldwide. Our community consists of 21,000 students and over 4,000 staff members from more than 80 countries.

Almost all internationally recognized fields of study are represented in our university, which has seven faculties:

Faculty of Built Environment
Faculty of Education and Culture
Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences
Faculty of Information Technology and Communication Sciences
Faculty of Management and Business
Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology
Faculty of Social Sciences

Tampere University has integrated sustainability as an elemental part of its strategy: We work together to build a sustainable world. This statement includes the principle of developing sustainable solutions through research and provide high-impact education for the benefit of the society.

**Name of the organization:** Tampere University

**Operations related to climate action:** Tampere University is committed to the common goal of the Ministry of Education and Culture administrative branch in achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. Tampere University has calculated its carbon footprint annually since 2019. In 2022 the carbon footprint of the university was 15 000 t CO₂ekv - which is 40 % less than in 2019. Reduction is partly result of the Covid-19 pandemic and its multiplier effects and thus can be considered temporary, but also active measures have been taken to reduce the footprint, especially in the maintenance of the properties. Furthermore, the calculation model has changed during this time and more categories of carbon sources have been included in the calculation.

Tampere University has many research groups actively doing research in the key strategic priority areas, as defined in Table 1 of this document. Furthermore, our university is active in advancing higher

education in climate issues, through its own bachelor and master's programmes (e.g., Bachelor's Degree Programme in Sustainable Urban Development) and also though national and international initiatives, such as the Climate University initiative where Tampere University contributes¹.

Existing collaboration with the City of Tampere and expectations for future collaboration related to climate action:

Partnership agreement between the City of Tampere, Tampere University and Tampere University of Applied Sciences. The City of Tampere, Tampere University, and Tampere University of Applied Sciences have agreed on a partnership that aims at:
Deepening the existing cooperation between the parties
Developing the effectiveness of research cooperation in the development of the city and its services
Responding to the common challenges of the operating environment.
Promoting the region's competitiveness, attractiveness and recognition.
Promoting the region's attractiveness as a student town
Promoting the effectiveness of international cooperation and the attraction of experts.
Enhancing the implementation of jointly identified advocacy goals nationally and internationally.
Strengthening the prerequisites for data-based decision-making
One of the focus areas for the Universities' cooperation in research, innovation and education is called "sustainable city as a trailblazer". This supports research, innovation and educational collaboration in sustainability themes, including climate action.

Tampere Region Climate Partnership. Tampere University has joined the Tampere Region Climate Partnership (Climate partner - Tampereen seudun ilmastokumppanuus). The goal of this partnership model is to involve companies and communities in the region in pursuing a carbon-neutral Tampere in cooperation with the Sustainable Tampere 2030 program. Tampere University reports annually about the measures to reduce carbon footprint.

STUE research community and profiling area. Tampere University has a multidisciplinary research community and profiling area called Sustainable Transformation of Urban Environments (STUE). The aim of STUE is to create and promote research-based solutions that transform cities into safe, resilient, and sustainable living environments for people of all ages, ethnicities, and capabilities. STUE supports multidisciplinary research and fosters opportunities for collaboration between researchers and the public sector, civil society, communities, and businesses. STUE researchers and the city of Tampere have several collaborations.

ECIU collaboration with European Mission cities. Tampere University is a member of the ECIU (European Consortium of Innovative Universities).

# PREFACE

## Tampere bears responsibility for a sustainable future.

We engage in effective work on climate and biodiversity and want to be internationally known for these efforts.

We believe that, by providing the city residents with a smooth everyday life that helps them make sustainable choices, our appeal will grow even stronger in the future. We look to the future with confidence, as we know that we can achieve change. We strive for a just transition to a climate-friendly society.

## Brexit, a global pandemic, Russia's war of aggression in Europe.

The events unfolding in the past few years have reminded us that our world can be turned upside down in the blink of an eye. The importance of being able to act together both locally and at the international level has also been proven. Additionally, the climate crisis and loss of biodiversity are simultaneously calling for both local and global solutions.

Every now and then, global political events and decisions seemingly take the form of something that occurs 'somewhere in the world'. This is, naturally, not the case. What is also clear is that climate change does not respect borders, although its effects are not distributed evenly.

By way of example, let us consider just some of the broader effects of our actions: by giving up oil heating in the buildings owned by the city (measure 4.4.2.), we reduce the use of fossil fuels – we have already given up using Russian fossil fuels; or as we have stepped up the use of Fairtrade products (for example, measures 5.4.7. and 5.6.11.), we have improved the everyday life and environment of foreign farmers.

## Cities are assuming growing importance globally.

And they represent the largest share of climate emissions and of the consumption of natural resources – the challenges are similar across the globe.

Tampere has always been known as a city where things get done. Here, words translate into deeds. The ability and confidence to act are natural features of the spirit of Tampere. Together we face all crises, and together we overcome them. We are prepared, and we adapt.

For us, the climate emergency implies action. Therefore, Tampere is in an advantageous position to serve as a climate pioneer, a developer of biodiversity and a circular economy trailblazer.

The budding role of pioneer is visible already: we joined the European Union's climate initiative for the first time in 2009. This climate initiative became global in 2016, and the following year Tampere signed the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy follow-up commitment. 2019 saw us publish a climate budget as the first city in Finland to do so, and in 2020 the Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap made it to the final of the World Smart City Awards. This spring, Tampere was elected as one of the top hundred European cities striving for climate neutrality.

## The green transition introduces changes and opens up opportunities.

One of the instruments whereby we are promoting a fair and just transition for residents and businesses towards a sustainable future is the Carbon-neutral Action development programme. As well as fostering biodiversity and the circular economy, this programme aims to achieve significant reductions in emissions from mobility and consumption.

Together, let us create a sustainable and boldly future-oriented Tampere.

Anna-Kaisa Ikonen
Mayor of Tampere
# INTRODUCTION

You are holding in your hand the first update to the Climate Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap. This update, just like the original version from 2020, was drafted in cooperation between the various city units and subsidiaries. The Climate and Environmental Policy Unit was responsible for the drafting process. The purpose of the roadmap is to describe the city's path to achieving climate neutrality by 2030. In this update, the 236 measures set out in the original roadmap have been updated while adding a number of new measures. The new measures also feature climate actions by an increasing number of subsidiaries and public utilities. The wide range of actions taken by city residents, businesses and communities, or by the state and other public bodies, are not described in this roadmap.

We present the measures under six themes, familiar from the original roadmap: urban planning, mobility, construction, energy, consumption, and nature. These themes derive from the City of Tampere's environmental policy, the Sustainable Tampere 2030 Guidelines. Additionally, this update adds to the roadmap a theme that traverses all six themes: coordination and monitoring of the city's climate efforts. The perspective employed in the original roadmap restricted itself to climate change mitigation, but this update also introduces climate change adaptation measures. The same decisive consideration remains, namely that these measures must not undermine the other - ecological, social, economic and cultural - dimensions of sustainable development. Several measures therefore contribute to many sustainable development goals.

In this roadmap, the themes are represented by different colours. The beginning of each theme presents a summary of the measures relating to that theme, together with the goals and the indicators used to monitor the achievement of the associated goals. Additionally, we also provide a snapshot of where we are at the moment. There are several sets of measures, or measure packages, under each theme: 37 in total. They cover the main sources of emissions that the city can influence. Phenomenon-based, the roadmap does not follow the administrative structure of the city. Therefore, several bodies may be responsible for a given measure. Climate change mitigation and adaptation require extensive cooperation both within the city and with stakeholders.

It is advisable to read the roadmap one full spread at a time. The left-hand side of a spread shows a card that illustrates the measure package, numbering the related measures and containing the applicable timetable and responsible parties as well as an indication of whether the measure promotes climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation. All timetables are presented by council term. The cards also show the more than 40 measures that have already been completed. This update elaborates the estimates that describe the cost level of the measures by providing a specific estimate for every measure. Similarly to the original Roadmap, the bottom section of the card displays an estimate of the emission reduction potential of the measure package concerned, as well as listing the benefits other than climate benefits associated with the measures. The cost and emission reduction potential estimates are represented by bullet symbols.

After an action card, the measure content is illustrated by providing case examples. In the updated version, the more precise emission and cost effects are brought together at the end of the roadmap, in section 5. The focus in the cost analyses is on the measures' direct costs that affect the city's finances, both in terms of investments and the operational economy. All cost estimates are based on data obtained from the units, public utilities and subsidiaries that are part of the city organisation. Often, measures set out in the roadmap are also taken largely for non-climate related reasons, which should be borne in mind when examining the figures.

Additionally, for some measures, we calculate a cost-effectiveness figure, representing their economy. Cost-effectiveness denotes how much the emission reduction that a measure yields will cost per reduced emission reduction unit. The lower the cost-effectiveness, the more viable the measure is economically.

According to the roadmap impact analysis, the city's measures will achieve a 73% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It has not yet been possible to assess the impacts of all measures. The most important factors that remain excluded from assessment are the measures whereby we can affect the mobility choices of local residents through instruments such as town planning and transport system development.

The 80 per cent reduction required for climate neutrality is a challenging goal, and it necessitates ambitious and long-term climate work on the part of the city. In cooperation with businesses, communities and local residents, however, we can achieve it. The roadmap, and the roadmap impact assessment, will also be updated in future as information becomes available on the impacts the measures have and on new practices and solutions.

"The roadmap describes the city's steps to achieving climate neutrality by 2030."

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Image 2. It should be borne in mind that many measures set out in the roadmap are also often taken for reasons that are not purely climate-related. The other benefits include a more comfortable, healthier and safer environment, the commercial opportunities brought about by technologies, the economic sustainability made possible by life-cycle thinking, and increased biodiversity.

CLIMATE NEUTRAL TAMPERE 2030

CLIMATE NEUTRAL TAMPERE 2030
# SECTION 1. TAMPERE'S CLIMATE GOALS

## Why do we have global warming?

Global warming, or the growing greenhouse effect, is one of the biggest global crises. It is caused by an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, which, like a greenhouse, heats the earth. Since the late 19th century, the rise in CO2 levels has accelerated as a result of increased use of fossil energy. The global average temperature has risen about one degree compared to pre-industrial times and in various scenarios is projected to rise some 2-5 degrees by the end of the century.

Global warming has a major impact both on societies and on the natural environment. In Finland, vegetation zones are retreating towards the north and flood risks and the operating conditions of forestry and agriculture are changing. Finland will experience significant effects through the global economy and through international politics. On the other hand, Finland can also stand to benefit if it succeeds in developing and exporting technology that mitigates climate change.

It is too late to halt climate change, but mitigating it is still possible. The objective of the 2015 Paris

Agreement is to limit the global average temperature increase to well below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels and to pursue measures to limit global warming to less than 1.5°C. The EU and Finland are also committed to this objective. However, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in April 2022 noted that emission reduction measures must be accelerated in order to achieve the objective.

The abandonment of fossil fuels, introduction of renewable energies, energy savings, and improvements in energy efficiency are important instruments to curb rising temperatures. The focus is also on reducing emissions from transport through a shift to alternative propulsion systems and through increasing the use of sustainable mobility modes by reinforcing the conditions for walking and cycling and by improving the public transport service level. In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the management of the carbon storage in forests and in green infrastructure, and expansion of the carbon sinks, are important means to mitigate global warming.

## Climate change adaptation needed today

Apart from climate emission mitigation, it is vital to find ways to adapt to the changing environmental conditions brought about by climate change. Climate change adaptation means the ways and means to reduce the adverse effects that climate change has on society and on the environment. Climate change will bring about – and has already brought about – changes in how weather extremes, such as storms and heavy rains, occur as well as in related environmental conditions. In Tampere, too, this is apparent as increasingly slippery conditions in winter and hot weather conditions becoming more common in summer.

Adaptation measures strive to reduce the harm caused by these changes while promoting the capability of people, social activities and the environment to function under changed and evolving conditions. These adaptation measures include the construction of urban run-off reservoirs that prevent flooding following increased heavy rains, as well as the development of the city's risk management process and improving city residents' preparedness.

Adapting to evolving conditions is absolutely necessary despite successful mitigation measures. The later we launch the adaptation measures, the more costly this will be in economic and human terms. The climate change adaptation goals include anticipating and managing weather risks and climate risks, safeguarding the security of supply, ensuring the sustainable competitiveness of society and businesses, and boosting social resilience. The ways in which we adapt to climate change may have to do with the physical characteristics of the urban structure, including (municipal) infrastructure, buildings, ecology and living environments, or with society's social characteristics and economy, such as resources, capabilities, approaches, and non-life insurance.

## Cities playing a major role

Cities play a key role in mitigating and also in adapting to climate change, as people increasingly live in cities and, as a result, the majority of consumption and energy use takes place in cities. Cities can lead the way towards climate-friendly solutions and they can enable sustainable ways of living, energy use,

mobility and consumption.

Internationally known for the climate work it has carried out, the City of Tampere is a pioneer. Tampere joined the EU Covenant of Mayors in 2009 and, in 2017, the renewed Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. Today, it is the world's most significant climate covenant, covering thousands of cities in an effort to boost local climate and energy measures. In spring 2022 Tampere was invited to join a network of one hundred European cities seeking to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, EU Missions: Climate-neutral and smart cities. This mission is one of the approaches promoted by the European Commission aiming to provide practical solutions to the most difficult common challenges.

Tampere's climate neutrality goal is defined as an 80% reduction from the 1990 emission level while offsetting the remaining 20%. One of the four focus areas set out in the City of Action strategy published in 2021 is Carbon-neutral Action. Among the goals of this focus area is a 60% emission reduction from the 1990 level by the end of this council term (2025). In addition to the strategy, commitment to the climate neutrality goal is part of the Mayor's Programme for 2021-2025. According to the Mayor's Programme, the measures set out in the Tampere Climate Roadmap will be implemented.

## Climate change in the city's financial processes

The City of Tampere employs a diverse range of methods to promote and monitor the progress of the climate work it carries out. In the city budget for 2020, Tampere introduced a climate budget element. The climate budget contains a breakdown of the city-level annual maximum emissions (the emissions budget) and the resources allocated by the City Group to the climate measures (the financial plan for climate measures). The figures are published on an annual basis in the budget, with the financial statements reporting the actual realised numbers. The climate budget helps the city in its efforts to transparently highlight the progress it makes towards the climate neutrality goal and to assess whether the actions taken by the city are adequate to attain that goal. In the 2021 financial statements, the City of Tampere's reported climate budget operating expenditure totalled some 0.2 per cent of the city's total operating expenditure while

CLIMATE NEUTRAL TAMPERE 2030

CLIMATE NEUTRAL TAMPERE 2030
climate investments accounted for approximately 4 per cent of the city's total investments.

The information contained in the Climate Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap is more detailed than the information in the climate budget. Rather than basic activity, it focuses more on policy recommendations and contains a greater number of measures than the climate budget. The climate budget only details the activities for which it is possible and meaningful to detail EUR amounts already in the budget phase and for which it is possible to monitor implementation.

Additionally, the environmental financial statements, compiled annually, reports the sums spent on climate change mitigation and adaptation and on the promotion of sustainable mobility. However, more comprehensively than the climate budget, the environmental financial statements reports all sums referring to environmental protection, not merely those that refer to climate protection. Moreover, the environmental financial statements provide more precise data, as it also reports the sums not detailed in the budget.

## Striving for a climate-neutral Tampere

On 18 June 2018, the City Council approved the Sustainable Tampere 2030 - Towards a Carbon-neutral City Guidelines, which link environmental policy, sustainable development and the climate neutrality goal set out in the Tampere Strategy while making policy on package implementation and monitoring.

The Sustainable Tampere Guidelines cover the themes that are key for climate emissions: mobility and urban structure, housing and construction, energy, consumption, and urban nature. Furthermore, in line with sustainable development, the goal is to achieve environmental status that is good in other respects too.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Image 5. Sustainable Tampere 2030 Guidelines

## The Guidelines set a target state for each theme:

Sustainable mobility and urban structure: Tampere will be a pioneer in sustainable urban planning, mobility and working methods. The city will be prepared for risks resulting from climate change. The living environment will be safe, healthy and comfortable.

Sustainable housing and construction: Residential areas will be attractive and unique, and they will promote sustainable lifestyles and participation. Easy access to nature will promote the well-being of residents. With construction activities, we will create conditions for safe, healthy and comfortable living.

Sustainable production and consumption of energy: Energy sources will be low in emissions. Energy will be utilised efficiently as smart heating, cooling and electricity networks, energy storages and smart buildings will work in conjunction with each other. In addition, smart solutions and energy services will decrease electricity and heating consumption peaks.

Sustainable consumption and materials economy: The principles of circular economy will direct the use of materials. The city will support sustainable consumption solutions for its residents.

Sustainable urban nature: Natural resources will be used sustainably, and carbon sinks will be strengthened. Biodiversity and the amount of green urban areas will be increased, and nature tourism further developed.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
Image 6. The City of Tampere's climate vision: greenhouse gas emissions will decrease by 80% by 2030 compared to 1990.

Good state of the environment: The full life-cycle environmental impacts of the operations will be identified and managed throughout the entire city organisation. The state of the environment will be constantly monitored and improved. The monitoring data will be publicly available and available to be used in decision-making.

The Climate Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap is based on the Sustainable Tampere 2030 Guidelines. However, the Roadmap specifically focuses on climate action. That is why the structure of the Roadmap differs slightly from the Guidelines: Sustainable mobility and urban structure divide into two themes, sustainable urban planning and sustainable mobility. The 'Good state of the environment' theme is excluded from the Roadmap, because it mainly concerns areas of environmental policy other than climate policy. A good state of the environment will be promoted through, among other measures, the separate Tampere Biodiversity Programme (LUMO) 2021-2030. A theme that cross-cuts all six themes, coordination and monitoring of the city's climate efforts, was added to the Roadmap.

The Sustainable Tampere 2030 Guidelines and this Roadmap implement the Sustainable Development Goals set out in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the City of Tampere is also committed to these Goals. While the measures set out in the Roadmap specifically address Sustainable Development Goals 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 17, the starting point is that climate goals are pursued through integrated sustainable development, and climate action must not undermine the other Sustainable Development Goals. Similarly to the original Roadmap, the updated version will also be translated into English.

# SECTION 2. ROADMAP UPDATE

The Climate and Environmental Policy Unit, operating under the auspices of the Sustainable City group part of Urban Environment Services, was responsible for updating the Climate Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap. The unit is tasked with monitoring and promoting the city's climate neutrality goal as well as with coordinating the climate efforts made in many quarters.

The roadmap was updated so that the groups and units of each service submitted their own proposals on how to update the existing roadmap measures and on adding new measures. Apart from the climate change mitigation measures, the updated edition also contains climate change adaptation and preparedness measures. This process was carried out during the winter and spring of 2022. On the basis of the proposals submitted, the Climate and Environmental Policy Unit updated this roadmap that covers the entire city. The city companies prepared their own climate neutrality roadmaps in 2020 and 2021. Some of the measures in them were added to the roadmap in the context of this update.

The measures set out in the Roadmap aim to reduce Tampere's climate emissions by at least 80% by 2030. The remaining 20% is intended to be tied to the carbon sinks available in the Tampere region or to be offset by other means. A plan to achieve this will be drawn up after 2025, when the impact of the emission reduction measures and the functioning of the offsetting schemes can be examined.

All emission reductions are calculated using a method commonly used by municipalities that is internationally comparable (in 2022, CO2 report). The calculations cover the global-warming emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) generated within the city of Tampere. Greenhouse gas emissions were aggregated to carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). Indirect emissions arising from sources such as the manufacture of goods and materials elsewhere and from their import into Tampere, or from Tampere city residents' travel outside the city, are not included in the calculations. However, the measures set out in the roadmap also aim to reduce these emissions.

When the implementation of the roadmap measures falls due, the city units will include measures from the final roadmap in the services' annual plans and in the work programmes of the units. For the measures included in these annual plans, reporting takes place three times a year in the context of strategy reporting. For all measures, the units update their data pertaining to the progress made directly in the Tampere Climate Watch service. The roadmap is a policy outline and a plan for the city's measures to achieve the climate neutrality goal. The measures will be decided upon separately at the relevant bodies in accordance with the city's normal decision-making system.

Supplementing the emission reduction estimates, the roadmap also shows for every measure the rough cost estimates of their implementation (bullet symbols at each measure) as well as, where possible, the more detailed EUR investment (in section 5). It should be noted that these cost estimates only illustrate on a rough level the magnitude of the investments made in the measures. Therefore, they do not address issues such as the type of the cost savings or other benefits that the measures will generate. Regarding the measures already completed and those under Social Services and Health Care (to be transferred to the wellbeing services county), no rough costs estimates were prepared. By way of illustration, more detailed economy calculations and cost-effectiveness calculations, discussed in section 5, were performed in respect of some measures. These calculations illustrate the profitability of the measures with due consideration of the measure life cycle and the cost savings generated during it, as well as assessing for each measure the price of the emission reductions resulting from the measures.

Often the measures set out in the roadmap also have non-climate related benefits, such as a more comfortable, healthier and safer environment, the commercial opportunities brought about by technologies, the economic sustainability made possible by life-cycle thinking, and increased biodiversity. By way of example, the action cards display some of these.

# SECTION 3. WHERE WE ARE NOW

## EMISSION DEVELOPMENT

Tampere's greenhouse gas emissions increased until 2010, but they have been decreasing since then, albeit the decline has slowed down in recent years. In 2020, total emissions were about 33% lower than in 1990, the baseline year. Emissions per capita showed a more clear decrease, for in 2020 they were some 52% lower than in 1990.

When interpreting the 2020 emissions, however, consideration should be given to the changes that took place in people's behaviour owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be assumed that these changes will not be of a permanent nature, at least not to the same extent.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Image 9. Development of carbon dioxide emissions in Tampere in 1990–2020, including emissions from industry. Source: 2022 CO2 report.

The main sources of emissions in Tampere are district heating, road traffic, industry and work machinery. Additionally, electricity consumption by consumers, individual heating, and waste management are also major sources of emissions. Agriculture, on the other hand, plays only a minor role in Tampere.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

The need for emission reductions in different sectors in order to achieve an 80% reduction of total emissions is rather high. The table in Figure 11 shows the greenhouse gas emissions realised in Tampere for 2020 and for each sector the annual change required to achieve the goal. The expert judgement as to whether a sector is able to keep within the emissions budget is based on the relevant change need, the roadmap emission projection, and the known measures. Finally, the table displays the sector-specific percentage change needed in 2020–2030. In the table, the emissions conform to the calculation employed in the CO2 report, except that the 'Consumer electricity consumption' item used in the CO2 report was rephrased in the table as 'Other electricity consumption' while 'Heating power' includes 'Geothermal'.

CLIMATE NEUTRAL TAMPERE 2030

The situation in recent years, where the decline in emissions has slowed down, is partly explained by the fact that Tampereen Sähkölaitos has had a break from major investments in renewable energy. When the new unit of the Naistenlahti Power Plant, Naistenlahti 3, is launched at the end of 2022, emissions from district heating will experience a significant drop. Additionally, Tampereen Sähkölaitos is planning other investments in green district heat for the 2020s, including various non-combustion solutions.

Reducing emissions from individual heating and from heating electricity requires that detached houses and other individual buildings switch to renewable energy sources. This change is already taking place thanks to the increased popularity of heat pumps, among other reasons. In order to achieve the demanding goal set, the roadmap focuses on the provision of energy guidance to private property owners.

With regard to transport, achievement of the emission reduction goal is most challenging, as the population of Tampere is growing and the changes in mobility patterns are slow to take root. In addition, decisions on mobility modes are not in the hands of the city alone but require cooperation from both the state and individual citizens. The city can and strives to improve the conditions that make it easier to choose sustainable mobility modes. Therefore, in the roadmap, the measures for sustainable mobility modes make up the largest single package.

Other electricity consumption can be reduced by improving the energy efficiency of electricity use and by increasing demand response. This is also largely in the hands of the city residents, but the city can promote it in its own activities and by enhancing energy counselling. The factor with the greatest impact on emissions from electricity is the national development of electricity production.

Reducing emissions from industry and work machines requires an active approach by businesses. In order to accelerate climate action by businesses, the City of Tampere is coordinating the Tampere Region Climate Partnership activities to commit businesses and communities to a common climate neutrality goal through measures that suit each of them individually.

Efforts are being made to reduce emissions from waste management by improving waste prevention, waste sorting and circular economy solutions. However, a high percentage of all emissions is generated by methane emissions from old landfills. Emissions from agriculture and forestry are low in Tampere, but forests play an important role as carbon sinks, and the measures in the roadmap aim to strengthen this together with the vitality of urban nature.

# Tampere's carbon footprint

So far, the climate work carried out by Tampere has been focusing on emissions occurring in the geographic area of City of Tampere. Emissions from Tampere's and the city residents' consumption are studied increasingly, and a significant share of these emissions is generated outside the city borders. In 2021, together with 14 other municipalities, Tampere participated in the Kulma project, which calculated for each municipality the life-cycle emissions of energy consumption and construction, mobility, food and goods as well as products and services. As a result, it was shown that in 2020 emissions from Tampere's consumption totalled 8.1 t CO2e per resident, which is more than twice the emissions generated in the Tampere region. In future, emissions from consumption will be calculated on a regular basis in order to be able to monitor their development. A new development programme to be launched in 2022, Carbon-neutral Action strives to influence the emissions from city residents' consumption and mobility.

Additionally, in 2021 a rough model for calculating the annual emissions from construction was devised for Tampere, as well as carrying out the calculation for the year 2020. The results put the 2020 carbon footprint for construction at 206,000 t CO2e. Therefore, the carbon footprint for construction is of the same order of magnitude as the biggest sources of geographic emissions: transport and district heating. The majority of the emissions, 104,200 t CO2e, came from the use of concrete in buildings. Site operations generated 39,500 t CO2e, the majority of which derived from the use of light fuel oil. The construction of traffic networks resulted in 11,400 and civil engineering in 2,000 t CO2e of emissions.

# CLIMATE NEUTRAL TAMPERE 2030 ROADMAP, RESULTS FOR 2020-2022

Everyone can follow the progress of the measures set out in the Climate Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap free of charge in a dedicated online service, the Tampere Climate Watch. The original roadmap approved by the City Board in August 2020 contained 236 measures in total. During the first two years, 18% of these (43 measures) were completed. The completed measures are also shown in this updated version of the roadmap. As for the remaining measures, nearly 50% of the

measures are currently being implemented and more than one quarter are in the planning phase. 5% of the measures have not been started yet. Of all measures, it was reported that 72% are on track. The measures are scheduled by council term. It is estimated that 158 measures will be completed in the course of the current council term. Following the roadmap update, the number of measures increases to 305.

# SECTION 4. ROADMAP

The Climate Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap is based on the themes set out in the Sustainable Tampere Guidelines and on the benefit goals derived from them. The 'Good state of the environment' theme is excluded from this roadmap, because it features sectors of environmental protection other than climate change mitigation. The first theme in the Guidelines, mobility and urban structure, divides into two parts: sustainable urban planning, and sustainable mobility. The roadmap update also added a theme that cross-cuts all earlier themes: coordination and monitoring of the city's climate efforts.

The seven benefit goals are implemented under 37 measure packages, containing a total of 305 measures.

# ORGANISING ROADMAP IMPLEMENTATION

The City Board approves the roadmap and on an annual basis monitors the implementation of the measures as part of reporting for the Carbon-neutral Action development programme. The roadmap action cards and emission calculation is updated as part of the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) every two years.
Measures to be taken in the city organisation to promote climate change mitigation and adaptation, their emission reduction estimate and the financial resources budgeted for implementation (so-called climate budget) are included from the roadmap in the city's budget annually.
The annual targets and measures are included from the roadmap in the Services' annual plans. The services and their groups update their own measures in cooperation with the Climate and Environmental Policy Unit and are responsible for the inclusion of measures from the roadmap in their service plans and annual plans.
The Sustainable City Group is responsible for monitoring, reporting and updating the roadmap for the entire city.
The roadmap is published as an open digital platform at ilmastovahti.tampere.fi. The city's partners can provide information on their climate actions at the ilmastokumppanuus.fi website.

|  Benefit goal: | Tampere will be climate neutral in 2030.
Tampere will take climate risks and change adaptation seriously.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Description: | Global warming is a crisis that affects people all around the world. Cities represent some 80 per cent of all consumption of energy and natural resources. In their everyday work, cities continuously make decisions that can either decrease or increase emissions.

Tampere is striving to be climate-neutral by 2030. This means that the greenhouse gas emissions within the area of the city will be reduced by 80 per cent as compared to 1990 while offsetting the remaining 20 per cent.

Climate change mitigation, as well as preparing for and adapting to the effects of climate change, call for a major cultural change. In order to achieve the goals, we need cooperation between residents, businesses, associations and communities.

The City of Tampere's climate measures are collected in this Climate Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap. It is for the city to strive to mitigate global warming and to protect residents and society from the adverse effects of climate change. The city wants to make a climate-friendly lifestyle possible for every Tampere resident.

Tampere's climate budget links the climate efforts to the city budget and financial statements. It is used to monitor the progress of the climate neutrality goal and whether the climate actions are adequate. Meanwhile, the climate neutrality goal takes concrete shape at the annual level. The climate budget produces data for decision-making purposes while providing increased transparency for the city residents.

The Tampere climate budget is composed of two parts:
the emissions budget; and
the financial plan for climate measures.  |
|  Goal 2030: | Climate emissions will have reduced by 80% as compared to 1990, and the remaining 20% will have been offset. The key climate risks will have been identified and action taken to mitigate them. Climate risk management will have been integrated into the city's risk management and preparedness process.  |

## SUSTAINABLE URBAN PLANNING

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

|  Benefit goal: | The city will grow primarily into public transport zones and regional centres  |
| --- | --- |
|  Description: | Tampere is experiencing an annual growth of approximately 3,000 residents. The aim is to enable sustainable growth while preserving the quality and functionality of the urban environment. Town planning will be focused on the city centre, the regional centres and the key public transport zones. Assessment of the climate effects from infrastructure is increasingly central to land-use planning. Tampere aims to create the economic conditions for an efficient service structure, energy system and public transport system, to reduce the need to own or use a car, to reduce emissions from mobility, to support walking and cycling on everyday journeys, and to conserve nature and natural resources. Land-use planning takes account of the conservation of biodiversity and adequate green belts. The growth which the city is experiencing creates increasing pressure to use forests and nature areas, and therefore it is absolutely necessary to carefully consider expanding any construction areas to green belts. Value-based information and indicators derived from ecosystem services will be used as part of the assessment of the content and effects of land-use planning.  |
|  Goal 2030: | • Residential floor area planned for the public transport zones and for the regional centres: 80% (2021), 85% (2025), 90% (2030). • Tampere city centre will have 15,000 new residents and 15,000 more new jobs in 2030 compared to 2015. • The urban structure will be mixed in the city centres as well as around the major tramway stops and public transport transfer terminals. • The urban structure will support walking, cycling and the use of public transport on everyday journeys. • Residents will be satisfied with the comfort and usability of the urban environment.  |
|  Indicators: | • Planned residential floor area in the public transport zones and in the regional centres (%) • Share of households (%) with a 300m or 700m distance to the key public services • Share of recreational areas of the total inner-city town planning area (%)  |

### Climate impact assessment of the inner-city master plan (council term 2017–2021)

In the context of updating the inner-city master plan, a climate impact assessment was carried out regarding the emission impact of land use changes, and a climate impact calculation tool was developed based on the Finnish Monitoring System of Spatial Structure (YKR). With regard to the urban structure, the main emission sectors are the energy use of buildings and passenger transport.

A key driver in emission development is the reduction of the specific emissions from district heat following the transition to lower emission energy production. As for construction, the most important factor is the energy efficient renovation of the old building stock, because new construction is rather energy efficient. Emissions from new construction can be affected, for example, through the choice of materials. The drive underlying the master plan guides towards structural reform, especially in evolving and mixed-function city-centre areas, where rising land values create room for housing companies to manoeuvre with their renovation and infill construction projects and thus also with energy efficiency improvement measures.

Growth that is based on sustainable mobility is made possible in the master plan particularly in the areas of the city-centre functions and in the Sustainable Growth Zone made up of hubs and public transport corridors, where a mixed structure and an efficient public transport system will in the best case scenario enable a smooth everyday life without owning a car.

The impact of the urban structure on emissions is reflected in the Tampere inner-city master plan's climate review, which divides the city into grids of 250 square metres. In the city centre, the regional centres and the intensive public transport zone, the biggest source of emissions is the heating of facilities, while in the car zone traffic is the biggest source.

### Carbon-negative Hiedanranta

Tampere has a vision to build Hiedanranta into a neighbourhood of 25,000 inhabitants that "produces more than it consumes". Within the framework of temporary Hiedanranta, a host of pilots have already been made possible, and currently the actual construction of Hiedanranta to meet the inhabitants' needs is about to be launched utilising the best expertise available. In the development of this area, the following will be the key objectives: sustainable modes of mobility, renewable energy solutions, the circular economy, and smooth everyday services that through the use of new digital solutions improve quality of life.

The tramway under construction will serve as the backbone of the traffic in this residential area. Already for the first blocks, a climate neutrality-enabling heat network, advanced on a global scale, will be installed in the area. The carbon footprint of house-building in the first districts will be more than 40% lower than the current level. The carbon footprint will be reduced on a systematic basis. Residents' common facilities and services will be realised as construction in the area progresses. The factory will enable a range of events for artisans and cultural operators.

## SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

## Benefit goal:

The modal share of sustainable modes of transport will be 69%

## Description:

In Tampere, climate emissions from transport are mainly due to road traffic. Tampere residents make about 50% of their journeys by car, but in future the city's growth cannot rely on passenger cars as strongly as thus far. The city strives to heavily increase the modal share of sustainable options while decreasing the share of motoring. Sustainable mobility modes, public transport, walking and cycling are all priorities in the development of sustainable mobility. Increasing the modal share of sustainable modes of transport is a challenging goal, which requires sustained and determined action and also the allocation of resources for the development of sustainable mobility in order to improve conditions for pedestrian and bicycle traffic and for public transport.

The service level of the Tampere region public transport system will be elevated to accommodate the percentage of daily urban mobility set out in the city's goals. The tramway is the single most significant project in terms of public transport system development, as it cuts the climate load by reducing energy consumption in transport and through the use of electricity instead of oil. Additionally, the tramway creates a framework for sustainable land use while promoting smart mobility that develops smooth travel chains and new transport services.

The shift to emission-free bus transport, as well as smooth travel chains and new mobility services, will all promote the sustainability of the public transport system. Achievement of the modal share set out in the city's goal requires a general improvement in the service level.

The conditions for pedestrian and bicycle traffic will be improved by streamlining the main cycling routes and by developing walking zones in the city centre and in the regional centres. The transport pricing reform is estimated to be not only the most effective but also the most cost-effective measure in terms of reducing emissions from car traffic. Additionally, halving the emissions from traffic requires that the fleet be renewed and the share of alternative propulsion systems increased.

New mobility services, such as car-sharing, demand-responsive transport, city bikes and electric scooters, supplement sustainable mobility, reduce the need to own and use private cars, improve the smoothness of residents' everyday life and facilitate the use of public transport. Mobility management is about encouraging sustainable mobility through efforts such as guidance, mobility plans, marketing, and the development and testing of new services. A large employer, the city is a trendsetter in these efforts.

## Goal 2030:

Modal share of public transport: 19% (2025), 21% (2030).
Modal share of walking: 31% (2025), 33% (2030).
Modal share of cycling: 13% (2025), 15% (2030).
Modal share of travel by car: 36% (2025), 30% (2030).
The number of journeys made by public transport in Tampere will increase 9% (2021), 22% (2025) and 44% (2030) from 2019.
The increase in car travel output will stop by 2025 and will start to decline despite population growth.
Percentage of vehicles with alternative propulsion systems in traffic use in Tampere: 5% (2021), 20% (2025), 35% (2030).
Percentage of alternative propulsion vehicles of the city organisation's vans: 0% (2021), 20% (2025), 100% (2030).
Level of outsourced low-emission propulsion transport services (bus and tramway line kilometres): 5% (2021), 35% (2025), 100% (2030).
Tampere will operate a comprehensive, diverse, efficient and low-emission public transport system consisting of a tramway, local trains, bus transport and smart travel chains connecting all mobility modes

## Goal 2030:

Walking and cycling will be smooth, attractive and safe mobility modes, separated on their own lanes in the city centres and on the main routes. Cycling will be the fastest mobility mode for journeys of under 3km.
Tampere will have created a diverse range of mobility services to complement a sustainable mobility system. The need to own and use private cars will have decreased.
Most journeys to school and commutes by city employees will be made using sustainable mobility modes.
The city and its partners will implement versatile mobility management as part of transport and community planning. The means of mobility management will be linked to the other means that promote sustainable mobility.

## Emissions from passenger transport in 2030

Sustainable mobility solutions in Tampere include the development of pedestrian-oriented city centres, development of the main cycling routes, expansion of the tramway in Tampere and regionally, and allocation of streets with a public transport focus, and development of smooth travel chains.

A climate impact assessment, which includes the scenario review pictured here, was carried out in connection with preparing the inner-city master plan, council term 2017-21. It illustrates the annual emissions from passenger transport after realisation of projected land use in the target year of climate neutrality, 2030. The review reveals a clear zonality of the urban structure and of mobility patterns, which is why emissions from city-centre residents remain low compared to the car zone in the inner city periphery.

On the other hand, emissions from mobility within the zone inside the ring road, well served by public transport, are also relatively high. One of the reasons for this situation is the excellent car accessibility that manifests itself especially around the Nokia motorway, which seems to affect the mobility mode choices made by the region's residents and employees in a way that impairs sustainable mobility. Particular attention should therefore be paid to the competitiveness of cycling and public transport in this zone in order to achieve the modal split shifts required by the emission reduction goals.

Image 35. The map shows the calculated emissions of passenger transport in 2030 by 250-square-metre grid, divided by the sum of the number of inhabitants and the number of jobs in each square.

## SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

**Benefit goal:**
New construction will be at zero energy level, and the carbon footprint of housing will be small

**Description:**
The climate burden of housing and services will be reduced through energy- and resource-efficient construction solutions and by increasing the use of renewable energy. Tampere will introduce a life-cycle assessment of construction emissions as part of planning and decision-making.

Renovating the existing building stock will play an important role in improving the energy efficiency of housing and services. Wood construction will increase carbon sequestration in buildings while reducing indirect emissions from the production of materials.

CO2 emissions from infrastructure construction will be reduced through effective soil management, such as by exploiting soil at source. This will also save natural resources and achieve cost savings through reduced transport operations.

Additionally, the reuse of soil generated in construction will be increased, as landfills are slowly filling up. Efforts will be made to chain sites under construction, in which case reusable soil will end up directly at the right place without any intermediate storage. To enable this, data on the soil to be generated will be inventoried already at the planning stage.

**Goal 2030:**
The city's service network plans and service facility network plans will be drawn up while minimising the carbon footprint and life-cycle costs. The efficiency of the city's service facilities will improve annually up to 2030.
The climate neutrality criteria in use in construction will be applied throughout the land-use process (town plans, plot allocation data, building codes, infill development, incentives) as well as in the planning of the city's own construction projects and in building maintenance.
The city will improve the energy efficiency of its own building stock while curbing in-service energy consumption. The energy consumption of facilities will decrease in proportion to the square metres used.
The city's properties will be 80% climate neutral in terms of energy by 2025, provided that Sähkölaitos can produce an equivalent amount of climate neutral heat.
Percentage of wooden apartment block construction from all new apartment blocks on plots allocated by the city (wooden frame and façade): 10% (2021), 15% (2025), 20% (2030).
Infrastructure construction will utilise all materials that can be utilised.
Transport distances will have been minimised by ensuring adequate intermediate storage and circular economy hubs.
Renewable materials will be used in all suitable infrastructure construction sites.
Work machines will run on low-emission fuels.
Construction will strive to meet the set emission goals through planning and by using construction carbon footprint calculations.
Guidelines will be created for customers and operators to address climate and environmental issues.

**Indicators:**
Percentage of energy class A of new residential buildings (%)
Energy consumption of the residential sector (kWh/resident)
Percentage of wood construction of all new apartment blocks on plots allocated by the city (%)
Energy consumption of the city's properties (total consumption/m2 and consumption/user)
Percentage of renewable heat and electricity of energy purchased by city for its properties.
Realised percentage for mass economy planning in all town plans (%)
Percentages of recovered materials in construction

## SUSTAINABLE ENERGY

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

**Benefit goal:**
Renewable energy to account for 80%

**Description:**
Emissions from the production of electricity and district heat in Tampere will be reduced significantly by switching energy sources to renewable energy. The main objectives of the energy transition carried out by Tampereen Sähkölaitos include increased use of domestic renewable energy, reduced greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the number of jobs in the wood supply chain in the Tampere region.

Smart energy technologies can optimise energy consumption, save energy and keep costs under control. Tampere will transition to smart outdoor lighting by 2025.

Increasing decentralised renewable energy production, such as solar energy and heat pumps, will cut emissions if this production replaces fossil energy. Energy efficiency will improve and emissions will decrease, as energy production avoids energy transfer losses. In addition, decentralised solutions will improve the security of supply while enabling the introduction of new technologies.

Replacing oil heating with a sustainable heat source, such as a heat pump, district heating or a biomass boiler, will reduce climate emissions significantly.

**Goal 2030:**
Percentage of renewable energy of Tampereen Sähkölaitos's energy production: 49% (2021), 80% (2025), 90% (2030)
Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from Tampereen Sähkölaitos's production as compared to 2010: 47% (2021), 80% (2025), 95% (2030)
The city will give up oil heating at its own properties by 2025
The production of grid-connected solar energy will increase throughout the city to 20MW (around 0.2MW in 2020)
The use of oil in the individual heating of buildings will have stopped

## SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

**Benefit goal:**
Consumption will be sustainable and the circular economy functional

**Description:**
Recycling and utilisation of materials both foster the circular economy, which aims to create economic value from fewer materials while preserving the materials and the value attached to them in the economy for as long as possible. In practice, this means that material efficiency must be improved, the product life cycle increased and climate emissions reduced following decreasing consumption of natural resources. Effective recycling of materials is a prerequisite for a circular economy. The EU Waste Directive aims to increase the recycling rate of municipal waste to 60% by 2030.

Greenhouse gas emissions from consumption are significant, which is why it is important for the city to lead by example in reducing consumption and to encourage sustainable and emission-reducing consumption patterns among city residents and businesses.

Food production accounts for a large percentage of emissions from consumption. A more plant-based diet is not only healthy but also climate-friendly. The city promotes it at school and work canteens.

Sustainable development and responsibility aspects are key principles in the city's investments, projects and procurement activities. By promoting sustainable procurement, both cost savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved.

Procurement of the city's services and materials takes into account the life-cycle climate impact and other environmental impacts. In procurement, the city sets requirements for carbon dioxide emissions, energy efficiency, renewable energy, material efficiency, recyclability, harmful substances and other sustainable development aspects.

In Tampere, increasing digital services is a cross-cutting goal that can also reduce the consumption of materials and the mobility needs. Other methods of sustainable consumption include equipment sharing and different types of reuse.

Sustainable consumption is possible only if there are sustainable products and services on the market. Through a platform-based and ecosystemic approach, the city's industrial policy promotes new businesses and sustainable events that are based on climate neutrality, ecological investment, cleantech and the circular economy.

**Goal 2030:**
Municipal waste recycling rate: 50% (2021), 55% (2025), 60% (2030).
The circular economy business will have expanded and the re-use of raw materials increased.
Biomass processing, nutrient recycling and the development of new high-level products from biomass will all have become more efficient.
Environmental criteria and life-cycle impacts will be taken into account, where applicable, in the most climate-relevant city procurements.
Percentage of Voimia units offering vegetarian options: 50% (2023), 70% (2030).

|  Benefit goal: | Urban nature and urban structures will bind carbon and preparations will have been made for climate change.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Description: | The desire is to keep forests and the green infrastructure of the urban environment functional and vibrant even as the city grows. This will trap carbon from the atmosphere while mitigating climate change.
In addition to the carbon-sink and carbon-storage impact, forests and green infrastructure provide a wealth of other benefits, such as habitats for different species, well-being and a pleasant environment for urban residents, as well as helping to adapt to climate change through regulation of drainage water and through a cooling effect.
The forests owned by the city (about 7,500 hectares, of which about 7,000 hectares in Tampere) account for some 20% of all forests in the city area. The majority of city-owned forests are located around housing, used for outdoor exercise and recreation. Some areas are protected. Commercial forests measure just over 1,000 hectares. The trees and soil of the city's forests have a large carbon stock, which in 2019 corresponded to about six years' total emissions. This stock will grow by about one million tonnes of CO2 by 2030.
According to Tapio Oy's report, the carbon sink in the trees and soil of the forests that the city owns totals approximately 60,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. The forest carbon sink has grown up to the 2020s owing to the city's forest management principles. However, the sink will decrease already during this decade as forests age and their growth slows down.
Forest management aims to increase the diversity and varied structure of forests. This will support the recreational use of forests while also helping prepare for global warming, which increases the risk of plant diseases. The carbon sink in forests and in the urban green will be strengthened in the management of forests and green belts.  |
|  Goal 2030: | • Greenhouse gas emissions from urban landscaping will have been reduced by 80%.
• The carbon sink impact of the forests and urban green infrastructure in the Tampere region will cover a significant percentage of the emission offsetting need.
• The carbon sink in the city-owned forests (growing stock and soil) will cover about 20% of the emission offsetting need of the 2030 goal.
• The greenhouse gas emissions not sequestered by carbon sinks will be offset in a manner to be determined separately.  |
|  Indicators: | • Annual growth of and harvesting in city-owned forests (m3)
• Carbon sink impact of the forests in the Tampere region (CO2 t)
• Amount of green belts in master plans and town plans in the inner-city area (m³/resident)
• Ecosystem services provided by green belts
• Emission impacts from urban landscaping  |

# SECTION 5. EMISSION PROJECTION AND COSTS

## CLIMATE NEUTRAL TAMPERE 2030 ROADMAP EMISSION PROJECTION

Major measures about to be completed – still some way to go to achieve goals in many sectors

In cooperation with specialists representing various sectors, the Climate and Environmental Policy Unit prepared an assessment of the future trend of the city's climate emissions. The basic principle of the projection is the assumption that the current trend will continue in all the data used for emission calculation. These data include, for example, the consumption of heating energy and electricity and the emission factor for heating and electricity. The impacts of measurable national changes, such as changes in emissions from energy production and the new propulsion systems adopted in vehicles, were added to the current trends. On this basis, the Current Development projection was created, also covering the impact of the measures that are clearly about to be completed, such as the construction of the Naistenlahti 3 power plant and the tramway currently under construction. By adding to Current Development the impacts of some of the measures designed in the roadmap, it was possible to arrive at the roadmap emission projection (Projection KT2030).

The measurable roadmap measures can achieve an emission reduction of around 73% by 2030 (Figure 56). However, it is impossible to estimate the impact of many measures, as it was not possible to produce data on their impact. The most important factor in the transport sector that remains excluded from the assessment are the measures whereby we can affect the mobility choices of city residents. This is why, despite updating the measures and increasing their number, the emission reduction impact as compared to the first (2020) roadmap edition has improved only by about one percentage point. However, the emission reduction that can be achieved under Current Development has meanwhile risen from 61 per cent to 69 per cent, largely owing to the measures about to be completed, with the biggest single impact coming from the Naistenlahti power plant. This positive development reflects that the targeted measures have translated into effective action.

Sustainable Tampere 2030 Roadmap emission projection, May 2022

Image 56. Tampere's actual climate emissions in 2010–2020, and a projection prepared based on current development and the measures set out in the Climate Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap. Apart from national development, Current Development includes the key climate measures taken in Tampere that are already about to be realised.

The projection results indicate that, by implementing this roadmap, the emission goal will be attained for other electricity consumption, for industrial electricity consumption, and for electric heating. District heat falls only slightly short of the goal, while oil heating, industry and work machines fall considerably short of the goal. In 2030, the traffic and waste management sectors will be the sectors remaining furthest from the goal. For a more detailed analysis of each sector, see Appendix 1.

Achieving the climate neutrality goal requires not only measures by the city but also broad participation by city residents and businesses. Additionally, emissions from industry, logistics and oil heating must also be cut drastically. Furthermore, where the regional functions are concerned, the existing landfills in particular play a key role, and it would be good to find ways to further mitigate emissions from these landfills. In turn, developing sustainable mobility to be easier, faster and more attractive also requires participation from city residents.

## What steps to take to reduce the remaining 7%?

Emissions from traffic must decrease significantly faster, also including a modal shift to sustainable mobility
Deficit 20–40 kt CO2e

Oil consumption by industry, construction and other work machines (such as maintenance) must be reduced more rapidly
Deficit ~17 kt CO2e

Oil heating must end both in residential and in industrial buildings
Deficit 7–10 kt CO2e

Emissions from existing landfills must be investigated more closely and mitigated
Deficit 10–35 kt CO2e

District heat production still needs more solutions to cut emissions
Deficit ~8 kt CO2e

# ESTIMATED COST OF ROADMAP MEASURES

Rough cost estimates, represented by bullet symbols, were prepared for every measure discussed in the roadmap. Additionally, more precise cost needs for 2023-2030 were estimated for some of the measures (Appendix 2, Figure 75). These cost estimates are based on the original Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap compiled in 2020 and on updated data. Additionally, the same table also shows the emission reduction potential for every measure for which it was possible to estimate this potential.

For the measures that were estimated, the City Group's total investment in 2023-2030 stands at some EUR 496 million. As for operating expenditure, the total cost of the roadmap measures in 2023-2030 comes to some EUR 100 million. For the city organisation, excluding all subsidiaries, the respective figures are EUR 246 million and EUR 99 million. A large share of this sum is already included in the current budgetary framework. Regarding the measurable individual measures, the emission reduction potential totals some 190,000 t CO2e.

However, these estimated costs that the measures incur cannot be treated as a 'price tag' for the Climate Neutrality Roadmap, as they contain a large number of major projects that are carried out largely for non-climate-related reasons and the projects would be implemented in any case. The roadmap therefore does not entail additional costs for projects, but projects nevertheless have significant positive climate impacts. Additionally, the estimates are based solely on the financial input needed to implement the measures and take no account of any possible cost savings that the measures may generate.

In the case of the subsidiaries part of the City Group, in particular, for the measures to be implemented they must be economically profitable and based on the development of business operations or be derived from legislative requirements. Increasingly, climate investments prove to be a good solution commercially and they bring a competitive advantage, which has led to the mainstreaming of climate-friendly activities.

# COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXAMPLE MEASURES

The economic profitability of measures in relation to other measures is often illustrated on a marginal abatement cost curve. The example measures selected from the roadmap are illustrated on curves (Figure 58 and Figure 59) where the x axis displays the emission reduction potential of the measures in 2030 (t CO2e) while the y axis shows the measure's cost-effectiveness, or economy (€/t CO2e). The curve shows the measures in the order of their cost-effectiveness, placing the most cost-effective measures at the left-hand edge of the curve.

Cost-effectiveness illustrates the price of the emission reduction that a measure incurs, expressed in the calculations as per tonne of reduced greenhouse gas emission (€/t CO2e). A negative cost-effectiveness figure means that the measure, in addition to an emission reduction, generates cost savings through, for example, reduced energy or maintenance costs. The greater the negative cost-effectiveness is, the more profitable it is to implement that measure. A positive cost-effectiveness figure means increased costs. The width of the column illustrates the measure's emission reduction potential – the wider the column, the greater the emission reduction potential.

The cost-effectiveness calculations take account of the costs of measure implementation or investment as well as the cost savings generated by a measure as compared to a scenario where the measure is not implemented. Calculations of this type provide a good assessment of the overall economic performance, but they entail uncertainty as to, for example, how the price development taking place over the coming years will be assessed.

|  Example measures examined | (the example measures are not always exactly identical to the measures set out in the roadmap but provide an understanding of the economy of the measure in question)  |
| --- | --- |
|  Outdoor lighting (measure 4.2.4) | 95% of the city's outdoor lighting will be replaced with smart control LED lights by 2025.  |
|  Solar panels (measure 4.3.2) | The amount of solar energy produced at the city's buildings is expected to increase tenfold linearly by 2030, meaning that in the target year (2030) the annual capacity is expected to be 630 kWp while annual production is expected to be 567 MWh.  |
|  Renovation construction (measure package 3.3) | All buildings owned by the city will be renovated to be 20% more energy-efficient than the minimum legal requirement.  |
|  New construction (measure package 3.1) | All new buildings owned by the city will be constructed to be 20% more energy-efficient than the minimum legal requirement.  |
|  Cars (measure 2.6.11) | The number of the city organisation's cars using different propulsion systems will develop over the period examined (2023-2030) such that in 2025, 30% of cars will be electric and 10% will be gas-powered. By 2030, 70% of all cars will run on electricity and the remaining 30% on biogas.  |
|  Vans (measure 2.6.12) | The number of the city organisation's vans using different propulsion systems is assumed to develop over the period examined (2023-2030) such that in 2025, 10% of vans will be electric and 10% gas-powered. By 2030, 75% of all vans will run on electricity and the remaining 25% on biogas.  |
|  Oil heating (measure 4.4.2) | The city's buildings will replace oil heating with water to air heat pump systems by 2025.  |
|  Public transport (measure 2.3.3) | The number of Nysse's buses using different propulsion systems is assumed to develop over the period examined (2023-2030) such that in 2030, 50% of the bus traffic will be electric, 40% renewable diesel-powered and 10% biogas-powered.  |
|  Work machines (measure 2.7.3) | The city's own work machines will linearly switch to renewable diesel such that it will be used exclusively by 2030.  |

Of the measures examined, based on the calculations made, all measures with the exception of work machines are economically profitable, meaning they produce life-cycle cost savings, as their value on the y axis is negative. This illustrates that, in reality, several energy saving measures are economically profitable investments when considering their entire life cycle. Although some investments may entail high costs, during their life cycle they can generate enough cost savings for the measures to be economically preferable to current development. It should also be kept in mind that energy-efficient investments are no longer necessarily more costly than so-called traditional solutions, while on the other hand the costs of saving energy can, following increasing electrification, be considerable compared to expenses such as fuel costs. It is also worthwhile to implement measures that are significantly inexpensive, even if they incur some costs. Often they in any case also create other benefits besides reducing emissions.

If an investment's life cycle goes beyond the 2030 carbon neutrality target year, only the share of the investment costs in the examination period 2023-2023 will be taken into account in the calculations. For example, for an investment made in 2025 with an economic life span of 25 years, 20% is considered, for (2030-2025)/25 = 20%. The calculations employ a discount rate of 4 per cent, which is used to convert future cash flows to present value for commensurability. The example calculations are dynamic, and the measures are therefore always compared to current development, not to any static status quo. Additionally, under these models, the development of prices and emission factors has a temporal dimension. Owing to the dynamic nature of the emission factors, the emission impact may not necessarily peak in the target year, 2030, not even in the case of significant measures, as the emission factors will experience a downward trend over the years in any case, which will also bring down the emission reduction impact that the measures can achieve.

Cost-effectiveness was calculated by employing the UK's general emission reduction cost-effectiveness method framework (BEIS 2019) and the cost-effectiveness examination of Finland's national emission reduction measures (Granskog et al 2018). Cost-effectiveness is expressed as the adjusted Net Present Value of a measure divided by the cumulative emission savings over the calculation period. For more detailed information on the calculation method and the initial values, see the background memorandum prepared on the costs of the original Carbon Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap (Nieminen 2020, in Finnish). The calculations have been updated, and further information regarding them is available from the City of Tampere's Climate and Environmental Policy Unit.

# COSTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN FINLAND AND TAMPERE

The national KUITTI project published in spring 2022 assessed the direct and indirect impacts from climate change that will incur costs for Finland. According to the project final report, climate change will result in increasing costs in Finland through developments such as floods and disturbances in power distribution while affecting the conditions for and profitability of forestry and agriculture, increasing health care costs from heatwaves and vector- and waterborne diseases as well as affecting several different ecosystem services. Climate change mitigation and adaptation can help reduce these impacts and the resulting costs.

Overall, the KUITTI project estimates that the annual economic cost of weather extremes in Finland will come to approximately EUR 90 million. When assessing the harm people experience based on other than direct monetary compensation, the annual cost in Finland is estimated to be about EUR 400 million. In relative terms based on population, the corresponding figures for Tampere would be around EUR 4 and 18 million annually, respectively. However, these estimates only cover some of the negative impacts. It should also be noted that such quantitative economic evaluations contain a high degree of uncertainty and require a lot of specification and choices by experts.

The costs of greenhouse gas emissions from Tampere, including the negative impacts described above, can also be assessed on the basis of the emissions trading price or the social cost of car

bon dioxide. Assuming that emissions in the coming years will develop in accordance with Tampere's emissions budget, and the cost of a ton of carbon dioxide is at the level of the average price of the emission allowance in 2021 (about €54/t CO2e), the negative impacts (or costs) from emissions in 2022 would be about 40 million euros, and only about 14 million euros in 2030 after an 80% reduction in emissions. (Figure 60). In reality, the emissions trading price is likely to go up considerably in the future, and in early 2022 the price has fluctuated between €60-100 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions.

If the same estimate is made with higher prices for a ton of carbon dioxide, using estimates of €100/t CO2e and €150/t CO2e in the example calculations, the annual harm by emissions would be €72-108 million in 2022 and €26-39 million in 2030. A higher price of CO2e better reflects the real negative impacts from emissions, i.e. the social cost of carbon. Several estimates of such a price have been made, but there is no consensus on the correct level. In the United States, 51 dollars (approx. 50 euros) per ton of carbon dioxide is used as the social price of carbon in the calculations of the projects. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has suggested that to stay in the Paris Agreement, the price of carbon in 2030 should be between $135 and $5500/t CO2e (about €130 and €5400/t CO2e).

Negative impacts caused by greenhouse gas emissions according to the emissions development of climate budget, and based on the emissions trading price (the average value in 2021 was about €54/t CO2e) and hypothetical higher prices reflecting the negative impacts of carbon (100 and 150 €/t CO2e).
The relevant question is not merely how much will it cost to implement the Climate Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap.

## A MORE RELEVANT QUESTION MAY BE:
How much will it cost if we do not invest in climate change mitigation and adaptation?

It is estimated that the cost of greenhouse gas emissions in Tampere in 2022 could be almost 110 million euros.

# THE CHALLENGE OF MODAL SHIFT AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT

## ON THE TRANSFORMATION OF MOBILITY HABITS

Estimates on the need to transform our mobility habits are outlined in two distinct ways. The emission projection used here assumes that Current Development has already taken the propulsion system shift for 2030 as far as it can go. Despite this, emissions must be cut further by some 20 kt CO2e. If the necessary emission reduction is achieved solely by reducing the output from cars running on fossil petrol, the transformation would mean that car travel must be cut by some 180 million kilometres, corresponding to approximately 18.6% of the current car travel output (Figure 62). It should be noted that in this rough example, only illustrating the scale of the transformation, the emissions or output of any other vehicles remain unchanged.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
Output from traffic in the emission projection

CLIMATE NEUTRAL TAMPERE 2030

CLIMATE NEUTRAL TAMPERE 2030
On the other hand, it was assessed how the mobility choices made by city residents should develop in order to achieve the sustainable mobility goal: In 2030, 69% of all journeys will be made using public transport, on foot or by bicycle. Below is a calculation of the mobility outputs for different mobility modes, prepared assuming that the 2030 sustainable mobility mode goal will be attained. In this example, the output of public transport more than doubles while car travel experiences a decline of about 10%. Additionally, walking shows an increase of 33% and cycling nearly doubles. It should be borne in mind that this mobility is for people living in Tampere, whereas the previous example (Figure 63) concerns all mobility within the geographical region of Tampere.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Image 63. Example estimate of how the journeys made by people living in Tampere and, consequently, mobility outputs could develop in order to achieve the 69% modal split goal for sustainable modes of mobility.

## COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF MOBILITY MODAL SPLIT

In a cost-benefit analysis, Tampere has prepared a comprehensive estimate of the EUR impacts of the shift in the modal split that supports the climate neutrality goal as well as how well they match. This was undertaken so that the impacts of the climate measures taken could be assessed beyond emission reductions and direct costs or cost savings.

To reach the carbon neutrality target, it is estimated that the share of sustainable transport modes in Tampere should increase from the current 54% to 69% by 2030 (Figure 64). Originally, this analysis was included in a Master's thesis (Joronen 2020) and it concerned cars, walking and cycling (consult this thesis for more information on the calculation method and the assumptions). The estimate was later supplemented to also cover public transport. For more detailed information on the calculations, contact the City of Tampere's Climate and Environmental Policy Unit.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

Image 64. The modal split in 2016 and the targeted modal split in 2030.

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

The calculations compare the costs and benefits arising from the targeted modal split shift compared to current development, with due consideration of the growth of the city's population. The impacts take account of the costs and benefits experienced by the city organisation from infrastructure investment and maintenance as well as from the operation of and ticket sales proceeds from public transport; by individuals from vehicle, travel time and health related impacts; and more generally by society regarding health, accidents, climate change, air pollution and noise. This examination does not take a position on the measures whereby the targeted modal split could be achieved.

The analysis is based on the city's estimates of the development of the travel outputs (passenger-kilometres/year) of the different mobility modes up to 2030 and on the passenger-kilometre-specific unit values of the different cost items and benefits items, which are based on bibliographic sources and calculations prepared by the City of Tampere's Climate and Environmental Policy Unit. The examination compares targeted development with current development, and the results show the difference between these two.

When looking together at the city's economy, individuals, and wider society, the total cost from more sustainable mobility in the period 2023-2030 is 175 million euros and the corresponding total benefit is 1,014 million euros (Image 65). According to the estimate, a total net benefit of 840 million euros would result from moving towards more sustainable mobility, which is approximately 105 million euros on an annual basis, meaning that society would benefit from moving to a more sustainable mode of transportation.

Image 65. Total expenditure and total benefit from the targeted modal split compared to current development.

Of the total expenditure, 36% will be incurred by the city, 62% by individuals and 2% by society. The most significant cost arises from individuals' increased travel time and from increased traffic operation costs incurred by the city. Of the total benefit, 13% will be incurred by the city, 80% by individuals and 7% by society. The most significant benefits are the cost savings to individuals from vehicle use and the increased proceeds from ticket sales accruing to the city. Additionally, individuals and society will achieve significant health benefits, and society will benefit from the reduced impact of climate change.

According to this examination, the Tampere city organisation's net benefit from the targeted mobility mode shift totals EUR 66 million in 2023-2030. The increase in costs is mainly due to the operation of public transport (EUR 63 million) and the benefits come from increased proceeds from public transport ticket sales (EUR 120 million). In addition, benefits will also be derived from a reduced level of

road investments (EUR 9.5 million).

The net benefit to individuals from the targeted mobility mode shift will come to up to EUR 700 million in 2023-2030. Increased costs are due to longer travel times as a result of an increase in slower mobility modes (EUR 110 million) while the benefits arise mainly from a decrease in car-related operating costs (EUR 780 million). Additionally, individuals will benefit from improved health and longer life expectancy (EUR 28 million).

The examination suggests that the net benefit to society from the targeted mobility mode shift will be EUR 72 million in 2023-2030. Increased costs are solely due to a higher number of cycling and pedestrian accidents (EUR 2.7 million) while the benefits arise mainly from the effects of increased walking and cycling on healthcare costs and on a decreasing amount of sick leave (EUR 40 million), from reduced climate change negatives (EUR 29 million) and from reduced air pollution (EUR 2.7 million) and noise pollution (EUR 3.2 million).

# SECTION 6. CONCLUSION

This second edition of the Climate Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap presents more than 300 climate measures by the City of Tampere, 75 of which promote not only climate change mitigation but also climate change adaptation and preparedness. What is more, the roadmap now also contains an increasing number of measures by the city's companies and public utilities. Similarly to the first edition of the roadmap in 2020, this update was also drawn up in cooperation with the services and units.

A great many of the measures contain climate actions big and small, undertaken for a variety of reasons. These are included and highlighted in the roadmap from the perspective of climate impacts. For some of the measures, the costs and the direct impact on climate emissions are small, yet serve as good examples and reinforce the growing river of change from small streams. These include pur

chasing electric cars or solar panels for the city, increasing the share of vegetarian food in schools and staff canteens, increasing recycling and the use of recycled materials, and wood construction. Many of the measures set out in this roadmap have an indirect impact on climate emissions, enabling city residents to live, use energy, move and use services sustainably. Tampere is determined in its efforts to guide the growth that the city is experiencing to central areas and along the trunk routes of public transport. The tramway will densify the city while also making energy efficient housing and a car-free everyday life possible. Smooth mobility services, digital services and a well-functioning circular economy all make it easier for city residents to make sustainable everyday choices. The impact of these measures is significant, but we will witness it only in the longer term, and it is very difficult to assess in advance the scope of that impact.

Image 66. Roadmap measures on a timeline. Large balloons represent major investments and emission reduction measures, while medium-sized balloons represent smaller climate actions and small balloons represent changes in the practices of everyday life.
Adapting to evolving conditions is absolutely necessary despite successful mitigation measures. The later we launch the adaptation measures, the more costly this will be in economic and human terms. Adaptation measures strive to reduce the harm caused by these changes while promoting the capability of people, social activities and the environment to function under changed and evolving conditions. These adaptation measures include the construction of urban run-off reservoirs that prevent flooding following increased heavy rains, as well as the development of the city's risk management process and improving city residents' preparedness. Many of the measures, including cherishing the city's green infrastructure, decentralising the energy system and assessing climate impacts in the context of the city's development projects, serve both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. Monitoring the progress made with all roadmap measures is possible on an open website, the Tampere Climate Watch.

The measurable measures set out in the roadmap can achieve an emission reduction of around 73% by 2030. However, it is impossible to estimate the impact of many measures, as it was not possible to produce data on their impact. The most important factor in the transport sector that remains excluded from the assessment are the measures whereby we can affect the mobility choices of city residents. Although the emission reduction impact from the measures improved by only about one percentage point over the first (2020) roadmap edition, the emission reduction that can be achieved under Current Development rose from 61 per cent to 69 per cent. This positive Current Development reflects that the targeted measures have translated into effective action. It was projected that the transport and the waste management sectors will remain furthest from the goal.

Additionally, the progress made with climate efforts is monitored in the city's budget, in which a climate budget section details the annual city-level maximum emissions and the resources allocated to climate measures by the City Group. In the 2021 financial statements, the City of Tampere's reported climate budget operating expenditure totalled some 0.2 per cent of the city's total operating expenditure while climate investments accounted for approximately 4 per cent of the city's total investments. However, the Climate Neutral Tampere 2030 Roadmap contains more detailed information than the climate budget.

Instead of basic activity, it places heavier focus on policy recommendations and contains measures that are more detailed than the climate budget. For the roadmap measures assessed, the city organisation's total investment in 2023-2030 comes to some EUR 496 million and the figure for operating expenses is approximately EUR 100 million. A large share of this sum is already included in the current budgetary framework. However, these estimated costs of the measures cannot be treated as a 'price tag' for the Climate Neutrality Roadmap, as they contain a large number of major projects that are carried out largely for non-climate related reasons.

The roadmap therefore will not necessarily incur any additional costs, but projects will nevertheless have significant positive climate impacts. Additionally, it must be considered that the cost estimates are based on the financial input needed to implement the measures and they take no account of any possible cost savings that the measures may generate. However, as an example, this edition of the roadmap shows economic calculations for a few measures, as well as an estimate of the costs of modal shift in relation to their benefits.

Increasingly, climate investments turn out to be economically profitable solutions, which is why climate-friendly action has become more popular in the mainstream. Instead of the roadmap 'price tag', it may be more relevant to know the costs that will be incurred if we do not invest in climate change mitigation and adaptation. It is estimated that the cost of greenhouse gas emissions in Tampere in 2022 could be almost 110 million euros.

This roadmap only discusses the Tampere City Group's measures to promote climate neutrality. Measures are also needed from companies, communities and city residents, and a delightful number of them has already been taken. Achieving our goal will require major changes in many areas, including giving up oil heating, improving the energy efficiency of old buildings and replacing the propulsion systems of transport vehicles and work machines. In order to accelerate the climate actions by businesses, since autumn 2020 the City of Tampere has been coordinating the Tampere Region Climate Partnership activity, in the course of which more than 100 businesses and communities have now committed to a common climate neutrality goal through measures that suit each of them individually.

Achieving Tampere's ambitious climate neutrality goal requires a determined and long-term commitment to the climate neutrality goal from the entire city organisation. At Tampere, this goal is being made part of the operating culture while ensuring that it is addressed increasingly in operational and financial planning. In particular, further investment is needed to promote sustainable transport and to improve the energy efficiency of buildings.

The roadmap is intended to be updated on a regular basis. It will provide an opportunity to assess the achievement of the goal and, if necessary, to step up measures. In the context of the update, it is also possible to examine the changes in the local and global operating environment. For example, the development of transport propulsion systems and technologies is rapid, and solutions that are currently unknown may enter the market.

APPENDIX 1.

# ROADMAP ASSESSMENT FOR KEY EMISSION SECTORS

The projected emissions from traffic show a decrease of some 100 kt CO2e over 2020, while the achievement of the climate neutrality goal set out in the emissions budget would require an additional decrease of some 20 kt CO2e. The projection assessment includes a very optimistic view of the development of the new propulsion systems adopted. In the absence of reliable methods, it was not possible to assess any individual measures that strive to affect people's mobility behaviour. Therefore, the goal can be achieved by investing in influencing the shift in the modal split. An estimate is shown later as to how the modal split should develop.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Image 68. A more detailed picture of the roadmap projection of climate emissions from traffic

The emission projection includes all transport investments modelled for Tampere and the resulting change in traffic outputs. Electric cars are expected to become so popular that up to 30% of the output from cars in 2030 will be from cars running on electricity. Since the future traffic output without all investments is not calculated, no Current Development projection was calculated for traffic.

Additionally, account is taken of the reduced emission factors of all propulsion systems following technological development and as the distribution obligation of biofuels is increased. Public transport will run entirely on low-emission propulsion in 2030, in accordance with the public transport propulsion survey completed in early 2020. The adoption of new propulsion systems elsewhere than in public transport mainly relies on measures at national level, which is why the realisation of this shift is surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty.

The fact that some of the measures are only in the investigation phase must also be considered in the traffic emission estimate. For example, the roadmap mentions the use of parking fees and speeding up journey times on public transport, but in the absence of more specific plans the related impacts cannot be assessed.

It is difficult to assess the measures that promote the shift in mobility modes in some other way except by listing what the roadmap contains. These measures number more than 60 (Figure 69). The shift is slow, however, which is why these measures need to be taken decisively and communicated broadly so that the climate neutrality goal will be achieved.

|   | Measure package | Number of measures  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Increasing the share of sustainable mobility modes | 1.2 Conditions for sustainable mobility | 12  |
|   |  2.5 Pedestrian and bicycle traffic | 8  |
|   |  2.9 Mobility management | 14  |
|  Expanding the portfolio of public transport and mobility services | 2.1 Tram transport | 9  |
|   |  2.2 Local train transport | 6  |
|   |  2.3 Bus transport | 5  |
|   |  2.4 Public transport service level | 8  |

Image 69. Summary of roadmap measures to promote a shift in mobility modes.

The reduction achieved in respect of emissions from district heat is near the goal but still falls some 10 kt CO2e short (Figure 70). Sähkölaitos estimates that the long-term action plan will achieve its goal, and the difference is ultimately due to the different methods employed to calculate the emissions. In both cases, achievement of the goal requires that Tampereen Sähkölaitos will, after the upgrade of the Naistenlahti power plant, also focus future investments on renewable energy, non-combustion production and novel smart heat and grid solutions. The estimate for district heat is based on the assumption that emission development will be in line with Sähkölaitos's long-term action plan (measures described on pages 86-87).

A model similar to that used by Tampereen Sähkölaitos, adjusted by the city's population projection, was used to estimate the future consumption of district heat. The model roughly takes account of the removal of buildings, moderate renovation construction, the new construction necessitated by population growth, and shifts from one heat source to another.

Current Development already covers the completion of the Naistenlahti power plant and the transition to renewable fuel (Measure 4.1.1). The Projection KT 2030 calculation takes account of Sähkölaitos's long-term action plan (Measures 4.1.2-4 and 7), the broad achievement of the energy-saving potential of renovation construction through guidance (Measure package 3.4) as well as Finnpark's energy efficiency measure 4.3.5.

APPENDIX 1.

Reducing emissions from individual heating (mainly oil heating) to the target level set out in the emissions budget requires that all buildings that use oil heating must adopt other sources of heat more rapidly than at present. At the moment, 11.4 kt in climate emissions remains in this projection while the goal is to attain a near-zero level (Figure 71). The climate budget seeks to achieve a level of 4 kt CO2e. The pace of change has accelerated in recent years, which may be related to the financial support and guidance on giving up oil heating provided by the state. Today oil heating is still used to a significant degree in detached houses and industrial buildings.

No specific measures are included in Current Development. The Projection KT 2030 calculation contains measure package 4.4, assuming that residential buildings, in particular, will give up oil heating and the city's own buildings will stop using oil as planned by 2025. In this projection, oil heating will still be used in service and industrial buildings.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Image 71. The roadmap climate emission projection for oil heating. The goal is identical to the preliminary emissions budget for 2030.

The realised figures for other electricity consumption, electric heating, and industrial electricity consumption set out in the emissions budget will be achieved if consumption continues to develop at the current rate (Figure 72). The projected consumption is based on the current consumption per capita, which is decreasing by about 40 kWh, or by about one per cent, annually. However, total consumption is on a moderate increase following population growth. The reduction in emissions is therefore mainly due to a significant reduction in the national electricity emission factor, which is also influenced by the investments made by Tampereen Sähkolaos. Energy efficiency measures will keep the consumption growth under control while electricity consumption is at the same time growing, especially in traffic but also in industry and in heating.

Building-specific heat pump heating is included in the emission figures for electric heating. This increase takes account of Current Development, increasing the efficiency of renovation construction and replacement of oil heating with renewable sources of energy.

The only factor included in Current Development is the development of the national emission factor for electricity. The Projection KT 2030 calculation includes the energy efficiency estimate set out under measure package 3.4, Finnpark's energy efficiency measure 4.3.5 and, from measure package 4.3, the estimate of the growth of solar power at buildings as well as Tredu-Kihiteistöt's measure 4.3.8 to step up solar power.

Additionally, climate emissions from the electricity consumption of electric heating and of industry will achieve the set goal. The projection for electric heating takes account of making renovation construction more efficient. Electric heating also includes the electricity consumption of ground source heat pumps, which will grow following the replacement of oil heating.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
Image 72. The roadmap climate emission projection for other electricity consumption. The goal is identical to the preliminary emissions budget for 2030.

The realised figure for emissions from industry and work machines has unexpectedly gone up in 2020 (Figure 73). This projection has not been adjusted yet owing to the uncertainty surrounding the situation. In other respects too, it has not been possible to project with high accuracy emissions from industry, since they depend on how much businesses purchase fossil fuels. The rise in emissions is due to increased procurement of fuel oil, which might have to do with the crisis brought about by the global COVID-19 pandemic that broke out in 2020. In any case, achievement of the goal will require that measures be taken, in particular, in industry and at construction sites.

The highest emissions from waste management are methane emissions from existing landfills, where no significant volumes of waste have been deposited since 2016. Previous calculations overestimated the level of emission reductions, and that is why this projection will not achieve the 2030 goal (Figure 74). It is appropriate to employ new models and measurements to further specify this

calculation. Waste management and the Sulkavuori Central Treatment Plant also produce significant amounts of renewable energy and biogas. Their effects are reflected in energy production and energy consumption. Additionally, waste management plays a major role in the circular economy activities.

# MEASURES REMOVED DURING UPDATE PROCESS

The roadmap update process removed three measures that were included in the first version. These measures were removed because they are included in the other measures or because there is no need for them.

|  Theme | Measure package | Measure number in 2020 Roadmap | Measure | Time-table | Responsible party | Reason for removal  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Sustainable mobility | Pedestrian and bicycle traffic | 63 | The pedestrian and bicycle network will be supplemented by adding missing underpasses and connections. More room will be provided for pedestrians and cyclists during roadworks compared to the current situation while improving accessibility. | 2020-2029 | Transport System Planning | This item is included in the other measures.  |
|  Sustainable energy | Centralised renewable energy | 149 | An investment will be made in a new biomass heating plant if the project is found to be viable. | 2022-2025 | Tampereen Sähköliatos Oy | On the basis of the 'Fuel-free and carbon-negative district heating' survey, it is likely that there will be no need for this measure; instead, the heat demand will be covered by non-combustion solutions.  |
|  Sustainable consumption | Circular economy | 179 | As part of the construction of Hiedanranta, a solution will be developed for the removal and utilisation of the zero-fi-bre sludge at the bottom of Lake Näsijärvi as energy and/or material on an industrial scale. | 2022-2025 | Hiedanranta Development Programme, Hiedanrannan Kehitys Oy | This item is included in the other measures.  |
