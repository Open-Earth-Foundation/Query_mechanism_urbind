Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# Summary

In 2015, the Paris Climate Agreement set the goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible, and in any case to well below 2 degrees Celsius. As the City of Leipzig, we are committed to this goal, which is why the City Council adopted the Leipzig Energy and Climate Protection Programme 2030 (EKSP 2030), setting the climate policy goal of a climate-neutral city by 2040 at the latest. The aim is to more than halve the city's overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

By participating in the EU mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030", Leipzig City Council and the city administration have jointly committed to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (City Council resolution VII-DS-06102). However, it will only be possible to pursue this goal even more ambitiously with the involvement of society as a whole in order to achieve the necessary transformation towards climate neutrality by 2030 at a local level. The EU mission gave the city of Leipzig the opportunity to launch a city-wide climate protection programme in order to tackle the path to climate neutrality in a targeted manner and in a broad alliance of stakeholders. In addition to the Energy and Climate Protection Programme (EKSP), which is currently being implemented, external stakeholders from business, science and urban society were involved in a participatory process. As a result, more than 40 stakeholders from business, science, social institutions, administration and civil society have declared their willingness to achieve goals and implement measures on the path to climate neutrality by 2030 in the first version of the Climate City Agreement.

The Climate City Contract is a jointly designed programme of Leipzig's citizens, business, science and civil society that shows the path to climate neutrality by 2030. In addition to the EKSP 2030, whose measures and priorities for action are largely developed and implemented by the administration and its municipal companies and which is defined by 10 success factors, the Climate City Contract documents the joint efforts of the administration and private companies to develop over 800 innovative, sustainable measures. These are implemented in a network or as individual measures, in the neighbourhood, for the company or for society. It is estimated that this will result in CO2 savings of 560 tonnes and an investment volume of 330 million euros.

Our joint task now is:

to drive forward the further implementation of the measures in network associations,
to extend the use of digital applications such as digital twins, AI and our Leipzig app for support,
to win over further partners, enablers and activists for involvement in the Climate City Contract and to include them in further stages for development of the CCC,
to act as a driving force for other European cities with our activities
to advocate for the removal of the described financial and legal barriers at state, federal and european level.

In this way, we aim to contribute to the implementation of the European Green Deal while preserving the city's quality of life, along with its ecological, social, and economic resilience.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

# 1 Introduction

# Introduction

This Action Plan is one of three parts that together form the Climate City Contract (CCC). It stands alongside the investment plan and the core contract with voluntary commitment and is closely linked to both: The cost scenarios of the Investment Plan build on the measures of the Action Plan. All three components of the CCC are therefore harmonised and aim in the same direction. Together, they can initiate a new phase of adaptation to climate change in Leipzig and lead to far-reaching and lasting reductions in emissions. To define this path, the CCC builds on what has been achieved so far.

# Leipzig

Leipzig is a modern metropolis and, with around 629,000 inhabitants, is not only the largest city in Saxony, but also the seventh largest in Germany. The city area covers almost  $300\mathrm{km}^2$ . Leipzig is made up of ten city districts, which are subdivided into 63 neighbourhoods. An overview of the districts is shown in the following illustration.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
Figure 1 Leipzig and its districts

Situated in the north-western part of the Free State of Saxony, bordering on the federal states of Bavaria, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg, Leipzig is today an important cultural city throughout Europe. Its economy and population are developing dynamically. The city has a dense network of research institutions and is home to the University of Leipzig, one of the oldest universities in Germany. As an important trade fair centre and a traditional university city, Leipzig has always been a city of trade, encounters, creativity and the exchange of people from the most diverse backgrounds and ideas. This

is complemented by its historically grown self-image as a civic city, in which individual freedom, participation and co-determination of public life play a special role.

# Leipzig Charter

In 2007, the "Leipzig Charter for a Sustainable European City" was adopted in Leipzig by the European ministers for urban development and spatial planning. The aim of the Leipzig Charter 2007 was to establish integrated, city-wide urban development as a key approach to strengthening and developing the European city. A special focus was also placed on neighbourhoods with particular development needs. As a city that has undergone a fundamental transformation - characterised by shrinkage in the 1990s to dynamic population and economic growth and a very high quality of life - Leipzig today serves as a role model for strategic and sustainable urban development.

In the course of global changes over the last decade, the Charter was revised in a broad national and European dialogue process. The "New Leipzig Charter" (full title "New Leipzig Charta - The transformative power of cities for the common good") sets out ambitious guidelines for an integrated urban development policy for European cities. It places particular importance on public and social action that is committed to the common good. The New Leipzig Charter formulates three substantive dimensions of action for cities: the "green city", the "just city" and the "productive city". The aim is to focus on the transformative power of cities and the participation of all sections of the population. The City of Leipzig welcomes the update of the Leipzig Charter. Many of the topics mentioned are included in the strategic goals of the City of Leipzig as mandates for action. The core principles, such as integrated working, citizen and stakeholder participation or location-based approaches to action, are anchored above all in the Integrated Urban Development Concept.

# Population

As at 31.12.2023, the city of Leipzig had 628,718 main residents and a population density of 2129 people per square kilometre. Leipzig has a foreign population of approx. 14%. The city of Leipzig is the only region in eastern Germany to be one of the fastest-growing districts and cities in Germany. According to a new population forecast by the Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development, the population in Leipzig will increase by more than 14% by 2040. In the main variant of the forecast, around 639,000 inhabitants are predicted for the year 2030, and a further population increase to a probable 664,000 is expected by 2040

Since 1990, Leipzig has undergone a transformation characterised by phases of shrinkage and re-urbanisation. After the reunification of Germany in 1990, the number of inhabitants initially fell due to emigration and relocations to neighbouring municipalities. These waves of emigration led to a decline in the population, which was partially offset by incorporations in the late 1990s. From 1990 to 1999, the number of inhabitants fell from just under 511,000 to around 489,500 due to emigration and relocation to neighbouring municipalities.

Since around 2005, however, there has been a significant increase in the population. In the last ten years, the population has grown by 15.9% - making Leipzig the fastest growing metropolis in Germany. This change is reflected not only in the population trend, but also in the increasing dynamism and diversity of the urban environment, which is characterised by a growing economy, a flourishing cultural life and a lively urban atmosphere. One of the reasons for this growth is the high level of life satisfaction: according to a survey by the EU Commission, Leipzig ranks fifth out of 83 European cities in terms of quality of life, making it the most liveable city in Germany.

# Urban policy

City policy is shaped by the City Council, the Lord Mayor and the eight specialised mayors (aldermen). The City Council is the elected representative of the citizens and the main body of the City of Leipzig. Councillors are elected by direct universal suffrage, free, equal and secret ballot for a five-year term. The election of the current City Council took place on 9 June 2024. According to the Saxon municipal code, the Mayor is the Chairman of the City Council. The City Council lays down the principles for the administration of the City of Leipzig and decides on all matters concerning the City of Leipzig, unless the Lord Mayor is responsible by law or the City Council has delegated certain matters to him. The Lord Mayor is therefore Chairman of the City Council, head of the city administration, responsible for the internal organisation and ongoing administrative business and implements the resolutions of the City Council and its committees. The term of office of a Lord Mayor is seven years.

# Building stock and cityscape

Leipzig suffered little destruction during the Second World War and therefore has a large stock of buildings from the Wilhelminian era and the years of the Weimar Republic. During the GDR era, the Gründerzeit neighbourhoods and many residential buildings fell into disrepair due to a lack of investment. Of a total of 257,000 flats in 1990, around 196,000 were in need of refurbishment, including 103,000 from the Wilhelminian era. After German reunification, extensive refurbishments were carried out in the building sector, which also improved the energy efficiency of the buildings. In the meantime, over 70% of all flats from the Wilhelminian era have been completely refurbished and in 2022, almost 67,700 residential buildings and 349,000 flats were counted. Today, the Gründerzeit neighbourhoods are considered lively and attractive residential areas.

In the years between 1961 and 1990, large industrial housing estates were built in some Leipzig districts. Grünau and Paunsdorf are particularly worthy of mention. The buildings constructed in these neighbourhoods provide concentrated space for several tens of thousands of residential units. Figure 4-1 shows the distribution of residential buildings by age group. Since reunification, around 40% of today's housing stock has been added. Almost all residential buildings in neighbourhoods such as Schönau or Heiterblick were built after reunification.

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
Figure 2 Construction age classification

The total number of buildings amounts to 142,577 buildings, which cover an area of 22.4 km². It should be noted that a number of neighbouring municipalities were incorporated into the City of Leipzig at the end of the 1990s. Historically, these municipalities are not or only partially connected to existing infrastructure networks. In particular, peripheral locations are generally not connected to district heating supply networks.

The number of residential buildings in Leipzig is approx. 45% and the number of non-residential buildings accounts for approx. 55%. Almost 64,600 buildings were categorised as single-family houses, multi-family houses and large multi-family houses. In the residential building category, 67% of the usable floor space is accounted for by apartment blocks and large apartment blocks. Figure 2. (Key points for municipal heat planning) Single-family houses account for around 24% of the usable floor space of residential buildings. High-rise buildings account for around 4.4%. While districts such as Plaußig-
City of Leipzig

Portitz or Meusdorf, which are located on the outskirts of the city, have a comparatively high proportion of single-family houses, high-rise buildings are also strongly represented in the centrally located districts, for example in Grünau or Lößnig. Half of all residential buildings in the city of Leipzig were built before 1948. As a result, around 19,700 buildings are listed, most of which are in locations close to the city centre. However, the districts of Plagwitz and Connewitz are also characterised by old districts with buildings from the Wilhelminian era. As listed buildings can often only be renovated to make them more energy-efficient at great expense, it is sensible and necessary to differentiate between listed and non-listed buildings with regard to energy-efficient renovation.

## Urban green, forest and park areas

Leipzig is one of the greenest cities in Europe. The entire urban area of Leipzig is characterised by numerous parks and green spaces, a species-rich stock of street trees, many allotment gardens and important cemeteries. Large parks and open spaces, a network of green spaces and the Pleiße, Weiße Elster and Parthe rivers with their floodplains, together with the residential and commercial areas, also characterise a varied urban landscape. One of the largest alluvial forest areas in Central Europe stretches right through the city of Leipzig and into the region. Leipzig's alluvial forest is of great ecological importance.

As a compact city in the ecological green network, it is both a cause and a victim of climate change: heavy rainfall events are increasing, as are heat and drought, which have a negative impact on the city's ecological green network and the quality of life and health of its residents. As a green city with lots of green spaces, Leipzig's urban area acts as a carbon sink and reservoir. These must be urgently preserved in the interests of natural climate protection in order to avoid damage to the green infrastructure and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions in the long term.

In order to prevent the elimination of green spaces, which are essential to mitigate the effects of climate change and species extinction, in the course of the city's extraordinary growth, the city council adopted a green statute for the city of Leipzig in February 2024. The greening statute provides clear regulations for new buildings: Flat roofs must be greened over a wide area and permanently, unless there are photovoltaic or solar thermal systems if the two systems would interfere with each other by combining, façades must be greened and backyards and front gardens must be green and integrate the habitat of animals as early as the building planning stage. In 2022, green spaces will account for around 20 % of the urban area. In order to increase this proportion and also protect urban waters, the city has developed a comprehensive blue-green strategy that combines approaches such as the "UrbanGreenEye" satellite climate monitoring lighthouse project and the "Valuing urban greenery" research project, which has developed a digital assessment tool for the benefits of urban greenery. The "Integrated Water Concept for Leipzig and the Neighbouring Region" developed by the Office for Urban Parks and Bodies of Water Authority has been nominated for the nationwide "Blue Compass" climate adaptation prize organised by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) and the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) and is competing for the audience award.

## Transport

Leipzig is structurally very well integrated into the national and international transport networks: The city is directly connected to all neighbouring regional centres and metropolitan regions via the A 9, A 14 and A 38 motorways. These are in particular the greater Berlin area in the north, the Dresden area in the east, Halle (Saale) in the west and Erfurt in the south-west. In order to reduce air pollution, a clean air plan was developed, the central measure of which - the establishment of a low emission zone - has been in force since 2011. Within the low emission zone, only vehicles labelled with a green sticker (pollutant group 4) are allowed to drive on public roads.

Urban transport is characterised by a dense tram network with 13 lines on a total route of 218 km. There are also 61 bus routes, most of which operate in the city centre. The public transport tariff of the Central German Transport Association (MDV) applies not only in the city of Leipzig, but throughout Central Germany. Located directly in Leipzig city centre, Leipzig Central Station is traditionally one of the most important hubs in the German railway network. The ICE, IC, EC, CityNightLine and DB night train connections provide good and fast connections for long-distance transport. Direct ICE lines run from Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfurt, Erfurt, Munich, Nuremberg and Dresden to Leipzig every hour.

The rail network provides direct connections to the regional centres of Halle (Saale) and Chemnitz as well as numerous medium-sized centres (e.g. Bitterfeld, Wurzen, Altenburg). In the regional rail network,

the main and medium-sized centres such as Eilenburg, Delitzsch, Borna, Oschatz, Döbeln and Wurzen are connected to the Leipzig regional centre as a link to long-distance transport. In the long-distance bus network, various transport companies offer regular connections from Leipzig Central Station to destinations in Germany and abroad, including Berlin, Düsseldorf, Stuttgart, Munich, Prague and Budapest.

The growing population means more traffic and an increased need for mobility with the same amount of space. A particular challenge for transport and urban planning and the city's mobility service provider, the Leipzig public transport company (Leipzig public transport company), was to develop a mobility strategy that integrates Leipzig's environmental and sustainability goals. Leipzig's mobility should be safe, reliable, clean, affordable and accessible to all. In order to meet these challenges, several solutions were outlined on the basis of scientific methodology. Of the six scenarios, a concept was unanimously adopted in September 2018 that prioritises the equal expansion of cycling, walking and public transport. This sustainability scenario also gave rise to the Mobility Strategy 2030. The implementation of this strategy is ensured by a framework plan that is further developed and updated every two years. An integral part of the framework plan for implementing the Mobility Strategy 2030 is currently around 230 projects that are to be started or implemented as part of the 2025/2026 dual budget and contribute to achieving the defined goals (LINK).

Leipzig is nicknamed "Little Venice" due to its many waterways and around 300 bridges. The Karl Heine Canal in particular is a striking feature of the city: the three-kilometre-long artificial waterway runs along artistic building facades and under 15 bridges past sights, is popular for boat and canoe trips, paddling and strolling and connects the urban area with Leipzig's New Lakes landscape.

As part of the Mobility Strategy 2030, the Cycling Action Programme 2023/2024 was developed, which provides for structural measures to improve or construct cycle paths, mark cycle traffic facilities and set up cycle lanes. The aim is to close gaps in Leipzig's cycle network, increase the attractiveness of the infrastructure and provide better protection for children and senior citizens in particular. In addition, cycle paths in the countryside, for example along the Saale-Elster Canal or the Elster cycle path, are to be expanded.

With the D4 (Mittellandroute) and D11 (Leipzig-Hof) routes through Germany, Leipzig is well connected for inter-regional cycle traffic. From the Saxony Cycle Network (cycle traffic concept of the Free State of Saxony 2005), the Leipzig New Lakes Route also runs through Leipzig.

Due to its compact and mixed settlement structure, the generously dimensioned street spaces in the Wilhelminian-style residential areas and a well-developed car-free network of paths in the large new development areas, Leipzig has good starting conditions for pedestrian traffic and is one of the strongest pedestrian cities in a city comparison. The compact city centre with its car-free streets and passages is extremely pedestrian-friendly. According to the latest traffic survey conducted by TU Dresden in 2018, over 27% of all journeys in Leipzig are made exclusively on foot. The conceptual basis for the promotion of pedestrian traffic and the development of a city-wide footpath network is the pedestrian traffic development plan. The different requirements of streets, paths, squares, open spaces and green areas are evaluated using a differentiated importance plan and applied in planning. A plan of measures prioritises the fields of action and measures required for implementation for the time horizon up to 2030. A particular concern of the plan is to achieve a sense of urban mobility through promenades, an improved residential character of boulevards, passages and squares and improved safety, especially for children and senior citizens. To this end, various programmes have been drawn up, taking into account citizen participation processes.

Leipzig has an international commercial airport, Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2023, there was a passenger volume of around 2.09 million passengers at Leipzig/Halle Airport. With an increase of 35% compared to the previous year, the number of passengers is thus approaching pre-pandemic levels.

## Economy

In 2023, Leipzig was home to around 46,900 companies from a wide range of economic sectors such as manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, hospitality, information and communication, financial and insurance services or real estate and housing. Leipzig's economy is characterised by a correspondingly high level of sector diversity. Following losses in value creation in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Leipzig can look back on a successful business year in 2023. Despite several
City of Leipzig

O

crises, the trade fair city proved to be economically stable and resilient. Due to the war of aggression against Ukraine and the associated refugee movements, the population grew even faster than in previous years. Nevertheless, the unemployment rate rose only moderately. This is also due to the overall economic growth. For the second time in a row, Leipzig has set a new record for the number of companies with a total of 46,880 resident companies. This also applies to individual sectors such as manufacturing, business services, science, technology and IT as well as the creative sector. Other sectors, such as trade, achieved record figures in a multi-year comparison.

Following the economic and financial crisis of 2008/2009, there was positive economic development until 2019. In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic led to a drop in value added of just under 1.5 %. The service sector accounted for around 80 % of economic value added in 2020, while the manufacturing industry accounted for around 20 % and the construction industry for around 6 %. A recovery in the economic situation can be seen for 2021: compared to 2019 and 2020, value added has increased again, although this also has an impact on resource consumption and thus on GHG emissions, particularly in the manufacturing sector. However, it is not yet possible to determine from the figures available whether this trend has continued over the past two years against the backdrop of the war of aggression against Ukraine.

Close cooperation between the city administration, research and development institutions, the committed civilian population and a forward-looking business landscape can leverage a wide range of synergies in various economic sectors and strengthen the resilience of the entire Central German region in terms of regional value creation. Leipzig has for many years relied on a cluster strategy that promotes the greatest possible diversity of sectors and thus sustainable growth to diversify local economic strategies. In addition to traditional sectors that have established themselves over decades, there is a strong focus on innovation-driven sectors. This mix of innovation and tradition creates an ideal climate for successfully meeting the challenges of the global economy and continuing to grow. A particular concern is to strengthen the regional innovation potential of Leipzig as a business location. To this end, there is close co-operation in the form of projects between the city administration, research institutions such as Leipzig University or the Fraunhofer Institute and industry, in which civil society is directly or indirectly integrated through participation processes. Since the declaration of the climate emergency in 2019, the aim has also been to increasingly recognise the environment as an actor in its own right and to involve it in the development and promotion of innovations. For example, Leipzig municipal utilities is planning to expand the BioCity Campus Leipzig innovation centre with funding from the Free State of Saxony. With the help of an investment of around 15 million euros, around 10,000 square metres of rental, office and laboratory space as well as co-working and conference rooms for companies from the life sciences sector are being created on the old exhibition grounds. The city's economic development agency is thus paving the way for start-ups and the development of sustainable ideas. As a top life sciences cluster, Leipzig is a dynamic location for research and start-ups and offers efficient networks, fast approval procedures and a comprehensive research and transfer landscape. Another example of an innovation centre is Hall 7 on the site of the cotton mill. Hall 7 will be renovated by 2025 and transformed into an innovation centre, the Digital Hub, for start-ups, SMEs, researchers and users. The aim is to work together at this location on ideas for the city and with the city. The Digital Hub will focus on the development of new technologies and business areas in the fields of smart city, energy and e-health.

The north of Leipzig is home to a strategically important automotive industry for the whole of Europe. With the arrival of BMW and Porsche at the turn of the millennium, the Saxon metropolis became a centre for cutting-edge technology in automotive production. In modern and sustainable plants with flexible logistics, Porsche and the BMW Group produce innovative electric vehicles and other premium vehicles for export worldwide. Porsche, BMW and their suppliers now employ around 20,000 people in Leipzig. In the course of the transformation, Leipzig has also attracted other companies specialising in connected driving and battery production. With a focus on electromobility, Leipzig is becoming a pioneer in this field.

In future, the City of Leipzig will focus its cluster strategy more strongly on the Greentech, Health and Energy clusters, thereby laying the foundations for the transformation of Leipzig's economic structure.

## International network

Leipzig is present and engaged both in Europe and worldwide. Leipzig assumes holistic global responsibility under the motto "think globally, act locally". Sustainable urban development and mobility, climate protection, cultural exchange, education, inclusion and fair trade are the hallmarks of Leipzig's

activities with selected partner cities and institutions as part of the development policy agenda. The City of Leipzig is committed to the 2030 Agenda adopted by the United Nations with its 17 global sustainability goals.

As part of the City of Leipzig's membership in the European city network "Eurocities" and through numerous European policy activities and projects, e.g. in the Horizon 2020 project Office for City Planning RCS, the city administration contributes to the promotion of the European idea and cohesion. With its involvement, for example in the committees of the Association of German Cities or as a Mission City in European networks such as NetZeroCities, the city is committed to greater municipal room for manoeuvre and inclusive, sustainable and modern urban development. Furthermore, the City of Leipzig is member of the global Cities Coalition for Digital Rights (CC4DR). Various EU programmes such as Interreg, Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020 have resulted in relationships with European partners that continue even after the end of the project and have led to a constructive exchange, particularly with regard to energy policy, digitalisation, infrastructure and sustainable development.

,170 people from another EU country live in the city. As EU citizens, they can settle in Leipzig without restrictions, pursue a profession and, for example, vote in local and European elections. Around 4,800 foreign students make up 12% of the student body at Leipzig's universities (as of 2022). In the last funding period 2014-2020, projects totalling over 143 million euros were financed in Leipzig with the support of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

## Current climate neutrality target

The city administration is aware that the crucial window of opportunity to effectively prevent the physical tipping points of the climate system by massively reducing greenhouse gas emissions will close in the next few years. To this end, the City of Leipzig is pursuing the goal of climate-conscious urban development throughout the city.

Among other things, the city administration is to serve as a role model and operates in a climate-neutral manner in all areas of municipal self-government by 2035. With the Leipzig Group as a municipal holding company and city-owned group, the City of Leipzig has far-reaching control options. The operating business is divided into the business areas of energy and heat supply (Leipzig municipal utilities), mobility (Leipzig public transport company) and water (Leipziger Wasserwerke, Leipziger Sportbäder).

The municipal greenhouse gas balancing is carried out in accordance with the BISKO standard (Bilanzierungs Systematik Kommunal), which is applied uniformly throughout Germany and is based on the final energy-based territorial principle. The balance therefore includes a list of final energy consumption that occurs within the city area, an analysis of the life cycle of all energy sources (including extraction, conversion, transport and utilisation) and a derived greenhouse gas balance. Leipzig's balance sheet is therefore comparable with those of other German municipalities, although the actual input data collected must be taken into account in each case. All energy-related consumption in the private household, commercial and transport sectors in the Leipzig city area is recorded. Energy consumed outside the city limits (e.g. for consumer goods) and air travel cannot be recorded. In addition to carbon dioxide (CO2), the most emitted greenhouse gas, the two other most important greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are also analysed.

The municipal utilities are subject to European emissions trading and are nevertheless included in the City of Leipzig's reduction target, meaning that the purchase of certificates is not included in the city's overall balancing (energy generation is balanced according to energy source-specific emission factors). Larger private actors in the city of Leipzig are sometimes involved in emissions trading independently of the administration.

In accordance with the Paris Agreement on climate change, the City of Leipzig has set itself the goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2040 at the latest. Climate neutrality is defined as a residual emission value (without compensation measures) of 0.25 tonnes of CO2 equivalents per inhabitant (residual value of technically unavoidable emissions). This ambitious climate protection target is based on a socially just, economically resilient and ecologically sustainable vision of the future. The state of climate neutrality is achieved when the remaining amount of technically unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions is offset. The City of Leipzig is examining the extent to which offsetting measures can be utilised in the future.

Figure 3 Medium-Term Climate Targets

In accordance with the Council resolution on the climate emergency in 2019, the City of Leipzig is pursuing the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement at municipal level and applies the internationally applied CO2 budget approach as a basic principle. The calculation of Leipzig's remaining CO2 budget is therefore based on a target scenario of a possible limitation of global warming to 1.75 degrees with a probability of  $83\%$ .

The residual budget still available is determined using the methodology proposed in the 2020 Environmental Report of the German Advisory Council on the Environment (SRU), resulting in a final residual budget of 29.0 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents for the city of Leipzig from 2020.

The EU Mission "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" has given the City of Leipzig the opportunity to launch a city-wide climate protection program, aimed at purposefully pursuing the path to climate neutrality in a broad alliance of stakeholders. In addition to the already ongoing implementation of the Energy and Climate Protection Program (EKSP), external stakeholders from business, academia, and civil society are being involved in this process through a participatory approach.

By participating in the EU Mission, the Leipzig City Council and city administration have jointly committed to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (City Council Resolution VII-DS-06102). A significant intermediate goal is an  $80\%$  reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to the baseline year of 2019 (5.25 tons of CO2 equivalents per capita), assuming the optimal implementation of all measures.

Climate neutrality is defined as a gross emission value (without compensation) of 0.25 tons of CO2 equivalents per capita. As an interim target on the path to climate neutrality, the City of Leipzig, through the EKSP, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1.90 tons of CO2 equivalents per capita by 2030, which corresponds to a  $65\%$  reduction from the 2019 baseline.

With the help of the Climate City Contract, supported by political decisions at the state and federal levels, and with the promised measures (financial, regulatory, personnel) to reduce existing barriers, the achievement of the climate neutrality goal set by the City Council by 2040 is expected to accelerate. Based on the 2019 baseline, the goal is to close the emission gap from 1.9 tons per capita to 1.1 tons per capita by 2030, achieving a significant reduction of  $80\%$ .

In the first phase of the Climate City Contract, stakeholders from business and academia will be involved in the collective path towards climate neutrality. However, given the current conditions and the current level of external stakeholder integration, the ambitious goal of an  $80\%$  reduction is unlikely to be fully achieved for the time being, under the current conditions (first version of the CCC), we can realistically expect a  $65\%$  reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

The first phase of the Climate City Contract lays the foundation for a city-wide climate protection program. Processes and structures will be refined, and a more comprehensive monitoring system will be established.

In further expansion stages of the CCC, additional stakeholders will be integrated into the city-wide climate protection program over the next few years. Additional to this, further external support is needed to break down various existing barriers, accelerate the implementation of climate-protection measures, and bring the city closer to achieving climate neutrality under realistic assumptions.

# Integration of the CCC into existing urban strategies and development process

As described above, the City of Leipzig's climate protection goals reflect an integrated and long-term planning mentality. Overall, the City of Leipzig sees the EU mission as an opportunity to further strengthen its climate protection efforts and, in cooperation with external players from the private sector, research and development institutions and civil society organisations, to play a pioneering role in a competitive, vibrant and climate-neutral European Union. Leipzig also recognises the opportunities for the structural promotion of innovation and sustainable economic growth that arise from participation in the ambitious EU mission.

The cross-departmental development of the Leipzig Climate City Contract is being carried out in alignment with the following urban strategies and concepts with a technical climate protection focus (further strategies at national, state and local level are presented in detail in Chapter 2.2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment, which is why only the most important local strategies are named here):

The Leipzig Strategy 2035 sets out the direction in which Leipzig should develop over the next ten years and formulates guidelines for the city administration, municipal enterprises and holdings.

In addition to a spatially organised urban development strategy, it includes several specialist concepts that bring together the department-specific specialist plans and condense them into their essential, urban development-relevant statements.

**Energy and Climate Protection Programme (EKSP 2030):** The EKSP 2030 (adopted in 2022) sets out strategic goals, priorities and measures aimed at achieving climate neutrality by 2040 at the latest. It comprises a catalogue of over 150 specific measures and investments of over 300 million euros annually, which are regularly monitored and evaluated. The measures of the EKSP 2030 are integrated into the city's energy and climate policy framework and are regularly certified as part of the European Energy Award (eea Gold in 2021).

**Mobility Strategy 2030:** The Mobility Strategy 2030 is a comprehensive plan for the long-term sustainable development of Leipzig's transport system. It sets out goals and measures to promote climate-friendly and efficient mobility in the city. This includes strengthening local public transport, expanding cycle paths and pedestrian zones, reducing motorised private transport and its progressive electrification. The creation of the Mobility Strategy 2030 goes back to a city council resolution in 2015. At that time, the administration was commissioned to develop three different mobility scenarios for updating the local transport plan. In September 2018, the city council voted unanimously in favour of the sustainability scenario as the transport policy premise for the mobility strategy up to 2030.

**Municipal heat planning:** Municipal heat planning is a concept for the efficient use of heat energy in Leipzig with the aim of realising a climate-neutral heat supply by 2038. As part of its municipal services of general interest, it is the task of the City of Leipzig to look for solutions in the heating sector that ensure a sustainable, secure and affordable energy supply for the population. Municipal heating planning forms the strategic basis for initiating and implementing targeted measures for the decarbonisation of the heating system. It includes analysing the city's heating requirements, identifying potential energy savings and developing strategies for the use of renewable energies in the urban area and is currently being developed. It serves the city and its municipal companies, as well as the real estate industry, property owners, energy suppliers and the population as a guide for designing, managing and investing in the efficient expansion of heating and cooling networks, saving heating energy in neighbourhoods and thus gradually decarbonising the heating sector.

Other relevant strategies and policies are listed in Module A-2.

The Climate City Contract integrates existing catalogues of measures, including the EKSP 2030, the mobility strategy and the municipal heat planning. It is also supplemented by the commitments of Leipzig companies and organisations that contribute to achieving the climate neutrality targets with their own measures, which have not yet been included in the municipal strategies. In this way, the Climate City Contract can reduce the reduction gap between municipal programmes and the city-wide reduction target, as the following figure illustrates:

# Work process for the creation of the Leipzig Climate City Contract

The declaration of the climate emergency by Leipzig City Council in autumn 2019 created a strong mandate to strengthen municipal climate protection activities in terms of structure, personnel and funding. Under the leadership of the Sustainable Development and Climate Protection Department, cross-departmental processes and strategies that contribute significantly to the climate neutrality target have been driven forward since 2021.

The development of the first version of the Climate City Contract was organised in cooperation between the Office for Sustainable Development and Climate Protection and the Digital City Unit and was continuously expanded to include expertise from specialist departments and the Leipzig Group. Since 2023, a wide range of participation formats have been organised to identify effective climate protection measures to address over 100 stakeholders and institutions in the Leipzig city area in a target group- and sector-specific manner. Leipzig companies, research and development organisations as well as health and social institutions were invited to workshops and information events on the topic of climate neutrality and invited to contribute effective measures to the Leipzig Climate City Agreement.

At the beginning of 2024, the Mayor of Leipzig addressed the organisations involved to date, inviting them to sign the preamble to the Climate City Contract with a strong commitment to the city's climate protection goals and to work together with the city of Leipzig to achieve a climate-neutral Leipzig. Half of the stakeholders addressed, signed the Climate City Contract online and used an online tool to contribute individual and network-related measures to the process creating a strong alliance of stakeholders for effective climate protection in Leipzig. The measures submitted by the companies are summarised and evaluated in section 3.2.

Figure 5 Co-signatories of the Leipzig Climate City Contract (A detailed overview is included in the Core Contract).

In order to achieve the City of Leipzig's climate neutrality targets, the involvement and commitment of local companies and organisations as well as civil society will also be increasingly required in the future. The city administration is therefore already offering support activities for interested organisations and will continue to expand its commitment to involving companies and civil society in climate protection activities in the future.

The Leipzig Energy Efficiency and Climate Protection Network, which was launched in 2019 in cooperation with Leipzig municipal utilities and the Leipzig Chamber of Industry and Commerce, has since offered a practice-oriented platform for advising private stakeholders on effective climate protection measures and promoting sustainable business practices. In addition, the cross-industry cluster strategy of the Leipzig Economic Development Agency and the Energy and Environment Network are working to achieve overarching climate protection and sustainability goals with numerous workshops and specialist days.

In the future, the updating of the Leipzig Climate City Contract will be aligned with the processing cycles of the EKSP. The implementation of the EKSP is accompanied by the creation of a two-year implementation programme that is linked to the respective valid planning period of the municipal budget. The implementation programme is currently being drawn up for the period 2025/2026. Furthermore, the monitoring of the Climate City Contract is also linked to the evaluation of the EKSP (further information on the continuation of the process and monitoring can be found in chapters 4 and 5).

However, the comprehensive achievement of climate neutrality in Leipzig cannot be achieved through municipal measures in the Leipzig city area alone. In addition to the active cooperation of Leipzig, organisations and companies, which were activated as part of the process of drawing up the first version of the Climate City Agreement, financial and regulatory support is also needed from the state and federal levels to underpin the climate neutrality target in the federal administrative hierarchy (see also Chapters 2.3 and 4.1).

# GhG Emissions Baseline inventory

Municipal energy and GHG balances serve as an instrument for climate protection monitoring. On the one hand, to present the status quo of a municipality and thus to review the climate protection targets that have been set. On the other hand, to determine whether measures are actually having the effect attributed to them. Leipzig's energy and greenhouse gas balance is based on the final energy-based territorial principle. This means that it records energy consumption and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions in all climate-relevant areas and categorises them by consumer and energy source.

The assessment in Leipzig is carried out according to the BISKO standard, which is uniformly applied by municipalities and districts throughout Germany, and includes a list of the final energy consumption that occurs in the city area, an analysis of the life cycle of all energy sources (including extraction, conversion, transport and use) and a derived greenhouse gas balance. The calculation is carried out using the climate protection planner balancing tool developed by Klimabündnis e. V. and the IFEU Institute in accordance with the territorial principle.

Since the 2011 balance sheet year, the energy and greenhouse gas balances in Leipzig have been regularly updated based on a highly comparable database and published in annual implementation reports. This Climate City Contract is based on the base year 2019. The key results of the balance sheet are presented below.

The main indicator for the development and comparison of energy and greenhouse gas balances of different municipalities is the emissions in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  equivalents per capita. The following figure shows the development for the city of Leipzig in the period from 2011 to 2019. The indicator can be used to illustrate the influence of the energy mix and population development in comparison to absolute final energy consumption.

Figure 6 Development of greenhouse gas emissions in the city of Leipzig in t 2011 (without weather correction)
![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)
After an initial increase (2011 to 2013), the nine-year balance for the city of Leipzig shows a steady decline in emissions per inhabitant across all sectors. The decrease (both including and excluding the weather correction) over the total period of nine years is  $17.1\%$ .
City of Leipzig

#

In the business sector (including all municipal facilities, which account for around  $2\%$  of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the city of Leipzig), emissions fell more sharply by  $24.4\%$  than in the household  $(12.9\%)$  and transport  $(7.3\%)$  sectors. The total value for 2019 is 5.3 tonnes per inhabitant and the population increased by  $16.3\%$  in the period under review.

The industrial sector is particularly electricity-intensive and therefore accounts for the highest proportion of greenhouse gas emissions at  $31.2\%$ , followed by private households at  $28.2\%$ . In contrast, Leipzig's households account for  $34.3\%$  of final energy consumption, while industry only accounts for  $24.5\%$ . The main reasons for this are the energy source mix of the heat supply and the significantly higher electricity consumption in the industrial sector. The transport, trade, commerce and services and municipal buildings sectors show only slight differences in their respective shares.

One important reason why absolute CO2 emissions in Leipzig are not falling more sharply is the city's dynamic population growth (around 90,000 inhabitants between 2015 and 2024). It therefore makes sense to analyse this by looking at the annual per capita emissions. The number of public institutions, the size and facilities of the university, the number of municipal buildings or the development of commercial and industrial companies also influence the level of CO2 emissions and do not correlate directly with the influx of new citizens. In addition, cross-sector electrification is taking place, meaning that more facilities are equipped with electrical consumers. The increasing air conditioning of buildings and the rising level of digitalisation with decentralised IT devices continue to cause a slight increase in electricity consumption.

If more and more solar plants are built in Leipzig to cover solar power consumption, this is not directly reflected in the balance sheet. In the Bisko standard, according to which Leipzig prepares its balances, the emissions of electricity consumption are calculated using the emission factor of the overall German electricity mix (in order to avoid selective allocation). The expansion is therefore only reflected by means of the decreasing German electricity emission factor.

Figure 7 Shares of the various sectors in Leipzig in 2019 in final energy consumption (top) and GHG emissions (bottom)

|  Transport: | Energy consumption | 25,1%  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  GHG emissions: | 25,5%  |
|  Private households: | Energy consumption | 34,3%  |
|   |  GHG emissions | 31,2%  |
|  Municipal facilities: | 1,7% Energy consumption |   |
|   |  1,7% GHG emissions |   |
|  Industry: | Energy consumption | 24,5%  |
|   |  GHG emissions | 28,2%  |
|  Trade, commerce, services: | Energy consumption | 14,5%  |
|   |  GHG emissions | 13,4%  |

In addition to the balancing by sector, the breakdown by energy source provides important information for the strategic orientation of energy and climate protection work in the city. The main energy source groups are therefore shown below in terms of their share of final energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

The breakdown by energy source shows that fossil fuels, electricity and gas are the three main energy sources, accounting for just under  $77\%$  of final energy consumption and around  $83\%$  of GHG emissions. While gas has the highest share of consumption  $(31.2\%)$ , electricity consumption is responsible for more than a third of GHG emissions  $(34.2\%)$ . The advantages of renewable energy sources due to their low GHG emission factor become clear below.

Figure 8 Final energy consumption (top) and GHG emissions (bottom) by energy source group for 2019 (green: renewable, orange: fossil, blue: mix)

Greenhouse gas emissions in the city of Leipzig totalled almost 3 million tonnes of CO2 in 2019 of which around  $46\%$  was attributable to heat generation,  $31\%$  to electricity generation and the remaining  $23\%$  to the mobility sector. The sectoral distribution is broken down into final energy consumption and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions as shown below. For the Agricultural, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU) sector, there is no GHG accounting yet, but it is planned; and beyond individual measures, there is no overarching strategy that would address this sector. Therefore, no data can be presented here.

|  Level | Name & title | Description | Type (regulation/policy/strategy/action plan)  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  EU | European Green Deal | With the European Green Deal, the 27 EU member states want to become climate-neutral by 2050. As a first step, greenhouse gas emissions are to be reduced by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. In order to achieve this goal, the economy and society must be reorganised in many areas. | strategy  |
|  EU | New Leipzig Charter | The new Leipzig Charter, as a strategic framework for integrated and sustainable urban development geared towards the common good, anchors the basic principle of joint development of projects and programmes in a joint dialogue between all stakeholders. | strategy  |
|  national | Federal Climate Protection Act (KSG) | The Federal Climate Protection Act (KSG) is a German federal law designed to ensure the fulfilment of national climate protection targets and compliance with European targets. The Climate Protection Act enshrines the climate protection and sector targets set out in the Climate Protection Plan 2050 in law for the first time: greenhouse gas emissions are to be reduced by at least 65% below the comparable figure for 1990 by 2030 and by at least 88% by 2040. Net greenhouse gas neutrality is to be achieved by 2045. The law also sets annual reduction targets for the period up to 2040. For various sectors of the economy, maximum quantities of emissions are specified per year until 2030. | regulation  |
|  national | Heat Planning and Decarbonisation of Heating Networks Act (WPG) | The law lays the foundations for the introduction of binding and comprehensive heat planning in Germany. The aim is to convert the heat supply to greenhouse gas neutrality in order to help achieve the German government's climate protection targets by 2045. (Source: https://www.bmwsb.bund.de/SharedDocs/gesetzgebungsverfahren/Webs/BMWSB/DE/kommunale-e-waermeplanung.html). To this end, the WPG and the Building Energy Act are interlinked. | regulation  |
|  national | Federal subsidy for efficient heating networks (BEW) | The BEW promotes the construction of new heating grids with a high proportion of renewable energies and the decarbonisation of existing grids. The BEW creates incentives for heating network operators to invest in the construction of new heating networks with a high proportion of renewable energies and to decarbonise existing networks. The funding pursues a systemic approach that focuses on the heating network as a whole and aims to reliably support the time-consuming conversion of existing networks to | regulation  |

|   |  | renewable energies and waste heat and the construction of new networks that are predominantly powered by renewable energies. For example, Leipzig municipal utilities can receive subsidies if they set up a local heating network with a high proportion of renewable energies in a new development area or receive funding if they convert existing district heating networks to renewable energies and waste heat. |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  national | Renewable Energies Act (EEG) | The aim of the law is to implement the switch to renewable energies. The proportion of electricity generated from renewable energies is to be increased to at least 80 % of gross electricity consumption in Germany by 2030. The law regulates the electricity feed-in of grid operators and the associated remuneration. The law also regulates the proof of origin and regional certification of electricity in order to create transparency. Local authorities are to receive a financial contribution from the local plant operators; this contribution from the operators is voluntary, but the plant operators can claim reimbursement from the grid operators. In total, the financial contribution can amount to up to 0.2 cents/kilowatt hour. (Source: EEG 2023)

In addition, on 29 July 2022, the law stipulated that renewable energies are in the overriding public interest and serve public safety. This is crucial for increasing the pace of expansion. As a result, they will take precedence over other interests when weighing up decisions in future. This means that the speed of planning and approval procedures can be significantly increased. | regulation  |
|  national | Building Code | The building planning law regulated in the BauGB has far-reaching significance for the construction of renewable energy installations and their utilisation. It primarily regulates the permissibility of these systems under planning law, which is binding for the federal states and municipalities. For example, the BauGB allows areas to be defined in which certain renewable energy plants such as wind turbines, hydrogen plants or photovoltaic plants can be prioritised. To further accelerate/simplify expansion, solar installations were included in the scope of privileges under building law as of 1 January 2023 under certain conditions (localisation in 200 m strips along motorways and railway lines of the superordinate network as well as agricultural PV installations in a spatially functional connection with agricultural, forestry and horticultural operations). | regulation  |

## A-2.1: Description &amp; assessment of policies - Description and assessment of policies relevant to climate protection

### International Framework for action

Limiting the rise in the global mean temperature at an international level was quantified in the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. The temperature rise is to be limited to well below 2 °C, if possible to 1.5 °C. By ratifying the Paris Agreement, nations and international alliances have committed to aligning their energy and economic policies with this goal. In the UN climate conferences that followed Paris, implementation steps for the Paris Climate Agreement were developed. The current status of this process is represented by the final declaration of the UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai in December 2023. This was the first time that all member states were called upon to abandon the use of fossil fuels. At the same time, a tripling of renewable energy capacities and a doubling of energy efficiency were set as medium-term targets for 2030.

At European level, the EU Commission has presented a package of legislative projects to implement the European Green Deal, with concrete reduction targets for 2020, 2030 and the strategic vision of a climate-neutral Europe by 2050. The targets are formulated in line with the Paris resolutions and are intended to provide the guidelines for national action plans.

The starting point for formulating interim targets for climate neutrality by 2050 is the calculation of a remaining budget, which is distributed by sector. This results in ambitious emission reductions for the years 2030 to 2050 in order to limit the increase in the annual mean temperature. With the "Fit for 55" package of measures, the EU Commission is pursuing the concrete interim climate protection target of a 55 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 (compared to 1990).

On 7 October 2020, the European Parliament adopted the new EU Climate Change Act, which raises the reduction target for greenhouse gases from 40% to 60%, thereby exceeding the Commission's proposal of 55%. In addition to the stricter targets, the EU Climate Change Act includes mechanisms for budgeting emissions, a ban on subsidies for the use of fossil fuels and a right to climate protection.

### Climate protection at national and federal state level

As the economically strongest and most populous nation within the European Community, Germany has a special responsibility to make the internationally agreed targets a reality. Subsidies and restrictions at federal policy level have the greatest influence on the European Community's contribution to limiting the rise in global temperatures. The international trend from declarations of intent to concrete emissions targets is also continuing in Germany. The Federal Climate Protection Act (KSG) passed in December 2019 establishes a binding commitment to this overall target.

With the amendment of the German Climate Protection Act, passed by the German government in May 2021, these targets were tightened. With reference to the year 1990, the reduction target for greenhouse gas emissions is 65% for 2030, 88% for 2040 and Germany should be climate-neutral by 2045, i.e. have achieved a balance between emission sources and sinks.

The Federal Climate Protection Act creates better conditions for federal states and municipalities to formulate their own targets and legitimise specific measures. The current situation also demonstrates how global crises are closely interlinked and have a direct impact on the ground. This involves the need to phase out fossil fuels as quickly as possible and to completely switch from coal, oil and gas to renewable energies at all levels within two decades. And to shape the heating and transport transition in parallel with the energy transition.

In the Free State of Saxony, the Energy and Climate Programme Saxony 2021 (EKP) regulates the strategic direction of energy and climate policy up to 2030. However, the EKP does not define its
City of Leipzig
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
9

own reduction targets, either overall or per sector, but refers to the national targets from which a derivation for the Free State of Saxony is to take place.

According to the EKP, the state government assumes responsibility for ensuring that Saxony makes its contribution to limiting the increase in the global average temperature to 2 degrees. No statement is made on the 1.5 degree target set out in the Paris Agreement.

## Local Framework for action

Selected local strategies and concept papers of the City of Leipzig are analysed in more detail below with regard to their impact on the climate protection efforts of the City of Leipzig. Even h though the processes and strategies presented underpin the City of Leipzig's climate protection and climate neutrality efforts, at least some of them contain concrete reduction targets or development paths for GHG. Only the EKSP is an exception here.

As already explained, the action plan comprises a summary of selected measures from the various existing strategies and concepts (e.g. from the EKSP) for which a concrete greenhouse gas reduction can be expected. The local strategies mentioned are measure- and sector-oriented (e.g. mobility, energy and heat supply), but they do not contain any concrete GHG reduction pathways, but rather work with a qualitative catalogue of targets, such as achieving a modal split of 30:70 for eco-mobility in 2030.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that various decarbonisation strategies are being or have been developed for all key levers (electricity, heating, transport), each of which is underpinned by specific catalogues of measures. The development is always carried out within the administration in a cross-departmental process, often with the participation of the municipal companies of the Leipzig Group (municipal utilities, transport companies, waterworks, grid company) and together with civil society in the form of analogue and digital participation processes (see, for example, online participation in the pedestrian traffic development plan https://buergerbeteiligung.sachsen.de/portal/leipzig/beteiligung/themen/1029291).

## Climate adaptation

In addition to numerous concepts and action plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a comprehensive strategy for adapting to the changed climatic conditions (climate adaptation strategy) is being developed, which is expected to be available in 2025. With the Green Master Plan, the Heat Action Plan and the Urban Climate Analysis, there are already various strategic and measure-oriented concepts and, for example, the Green Roof Promotion Programme, concrete support for Leipzig's adaptation to the effects of climate change, which are not part of the Climate City Agreement.

The possibilities of digitalisation for accelerated planning and monitoring processes are also increasingly being used in the area of climate adaptation. For example, the Urban Green Eye project is developing a cloud-based portal for the Germany-wide collection of climate adaptation-relevant indicators for integration into municipal administration and planning processes, particularly for integrated urban development.

## Overarching strategies in the area of climate protection

Since 2009, the City of Leipzig has been participating in the multi-stage European Energy Award (EEA) award process for municipal commitment to energy efficiency and climate protection, in which an accredited auditor checks annually whether and to what extent the existing potential and the measures of the Energy and Climate Protection Programme have been implemented. In 2011, the City of Leipzig was honoured for the first time and has been entitled to bear the title "European Energy and Climate Protection Municipality" ever since. This is visible to the citizens of Leipzig on the blue city entrance signs, among other things.

Leipzig was already awarded Gold status in 2017, which is awarded for special achievements in municipal climate protection. Leipzig is thus one of an exclusive group of major cities that have successfully implemented the EEA targets. In 2021, the City of Leipzig was again honoured with the European Energy Award Gold. This external audit forms the basis for the certification and recognition of municipalities and takes place every four years.

In order to evaluate climate protection activities, a systematic analysis of energy consumption in the administration and municipal companies is carried out. This takes place

in interdisciplinary energy teams consisting of employees from relevant municipal departments, municipal companies and important institutions such as the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, Chamber of Crafts, University and HTWK Leipzig. The process supports the municipal administration in identifying strengths, weaknesses and potential for improvement in order to subsequently implement urgent energy efficiency and optimisation measures.

By declaring a state of climate emergency in October 2019, the City of Leipzig made a clear commitment to municipal responsibility for the scientific facts of anthropogenic and progressive climate change. Climate protection and adaptation to the consequences of climate change have been given a much higher priority in municipal action.

To intensify activities, an immediate action programme 2021/22 for climate protection with 24 measures was drawn up based on the existing Energy and Climate Protection Programme 2014-2020. As a result, the Office for Sustainable Development and Climate Protection was established as a central contact point for climate protection and sustainability processes in the City of Leipzig to accelerate the implementation process.

The Leipzig Strategy 2035 is the fundamental strategy paper for the future development of the city of Leipzig and formulates the key objective: Leipzig grows sustainably and serves the common good. Climate protection is firmly anchored in the specialised concepts of climate protection, technical infrastructure and sustainable mobility.

## Specialised concept for climate protection and technical infrastructure

To ensure that future generations will also be able to live in Leipzig as a city worth living in despite advancing climate change, far-reaching climate protection measures in the areas of heat and electricity supply, regional recycling management and resource conservation must be actively prioritised and promoted in municipal decision-making. Municipal heat planning and energy master planning for the city as a whole contribute to the networking of the energy system with the industrial, transport and building sectors. In order to ensure a stable energy supply and price against the backdrop of volatile global markets, renewable energies are being ambitiously expanded in the urban area and in co-operation with the region. This strengthens innovative approaches to regional economic resilience based on low-carbon technologies.

The specialised concept looks at urban energy development, the grid-based technical infrastructure and broadband supply. It takes a holistic approach to the energy transition, covering the areas of heating, electricity and mobility. The implementation of a holistic energy transition is pursued as a central field of action of the city administration in close cooperation with the municipal companies of the Leipziger Group with the following objectives of public services:

strategic integration of the topics of energy transition and climate protection into the ongoing processes of urban development and renewal,
initiating the heating transition in the building sector and establishing sustainable solutions for supply, disposal and financing,
development of a sustainable, resilient and intelligent supply and disposal structure by intelligently linking centralised and decentralised approaches
Extension of the use of digital applications and innovative technologies like sensor infrastructure and AI.

The City of Leipzig's energy and climate protection process for the coming years is based on the Energy and Climate Protection Programme 2030 (EKSP 2030), which was adopted by the City Council in autumn 2022. With the adoption of the Energy and Climate Protection Program 2030 (SECAP) the city of Leipzig continued to formalize its ambitious climate protection and sustainability goals and committed itself not only to a strategic programme, but also concrete implementation measures. Every two years, the implementation program will be updated, adapted to changing conditions, and further concretised to actually implement the goals of the SECAP and achieve climate neutrality no later than 2040.

In order to achieve significant GHG savings by 2030 and, at the same time, to shape a transformation to a sustainable city, the city of Leipzig has identified the following ten success factors, which will be

used to the future energy and climate protection work of the city up to the year 2030, continuously developing further measures and taking up impulses from the public and integrating them into the work. The success factors of the EKSP are compared with the Fields of Action of the Climate City Contract in the following process.

Sustainable mobility
Sustainable energy and heat supply
Sustainable land-use
Climate-friendly green-blue infrastructure
Climate-friendly urban district development
Climate-neutral city administration
Regional circular economy
Sustainable nutrition
Climate education
Climate protection initiative

The strategies and concepts aimed at the three main factors for Leipzig's climate neutrality (mobility, heat, electricity) are briefly outlined below.

## MOBILITY

The sustainable mobility concept pursues intelligent mobility on the basis of integrated transport planning. In Leipzig, as a "city of short distances" with a constantly growing volume of traffic, the concept focuses municipal action on strengthening the environmental network, efficient traffic management and a significant improvement in the quality of cycling, walking and local public transport services.

The aim is to increase the share of eco-mobility from 60 % of journeys made by Leipzig residents (modal split 2018) to 70 % by 2030 (of which 27 % on foot, 20 % by bike and 23 % by public transport). A further increase is aimed for in the long term. The following goals are formulated in the Sustainable Mobility Concept for dealing with increased traffic volumes through integrated transport planning and intelligent mobility:

Continue participation and communication with high quality and reach,
Promote environmentally friendly transport organisation by increasing the attractiveness and strengthening the environmental network,
Minimising the negative effects of traffic on people and the environment,
Strengthening Leipzig as a business location through intelligent and sustainable mobility,
Improving the quality of public spaces in the main thoroughfares,
Ensure multifunctional public space design and equal mobility opportunities.

## Mobility Strategy 2030

The aim of the sustainable mobility strategy is to remain a city of short journeys and to make mobility safe, accessible, clean and affordable for everyone. The mobility turnaround will be consistently strengthened through the promotion of eco-mobility and the area-appropriate distribution of transport space. On the one hand, settlement development and a mix of functions will contribute to reducing motorised private transport. On the other hand, the environmental alliance (public transport, cycling and walking, shared mobility) will be specifically promoted as the backbone of the mobility turnaround in order to facilitate the flow of commercial traffic that will continue to be necessary. The foreseeable technical changes in the context of e-mobility and autonomous driving, as well as the opportunities of intermodal change between different types of mobility, are to be utilised in a targeted manner for Leipzig.

The expansion of eco-mobility services increases the pressure on existing public spaces and requires a climate-adapted redistribution of traffic space and a reconsideration of stationary traffic. Intensive communication and participation are essential cornerstones here and must be incorporated into the coordination of parallel work processes (ecological transition, climate adaptation, etc.).

In a participatory process, a total of six scenarios were developed, each with a different focus. The Leipzig Citizens' Representation unanimously voted in favour of the sustainability scenario, which prioritises the equal expansion of cycling and pedestrian traffic along with public transportation (ÖPNV). Additionally, the aim of the measure is an implementation of traffic control measures

depending on the environmental pollution (among others NOx) at LSA and digital information media (LED boards). This makes it possible to defuse hotspots with increased environmental pollution and to liquefy traffic (delivery date: 2030)

Measures and focus topics are described in 10 fields of action, the individual measures of which are not part of the Climate City Contract.

The Cycling Development Plan 2030+ forms the basis for the city's planning of measures and resources to promote cycling and concretises the Mobility Strategy 2030 for the field of cycling.
City of Leipzig
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The attractiveness of cycling as a largely emission-free mode of transport is to be increased in order to raise the modal split to 23% cycling mode share and the cycling mode share for journeys to work to 35% by 2030.

The Cycling Development Plan 2030+ addresses both politics and administration for the provision of adequate infrastructure, but also takes the economy into account. In addition to establishing and maintaining a cycle infrastructure that meets requirements and is seamless, e.g. by increasing the number of public cycle parking facilities to 50 parking spaces per 1,000 inhabitants or increasing the number of public cargo bike parking spaces to 2 per 1,000 inhabitants by 2030, the plan also aims to increase the share of bicycles in commercial passenger transport and the use of cargo bikes in commercial transport.

The Cycling Development Plan 2030+ was created in a comprehensive participation process involving city council groups, the youth parliament, municipal advisory boards, associations and well over 4,000 citizens in the form of workshops, online participation and public discussion rounds.

# HEAT

The city of Leipzig is pursuing ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the heating sector, which is responsible for more than 57% of the final energy required. This area is to be made climate-neutral before the city as a whole and the electricity supply. Heat generation currently accounts for almost half of total emissions, which is why the heating sector can be seen as a key area on the road to climate neutrality. The main instrument for achieving the targets set is the creation of a municipal heating plan, the current framework of which is based on the Heating Planning Act (WPG), which came into force on 1 January 2024, and the amended Building Energy Act (GEG). Heat planning is divided into three main components/working steps:

Inventory analysis,
Potential analysis and
Scenario development.

The first two work modules have essentially already been completed. This showed that over 95% of the current useful heat requirement of approx. 4,600 GWh is generated from fossil fuels, primarily natural gas, heating oil and coal. The majority of this is generated in individual plants, but around a third is also generated in large-scale plants that supply the heat produced via a district heating network. The so-called transformation plan describes how the current heat generation in the district heating system can be replaced. To this end, technologies such as the utilisation of industrial waste heat, power-to-heat plants and the use of hydrogen were investigated and transferred into a decarbonisation strategy. There is also a wide range of potential for areas outside the district heating network, which was analysed as part of the heat planning. These include the potential of environmental heat and geothermal energy for use in heat pumps, as well as solar thermal energy and biomass.

When developing scenarios, the potential identified must be harmonised with the local conditions and weighing up criteria such as affordability and security of supply. It is already foreseeable that the expansion of the district heating supply in Leipzig is the decisive factor in transforming the existing system in the shortest possible time and at manageable prices. The advantage of district heating also lies in the fact that the high proportion of listed buildings in Leipzig can be supplied with this technology. In areas where district heating cannot be expanded for technical and economic reasons, heat pumps will dominate the system in future. In order for this to be technically successful, it is necessary to focus more on building refurbishment.

Overall, municipal heating planning is the City of Leipzig's action strategy for decarbonising the city's heating supply. Based on the identified potential, further sub-strategies must be developed, in particular for decentralised solutions for areas not supplied with district heating. In addition to evaluating the technical possibilities in these areas, the focus here is also on consulting and funding opportunities for property owners in these areas. The EnAct4CleanCities pilot city project is developing initial solutions for this in the period 2025-2026.

In addition, the expansion of district heating in the city will entail immense infrastructure measures. In particular, planning and coordination processes between the city administration and the Leipziger Group must be optimised and accelerated. Digital solutions, such as a digital energy twin, are also
City of Leipzig
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
4

being developed. In addition, obstacles in the expansion process are being discussed for a model expansion area, solutions are being developed and transferred to all subsequent areas in a streamlined process. Various working groups have been set up to tackle the complex problems involved in implementing heat planning, involving various specialist departments and Leipzig Group companies (in particular municipal utilities, waterworks, network operators). The focus here is on topics such as securing space for the heating transition, digital twins and addressing property owners.

At the same time, a structured decommissioning of the gas grid and a correlating expansion of the heat and electricity grids will be conceptualised (by the end of 2025). In addition, the possibility of converting parts of the existing gas network to a hydrogen supply is being examined.

Based on the results of the framework paper on the municipal heating plan, the following requirements arise:

City-wide refurbishment of the building envelope (and heating distribution) of properties with above-average energy requirements (worst-performing buildings) so that, on the one hand, the limited potential for utilising renewable energies is not used unnecessarily and, on the other, affordable (socially acceptable) energy costs are ensured
Area and building-dependent refurbishment of the building envelope and technology in preparation for the change in heating technology and the change in primary energy source, communication to tenants about the upcoming changes
Development of special neighbourhood and building-specific solutions in areas without a foreseeable district heating supply, with insufficient potential for supplying renewable energies and/or other challenges (e.g. high energy deficits).

To ensure the successful implementation of municipal heating planning, the process for creating the municipal heating plan is carried out transparently and external stakeholders are involved at an early stage. A project advisory board was therefore established in parallel to the existing project organisation. The role of the project advisory board is to provide technical advice to the project team during the development of the municipal heating plan and to assess the results in an integrative manner. The advisory board is made up of representatives from business (e.g. IHK, HWK), environmental/consumer protection, the housing industry and science as well as regional and state authorities.

## ELECTRICITY

With the help of the framework concept for the planning control of land requirements for the generation of renewable energies, or RaKo-FEE for short, the City of Leipzig has created an instrument to drive forward and steer the expansion of wind and solar energy and to reconcile it with municipal needs.

On the one hand, areas for the generation of solar and wind energy are identified. At the same time, a comparison is made with existing land requirements for future uses such as new housing construction, agricultural land, commercial use in harmony with green and open space utilisation and taking into account binding nature and species protection requirements. The framework concept contains a set of criteria with statements on the possible suitability or non-suitability of areas.

At the same time, the area targets for wind energy are being defined at regional level in the Regional Planning Association of Western Saxony on the basis of the Wind-an-Land Act. The City of Leipzig's land use concept is therefore being developed in close cooperation with the Leipzig-Western Saxony Regional Planning Association. The specifications in the RaKo-FEE form the basis for an accelerated expansion of solar and wind energy plants in the Leipzig urban area. At the same time, digital tools were used to sensitise and inform citizens in workshops on the topic of wind and solar expansion, as there are some considerable reservations among the population.

## WASTE

With the aim of realising the vision of zero waste - i.e. the preservation of all resources through responsible production, consumption, reuse and recovery of products, packaging and materials without incineration and without disposal on land, in water or in the air that endangers the environment or human health - in the city of Leipzig, the municipal cleaning entity is developing a city-wide zero waste strategy and concrete measures in a zero waste concept.
City of Leipzig
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
5

The core objectives of the Zero Waste Strategy for the City of Leipzig are:

Ensuring the long-term high level of separately collected residual waste
Reduce the volume of residual waste by 10 % to 125 kg/E*a by 2030 (2020 = 139 kg/E*a)
Reduce municipal waste by 10 % by 2030 to 330 kg/E*a (2020 = 367 kg/E*a)
Expansion of support services for local businesses to reduce residual waste (waste for disposal).

In the concept for implementing a zero waste strategy, Leipzig is relying on a high level of citizen participation and the involvement of multiple stakeholders, as success requires awareness throughout society and a change in consumer behaviour. The zero waste strategy will be developed by the end of 2024.

## Leipzig City Council as an organisation

Leipzig City Council is also looking at its own climate neutrality as an organisation.

For "Climate-neutral city administration 2035", a concept is to be created for the first time that places the city administration as an acting organisation at the centre of municipal climate protection activities and consequently deals with its underlying internal processes.

The concept highlights the areas of heat generation, electricity consumption (100% green electricity procurement and own consumption of self-generated electricity on municipal roof areas) in buildings and infrastructure, energy consumption in the vehicle fleet, business trips, waste disposal and procurement. The concept for the "Climate-neutral city administration 2035" will be finalised by 2025.

## Climate balance

The climate budget project aims to analyse the impact of future dual budgets on CO2 emissions. The initial aim is to determine the total amount of CO2 or CO2 equivalents emitted in a year as a result of the City of Leipzig's fulfilment of municipal tasks. The municipal costs are to be linked to the climate impact of municipal action. On this basis, instruments will be developed for managing sustainability in the coming years via the budget in order to achieve the goal of "climate neutrality of the administration in 2035".

## The Leipzig energy and building standard for municipal properties (energy guideline)

The City of Leipzig's energy guideline defines energy principles and targets as well as specific minimum requirements and standards for the planning, construction and operation of municipal buildings and facilities. It forms the basis for all architectural and engineering commissions and sets an annual target of modernising 2 - 3 % of the building stock. Based on the 2018 reference point, this means refurbishing around 30,000 m² - 45,000 m² of the municipal building stock each year and saving around 54% of GHG emissions from municipal buildings and properties by 2030 (target: 12,500 tonnes of residual CO2 emissions in 2030).

In addition to the requirements for the construction and modernisation of existing municipal buildings, a key prerequisite for achieving decarbonisation by 2035 is the conversion of the heating supply. Properties previously supplied with fossil fuels are to be converted on the basis of the municipal heating plan. Only district heating or fossil-free energy sources are to be used for new builds and complete modernisation. KfW energy efficiency class 40 is the target standard for new buildings. In the case of partial modernisation of buildings, the use of components that meet the KfW Efficiency Building 55 energy standard must be observed. From 2025, only sustainable buildings are to be constructed; a separate standard has been defined for this.

As part of the planning of new buildings and modernisations, the full use of roof surfaces for photovoltaic systems is planned. At the same time, all existing municipal buildings will be analysed for possible retrofitting with photovoltaics. The target is to install photovoltaic systems on municipal roofs in new and existing buildings totalling approx. 1,000 kWp to 1,500 kWp per year.

# Evaluation of policies at national and regional level

Laws and regulations set the legal framework for action. They influence the structures and scope within which people and organisations can act (e.g. opposing steering effects of regulatory instruments, financial incentive instruments). The organisational factors are decisive for the implementation efficiency of climate protection measures (e.g. sufficient availability of skilled workers, particularly in the area of construction and renovation).

In order to achieve the goal of climate neutrality, the organisational and financial power of the municipal level is not sufficient. Targeted support and customised framework conditions are therefore required in the multi-level federal system at EU, federal and state level in order to support cities in effective climate protection at municipal level. Many strategic objectives of energy and environmental policy are defined at EU level and transposed into national law. Clear, reliable regulations help national policy and therefore also the municipalities. In addition to the targets, various directives set the course for climate protection measures at local authority level. At present, the EU's climate policy framework is still relatively broad, which is why significantly more ambitious targets for the EU member states would lend more weight to the necessary climate protection.

The German government is pursuing a trio of targets consisting of greenhouse gas reduction, expansion of renewable energies and increased energy efficiency. A climate policy should strengthen the municipalities in their role as central organisers of the energy transition. The federal and state governments should support municipal decision-makers in consolidating the success of municipal climate protection measures. Political will and explicit support are needed at all political levels - without circumventing the principle of subsidiarity. This manifests itself not only in long-term goals, but also in concrete measures that set the framework for energy and climate policy.

Tax incentives for investments in energy efficiency and renewable energies create suitable economic incentives in conjunction with a more extensive design of the funding programmes. This will benefit energy efficiency in particular (e.g. building refurbishment), which has so far fallen well short of the targets. The promotion of renewable energies should be given a reliable long-term framework. At municipal level, simplification for self-consumers of solar power is a driver for the further expansion of solar energy. There is still a lot of potential here. The Renewable Energy Sources Act needs to be amended to abolish the burden on self-consumption of renewable electricity. A nationwide climate protection law is urgently needed that gives climate protection a clear legal position in all relevant fields of action and provides for interactions with existing laws in construction, urban development and spatial planning, the energy industry, mobility and agriculture.

The federal states can use state legislation to set requirements that have a direct impact on municipalities and cities. For example, they could define climate protection as an objective for municipalities within the framework of municipal ordinances (or municipal regulations) or as part of the Saxony climate protection programme. It would be possible and sensible to define climate protection at state level as a mandatory task (at least for precisely defined areas), but in the political discussion it is often pointed out that federal funding programmes (municipal guidelines) may then no longer be able to be used, as mandatory tasks may not be funded.

# Possibilities

The local climate targets can only be achieved through a coherent and supportive political framework. The City of Leipzig wants to ensure that all urban measures and programmes are in line with the overarching climate targets and are continuously adapted.

In principle, the Federal Environment Agency's assessment from 2022 can be shared here (sub-report "Klimaschutzpotenziale in Kommunen. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of greenhouse gas reduction potential in municipalities", p. 62/63):

Climate protection is currently not adequately taken into account in specialised legislation that addresses municipalities or is implemented locally by municipalities. Almost all climate action is based on voluntary local action and therefore has a lower priority than mandatory tasks. Climate protection and climate adaptation should also become mandatory municipal tasks. This means that there is a clear legislative line with specific tasks and targets to be fulfilled at municipal level with corresponding funding from the state and federal government.

Further challenges exist in the following areas:

The measures to activate private building owners have great potential for savings, for example with regard to building refurbishment or switching to district heating.
In practice, only a fraction of the GHG reduction opportunities are utilised, as these are exclusively voluntary activities. The responsibilities of local authorities in this area need to be expanded in order to improve access to the huge reduction potential in the building sector.
There is often a lack of framework conditions and knowledge for the legally compliant implementation of various measures.
In addition, local authorities often lack the human resources to cushion the additional personnel costs of enforcing stricter climate protection criteria in specialised legislation (e.g. according to Section 52 of the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (GEG), the obligation to use renewable energies in an existing public building).
There is still a lack of democratic commitment in the population towards climate neutrality endeavours, which must be countered with information and advice. Existing advisory structures (e.g. in advising building owners on the heat and energy transition) in the municipalities as competent local actors must be qualified and expanded for this purpose (funding gap).
In addition, the time frame in which cities have been pursuing climate protection must be taken into account: while western German cities can already look back on a decades-long tradition of municipal climate protection and can build on established civil society networks and commitment, this development has only been taking place in the eastern German states since 1990.

To address these challenges, the eight German mission cities have joined forces to form the stonGERcities network. The cities regularly exchange within the framework of this network. In addition, a steering committee was set up as a formal forum for dialogue between various interest groups. This consists of representatives from federal ministries (Federal Ministry of Housing, Urban Affairs and Development, Construction; Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Federal Ministry of Digital and Transport; Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection; and the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy).

Ministry of Finance), the Association of German Cities, the Federal Institute for Urban Development Research, two representatives of the mission cities and representatives of the state ministries. In this steering forum, the German mission cities are given the opportunity to address needs and obstacles and work on solutions.

# Explanations to table A2.1

The urban strategies and concepts described above result in sectoral emission reduction paths depending on European, national and regional framework conditions. For example, achieving the GHG reduction target of 70 % in the heating sector can only be realised with accelerated planning and approval processes for district-bound pipeline infrastructures for local and district heating networks. The financing and implementation deadlines for large-scale projects to integrate industrial waste heat and the economic availability of "green gases (e.g. hydrogen)" as climate-neutral energy sources for the city-wide heat supply are also decisive for achieving the ambitious reduction targets by 2030. On the consumption side, a massive increase in renovation rates in the private, municipal and commercial building sector to approx. 3 % per year is required in order to significantly reduce the overall urban heat demand through increased building energy efficiency. These secondary conditions result in residual emissions of 30 % (440,007 tonnes of CO2 in 2030) for 2030 in an optimistic scenario with regard to structural and technical implementation processes and the sufficient availability of climate-neutral energy sources (e.g. green hydrogen).

The level of emissions in the transport sector is also highly dependent on European and national requirements regarding the substitution of conventional drives and the targeted promotion of alternative drive models, particularly in the medium and lower price segments, as these make up a large proportion of the city's vehicle fleet. With regard to the modal shift to environmentally and climate-friendly modes of transport, the city of Leipzig has set itself ambitious targets with its sustainable mobility strategy and a modal split of 70/30, so that by 2030 over 2/3 of all urban journeys will be climate-neutral. The remaining individual journeys can be made climate-friendly by increasing the electrification rate of private motorised transport. To this end, the Leipzig Group is investing heavily in public and semi-public charging infrastructure and attractive conditions for climate-conscious mobility services in cooperation with the transport planning departments. This will enable a realistic reduction in emissions of around 60 % to be achieved by 2030. In contrast, the city of Leipzig has little influence on the fleet renewal of the remaining 30 % of private motorised traffic, but is leading the way by electrifying its own vehicle fleet.

In the area of waste, the zero waste concept is a strategy developed to ensure the preservation of all resources through cycle-orientated production, consumption, reuse and recovery of products, packaging and materials. The core objectives are to achieve a high proportion of separately collected residual waste in the long term and to reduce the volume of residual waste to 125 kg per inhabitant per year. In addition, municipal waste is to be reduced by 10 % to 330 kg/a by 2030 and advisory services for businesses are to be intensified. Valid statements on GHG reduction in the waste sector cannot be made on the basis of current data.

In recent years, a wide range of climate protection activities can be recognised in Leipzig's finely structured economy with its predominantly small and medium-sized enterprises, the dynamism of which can be further strengthened through intensive networking (Leipzig Energy Efficiency and Climate Protection Network, Energy &amp; Environment Network, Solar Booster, green industrial estates, etc.).

With the increasing use of renewable energies in industrial and production processes and significant efficiency gains, the diversity of private sector players in the Leipzig Climate City Contract results in a savings potential of 65 % in the commercial and industrial sector (IPPU) by 2030, which can also be exceeded with scaling effects.

# 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

## A-3.1: Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

Due to the complexity of the various systems and stakeholders involved in achieving climate neutrality, there are many potentials as well as challenges and barriers to achieving the goal of climate neutrality by 2030. European cities face similar challenges in this regard. These are explained below and placed in concrete relation to Leipzig's circumstances.

## Energy Systems

In order to achieve climate neutrality, the further development and expansion of the technical infrastructure for greenhouse gas reduction is essential. In the case of individual technologies and infrastructures, such as the use of green hydrogen, it is still unclear whether and in what way the solutions will be available and usable. Furthermore, it is unclear which opportunities they offer and what obstacles there are to their use. The existence and low-threshold accessibility of an infrastructure are the basic prerequisites for being able to identify and utilise solutions on the path to climate neutrality (e.g. existence of an infrastructure for the production and distribution of gases from renewable energies). The high investment costs of low- and zero-emission solutions are an obstacle to their widespread use.

### Possibilities:

A central component of Leipzig's climate neutrality target is the expansion of renewable energies with 400 MW of installed capacity by 2030. The use of local resources for solar, wind and other renewable energy projects plays a key role in this. As a municipal subsidiary, Leipzig has a direct influence on the city's energy supplier in the form of Leipziger Stadtwerke.
The strategic foundations for climate-neutral energy supply and disposal in Leipzig have been finalised or are in the process of being updated in the EKSP 2030
Leipzig municipal utilities, the main player and wholly owned subsidiary of the City of Leipzig, has developed a strategy for climate-neutral heat supply and has a highly efficient and hydrogen-ready energy generation infrastructure in the form of the Gas Power Plant South. This is accompanied by the expansion of solar thermal energy and decentralised CHP plants (https://zukunft-fernwaerme.de/).
Increased joint use and collection of data for digital twins by the city administration, utility companies and other municipal companies for accelerated and more efficient planning and approval processes (e.g. to prepare the implementation of municipal heat planning)

### Barriers:

The planning and approval procedures for renewable energy projects, such as the construction of wind turbines, solar power plants or power lines, are very complex and lengthy in Germany. These procedures include extensive environmental impact assessments, public participation and various coordination processes between the authorities involved. This can delay the realisation of projects by years.

Nature conservation and species protection laws such as the Federal Nature Conservation Act stipulate strict requirements that can restrict the construction of wind turbines in certain areas in order to protect flora and fauna. This applies in particular to the protection of bird and bat species that could be endangered by wind turbines.

Land availability and spatial planning: There are often conflicts regarding the use of land for renewable energy projects, particularly in densely populated areas. The regional development plans of the federal states determine which areas are available for renewable energies. The lack of suitable land or competition with other uses (e.g. agriculture, residential development) can hinder the implementation of the energy transition. Leipzig's urban area offers only limited suitable areas for the construction of large-scale renewable energy plants (ground-mounted PV and solar thermal systems)

as well as wind turbines due to distance regulations), which is why close cooperation with the surrounding area of Leipzig is essential

The expansion of the electricity grids, especially the transmission grids, is crucial for the transport of renewable electricity from the generation centres (e.g. wind farms in the north) to the consumption centres (e.g. in southern Germany). However, grid expansion is often delayed by lengthy approval procedures, regional resistance and legal objections. When planning large-scale renewable energy projects, the existing grid capacity and integration must always be taken into account, which may result in increased project costs

Legal disputes and citizen participation: Citizens' initiatives and environmental organisations have the opportunity to file lawsuits against planned projects, which can lead to further delays. While citizen participation is an important aspect of democracy, it can slow down the processes considerably if objections and legal disputes block the procedures. A lack of local acceptance can also hinder ambitious RE expansion. As part of a former lignite mining region, the infrastructure is heavily geared towards this energy source. A climate-neutral conversion requires massive investment.

Regulatory uncertainties: Uncertainty about future legislative changes and support programmes can deter investors from investing in renewable energies. Frequent changes to subsidy mechanisms such as the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) can impair planning certainty and lead to a decline in willingness to invest.

Federal and state competences: The responsibilities between the federal and state governments are often unclear, which can lead to coordination problems. Differing regulations and political priorities at federal and state level can make it difficult to implement the energy transition.

Together, these barriers contribute to the fact that the implementation of the energy transition is progressing more slowly than planned. Accelerating these processes requires legal adjustments, better coordination between levels and possibly also greater centralisation of certain decision-making processes.

Barriers to innovation and technology development: The rapid development of new technologies and their implementation on the market can be hindered by patent rights, regulatory uncertainties and competition with existing, established technologies. Companies may be reluctant to invest in innovative but unproven technologies. The technical availability of hydrogen as a fuel has not yet been determined.

Political and lobbying influences: The influence of lobby groups representing fossil fuels or energy-intensive industries can delay or water down political decisions in favour of the energy transition. These groups exert pressure on political decision-makers to protect their interests, which can lead to compromises or weakening of climate protection measures.

Energy market regulation and design: The current rules and structures of the energy market, such as the way prices are set or feed-in tariffs, can make it difficult to integrate renewable energies. A reform of the market rules is necessary to enable flexibility and promote renewable energies more strongly.

## Mobility and Transport

The mobility sector is responsible for a third of greenhouse gas emissions in Leipzig. However, a large-scale transformation is challenging and must be tackled at all levels of scale. Leipzig is already implementing various strategies and measures to promote eco-mobility (see chapter A2 current policies). The following opportunities and barriers exist on the path to climate-neutral mobility:

### Possibilities:

Leipzig has an extensive public transport network as well as numerous pilot projects for improved public transport services in peripheral areas and time zones (e.g. FLEXA). The Deutschlandticket also has a positive effect on the use of public transport
Numerous innovative mobility concepts are available (Leipzig Move for multimodal use of public transport, bike and car sharing, scooters &amp; taxis including ticketing), city-wide network of mobility stations, promotion of Park &amp; Ride / Bike &amp; Ride
City of Leipzig

Increased joint use and collection of data for digital twins by the city administration, utility companies and other municipal companies for accelerated and more efficient planning and approval processes (e.g. facilitating the planning of charging infrastructure expansion)
The climate-friendly mobility options of eco-mobility are flanked by a good walking and cycling infrastructure
A large part of the built environment dates back to times when motorised traffic was not yet widespread.

## Barriers:
The expansion and modernisation of transport infrastructure is associated with high investments and has correspondingly long planning, approval and implementation cycles. This also applies to electric vehicles and charging infrastructure
Limited long-term revenue opportunities for public transport, as no nationwide price increases are possible with the Deutschland-Ticket. Low awareness and acceptance of sustainable mobility options.
Strong cultural focus on motorised private transport
Path dependencies due to the long half-life of the built environment

## Waste and circular economy

Waste management plays a crucial role in achieving climate neutrality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions through waste minimisation, recycling and resource efficiency. The transition to a circular economy requires significant changes at all levels, from individual behaviour to city-wide infrastructure. Leipzig has already implemented various strategies and measures to promote waste reduction and improve recycling (see chapter A2 current policies). The following opportunities and obstacles are crucial on the road to a climate-neutral waste economy:

## Possibilities:
Existing recycling infrastructure: Leipzig has a well-established waste collection and recycling system that offers potential for further optimisation in order to increase recycling rates. The city has access to modern sorting facilities that are capable of efficiently processing different types of waste, which facilitates the recovery of valuable materials and helps to conserve resources.
Innovative circular economy projects: Leipzig has a large number of ongoing projects aimed at reducing waste and increasing resource efficiency. Examples include
The social departmentstore in Leipzig-Sellerhausen, where furniture, electrical appliances and other consumer goods can be purchased at favourable prices to low income households, which extends the life cycle of these products.
The promotion of "swap shops" and "swap shelves" that enable the exchange of used items and thus contribute to waste avoidance.
Repair workshops that enable citizens to repair defective everyday objects and make them functional again, such as the Makerspace in Leipzig-Gohils
The "Wiederschön" concept shop in Leipzig's Höfe am Brühl, which is run by the municipal waste company and operates entirely in the spirit of recycling.

Digital tools for waste management: Leipzig is researching the use of digital technologies, such as intelligent waste containers and the collection of data in real time, to improve the efficiency of waste management. These technologies can help to optimise waste collection routes, reduce operating costs and increase recycling rates. Pilot projects provide important insights and pave the way for wider implementation.

Awareness campaigns: The city has launched various awareness campaigns aimed at educating citizens about waste reduction and recycling. These campaigns promote a circular economy mindset and encourage residents to reduce, reuse and recycle waste. Among other things, the Alliance for Waste Prevention serves as an active network of numerous municipal associations, structures and initiatives with the aim of avoiding waste, using items for longer and promoting the use of reusable materials.

Exchange with other municipalities: Leipzig is committed to exchanging ideas with other cities and municipalities, particularly through networks such as the "Zero Waste Cities", in order to share best practices and work together on solutions for a low-waste future.

Utilising green waste to generate energy or storing carbon in biochar by means of pyrolysis is not yet common practice in Leipzig.

## Barriers

The transition to a circular economy requires considerable investment in infrastructure, e.g. in modern recycling facilities and advanced waste processing technologies. These investments are often associated with long planning, authorisation and implementation cycles.

**Cultural and behavioural barriers:** There is a lack of awareness and acceptance of circular economy principles in some parts of the population. Many residents are still accustomed to linear consumption patterns that prioritise disposal over reuse and recycling.

**Regulatory challenges:** Existing regulations do not fully support the transition to a circular economy. For example, there may be legal barriers to the use of certain recycled materials, or regulations may not incentivise companies to adopt circular practices.

**Planned obsolescence** is a challenge, a repair obligation or extension of the warranty requires federal German regulations.

**Conversion of waste and wastewater treatment for energy generation:** The construction of a fourth treatment stage in wastewater treatment plants in Leipzig is capital and space intensive. Similarly, the production of biogas from sewage sludge, the recovery of waste heat from wastewater, the utilisation of all areas in waste plants for renewable energies and the optimal energy-efficient design of power plants all require skilled workers, time resources and technology.

Leipzig has old landfill sites from the GDR era. It requires capacities to retrofit all of these with measures for landfill gas capture (CO2 and CH4).

## Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions: Food

Worldwide, food systems are responsible for approx. 25-35% of global THF emissions, which means they alone are expected to contribute to 0.6-09°C of global warming by 2100. The interplay of individual factors within food systems is complex and is based on value networks and supply chains that are interdependent at local, regional and international levels. The transformation of regional food systems cannot therefore take place without holistic approaches. For this reason, the city of Leipzig is developing a food strategy as part of a broad-based public participation process, which is intended to provide action goals and recommendations for measures to shape the local and regional food system in a sustainable and climate-neutral way, from the field to the plate.

## Possibilities:

Communal catering (e.g. in schools and municipal kindergartens) represents a major lever for municipal action to increase the proportion of bioregional food and at the same time make the corresponding products accessible to all social milieus
Stronger, predictable demand for organic products incentivises producers to switch to organic farming.
At the same time, the City of Leipzig has adopted a new leasing concept in which areas of land belonging to the City of Leipzig are structurally leased to organic farms with a regional marketing concept. Organic farming practices promote the build-up of organic carbon in the soil, sequestering relevant amounts of CO₂ in the land.
In combination with agroforestry systems, the potential for carbon sequestration in woody plants and the resilience of agricultural land to climate change impacts also increases.
The regional processing structures for primary agricultural products - especially in the organic sector - have great potential for expansion. Regional or local processing and service centres that supply out-of-home catering and food retailers can avoid transporting products for processing (e.g. grain to the mill) over many hundreds of kilometres and thus directly prevent greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, various projects have already emerged in this area, which need to be bundled across the board so that service providers, producers and customers can network better with smart logistics structures.

Through coordinated communication and education work and the establishment of producer-consumer networks, people in Leipzig can be made more aware of the value of bioregional products. At the same time, campaigns for the sustainable utilisation of leftovers and waste avoidance help to prevent food waste among end consumers and also in individual and communal catering.

## Barriers:

The solitary, direct tendering of organic and regional food in communal catering is not expedient, as "regional" is not a valid European tendering criterion and is also not firmly defined.
Simply replacing components or product groups with organic food would increase purchasing costs and therefore the end customer price for diners above a socially acceptable level. In addition, misallocations can occur because organically produced products are not (yet) available in the expected quantities regionally or even nationally, meaning that products with very long transport distances would be purchased.
The establishment and expansion of regional processing capacities is associated with high costs and must be linked to a corresponding increase in demand in order to maintain profitability for the companies. The same applies to organic certification on farms. In addition to the financial risk, there is sometimes a lack of willingness, expertise and trained staff.
Broad sections of the population - regardless of their socio-economic background - are less willing to spend more money on bioregional products following the stacking crises of recent years. A lack of information and misconceptions further reduce this willingness.

## Green Infrastructure: Green Areas

Green-blue infrastructures in urban areas play a crucial role in combating climate change and improving the quality of life. They involve the integration of water and vegetation areas into urban landscapes, which provides a variety of benefits, including regulating the urban climate, promoting biodiversity and improving air quality. These infrastructures can also help reduce flood risks and provide recreational and leisure opportunities for residents.

## Possibilities

The targeted creation of green spaces and water areas in urban areas can have a positive impact on the urban microclimate and reduce urban heat stress.
Green infrastructures contribute to the storage of carbon dioxide and thus make an important contribution to climate protection.
The city of Leipzig has already launched several initiatives to improve the green-blue infrastructure. These include the renaturalisation of the alluvial forest, the creation of floodplains and the promotion of community gardens in residential areas. These measures not only support climate adaptation, but also promote social interaction and residents' identification with their city.
Thanks to the numerous allotment garden sites in the city, Leipzig has a high level of biodiversity and space in some parts of the city centre

## Barriers

Financing such projects is often a challenge, as the costs for planning, realisation and maintenance can be considerable. Another obstacle is the availability of land in densely populated urban areas
In addition, there needs to be a change in awareness among citizens and decision-makers in order to recognise and promote the importance of green-blue infrastructures for urban development.
Due to the increasing heat stress, a loss of trees is to be feared

## Built environment

Leipzig will see further population growth in the coming years and expects over 25,000 additional residents by 2030. In order to respond to this development, the city is aiming to develop several new

neighbourhoods and upgrade existing ones. Large inner-city neighbourhoods are being planned, particularly on the former railway sites of the Eutritzscher Freiladebahnhof and the Bayerischer Bahnhof. A total of over 8,745 new flats have been approved (as of 2023). Significant increases in residential space are also planned in the coming years, even if no precise forecasts are possible given the current weak construction sector.

In the interests of sustainable growth, priority should be given to the development of areas in existing settlements that already have infrastructure by closing gaps between buildings, adding storeys, conversion, redensification, consolidation and reutilisation of converted areas or garage yards. The limits of inner-city development are particularly evident in inner-city neighbourhoods: Unsealed, publicly accessible green spaces on undeveloped plots make a significant contribution to the quality of the residential environment and play an important role in the microclimate (avoiding heat islands), biodiversity, rainwater infiltration and reducing air and noise pollution in the neighbourhoods.

With a portfolio of almost 36,700 flats (10.6% of flats throughout Leipzig), the municipal subsidiary Leipziger Wohnungsbaugesellschaft (municipal housing association (LWB)) fulfils a secure and socially responsible housing supply on behalf of the city. In doing so, LWB sets energy standards and integrates renewable energies in new buildings and refurbishments and contributes to the city's refurbishment target. In order to contribute to the city's climate neutrality target, LWB is guided by its sustainability scenario, which assumes an energy-efficient refurbishment rate of 2.1 per cent. The aim is to phase out all fossil-fuelled systems and switch to district heating/heat pumps. For buildings with gas systems with low energy efficiency standard (cat. F-H), the target standard is efficiency house standard EH 85 (61-73 kWh/m 2), for listed buildings EH 100/115 (74-86: 87-99 kWh/m 2), for buildings cat. D (100-130 kWh/m2), E (130-160 kWh/m2) the target is EH 70 (48-60 kWh/m2), for buildings from EH 115 the target is EH 70 + conversion of fossil fuels to heat pumps. This means an required investment (including indexed cost extrapolation) of EUR 635 million. At the same time, the focus is on developing a green and intergenerationally fair public space in housing areas. This includes planting, mobility stations (car sharing, e-bikes), parcel boxes and rainwater retention and infiltration on the properties and districts. 14 % of the housing stock is owned by local housing associations (e.g. Genossenschaften) that also have high interest in the climate neutral transition of their building stock.

Leipzig has formulated the goal of net-zero sealing by 2030 as the basis for an urban development strategy that takes into account both the need to create affordable housing and the sustainable protection and unsealing of open spaces.

## Possibilities:

Increasing energy efficiency, both in existing and new residential buildings
Revitalisation of open and brownfield sites as part of dual inner development to limit land take
Innovative solutions for climate change adaptation (sponge city, heat planning)
Adaptation of existing buildings (energy-efficient refurbishment, façade greening)
Pilot projects as the Horizon 2020 project SPARCS on the development of Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) gave valuable insights in the prerequisites and feasibility of the PED concept in social housing and monument protected areas. Learnings from the project and esp. replicating developed solutions help to speed up the transition of the building stock. LWB and its energy management subsidiary WSL have developed a dynamic heat control within SPARCS that helps to reduce energy amount for heating by 10% and that is now successively being rolled out to the LWB building stock. (www.sparcs.info, www.sparcs-leipzig.info)
Dedicated information and consultation campaigns addressing private house owners (e.g. single home owners, owner occupiers) can support the transformation of this building stock and increase refurbishment rates. Digital tools can be used to reach out to this target groups as it is done in the Mission Cities pilot project EnAct4CleanCities.

## Barriers:

Ensure affordability of housing, although financing measures is difficult for owners with low incomes
High costs for new construction and refurbishment measures (integration of new technologies into "old" building stock is expensive)
City of Leipzig
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Skilled labour shortage in the skilled trades for the implementation of new construction and renovation measures
Heterogeneous ownership structures in the existing neighbourhoods (very small-scale, many of whom do not live in Leipzig and are therefore difficult to reach)
20 % of Leipzig's building stock is under monument protection law. The refurbishment of those buildings is often more difficult and expensive compared to other building stocks.
Continued growth in housing demand leads to further land sealing and resource consumption for new housing construction

## Communication and Cooperation

Knowledge of climate-friendly solutions and behaviours as well as the experience of self-efficacy are prerequisites for individual and organisational learning (e.g. correct heating and ventilation). The factors described here influence the development of climate-friendly behavioural routines and are therefore a key driver of social transformation.

Climate-friendly actions are determined on the one hand by values (long-term) and on the other by attitudes (short-term). These are the prerequisite for communication and cooperation; and are in turn influenced by these. Values and attitudes influence personal actions on an individual level and the actions of groups and organisations on a societal level (e.g. with regard to consumption patterns).

Public sentiment could change if the population had to accept noticeable restrictions or pay higher levies and taxes to finance climate protection measures. Compensatory measures must therefore be found for socially disadvantaged population groups. Climate protection should be organised in a socially just and participatory manner.

## Possibilities:

Educational initiatives are of great importance to strengthen the community's commitment to climate protection. By promoting climate education, citizens can be better informed about the causes and consequences of climate change and motivated to act sustainably.
Educational programmes in schools and public institutions raise awareness of the necessity and possibilities of climate protection.
Programmes in daycare centres reach both children and their parents.
Leipzig has an active citizenry and a wide-ranging landscape of organisations that proactively provide support (see chapter on stakeholders).
The City of Leipzig is also increasingly communicating digitally with its citizens on climate protection issues, e.g. via the Leipzig app.

## Barriers:

Climate protection is part of populist debates in local, state and federal elections, which makes it difficult to conduct an objective debate.
It requires a large portfolio of communication measures that are strongly customised to the individual target groups. The development and implementation of these measures is sometimes associated with great effort and costs

## Work and Enterprises

Long-term economic activity is a basic prerequisite for achieving climate neutrality. The economic framework conditions influence investment decisions in technologies and infrastructures (e.g. profitability gaps when investing in refurbishment measures or renewable energies). Tariffs and subsidies (e.g. CO2 pricing) have a steering effect on climate-relevant decisions. The preservation of dignity and free personal development are basic prerequisites for social acceptance of the necessary transformation (e.g. dealing with income sufficiency). The expansion of climate-neutral technologies and infrastructures requires massive investment from the private and public sectors. If it is not possible to secure the investments required to achieve the climate targets through grants and loans, their implementation will be jeopardised. Many of the planned climate protection measures are therefore heavily dependent on financial support through appropriate project funding at regional, national and international level. Due to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine and international market instability, certain sectors are currently experiencing extreme price increases and fuelling inflation. Such external geopolitical effects may jeopardise the economic implementation of
City of Leipzig
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

planned climate protection measures. On the other hand, high reference prices for (fossil) energy increase the economic viability of renewable energy technologies. This can be supported, for example, by appropriate CO2 prices that reflect the externalised costs of fossil fuels.

## Possibilities:

The mobilisation of private investment is essential for the long-term development of sustainable infrastructure, particularly in the transport and energy sectors. Public-private partnerships are one way of generating additional funding and realising innovative projects. These co-operations contribute to the financing and implementation of climate protection measures and at the same time promote economic growth and future-oriented innovations.
Windows of opportunity created by high reference prices due to external effects should be utilised
High carbon prices and a climate fee for all would ensure that higher costs for poorer people are offset, as they usually have a smaller carbon footprint and would get back more than they would pay in addition
The shortage of skilled labour in the building market, different crafts but in the planning/consulting and public sector could be counteracted by forward-looking training support
Through the participation process of the Climate City Contract and the Leipzig Energy Efficiency Network, a cross-sector network is being established that is to be expanded for further cooperation, knowledge exchange, etc. It is to be expanded.
Exploring the benefits go the use of climate investments and creating capacities in this regard will become crucial for companies in the future.
The Office for Economic Development of the City of Leipzig already offers a wide range of support options for Leipzig companies, e.g. support for the procurement of cargo bikes, the solar scout and increased subsidies for the implementation of climate efficiency measures.
In the coming years, Leipzig's economic development strategy will increasingly focus on the clusters greentech, health and energy.
Separate climate neutrality concepts are being developed for Leipzig's existing industrial estates. The Hupffeld site in Leipzig-Leutzsch is leading the way here.

## Barriers

Shortage of skilled labour and, in some cases, a lack of knowledge, including in the skilled trades, for the installation and maintenance of RE technologies.
Non-economic viability of RE technologies and long refinancing periods make investment decisions by companies more difficult.
Complex regulatory and subsidy landscape affected by frequent changes, e.g. for the installation of renewable energy systems, high bureaucratic costs

## Internal Organisation

As part of the concept for climate-neutral administration in 2035, a wide range of employee awareness-raising measures are being implemented (Eco:Check as part of the Smart City Challenge, energy-saving challenges, participation in city cycling and job cycling campaigns). Innovation projects on specific energy and climate-related issues are being introduced to the municipal workforce in order to effectively reduce the GHG footprint of employees (accelerated expansion of the e-charging infrastructure for cars and bicycles and cargo bikes, digital meter reading and monitoring processes as part of municipal energy management).

In a preliminary study on Leipzig's climate budget, the following challenges in integrating the topics of climate protection and climate adaptation were identified by the specialised departments:

## Possibilities:

The concept for climate-neutral administration is a comprehensive programme of measures for Leipzig's city administration.
A climate protection manager in the central Office for Digitalisation and Organisation supports the various measures and networks between specialist departments and other stakeholders.
City of Leipzig

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

The aim of the sustainable and climate-neutral municipal budget project is to analyse the impact of the current 2023/24 double budget on CO2 emissions. The initial aim is to determine the total amount of CO2 equivalents emitted in a year as a result of the City of Leipzig's municipal task fulfilment. On the basis of this initial balance sheet, instruments are to be developed as to how the issues of climate protection and sustainability can be managed via the budget in the following years in order to achieve the strategic goals.

# Barriers:

Lack of standardisation or conflicting objectives between internal city strategies in climate protection and climate adaptation (e.g. monument protection, land use planning for renewable energies)
Bureaucratic hurdles and limited personnel and financial capacities for process coordination/control and implementation of measures
Insufficient legal freedom of action or abstract regulations
Outdated data basis for transparent decision-making and monitoring

# 3 Part B - Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

# 3.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

The framework for Leipzig's climate neutrality strategy is provided by the Energy and Climate Protection Programme (EKSP). Biennial implementation programmes are drawn up for this, with which current measures are developed in each case.

The Energy and Climate Protection Programme is divided into ten "success factors", i.e. key strategic areas (KSAs). In the logic of the EKSP, the Climate City Contract is a building block of the Climate Protection Initiative key strategic area and helps to close the gap to climate neutrality by 2030 by activating companies and civil society.

The following page shows a roadmap of Leipzig's climate neutrality strategy. As the overview originates from preliminary work, it is organised according to the structure of the EKSP by key areas (shown on the right).

For a consistent presentation in the Climate City Contract, it was decided to assign the success factors of the EKSP to the fields of action of the Climate City Contract, as this makes it easier to structure the indicators and impact pathways. This is done as follows:

The impact pathways are organised according to the specified fields of action. Chapter 3.2 shows which measures are assigned to these. Whether the measures achieve the desired impact is measured using indicators, which are presented in section 3.3.

The defined impact pathways can be summarized as followed: In the energy system, the development of renewable energy generation capacities is being promoted in various ways. By providing information on whether the expansion is already achieving the set targets, the aim is to encourage subsequent adjustments. Companies are also involved in this area. Heat planning and the expansion of district heating are working towards climate-neutral heat.

In the transport sector, the Mobility Strategy 2030 is being implemented with many different measures. Companies are getting involved here by improving opportunities for their employees, which also promotes new standards in the corporate context.

The circular economy and waste are topics that have received less attention to date. The zero-waste strategy creates a good basis. There is still potential to further systematise the handling of waste and wastewater, to use all energy sources and to reduce emissions. There is also still potential in the economy on the way to a circular economy.

Leipzig is well positioned in the area of green-blue infrastructure insofar as it is recognised and dealt with as a separate topic area. Many co-benefits can be expected here, including in the area of mandatory tasks. Companies are also planning a number of measures in this area. The quantification of the contribution to reducing emissions is still pending, but is planned.

In the area of buildings and the built environment, a department is being formed within the responsible office that will increasingly drive forward the necessary change. Various projects have recently been acquired to promote the refurbishment and expansion of renewable energies.

The CCC process plays a major role in the area of engagement/miscellaneous, offering opportunities for systematisation and for working with companies and civil society. The commitment of companies is central here, which is networked with the urban climate agreement process.

As mentioned, the EKSP sets the framework for all climate neutrality activities of Leipzig and includes 10 success factors. Each of the success factors is linked to concrete actions or strategies. For each of the pathways listed above, municipal strategies and concepts are in place.

There are shared responsibilities for the implementation of the different strategies among the city departments. For some of the pathways an active civil society and citizens initiatives are already in place. As for local businesses the Office for economic development offers different measures and support schemes for them to encourage climate friendly businesses (e.g. in RES installation on company buildings, climate friendly transport etc.).

Yet, for some of the envisaged pathways the city itself can't set all necessary framework conditions to reach climate neutrality so there are still gaps in the pathway. Some gaps are due to a lack of a federal strategy (such as the strategy for mobility decarbonisation) or unfavourable federal conditions, which make it impossible to trigger a decarbonisation at local level (such as missing representation of harmfulness of GHG in pricing) (see also chapter A-3 on barriers and opportunities). Other gaps are on municipal level and concern either clarity regarding the sufficiency of the currently implemented measures or funding and implementation of planned measures.

It must be noted that a full decarbonisation of an economy in a system of dependent, nested federal levels was never done before. Thus scopes of influence are not structured according to emission sources; neither are information sources needed for appropriate balances. As the federal levels depend upon each other, if higher level conditions are unfavourable, definitive answers regarding full decarbonisation from a lower level would in most cases be unsound. Hence, in each of the action fields, the municipal actors do their very best to advance measures, elaborate clarity regarding impacts and

strategy, make funding available for advancing more measures, and lobby for conditions conducive for fossil fuel phase out. Impact pathways were developed for six action fields:

## Energy systems - Sustainable Energy and heat supply (KSA 2)

For decarbonising the municipal heating provision, currently a planning concept is being developed. This will probably clarify how to decarbonise district heating, which districts will be fed by district heating, for which this is unsure, and which will definitely not be fed by long-distance district heating ("decentral supply"). In some cases, for decentral supply areas, island district heating might be possible.

This heating concept needs to be finalised and implemented, which includes the connection of further districts to district heating, and decarbonised district heating supply, as well as concepts for decentral supply areas. This addresses the availability of technology.

Regarding electricity, once the heating planning is done, and a federal strategy for transport decarbonisation given, a substantial strategy for the extension of the electricity grid can be prepared. If some of the latter remain missing, a more vague strategy can be prepared.

Regarding the extension of renewable energy provision, many measures already support the extension of renewable energy in the municipal area. A dashboard shall identify whether the planned measures are sufficient to meet the demand by 2030. This addresses insufficient speed and clarity.

Aconcept is prepared to identify suitable areas; to alleviate conflicts in space.

An option would be to start planning the electricity grid extension already now. However, heating planning is legally required now.

## Mobility &amp; transport - Sustainable mobility (KSA 1)

The mobility strategy 2030 is being implemented. Developing a municipal decarbonisation strategy for mobility is difficult, as mobility relies so heavily on federal conditions and standards.

An additional concept needs to clarify whether these measures are sufficient for decarbonisation, given favourable federal conditions; or whether further measures need to be developed. This includes defining the Leipzig strategy for supporting alternative drives, and a long term vision for parking (planned). This concept also needs to define sources of resource for measures.

Campaigns address the cultural hegemony of motorised individual mobility.

Long term planning with active transport in mind shall improve traffic conditions for active transport and lay ground for many years. The street works needed for district heating extension here represent an opportunity to adapt the city to active transport needs.

To deal effectively with reluctance in the population, the main sources of reluctance against climate friendly mobility should be investigated. From this analysis, it can be defined which measures best support acceptance.

Options: prepare district mobility concepts instead. Arguments against it: municipal strategy in place; lack of resources

## Waste &amp; circular economy - Regional circular economy (KSA 7)

There are many measures already in place that help to reduce waste and disseminate knowledge about repair and long-term use. This includes local shelves for the exchange of unused things, repair shops, and second hand shops for clothes and material. Many of them were developed by the civil society. Hence, adequate appreciation should be shown to the initiators and participants.

The local waste treatment company developed a zero-waste strategy. It is understood as zero wastage of resources, not as zero garbage. Possibly, this should be sharpened to get closer to the latter. Furthermore, currently it is an idea collection. Concrete measures should be chosen according to their efficiency, and their ability to address barriers such as normality of linear usage.

Currently, waste treatment and circular economy is not a planning and implementation priority. It should be addressed in the subsequent EKSP implementation plan, to adress the capacity issues.

# Green infrastructure &amp; nature-based solutions - Sustainable land-use (KSA 3), Climate-friendly green-blue infrastructure (KSA 4), Sustainable nutrition (KSA 8)

Guidelines for sustainable land use are being developed to help to protect green spaces and infrastructures. As they help to balance building and open spaces, they also touch the field of built environment.

There are measures in place for improving the green infrastructure of the city, such as the street tree programme or the green roof programme. And when streets will be opened for extending the district heating, they shall be rebuilt with green infrastructure and active transport in place. Standards for street designs could further advance this. Additionally, green infrastructure suffers from the effects of climate change already, so the measures first help to maintain the status quo before being able to deliver extra services. Supporting initiatives such as "Leipzig giesst", or allowing citizens to car for street tree foots, addresses this. Nature based solutions are mainly in place for climate adaptation (heat protection; sponge city planning). Their potential as CO2 sinks is not yet quantified and fully exploited in Leipzig. Creating a balance is addressed in the new EKSP implementation programme.

This field also includes measures for a climate friendly food system; as this mainly means localised agriculture. As the sustainable land use practices, sustainable nutrition practices help to protect and improve local green spaces. Yet again, many measures were developed by the civil society and should be met with adequate appreciation and support. Support for common use of tools and of production and delivery spaces addresses the expensiveness of regional products.

# Built environment - Climate-friendly urban district development (KSA 5)

Regarding the built environment, a concept for climate friendly district development has been developed. Now it has to be implemented with ambition. Building up personal structures for this is ongoing. As one substantial federal funding source has been stopped last year, motivating for more renovation and updating building technology is challenging; as well as addressing sufficient numbers of districts.

This field is currently quite volatile, as the mandatory municipal heating planning caused a increasing the district heating, which results in major street renewals in the chosen district heating extension districts. Additionally, a new projects seek to complement these inner city developments with support for more peripheral areas with reducing heat demand and replacing the rest by renewable sources. This is one tool to address the availability of affordable living space. Support for balcony PV for tenants further supports tenants.

A challenge lies in Leipzig's history: after the fall of the wall, many of its old buildings were sold - mostly to owners from the west. Still today, almost 90% of Leipzig's inhabitants are tenants. Thus, measures both have to focus on tenants as well as on owners which do not reside within the region. This is known to be more challenging than dealing with home owners. In one project, new measures to address different target groups will be developed. Another project addresses the harmonisation of renewable planning with heritage protection demands.

# Other/Engagement - Climate-neutral city administration (KSA 6), Climate education (KSA 9), Climate protection initiative (KSA 10) - CCC

The last pathway deals with how to mobilise people for the transformation towards a climate neutral society. Leipzig has decided to split it into three sub-strands: a) the climate neutrality of the city administration, b) climate education, and a wider c) climate protection initiative.

The climate neutrality of the administration is implemented by the EKSP and a climate protection manager for it, plus a manager for climate neutral city buildings operation. Measures are well underway. Different projects aim at harmonising target conflicts by developing guidelines. Climate protection managers do their best to steer processes and implement measures. An internal balance addresses the issue of lacking data.

Regarding climate education, there is potential to further define the matter. In schools, the leeway is limited as the curriculum (set by the "Länder"; subfederal level) is demanding. The subject is mostly too

complex for kindergartens; although basis for climate friendly habits can be formed. 50/50 is an established format for involving schools and kindergartens.

It should be investigated whether cooperations with the universities and professional schools can be assumed. Additionally, should be developed how to involve the adult education centre (VHS) to further address the variety of target groups. Addressing companies with the help of the Also the CCC is one step addressing one specific target group.

The climate protection initiative is realised by the CCC. Currently, 50 companies have pledged climate protection measures. 20 take part in a local peer learning energy efficiency and climate action network. The "Grannies for future" initiative carries out civil society engagement actions. How to mainstream climate action among all different citizen groups should be further developed in the future EKSP implementation plan.

That climate protection is part of populist debates is currently not yet actively addressed. This should be pondered in future EKSP implementation programmes.

Insecurities regarding renewable extension and its profitability will be addressed with a new project that will provide information for different target groups.

Options: working with the civil society more strongly now. Arguments against it: concentration on current energy measures; lack of resources, limited immediate emission efficiency

# 1 Energy-efficient and environmentally friendly urban lighting

|  Action outline | Action name | Use of energy-saving lighting and Energy-efficient and environmentally friendly urban lighting  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Action type | Municipal buildings and facilities  |
|   |  Action description | Electricity consumption in municipal buildings is significantly influenced by lighting (approx. 50%). Replacing and modernising lighting is therefore an important lever for reducing electricity consumption.
The gradual use of LED light sources and intelligent lighting control in all areas of buildings is the focus of implementation.
Street lighting in particular accounts for a significant proportion of electricity consumption in the municipal area, at 40% and around 20 GWh/year (including traffic lights), with correspondingly high electricity costs. With the lighting strategy and the lighting master plan, the necessary strategic instruments and foundations are already in place for the gradual implementation of sustainable and energy-efficient urban lighting in Leipzig. Activities need to be intensified with regard to climate protection and a climate-neutral city administration by 2035. Further financial and human resources will be made available for this purpose. Efficient urban lighting will also result in a noticeable reduction in the budget in the medium term. The use of LED lighting and intelligent, demand-oriented lighting are important aspects for the future.  |

The City of Leipzig wishes to fulfil its responsibility by enabling and promoting the development of such facilities, preferably on municipal land. Due to the limited area potential for wind energy plants in urban areas, solar plants are of particular importance. The construction of generation capacity outside the city by Leipzig Group companies should also be encouraged.

In addition to the construction of large-scale plants, larger roof systems (e.g. on hall buildings) and combined use on agricultural land also offer opportunities for the expansion of renewable energies. The expansion targets by location are to be defined as part of the potential study according to M 1.8. Additional expansion is necessary to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement. To achieve this goal, areas in the immediate vicinity should be included in the consideration.  |

|   |  Action description | The unavoidable waste heat from Total's refinery in Leuna cannot be used efficiently in the refinery itself. While the refinery uses cooling capacity, the heat is needed for heating in the public and private sectors in Leipzig. The Leipzig municipal utilities are therefore planning to transport industrial waste heat from the Leuna industrial site to Leipzig via a district heating pipeline from 2027. The pipeline would be about 19 kilometres long and connected to the Kulkwitz power plant site (grid area west). At the same time, the hydrogen infrastructure will be built to prepare for the future use of hydrogen.  |

|   |  Action type | Sustainable energy production  |
|   |  Action description | In Leipzig, the political goal is to supply the citizens with climate-neutral heat as soon as possible. The issues involved are being comprehensively analysed as part of the city's heating plan. An initial component of this heating plan is the expansion of the district heating network and the conversion of heat generation structures towards a climate-neutral supply. These aspects are presented in Leipzig municipal utilities' transformation plan. A second is the conversion of all other fossil-fuelled heat supplies to climate-neutral solutions that are open to all technologies.
With around 50 % of the city supplied with district heating, all remaining requirements can also be covered by renewable energy systems-
Several areas will be newly connected to district heating will be connected to district heating. These first six areas will be prioritised for district heating over the next few years. Expansion plans for these areas are currently being finalised. These are: Gohlis Süd, Klinikum St. Georg, Neulindenau, Südvorstadt West and the Waldstraßenviertel.  |

|   | Action type | Sustainable energy production  |
|   | Action description | The joint project LHyVE aims to establish an intelligent and regionally networked green hydrogen system as a beacon for efficient sector coupling and to integrate it into the emerging European hydrogen infrastructure.

As a technology showcase, LHyVE aims to implement the entire value chain from production, storage, transport and distribution to final consumption in the Leipzig region and to network it via the infrastructure with European projects, cities and municipalities. this will connect the region to European hydrogen infrastructures and markets and lead to a climate-neutral future with secure jobs, technological expertise and a high quality of life.

The Leipzig region is one of the largest hydrogen consumers in Germany due to its chemical industry. Currently, more than 8.5 million standard cubic metres of hydrogen are used per day in the industrial region of Central Germany, which is more than 90 times the annual hydrogen consumption of the planned Leipzig Süd CHP plant in Leipzig (2 x 62 MW). Hydrogen is currently used in Leuna for desulphurisation in crude oil processing and for the production of methanol. In addition, there are numerous other companies and industries in the region, e.g. in the mobility sector, some of which produce large quantities of hydrogen themselves and can use it for the value chain.  |

| Reference to impact pathway | Action type | Research & Concept |
| Action description | In order to develop a city-wide heating strategy and the ongoing search by Leipzig municipal utilities for locations for the generation of electricity from renewable energies urgently the preparation of an energy concept (I.1), including a city-wide area concept for renewable energies is implemented. The area analysis should prioritise the possibilities for energy generation on existing buildings/parking spaces etc.. Only then should previously undeveloped but currently unused areas (e.g. derelict land, landfill sites) be included in the analysis. The suitability of agricultural land needs to be considered in the context of other land requirements of the growing city, e.g. for new housing, for new industrial estates, for organic farming, for mitigation measures. As a result, an integrated city-wide land use concept is required to provide the basis for the phasing out of fossil fuel energy generation in the medium to long term. In this context, options for energy production outside the city of Leipzig should also be considered). |

|   |  Action type | Research & Concept  |
|   |  Action description | The project Office for City PlanningRCS (Sustainable energy Positive & zero cARbon CommunitieS) is pursuing the development of a smart, energy-positive and therefore sustainable neighbourhood on what was once the largest cotton mill site in Europe. As part of the initiative, e-mobility management is being trialled alongside renewable energy sources for the electricity and heat supply. Innovative, mostly decentralised storage technology is also being used in all areas.

For the Baumwollspinnerei model neighbourhood, a photovoltaic system for generating electricity for self-consumption plus electricity storage and an interface to the public grid as well as a networked heating system are planned. This will ensure that the neighbourhood is supplied with electricity and heat in the future. Any surplus production will be fed into the Leipzig municipal utilities grid.

The Office for City PlanningRCS project at the Baumwollspinnerei also points the way to a resource-saving future in the field of e-mobility: a network of charging points has been set up at a central location for tenants, and public e-car sharing is offered; bidirectional charging stations are being used for research purposes, at which fleet vehicles from the commercial sector can both take in and return electricity.

In a showroom on the cotton mill site, the interplay of energy production and consumption is presented in near-real time, making energy supply tangible and understandable.  |

|   |  Action description | Making walking more attractive is a contribution to changing the modal split. In 2015, the city council decided to draw up a pavement rehabilitation programme, in which independent rehabilitation measures were defined for pavements with a high frequency of use and in a desolate condition (VI-A-00968). A total of 34 schemes with condition levels 4 and 5 plus a major project at Mockauer Strasse were identified. The measures were selected on the basis of pavement condition and high importance to users, as well as the fact that the repair costs could not be realised within the framework of road maintenance. In the future, the programme will be continued and supplemented as an independent component of the medium-term road and bridge programme (pavement priority list). The provision of safe and continuous footpaths enables an increase in pedestrian traffic. This has a positive effect on noise reduction, air quality, human health and the quality of life in the city  |

| Action outline | Action type | Sustainable urban development |
| Action description | Vibrant, attractive cities and communities need liveable public spaces. Streets and squares in particular, with their diverse functions, are the face and backbone of communities. They characterise quality of life and urbanity. They have a decisive influence on whether people enjoy living in their city or municipality.

A key instrument for achieving this goal is an urban and environmentally friendly speed limit for motorised traffic - including on main roads.

Cities and municipalities have far too narrow limits when it comes to setting speed limits. The initiative founded in July 2021 by the cities of Aachen, Augsburg, Freiburg, Hanover, Leipzig, Münster and Ulm is therefore lobbying the federal government to allow local authorities to decide for themselves when and where to impose which speed limits. |

|   |  Action description | **Second-Life Store**
The aim of the 'Second-Life Department Store' project is to offer items that have been labelled as waste by a waste disposal service provider back on the market to close loops for consumer goods and conserve resources. By raising awareness, sustainable management in the sense of 'Reuse, Reduce, Refurbish, Repair' is to be placed in the centre of society. A wide range of municipal players (waste disposal companies, crafts, art/design, retail, socio-cultural clubs, associations) are brought together to create unique selling points for each individual and to revitalise properties that have been vacant for a long time for various reasons

**Hardware4future**
Digital solutions offer new opportunities for participation and inclusion: the Hardware4Future project, which has been running since 2020 and aims to distribute used but functional end devices to economically disadvantaged target groups, shows how digital participation can be organised. The project is currently based entirely on voluntary work. Further development and stabilisation of the service is urgently needed, as demand continues to outstrip the supply of donated technology.

**Reusable containers**
The aim of the measure is to offer reusable solutions for food and drinks in the takeaway sector of Leipzig's catering industry, thereby reducing the amount of disposable tableware. It is being implemented as a cooperation project between the city's own cleaning services (project management), the Office for Economic Development (funding) and BUND Leipzig (consulting/campaigning).  |

# 32 Expanding the stock of street trees

|  Action outline | Action name | Expanding the stock of street trees  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Action type | Improving green infrastructure  |
|   |  Action description | The development of urban tree cover is taking place both as part of the development of new neighbourhoods and in existing neighbourhoods. In addition to actively sequestering CO2, the urban tree population reduces energy consumption for cooling and shades common areas, thereby improving bioclimatic conditions. With the Leipzig 2030 street tree concept, the development of existing street trees is currently a conceptual and thematic focus. In the course of new district developments and urban redevelopment and conversion measures, residential areas with an intensive stock of street trees are to be created. In addition, the independent planting of street trees in existing streets is an important focus, which is carried out independently of other civil engineering measures. Special emphasis will be placed on compensating for the loss of trees because of the extremely low rainfall in 2018-2020. The necessary replanting will be a priority in the coming years. In addition to maintaining the street tree population of approximately 56,000 trees (statistical values as of 10/2021 - there have been shifts between tree location groups following the introduction of the new cadastral software), these measures are intended to ensure an expansion of the population by 1,000 trees per year. The potential for increasing the street tree population is estimated to be in the order of 45,000 trees.  |

# 33 Strengthening biotope networks in Leipzig

|  Action outline | Action name | Strengthening biotope networks in Leipzig  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Action type | Improving green infrastructure  |
|   |  Action description | The proportion of forest in Leipzig is being increased, and with it the CO2 storage capacity. Priority areas for increasing forest cover are located in the post-mining landscape in the south of Leipzig. In addition to increasing the forest cover in the open countryside, forests will also be developed in the city. In addition, not only high forests are being promoted, but also sparse forest structures linked to open areas, which are particularly beneficial for biodiversity. Some existing forests are being 'remodelled' due to changes in site conditions, such as the rehabilitation of open-cast mines or climate change. The promotion of 'urban forests' to improve the urban climate is being trialled and supported. Not only does this have a positive effect on the CO2 balance, but the evapotranspiration of the plants also balances out temperature fluctuations, mitigating, for example, the consequences of hot summers caused by climate change. Applications for the implementation of the 'Tiny Forest' concept and other near-natural, structurally rich forms of land use in densely populated urban areas are being considered for their climate adaptation and air quality benefits. Their care and maintenance will be ensured by biotope management.  |

|  Action outline | Action name | Flood area development concept for the Elster-Pleiße-Luppe flood area  |
|   |  Action type | Improving green infrastructure  |
|   |  Action description | Ecologically functioning floodplains are extremely valuable. They contribute to the preservation of biodiversity and are important as natural floodplains and for water retention during heavy rainfall and flooding. They are also a key factor for a good urban climate and, last but not least, intact floodplains store large amounts of the greenhouse gas carbon. The revitalisation of Leipzig's floodplain landscape, supported by extensive open space management, will strengthen its function as a carbon sink, making it particularly important for climate protection. In order to successfully revitalise the floodplain landscape in the middle of a large city, many aspects and concerns have to be taken into account, e.g. nature conservation and hydrological potential for floodplain development, local recreational use or infrastructure such as settlement areas and traffic routes or urban drainage. This approach is pursued by an integrated spatial floodplain development concept, which develops a programme of actions and measures with short-, medium- and long-term solutions with the involvement of many stakeholders.  |

|   |  Action type | Sustainable Urban Development  |
|   |  Action description | Trees perform many functions. They provide shade, absorb carbon from photosynthesis, reduce noise and improve the urban climate. They provide cooling in high temperatures and help reduce air pollution through the dust-binding effect of their leaves. They are also important guardians of urban biodiversity. To preserve and protect existing trees, a Tree Preservation Statute protects the urban population, trees and shrubs. Ordered replacement planting in the case of interventions in the tree population or protective measures during the realisation of construction measures in the area of protected tree population are not sufficiently enforced. The administration wants to commit itself to the enforcement of tree protection.

In addition, the city of Leipzig is improving the monitoring of nature conservation compensation measures in development plans (Federal Building Code § 4c). This includes not only measures on municipal land, but also on private land, and the monitoring of green design measures to minimise the impact on nature and the landscape.  |

|   |  Action description | The creation of integrated energy and climate protection concepts at neighbourhood level and their implementation through Energy Renovation Management (ESM) is an important tool for energy-efficient urban renovation. To this end, refurbishment roadmaps are to be drawn up for all energy-efficient refurbishment areas by 2023 and for all other existing districts by 2025, with the aim of achieving a refurbishment rate of 3.5% of the existing stock per year and replacing fossil heating systems in the entire stock with renewable heating solutions by 2035. The measures are designed and implemented by a multidisciplinary team in close consultation with local people and stakeholders. The "Heating modernisation" support programme provides incentives and enables cooperatives to finance, install and distribute heating systems based on renewable energy. From 2024, there will also be an "Energy Efficiency with Stable Rents" funding programme, which will provide one-off grants to homeowners and housing companies for energy-efficient renovation of the building envelope. The aim is to ensure a stable ceiling for net cold rents after energy-efficient renovation.  |

|   |  Action description | According to the Climate Emergency Resolution, the administration is to become carbon neutral by 2035 to achieve this, the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the electricity and heating needs of the municipal building stock must be reduced. The energy guideline already provides a roadmap for achieving this goal. In order to keep to the timetable, it will be necessary to provide the necessary financial resources and to continue and expand the measures already established in the past. The selection of buildings to be renovated should be prioritised on the basis of potential savings and expected costs. The aim is to increase the annual rate of energy-efficient renovations in the entire municipal building stock towards a fully decarbonised building stock by 2035. From 2023, no gas or oil heating systems (except district heating) will be planned and installed in buildings owned by the municipality and municipal enterprises. Buildings already under construction and buildings in the planning stage (from work phase 4) are exempt. Exceptions must be submitted to the City Council for decision.  |

# 40 Construction of sustainable municipal buildings

|  Action outline | Action name | Construction of sustainable municipal buildings  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Action type | Municipal buildings and facilities  |
|   |  Action description | The Leipzig Energy and Building Standard defines the requirements for new buildings and the renovation of municipal buildings. The focus is on energy-efficient buildings. In addition to this standard, which applies to all buildings, at least two pilot projects (a school/day-care centre and a multi-storey building) in sustainable construction are to be realised with the involvement of municipal companies (LESG and LEIPZIGER HOUSING AND BUILDING SOCIETY (LWB)). As a major building owner and developer, the City of Leipzig is thus taking on an important pioneering role and strengthening its function as a role model. Sustainable construction means not only meeting the highest energy and utility standards (e.g. zero- or plus-energy house for new buildings, EH40 KfW for refurbishment and modernisation), but also using ecological building materials, resource-saving and recyclable materials. Reducing land use is another goal of sustainable construction. At the beginning of the planning phase, the potential for optimisation is identified on an interdisciplinary basis and variants are examined in order to implement the most ecological and economical construction method. In recent years, the sustainability and sufficiency of buildings in new construction, but also in the modernisation of buildings, have increasingly come to the fore, so that certification systems for sustainable buildings and the development of new criteria and evaluation systems have gained more attention. The Sustainable Building Rating System (BNB) is an existing tool for the planning and evaluation of sustainable and generally public building projects. The aim of the pilot projects is to gain experience and lay the foundations for forward-looking construction with an impact beyond 2030. From 2025, municipal construction projects must be planned as sustainable buildings according to a certification system to be chosen by the city.  |

# 42 Climate neutrality and sustainability in Leipzig's administration

|  Action outline | Action name | Climate neutrality and sustainability in Leipzig's administration  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Action type | Internal Organisation  |
|   |  Action description | The Concept for a Climate Neutral City in 2035 is the first concept that places the city administration as an active organisation at the centre of the city's climate protection activities and consequently addresses its underlying internal processes. The concept will define the accounting limits and present a roadmap with binding interim targets and concrete measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a climate-neutral, i.e. technically feasible, minimum level. Compensation of emissions is only foreseen for technically unavoidable residual emissions. As a contribution to the transition towards climate neutral mobility, the company's own fleet will be climate-friendly, (electric) bicycles are used for urban transport. Climate-friendly mobility options for employees increase the use of environmentally friendly means of transport. Leipzig's cultural institutions and cultural events throughout the city are striving for climate neutrality.

A digital, user-friendly management system centrally links supply and demand. Municipal IT infrastructures (e.g. data centres) are designed on the premise of energy and data efficiency (greentech). Rebound effects are to be avoided as far as possible. The direct and indirect GHG emissions caused by procurement along the supply chain are recorded so that levers can be identified and reallocated. Monitoring is used to set the course for emission-neutral or lower-emission supplies and services. Climate protection and sustainability must always be taken into account and given equal weight when redesigning work organisation as part of Modern Administration and Administrative Accommodation 2030. The three dimensions of sustainable working environments will be taken into account.  |

# Commitments and measures of Leipzig companies and organisations to the Climate City Agreement

More than 70 organisations were asked to document their climate protection measures in an online survey in 2024 and contribute them to the Climate City Agreement. Over 40 organisations responded to the survey. The measures submitted included climate protection measures already implemented since 2019 (base year) as well as measures planned up to 2030. It was stipulated that planned measures must at least a) have already been adopted by a shareholders' meeting or similar and b) be integrated into the companies' business plans or medium-term plans. It can be assumed that the companies will plan and implement further measures by 2030, which are to be included in future versions of the Climate City Agreement.

Due to the amount of work involved, the measures were not documented in the same level of detail as the municipal measures. The information on CO2 reduction is based on company data and estimates by the transition team using standard values. Table B-2.3 lists the measures per company, Table B-2.4 summarises the CO2 reduction per field of action and measure across all submitted measures.

# B-2 .6: Summary strategy for residual emissions

As currently neither emissions nor the sequestration potential are yet solidly quantified, the a strategy for dealing with residual emissions can not yet be determined.

Once this is available, the Leipzig strategy provides arguments for developing it. Measures can be implemented with the help of the biannual process for developing climate action implementation programmes, as much as with the iteration of the climate city contract. A further option would be to implement climate orientated household planning.

# 3.3 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

The monitoring of the Climate City Contract is based on a holistic approach that takes into account all sources of emissions caused by the City of Leipzig or the municipal economy and is linked to the monitoring of the EKSP. Various indicators such as the renewable share of the city's overall energy requirements, modal split indicators and the city's green supply are regularly reviewed to ensure that Leipzig remains on track. Both the measures of the Energy and Climate Protection Programme 2030 and the Leipzig Climate City Contract are subject to a two-year reporting process and are continuously evaluated. The uniform nationwide method of greenhouse gas balancing according to the BISKO standard used in the Energy and Climate Protection Programme 2030 will be taken into account. Furthermore, the city's measures and strategies (e.g. heat planning, mobility strategy) are regularly updated and adapted to current urban developments in order to make the best possible contribution to achieving the climate targets. This means that the monitoring of measures originating from other strategies (e.g. municipal heat planning) is carried out with the individual monitoring/preparation of implementation reports for these strategies at different times if necessary. At the time of EKSP monitoring, however, the current implementation status of these measures is surveyed and taken into account in the updating of the CCC.

Findings from other cities as well as national and international bodies (German Association of Cities, Eurocities, Climate Alliance, EU Mission 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities, StronGER Cities, Smart City Community model projects) are also incorporated to ensure that Leipzig is always at the cutting edge of technological, socio-political and scientific developments.

key indicators were selected and are explained below. The City of Leipzig does not use any indicators from the recognised platforms (CDP/ SCIS/ Covenant of OBMs) to monitor its climate protection measures.

|  Indicator name | Local RES production  |
| --- | --- |
|  Indicator Unit | MWh  |
|  Definition of | Annual local renewable energy production.

It can be inferred that this indicator will prove useful for tracking the impact of the installation and operation of renewable energy projects over time. It will allow for the analysis of the before and after situation, as following the installation and operation of renewable energy projects (or as the difference between the annual renewable energy generation related to the project compared to the BAU case).

It is possible to divide the annual total energy consumption compared to a previous baseline or inventory, and then multiply by it by 100 to express the difference/result as a percentage.  |
|  Calculation | Annual local renewable energy production is calculated by acquiring the total renewable energy generation within the city each year.

Relevant unit conversions are 1 J = 1 Ws; 1 kWh= 3,600,000 J; and 1 TOE = 41.868 GJ, 11,630 kWh, or 11.63 MWh (ITU-T L.1430: 2013)  |

# 4 Part C - Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

## 4.1 Module C -1 Governance Innovation Interventions

### C-1.1: Description or visualisation of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

#### Governance structures within the city administration

In order to accelerate implementation, the Office for Sustainable Development and Climate Protection was founded in 2020 following the declaration of the climate emergency in 2019. The Office for Sustainable Development and Climate Protection coordinates the city's climate protection process in a co-creative process involving political actors, academia, businesses, civil society and citizens. The backbone is formed by the Climate Protection Core Team, which is currently made up of six climate protection managers in the departments of Urban Development, Mobility, Building Management, Urban Greenery and Water, Digitalisation and Internal Organisation, Sport, Environmental Protection, Economic Development, Strategic Cultural Policy and the Sustainable Development and Climate Protection Department. The core team implements cross-sectional, integrated and agile working methods on climate protection and sustainability issues throughout the administration. With the climate protection steering group, integrated specialist planning is coordinated at departmental management level with the Head of Environment, Climate, Order and Sport. The newly established Climate Council involves a wide range of interest groups from politics, business, science and civil society as an advisory body to the City Council. Strategies and measures for climate protection are decided by the city council as a politically elected representative body. These are then implemented under the responsibility of the respective specialised mayors. We are committed to a close partnership with our region in the structural change that has been taking place in the Central German lignite mining region for several years.

The Office for a Digital City acts as a coordination unit for the implementation of digitalisation projects in the fields of data, networks, economy and urban society. The department initiates and manages digitalisation projects in the city of Leipzig and networks the relevant stakeholders from administration, business, civil society and research. The Office for a Digital City is also responsible for the development, monitoring and further development of the Digital Agenda and is the service point for the development of digitalisation concepts for the specialist departments and divisions. The department acquires funding for innovative projects and implements them. The department is also the point of contact for digitalisation issues, both internally within the administration and externally for urban society, science and companies. As part of the EU's "Climate-neutral and smart cities" mission, the Office for a Digital City specifically supports the development and implementation of digital solutions that contribute to reducing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions and improving the quality of life in Leipzig. This includes the promotion of smart city initiatives, the integration of digital technologies into sustainable mobility and energy systems and the use of data platforms for monitoring and the efficient planning and management of urban resources. Through close collaboration with various stakeholders and an interdisciplinary team of use case managers, the department is driving the digital transformation of the city to achieve climate neutrality while shaping the city as a liveable and sustainable space. The Office for a Digital City builds on project results and collaborations from EU and federal projects.

In addition, the department is the point of contact for digitalisation issues both within the administration and for urban society, science and companies and is the contact point for ideas and projects. In recent years, the department has worked intensively with other local partners on the development and implementation of climate-neutral neighbourhoods in Leipzig (EU project Office for City PlanningRCS) and is currently developing the city's digital twin together with specialist departments, the initial use cases of which cover the topics of energy and climate in particular.

The Leipzig City Administration (Digital City Unit) is supported by the Digital City Expert Commission in the management, coordination and co-creative implementation (see figure below) of integrated digitalisation projects. The Expert Commission is a 16-member committee appointed by the Lord Mayor and consisting of members from the key areas of business, administration, science, society and services of general interest. Since 2019, the committee has been advising the City of Leipzig on all topics relating to digitalisation within the city administration and is guided by the fields of action and guidelines of the Digital Agenda. Within the city administration and with the L-Group, formats such as the Future Conference or Digital Complices have been used for many years to find

ideas and develop a common direction. The contribution of digital applications to climate neutrality and climate adaptation in the sense of a green smart city are regularly on the agenda here

Against the background of the responsibilities and tasks described above, the Department for Sustainable Development and Climate Protection and the Office for a Digital City in the EU mission assume the overall city coordination role as a tandem

![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)
Figure 9 governance structures and processes in the City of Leipzig and interfaces to the governance sectors of urban society

The Transition Team of the Climate City Contract is made up of employees from both departments, also to drive forward the increased linking of the key topics of climate protection and digitalisation.

# Cooperation non-governmental actors &amp; Civil society:

Leipzig has established cross-sectoral working structures on specific specialist topics such as heat planning, the transport transition, food and consumption. These structures enable a coordinated approach to reducing emissions in various sectors.

Non-governmental organisations, private companies and academic institutions are involved in the climate protection process. The city involves these stakeholders through regular exchanges in forums such as the Leipzig Economic Development Clusters and the Netzwerk Energie und Umwelt e.V. The involvement of the public and other interest groups is emphasised through workshops, online platforms and public events to ensure broad support and participation in climate initiatives.

The city is also a partner or member of various national and state networks. There are also various local initiatives and committees, some of which were initiated by the city administration or of which it is a member. These include, for example

Heat transition project advisory board
Climate Council
Digital City Expert Commission
Future conference and digital accomplices
Climate protection steering group
Sustainable Leipzig Forum

## Heat transition project advisory board

External interest groups were involved at an early stage in the process of drawing up the municipal heating plan. In addition to the existing project structure, an advisory board was set up. This advisory board has the task of supporting the project team with expert knowledge and comprehensively evaluating the results. The early involvement was expressed by the participating institutions with a regular positive response to the invitation at management/executive board/presidium level. At the advisory board meetings held in 2023, the approach to municipal heat planning in particular was presented and the initial interim results were discussed.

## Climate Council

The City of Leipzig will set up a climate advisory board consisting of representatives from various interest groups, including companies, organisations and institutions. This advisory board will advise the city administration on climate protection issues and ensure close cooperation between the various stakeholders.

## Digital City Expert Commission

The great potential of the expert commission's work lies in the fact that the digital transformation not only permeates the economy, but society as a whole. That is why the commission's recommendations are intended to shape the digital transformation in the interests of citizens, pool the experience of business, administration and universities and develop a coherent overall concept for the entire city.

## Future forum/conference and digital accomplices

In order to strengthen the exchange on digitalisation topics at employee level both in the city administration and in cooperation with the companies of the Leipzig Group, the Office for a Digital City organises the format of the Digital Complices once or twice a year - each time with a different focus topic. Projects on various fields of action of the Climate City Contract, such as traffic/transport,

energy and digital twins to accelerate planning and approval processes, are regularly discussed and further developed across departments.

## Climate protection steering group

The Climate Protection Steering Group meets regularly to coordinate climate-relevant concepts and projects across departments within the city administration. It consists of relevant specialist departments (Office for Mobility and Civil Engineering, Office for Digitisation and Organisation, Office for Building Management, Office for City Planning, Economic Development, Office for Environmental Protection) and the Office for Sustainable Development and Climate Protection, which is responsible for moderating, documenting and following up on the work packages discussed.

## Sustainable Leipzig Forum

The Sustainable Leipzig Forum (formerly Leipzig Agenda 21) is an open movement of Leipzig citizens as well as private and public institutions. There is no legal entity and no membership. The Forum is largely supported by the City of Leipzig, which is also part of the Forum. The forum also receives support from a number of companies. Representatives from associations and organisations, companies and chambers, universities and scientific institutions, churches, trade unions, political parties and the City of Leipzig are involved in the forum. It organises networking events, public forums and workshops and brings all these stakeholders together to discuss sustainability issues.

## Further development of the governance structures for the Climate City Agreement:

For the development of the first version of the Climate City Agreement, the Transition Team relied on public events, such as the Future Day 2023 and the Saxon Energy Days, to involve organisations and companies in the implementation of the agreement and encourage them to sign the Leipzig Preamble to the Climate City Agreement. In addition to thematic workshops for specific target groups (e.g. social associations, higher education institutions) and a networking event in April 2024, over 100 organisations and companies were approached and involved. Some of the organisations activated in this way participated directly in the first version of the Leipzig Climate City Contract with their own measures.

As in its climate protection work to date, the City of Leipzig is also relying on existing (specialised) networks for the continuation of the Climate City Contract. In particular, networks such as the Leipzig Energy Efficiency and Climate Protection Network (EEKN) help to stabilise the participation process.

## Leipzig Energy Efficiency and Climate Protection Network (EEKN)

This network was founded in cooperation with Leipzig municipal utilities and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce. It offers private sector players advice on effective climate protection measures, points out ways of sustainable corporate management and actively supports them in their energy efficiency endeavours (LINK).

Promoting and initiating climate protection projects and measures in Leipzig are key instruments for encouraging many citizens to protect the climate. With the so-called climate protection offensive, the city administration wants to actively support this commitment and encourage direct action through various approaches. The measure is part of the EKSP and is already being implemented with the following components:

City homepage, official gazette, information flyer, etc.
Events, campaigns, specialist days (e.g. European Mobility Week, car-free day)
Competitions, tenders for funding (edited)

In addition, topic-specific and target group-oriented climate education activities (information and awareness-raising programmes, events, campaigns and advice for businesses and private households) are carried out.

In the update of the Climate City Contract, greater emphasis is placed on the participation of citizens. This will again be based on the existing stakeholder structures and the climate education measures already anchored in the EKSP. In future, more use will be made of both analogue and

digital measures to inform citizens online about the current status of climate protection efforts and encourage them to engage in dialogue.

This includes, for example, a climate portal with storytelling functions, which will be launched from the end of 2025.

Various digital information and participation tools are also being developed and tested as part of the EU mission pilot project EnAct4CleanCities. These include, for example, the further development and opening up of the data (i.e. improved preparation and explanation) of the Digital Energy Twin in order to make the topics of energy transition and climate protection and the implementation status in Leipzig transparent. In addition, challenges on climate-neutral behaviour are being developed for the existing Leipzig app and the option for citizens to submit digital commitments to the Climate City Contract and the climate neutrality target by 2030 is being developed on a pilot basis (completion by the end of August 2026).

The City of Leipzig's annual Smart City Challenge is to focus even more strongly on the topic of "digital solutions for the climate" in future. Founders, start-ups, students and established companies are invited to take part in the annual innovation competition to find innovative digital solutions for given municipal and civil society issues. From all the ideas submitted, three solutions are selected for each issue, which are further developed with the city administration and one is implemented as a pilot. The competition is being organised in cooperation with the Smart Infrastructure Hub Leipzig.

The working structures that have already been established, particularly with the municipal companies (L-Group), make it possible to organise planning and implementation processes more quickly and efficiently. A cross-organisational team (consisting of employees from various departments of the city administration, Netz Leipzig, Leipzig municipal utilities and Leipziger Wasserwerke) has already been entrusted with preparing the implementation of the first pilot districts for heat planning. At the same time, the Leipzig Energy Twin is also being further developed in order to have a uniform and up-to-date data basis for the planning process across all organisations and to be able to make investment decisions more quickly.

## 4.2 Module C-2 Social Innovation Interventions

### C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

The following table shows a comprehensive analysis of barriers and possible measures to achieve climate neutrality in the context of the city of Leipzig. It combines specific challenges with practical ideas and their potential positive effects, including the reduction of emissions and other co-benefits such as increased quality of life and economic competitiveness. The proposed measures range from technological innovations, some of which are already in operation/being implemented in Leipzig with the help of funding, to legal adjustments aimed at efficiently overcoming existing obstacles. The relevant organisational units are committed to the needs of the city administration and its partners in the Climate City Contract via interest groups such as the German Association of Cities or the Stronger Cities alliance.

The importance of integrated and digitally supported approaches for improving and accelerating planning and implementation processes is particularly worth emphasising.

It is already clear that targeted and coordinated measures can not only achieve climate targets, but also have numerous positive side effects for society and the economy. An interdisciplinary approach is crucial in order to promote both climate neutrality and urban resilience.

### How do these innovations empower and enable stakeholders and citizens to embark on the path to climate neutrality?

These innovations promote the participation of stakeholders and citizens through transparent and accessible information platforms, such as the Leipzig data portal (under development) and associated communication and participation tools, e.g. for owners and business owners (EnAct) in the energy transition. They enable data-supported decision-making and create incentives for broader participation through innovative approaches such as citizen energy cooperatives and crowdfunding projects. Pilot projects and local initiatives raise awareness and promote trust in climate-friendly technologies and processes, which encourages active participation.

### How do these innovations lower the barriers for marginalised groups to participate?

The advocacy efforts of the City of Leipzig and other mission cities (Stronger Cities) aim to overcome existing barriers through flexible and adapted regulations (EU and federal level) that also facilitate access to climate-friendly technologies and initiatives for marginalised groups. Funding programmes (EU, federal, state, city) and subsidies for low-income households as well as educational and training opportunities help to make participation more accessible for these groups. Digital solutions such as central planning portals and climate protection management systems simplify participation and at the same time offer support for disadvantaged population groups. The Leipzig App is already being used by around 28,000 Leipzig residents and therefore offers low-threshold access to urban issues such as climate protection initiatives and the energy transition.

### How can the long-term influence be secured and the existing/planned innovation activities be scaled?

The long-term influence and scaling of innovations can be ensured through close networking of projects and continuous adaptation to changing conditions. For example, it is in the nature of digital applications such as the Leipzig App and digital twins that they are continuously developed, expanded or replicated for other topics and users.

The integration of innovation funds and the promotion of pilot projects create a financing basis from which personnel, material and investment funds can be successively stabilised over the coming budget periods.

In addition, by creating standardised and flexible regulations and using digital platforms such as the Urban Data Platform and the Climate Data System, best practices can be transferred to other cities and regions.

This ensures that the successes achieved are sustainable in the long term and can be further expanded.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

## Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iteration

The development and updating of the Leipzig Climate City Contract builds on the existing cooperation and participation processes as well as existing network structures of the City of Leipzig in the area of climate protection. In addition to the institutionalisation of a climate advisory board in accordance with the Saxon municipal code, companies, organisations and institutions from various industries and sectors are also integrated into the work process. The Leipzig Energy Efficiency and Climate Protection Network (EEKN), which was initiated in 2019 in cooperation with Leipzig municipal utilities and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, provides an important platform for the implementation of measures and knowledge transfer and advises actors of the private sector on effective climate protection measures and shows ways to achieve sustainable corporate transformation. A Leipzig cohort from the companies participating in the Leipzig Climate City Contract will begin its work after submission in this network.

A holistic approach underlies the monitoring of the Climate City Contract, which takes into account all sources of emissions caused by the City of Leipzig or the municipal economy and ties in with the monitoring of the EKSP. Various indicators such as the renewable share of the city's overall energy requirements, modal split indicators and the city's green supply are regularly reviewed to ensure that Leipzig remains on track. Both the measures of the Energy and Climate Protection Programme 2030 and the Leipzig Climate City Contract are subject to a two-year reporting process and are continuously evaluated. The uniform nationwide method of greenhouse gas balancing according to the BISKO standard used in the Energy and Climate Protection Programme 2030 will be taken into account. Furthermore, the city's measures and strategies (e.g. heat planning, mobility strategy) are regularly updated and adapted to current urban developments in order to make the best possible contribution to achieving the climate targets. Findings from other cities as well as national and international bodies (German Association of Cities, Eurocities, Climate Alliance, EU Mission 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities, StronGER Cities, Smart City Community model projects) are incorporated to ensure that Leipzig is always at the cutting edge of technological, socio-political and scientific developments.

The city has developed a participation concept that enables the population to be actively involved in the discussion and implementation of climate protection targets and measures. To this end, regular workshops and events (analogue and online) are held to actively involve citizens in the energy and climate protection process. Important platforms include high-profile events such as climate conferences, the Ökofete, Klimafair and the annual city cycling event, as well as cooperation with climate groups and the active urban community. Further close cooperation with civil society players in the sense of the bottom-up approach is being sought.

The concrete participation process for updating the Climate City Contract will be part of Leipzig's application for the EU mission's Enabling City Transformation Programme (submission in October 2024). This participation process will take in consideration formats and approaches of social and technical innovation described above (Table C 2.1).

The Climate City Contract is to be updated every two years and in parallel with the development of the implementation programme for the city's Energy and Climate Protection Programme. This is planned for the first time in 2026.

In the next steps, specialist departments are to be involved even more closely, further organisations and companies are to be won as signatories to the CCC and cooperation with the city society, i.e. the involvement of citizens with concrete commitments in the CCC, is to be sought. In addition, the acquisition of further (subsidised) funds for the implementation of Leipzig's climate neutrality efforts is essential, as well as the continuous communication of legal and organizational barriers (countercurrent principle), which can only be overcome by public institutions at the federal and EU levels.

# 1. Introduction

## Introduction

Leipzig is a city of history and culture, but also of decline and environmental destruction in Germany's most devastated brown coal region. The citizens of Leipzig formed the heart of the Peaceful Revolution in 1989 and are regarded the driving force behind the epochal changes in Europe that ultimately paved the way for a united Germany in Europe. Today, it is these rich experiences that guide us to shape a comprehensively sustainable future and to develop our city into a climate-friendly living space that attracts more than 630,000 citizens and 2.5 million people in the metropolitan region.

Leipzig's development is an example for the challenges and potentials of European cities. During the German EU Council Presidency in 2020, cities adopted the New Leipzig Charter as a guiding document for urban development in Europe that is geared towards the common good. Together with the UN Agenda 2030, an action-oriented framework, it promotes further cooperation at local, regional, national and European level to strengthen the interests of cities and municipalities in Europe. With the implementation of our integrated sustainable urban development concept 2030 (INSEK 2030), we therefore strategically focus on the Leipzig Charter principles within the four pillars of our framework for action: quality of life, social cohesion, competitiveness and internationality. In addition, with the financial support of the Free State of Saxony from ERDF funds, we take part in the European Energy Award (eea) competition since 2011 and are proud to be awarded with the gold status twice (2017/2021). This demonstrates our continuous engagement to constantly evaluate and report upon our energy and climate protection activities which we established in our SECAP - the Leipzig Energy and Climate Protection Programme (EKSP) for over 10 years.

With the Leipzig Strategy 2035, we pursue the goal of making a contribution to a sustainable future that is oriented towards the common good, with special focus on climate neutrality, economic growth and social cohesion as a driving force in the network of European cities. In the City of Leipzig's Digital Agenda, we have agreed on goals, fields of action and projects that will help us on our way to becoming a climate-neutral city.

## AMBITION

In 2015, the Paris Climate Protection Agreement set the goal of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible, and in any case to well below 2 degrees Celsius. As the City of Leipzig, we are committed to this goal, which is why the City Council adopted the Leipzig Energy and Climate Protection Programme 2030 (EKSP 2030), setting the climate policy goal of a climate-neutral city by 2040 at the latest. Furthermore, we aim to cut in half the city's overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

With the participation in the EU mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030", the Leipzig City Council and the city administration have jointly committed to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (City Council resolution VII-DS-06102). However, to achieve the necessary transformation towards climate neutrality by 2030, we need the engagement and contribution of all stakeholders at all levels of urban governance (local, federal, national, EU) and the citizens of Leipzig.

## PROCESS

Our decarbonisation strategies for energy and heat, transport, buildings and economic development focus on ten factor of success:

climate-friendly neighbourhood development,
responsible land use by striving for net zero sealing by 2030,
climate-neutral energy and heat supply and
a regional circular economy, which is supported by our zero-waste strategy and our local nutrition strategy.

Our Sustainable Mobility Strategy 2030 focuses on eco-mobility and our Green City Masterplan ensures a healthy living environment characterized by our vibrant green-blue infrastructure. These instruments and plans allow us to promote our rich biodiversity, become climate resilient, ensure socio-spatial access for all and support active mobility and healthy people. As a city administration, we support local projects in our society through our climate protection campaign with advice and funding, promote climate education and lead by example with our concept for a climate-neutral city administration in 2035. This concept aims to raise awareness and to train employees, to transform our procurement system, to convert our vehicle fleet and renovate our municipal buildings with a particular focus on our renovation roadmap for daycare and school buildings.

# GOVERNANCE

To accelerate the implementation process, the Office for Sustainable Development and Climate Protection (RNK) was founded in 2020 following the declaration of climate emergency in 2019. The RNK coordinates the city's climate protection process in a co-creative process involving political stakeholders, the scientific community, businesses, civil society and citizens. The backbone is formed by the Climate Protection Core Team, which assembles ten climate protection managers in the Departments of Urban Development, Mobility, Building Management, Urban Greenery and Water, Digitalisation and Internal Organisation, Sport, Environmental Protection, Economic Development, Strategic Cultural Policy and the Department for Sustainable Development and Climate Protection. The core team implements cross-sectional, integrated and agile working methods on climate protection and sustainability issues throughout the administration.

The Climate Protection Steering Group headed by the vice mayor of the Department of Environment, Climate, Order and Sport represents the head of divisions and coordinates the integrated planning. The newly established Climate Council involves a wide range of interest groups from politics, business, science and civil society. It works as an advisory body to the City Council. Strategies and activities for climate protection are decided by the city council as a politically elected representative body. The passed strategies, plans or resolutions are then implemented by the respective vice mayor. Furthermore, we acknowledge the importance of a close partnership with our region to jointly shape the structural change that has been taking place in the Central German lignite mining region for several years.

The Digital City Unit (RDS) acts as a coordination unit for the implementation of digitalisation projects in the fields of data, infrastructure, economy, urban society as well as energy and climate. The unit initiates and manages digitalisation projects in the city of Leipzig and interlinks the relevant stakeholders from administration, business, civil society and research. The Digital City Unit is also responsible for the development, monitoring and updating of the Digital Agenda. It is the service point for the development of digitalisation concepts for the specialist departments and divisions. The department acquires and implements funding for innovative projects. The unit is also the point of contact for digitalisation issues, both internally within the administration and externally for urban society, science and companies. As part of the EU's "Climate-neutral and smart cities" mission, the Digital City Unit specifically supports the development and implementation of digital solutions that help to reduce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions and improve the quality of life in Leipzig. This includes the promotion of smart city initiatives, the integration of digital technologies into sustainable mobility and energy systems and the use of data platforms for monitoring, efficient planning and management of urban resources. By working closely with various stakeholders, the department is driving forward the digital transformation of the city to achieve climate neutrality and at the same time to shape the city as a liveable and sustainable environment. The Digital City Unit builds on project results and collaborations from EU and federal projects (see below).

The Digital City Unit is supported by the Expert Commission Digital City in the management, coordination and co-creative implementation (see figure below) of integrated digitalisation projects. Within the city administration and with the L-Group, formats such as the Future Conference or Digital Complices have been used for many years to jointly find ideas and to agree on a common orientation. The contribution of digital applications to climate neutrality and climate adaptation in the sense of a Green Smart City are regularly on the agenda here.

# MEASURES

We are already implementing a wide range of measures in which climate-friendly neighborhood development and digital control mechanisms are interlinked and enable the active participation of stakeholders in our city. The Digital Agenda Leipzig provides a key strategic framework for this. The development of digital twins in areas such as energy and climate protection will lead to accelerated planning and implementation of measures, for example in the municipal heat planning (Connected Urban Twins project). Experiences from ongoing pilot projects, e.g. in the field of CO2-neutral energy neighborhoods (Horizon 2020 project SPARCS) and emission-saving public transport planning (Interreg project EfficienCE), create a technical basis and data collection for the city-wide implementation of climate protection activities. These pilot and funding projects take place in close cooperation with municipal energy

and water suppliers, transport companies, research institutions, private companies and civil society actors (EnAct4CleanCities).

# EU MISSION

The successful application for the EU mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" facilitated the process to launch a city-wide climate protection programme which tackles the path to climate neutrality in a targeted manner and with a broad alliance of stakeholders. In addition to the City's Energy and Climate Protection Programme (EKSP), which is currently being implemented, external stakeholders from business, science and urban society were involved in a participatory process. As a result, more than 40 stakeholders from business, science, social institutions, administration and civil society have declared their commitment to achieve goals and implement measures on the path to climate neutrality by 2030 in the first version of the Climate City Agreement.

At a national level, we have joined forces with the seven other German mission cities to form the stronGERcities network. The network liaises with the Federal Ministry of Housing, Urban Development and Building. It represents the interests of the German mission cities. Politically, stronGERcities is supported by the German Association of Cities. At state level, we have also campaigned with our state capital Dresden for the Free State of Saxony to get involved in the implementation and financing of measures in our climate city contracts.

We are convinced that this ambitious project, initiated by the EU mission, will only succeed if all stakeholders across all levels of society and politics tackle this task together. Alliances in our city and dialogue with the municipalities of the EU mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" are just as important as the financial support for the cities through EU projects and federal/state funding.

# OUR CONTRIBUTION

The EKSP 2030 contains measures and priorities for action that are largely developed and implemented by the City administration and its municipal companies. The Leipzig Climate City Contract, in addition to this, documents the ambitious joint efforts of various stakeholders as well as the City administration to implement over 800 innovative, sustainable measures. It is a jointly designed programme of Leipzig's citizens, businesses, scientific institutions and civil society that demonstrates the path to climate neutrality by 2030. These measures will be implemented by companies or institutions individually or jointly and/or in the neighbourhood. The first version of the Climate City Contract includes measures estimated to result in saving of more than 560 tons of CO2 emissions and an investment volume of 330 million Euros.

What we plan to do next:

to drive forward the further implementation of the measures in network associations,
to extend the use of digital applications such as digital twins, AI and our Leipzig app for support,
to win over further partners, enablers and activists for involvement in the next version of the Climate City Contract,
to act as a driving force for other European cities with our activities and
to advocate for the removal of the described financial and legal barriers at state, federal and european level.

In this way, we aim to contribute to the implementation of the European Green Deal while preserving the city's quality of life, along with its ecological, social, and economic resilience.

# 2. Goal: climate neutrality by 2030

## Goal

### LEIPZIG CLIMATE NEUTRALITY TARGET

In accordance with the Council resolution on the climate emergency in 2019, the City of Leipzig is pursuing the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement at municipal level and applies the internationally applied CO2 budget approach as a basic principle. The calculation of Leipzig's remaining CO2 budget is therefore based on a target scenario of a possible limitation of global warming to 1.75 degrees with a probability of 83%.

The residual budget still available is determined using the methodology proposed in the 2020 Environmental Report of the German Advisory Council on the Environment (SRU), resulting in a final residual budget of 29.0 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents for the city of Leipzig from 2020.

The EU Mission "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" has given the City of Leipzig the opportunity to launch a city-wide climate protection program, aimed at purposefully pursuing the path to climate neutrality in a broad alliance of stakeholders. In addition to the already ongoing implementation of the Energy and Climate Protection Program (EKSP), external stakeholders from business, academia, and civil society are being involved in this process through a participatory approach.

By participating in the EU Mission, the Leipzig City Council and city administration have jointly committed to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (City Council Resolution VII-DS-06102). A significant intermediate goal is an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to the baseline year of 2019 (5.25 tons of CO2 equivalents per capita), assuming the optimal implementation of all measures.

In the first phase of the Climate City Contract, stakeholders from business and academia will be involved in the collective path towards climate neutrality. However, given the current conditions and the current level of external stakeholder integration, the ambitious goal of an 80% reduction is unlikely to be fully achieved for the time being, under the current conditions (first version of the CCC), we can realistically expect a 65% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

The first phase of the Climate City Contract lays the foundation for a city-wide climate protection program. Processes and structures will be refined, and a more comprehensive monitoring system will be established.

In further expansion stages of the CCC, additional stakeholders will be integrated into the city-wide climate protection program over the next few years. Additional to this, further external support is needed to break down various existing barriers, accelerate the implementation of climate-protection measures, and bring the city closer to achieving climate neutrality under realistic assumptions.

With the help of the Climate City Contract, supported by political decisions at the state and federal levels, and with the promised measures (financial, regulatory, personnel) to reduce existing barriers, the achievement of the climate neutrality goal set by the City Council by 2040 is expected to accelerate. Based on the 2019 baseline, the goal is to close the emission gap from 1.9 tons per capita to 1.1 tons per capita by 2030, achieving a significant reduction of 80%.

### STRATEGIC MILESTONES

The guideline of a precautionary energy and climate protection strategy has already been incorporated into the interdisciplinary urban development strategy for Leipzig, the Integrated Urban Development Concept 2030 (INSEK). The INSEK 2030 was adopted by the City Council in 2018.

With the Leipzig Strategy 2035 (further development of the INSEK 2030), the strategic objectives and projects of the City of Leipzig were harmonised with the vision "Leipzig grows sustainably and serves the
City of Leipzig

C

common good". The climate neutrality target was also included, as were the goals of our sustainable mobility strategy.

![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)
Figure 2 Target image Leipzig Strategy 2035

When the climate emergency was declared in October 2019, an immediate action programme was set up in 2020 with 24 measures to be implemented directly. This programme includes investments of 20 million Euro for:

the expansion of renewable energies on municipal roofs and open spaces,
raising building and renovation standards,
strengthening climate-conscious mobility services,
setting up an office for sustainable nutrition and agriculture and
climate accounting for cultural institutions and events.

The many years of climate protection work to date were recognised in 2021 with the European Energy Award in Gold.

However, it was only with the council resolution on the Energy and Climate Protection Programme 2030 in October 2022 that we succeeded in translating the energy and climate policy necessities into a municipal programme in such a way that 150 measures are being implemented under the collective responsibility of over 20 departments and municipal companies. The measures of the EKSP are being concretely implemented through two-year action plans, supported by financial backing to enhance monitoring.

In the central municipal leverage sectors of the transport, energy and heating transition, we are working closely with municipal companies to provide services of general interest and pursue the development goal of a sustainable, resilient and intelligent supply and disposal structure. In 2023 and 2024 alone, together with the Leipziger Group as a municipal entity, we were able to invest EUR 305 million per year in the transport and renovation transition, thereby saving up to 1.1 million tonnes of CO2.

At the same time, we are positioning ourselves as a local authority to become climate-neutral by 2035. As the second largest employer in the Free State of Saxony, our starting balance sheet impressively demonstrates that by 2021, we were already well on our way to reducing our total emissions of approximately 47,399 tonnes of CO2 equivalent to a minimum. At the same time, the process of
City of Leipzig

drawing up municipal heating plans is underway to make Leipzig's heating supply future-proof, climate-neutral and affordable by 2038.

# THG - BALANCE SHEET

In order to review the impact of the measures taken to achieve the target, the current status on the path to climate neutrality is regularly assessed using the standardised nationwide greenhouse gas balancing method in accordance with the BISKO standard. The BISKO standard (municipal accounting system) is based on the final energy-based territorial principle. It includes a list of final energy consumption that occurs within the municipal area, an analysis of the life cycle of all energy sources (including extraction, conversion, transport and use) and a derived greenhouse gas balance. Some data, in particular the consumption of electricity, district heating and gas, is only transmitted by the energy supply companies and network operators two years after the fact for auditing reasons. This means that the publication of a comprehensive greenhouse gas balance is always delayed. All energy-related consumption in the private household, commercial and transport sectors in the Leipzig city area is recorded. Energy consumed outside the city (e.g. for consumer goods) and air travel cannot be recorded. In addition to carbon dioxide (CO2), the most emitted greenhouse gas, the two other most important greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are also analysed. For reasons of stringency, the emission factor of the overall German electricity mix is used in the BISKO standard. This means that Leipzig's successes in renewable electricity generation plants do not have a direct impact on the balance, but only indirectly via the change in the overall German electricity mix.

![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)
Figure 3 Development of GHG emissions per inhabitant in the city of Leipzig

The per capita greenhouse gas emissions of the city of Leipzig in 2011 and 2021 initially increase and then slowly but steadily decrease, followed by a more significant reduction in 2019 and 2020. The population grew by 18.0 % during the period under review.

The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 is mainly due to lower natural gas consumption in the commercial sector and improved electricity emissions. This is because more electricity was produced using renewable energy sources both locally and throughout Germany. In 2020, total emissions fell sharply, particularly in the transport and economic sectors. The measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp reduction in traffic volumes and production losses in the economy as a result of delivery difficulties. Climate change also had an impact: Nine of the ten years analysed were significantly too warm, which reduced the need for heating energy. Greenhouse gas emissions fell by 22.1 % over the total period of 11 years (2011 - 2021, with weather correction) (without: 21.3 %). In the business

sector (including all municipal facilities, which account for around 2% of the City of Leipzig's total emissions), emissions fell more sharply (33.7%) than in the household (4.8%) and transport (17.1%) sectors. In 2021, GHG emissions will be 5.02 tonnes per inhabitant.

# ENERGY FLOW ANALYSIS

Leipzig's 2020 energy flow analysis shows that total energy consumption in the city of Leipzig has fallen by 10% compared to 2018 (10,187 GWh). Private households were the only sector to record a slight increase in final energy consumption in 2020, which is due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)
Figure 4 Energy flow analysis 2020 City of Leipzig - Part I

In addition to the balancing by sector, the breakdown by energy source provides important information for the strategic direction of energy and climate protection work in the city. The main energy sources and energy source groups are therefore presented below in terms of their share of final energy consumption. The total production of electricity from renewable energies was increased and the share of renewable energies in total electricity consumption for the city of Leipzig is 8% in 2020.

LEIPZIG CITY AREA

Leipzig is pursuing a holistic strategy that combines the reduction of climate-impacting emissions with the goals of integrated urban development. By utilising locally renewable energy sources and improving energy efficiency, the city not only contributes to global climate neutrality, but also strengthens its regional resilience and economic stability. A central component of this strategy is reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports. In a geopolitically dynamic global situation with increasing risks, this not only means greater energy independence, but also a strengthening of regional economic cycles. Revenues remain in the region, circulate locally and thus contribute to economic prosperity instead of being channelled into international trade in fossil fuels.

Leipzig's sustainable energy supply also brings social and environmental benefits. Making transport more environmentally friendly and increasing the use of low-emission vehicles improves air quality, especially in congested urban centres. This leads to a higher quality of life for residents. In addition, targeted climate protection measures contribute to the preservation and promotion of local biodiversity, which not only serves the ecological balance, but also has a positive impact on the urban climate and general well-being. The intelligent linking of centralised and decentralised energy approaches, such as virtual power plants, is of strategic importance. These smart solutions benefit from the many years of cooperation between Leipzig City Council, Stadtwerke Leipzig and partners from science and industry, e.g. as part of EU projects such as Triangulum and SPARCS. These diverse measures and targeted

cooperation not only make Leipzig a pioneer in the energy transition, but also increase the city's attractiveness for sustainable investments. The creation of long-term jobs in innovative industries of the future will further strengthen the city's economy and ensure its sustainable future viability.

Another positive effect is the improvement in air quality due to the reduction in emissions of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Good air quality is an important factor for people's quality of life, especially in urban centres with high levels of traffic congestion. Air quality can be significantly improved by making transport more environmentally friendly and using low-emission vehicles and energy sources.

Targeted climate protection measures can also contribute to the preservation and promotion of local biodiversity. Climate change and the scarcity of natural resources pose major challenges for biodiversity. The city of Leipzig is taking targeted measures to preserve or even improve habitats for animals and plants. This not only serves the ecological balance, but also has a positive effect on the urban climate and the well-being of residents.

# 3. Strategic priorities

## 3 Strategic priorities

### MUNICIPAL LEVERAGE SECTORS

Leipzig, one of Germany's most dynamic cities, wants to play a pioneering role in achieving climate neutrality targets and share its experiences and solutions with other cities. In order to realise these ambitions, the City Council has set the three municipal leverage sectors as systemic-strategic priorities that are decisive for the implementation of the Climate City Contract (CCC) by adopting the Energy and Climate Protection Programme 2030.

The main sectors on the way to a climate-neutral city are transport, electricity and heating. In the coming years, Leipzig will: focus on reducing CO₂ emissions through,

increasing the share of renewable energies in the electricity and heating sector,
the reduction of energy requirements,
focus on the promotion of sustainable mobility options
the implementation of technologies and digital applications which help to accelerate the transition process and to operate a climate neutral city.

To this end, we are endeavouring to comprehensively replace fossil fuels with renewable energies in the areas of electricity, heating and transport.

The future development of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector is heavily dependent on optimised interaction between the various political decision-making levels. Changing existing instruments and creating new incentives for eco-mobility at federal level can reduce the attractiveness of motorised private transport. The resulting increase in the volume of traffic should be redirected to eco-mobility. Accelerating the transport transition is therefore at the centre of our strategic priorities. The basis for this is the sustainability scenario of the Mobility Strategy 2030 with an associated framework plan. The scenario is also aligned with the climate targets of the City of Leipzig. This includes the increased promotion of local public transport and cycling. Transport-related emissions in urban areas will be reduced in the long term through attractive, affordable and inclusive mobility options for Leipzig's population.

Table 1 Development of modal split

|  Modal split City of Leipzig | 2018 | Sustainability scenario 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  PUBLIC TRANSPORT | 17,5 % | 23,0 %  |
|  Foot | 27,3 % | 24,0 %  |
|  Wheel | 18,7 % | 23,0 %  |

In quantitative terms, this means achieving a 70 per cent share of eco-mobility, with local public transport accounting for 23 per cent, cycling for 23 per cent and walking for 24 per cent. At the same time, the share of motorised private transport in the modal split is to be reduced to 30 percent. The aim is to increase passenger numbers to 220 million passengers per year and to increase the utilisation of local public transport by expanding the range of services.

The further expansion of renewable energy plants in Leipzig is being prepared by the so-called "Framework concept for the planning control of land requirements for the production of renewable energies (Rako-FEE)". The expansion of renewable energies for electricity generation is already being supported by a solar cadastre on possible RE potential on roof surfaces, a funding programme for the installation of balcony solar modules and a solar scout who explicitly advises businesses with large roof surfaces on the expansion of PV systems. In addition, the city administration and its municipal companies, e.g. Leipziger Wohnungs- und Baugesellschaft (LWB), have committed to the further expansion of PV systems on their buildings. By the end of 2023, the LWB had installed 97 photovoltaic systems with a total output of 4.07 MWp. This corresponds to the electricity consumption of around 2,000 two-room flats. PV systems with a total output of 1 MWp will be added in 2024 alone. The systems will be installed and operated by the wholly owned subsidiary WSL Wohnen &amp; Service Leipzig GmbH. Since 2023, the LWB has also been supporting the construction of PV balcony power plants by tenants.

Due to the urban area with limited land potential for renewable energy plants, cooperation with the surrounding municipalities of Leipzig is essential. Here too, planning and coordination processes are already underway with the Leipzig-Western Saxony Planning Association.

The future development of the heating mix, i.e. the distribution of final energy consumption across the various energy sources, depends on various factors. Fossil fuels such as heating oil and coal must be almost completely replaced by 2030. In the area of private households and municipal properties, the aim is to replace all systems with climate-friendly heating technology by then. Overall, the proportion of fossil fuels must fall to around 30 % and heating oil, liquid gas and coal must be completely replaced by renewable energies, district heating (using fossil and renewable energy sources) or natural gas.

Switching to a climate-neutral energy and heat supply is therefore a major lever for efficiently reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Leipzig. To achieve this, we need to scrutinise existing structures, use digital technologies and social innovations.

Leipzig City Council is playing a central role in shaping the transformation process of the heating supply and is developing a municipal heating plan for this purpose. The administration of the City of Leipzig, Leipziger Stadtwerke, Netz Leipzig and Leipziger Wohnungs- und Baugesellschaft are working together on this. The municipal heating plan aims to take the necessary steps for a sustainable, renewable heat supply in line with the city's climate and energy strategy. The prerequisite for successful implementation of the heating plan is an efficient technical infrastructure.

# 10 FACTORS OF SUCCESS FOR CLIMATE PROTECTION

In order to significantly reduce CO2 in the municipal leverage sectors and at the same time shape the transformation to a sustainable city with the commitment of the urban society to climate protection, we have identified the following ten success factors (key areas) in our energy and climate protection programme. They will guide our future energy and climate protection work until 2030 and integrate further impetus for the implementation of measures together with the urban society. This addresses

Climate protection campaign

Sustainable and climate-sensitive urban development not only includes the creation of environmentally and climate-friendly living spaces, but also a holistic ecological approach to urban development. Innovative concepts such as neighborhood energy concepts and energy-efficient refurbishment management are being actively promoted. At the same time, projects to increase energy efficiency are being driven forward, such as the refurbishment of municipal building complexes and the introduction of energy-efficient heating and lighting systems. This is accompanied by ongoing user training programmes in municipal administrative, educational and leisure facilities. In addition, Leipzig consistently focuses on the circular economy to minimise the amount of waste and recycle materials as completely as possible. The city's "Zero Waste Strategy", which pools initiatives and stakeholders in waste avoidance and recycling and strengthens them together with Leipzig's municipal waste management organisation, is key to this.

Leipzig is aiming for a climate-neutral city administration by 2035. The implementation concept addresses internal processes ranging from employee mobility and climate-neutral administrative buildings to procurement processes. One focus, for example, is the installation of solar systems on municipal buildings and roofs. This should help to increase the proportion of clean energy generation in Leipzig and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

Leipzig is investing heavily in basic research and planning services for heat planning and the heat transition. This includes the development of strategies and measures for efficient heat utilisation as well as the expansion of heating networks and renewable heat sources. Leipzig is planning and realising the expansion of solar thermal plants (including Germany's largest solar thermal plant in Leipzig-Lausen) in order to generate renewable energy from sunlight and strengthen the local energy

supply. Another focus is the planning of a waste heat pipeline from the Leuna industrial site, which will feed industrial waste heat into the city's district heating network.

In the area of mobility, the city also relies on a multidimensional mix of measures, e.g. by implementing the superblock approach. This aims to reduce traffic and improve the quality of life in certain neighbourhoods. This is achieved by setting up car-free zones, promoting pedestrian zones and improving local public transport. Another priority is the expansion of cycle paths to promote cycling and to increase the proportion of environmentally friendly modes of transport. This includes the creation of safe cycle paths, bicycle parking facilities and the promotion of bicycle hire systems. Special attention is being paid to the north of Leipzig, where urban development measures are planned that address sustainability and climate protection. These include the creation of green spaces, the promotion of renewable energies and the development of sustainable transport concepts.

The city of Leipzig promotes the sustainable supply of regional and seasonal food to the city's population. As part of the Biostädte network, Leipzig promotes the expansion of organic options in communal catering, particularly in school and day-care centre catering. With the local food strategy, we are pursuing the further development of urban-rural partnerships to promote the ecological cultivation of land and to increase regional added value.

In order to be able to clearly localise measures in the EU system, the success factors explained were assigned to the EU system as follows.

# DIGITALISATION AS A TRANSFORMATION ENABLER

The European Green Deal recognises digital technologies as a key prerequisite for achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals and aims to provide concrete support in line with the European Union's digital strategy with the EU's Digital Compass. Digital solutions and processes will provide support in all fields of action of the EKSP and contribute to more sustainable urban development (Green Smart City). Among other things, resource-saving - because digitalised and optimised - workflows, intelligently controlled mobility and integrated urban development that takes climate protection into account and can model climate impacts will help here. Climate protection measures, for example, can be planned in a more targeted manner, their real impact measured and linked with other influencing factors and data sources external to the city (e.g. weather, traffic) to form a climate protection monitoring system. Energy and resource consumption will be countered by energy-saving technologies and the collection and processing of only the necessary data. By participating in the EU project SPARCS for the development of energy-positive neighbourhoods (PEDs), the City of Leipzig is working with Leipzig's municipal utilities, municipal housing companies and SMEs in the real-world laboratory to test innovative, digital approaches to achieving climate neutrality and the energy transition. Solutions are being developed and tested here, particularly in the two sectors of heat and electricity, which also enable the realisation of virtual power plants in the city area, among other things. As part of the EKSP, the City of Leipzig is also focussing on the development of digital twins in

the areas of energy, heat planning, transport and climate adaptation. By using the twins for planning, scenarios and monitoring urban development processes, these can be accelerated, interactions recognised earlier and more targeted decisions made. The Digital City Unit operates the Leipzig App (City App) and is developing it further. The app is already a communication and transaction tool for around 30,000 Leipzig residents. Alongside leipzig.de, it will play an important role in the further implementation and scaling process of the Climate City Contract.

# 4. Process and principles

## 4 Process and principles

### PROCESS CONTROL

With the establishment of the Sustainable Development and Climate Protection Department, as a concrete consequence of the resolution on Leipzig's climate emergency, a new organisational unit has existed within the Department of Environment, Climate, Order and Sport since 1 July 2020, which is responsible for the systematic implementation of the city-wide sustainability and climate protection process in the city administration. Unique in Germany, the department works together with dedicated climate protection managers in the following relevant specialist departments to steer cross-departmental and cross-sector collaboration through the climate protection core team: Urban Development, Mobility, Building Management, Urban Greenery and Water, Digitalisation and Internal Organisation, Sport, Environmental Protection, as well as Economic Development, Strategic Cultural Policy and the Sustainable Development and Climate Protection Department.

Together with the Digital City Unit, the implementation of the EU mission and the development and monitoring of the Climate City Contract is carried out as a transition team (see Fig. Governance). This enables the topics of climate neutrality, energy transition and digital transformation to be tackled together as challenges for society as a whole and solutions to be developed in a co-creative process involving political stakeholders, science, business, civil society and citizens.

### COOPERATION PARTNER

With the Leipziger Gruppe (L-Group) as a wholly-owned municipal subsidiary, the City of Leipzig has far-reaching management options in the business areas of energy and heat supply (Leipziger Stadtwerke LSW), mobility (Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe LVB) and water (Leipziger Wasserwerke, Leipziger Sportbäder LWW). In addition to the premises of economic efficiency and customer orientation, the original business areas of the L-Group are orientated in particular towards future viability and the city-wide goals of climate neutrality, sustainable development and the common good. This is based on the Group strategy "Secure, sustainable and digital for Leipzig - at home in the transformation", which the Supervisory Board of LVV (as the holding company of the L Group) presented to the City of Leipzig as shareholder in December 2023. The L-Group is driving forward the energy and heating transition, the transport transition and water-sensitive urban development and sustainably securing services of general interest for the Leipzig region. Leipziger Stadtwerke began phasing out the supply of district heating based on lignite as early as 2022. New generation capacities of around 250 megawatts are being built for this purpose. This includes the Leipzig Süd combined heat and power plant with storage capacities of at least 1,500 megawatt hours. Another strategic approach is the increased utilisation of unavoidable waste heat from the industrial sector. Stadtwerke will continue to drive forward the expansion of renewable energies from wind and solar power in the coming years. The aim is to install half of the city's current load of new renewable capacity. The basis for this is an ambitious transformation plan that sets out the path to a climate-neutral heat supply. In the mobility sector, LVB is a key partner in the mobility transition with public transport passenger numbers of 153.3 million (2023). Therefore, the long-term goal is not only to switch to climate-neutral drives, but also to significantly increase passenger numbers.

With a portfolio of almost 36,700 flats (10.6% of flats throughout Leipzig), the municipal subsidiary Leipziger Wohnungsbaugesellschaft (LWB) fulfils a secure and socially responsible housing

supply on behalf of the city. In doing so, the LWB sets energy standards and integrates renewable energies in new construction and refurbishment and contributes to the city's refurbishment target. In order to contribute to the city's climate neutrality target, the LWB is guided by its sustainability scenario, which assumes an energy-efficient refurbishment rate of 2.1 per cent. The aim is to phase out all fossil-fuelled systems and switch to district heating/heat pumps. For buildings with gas systems with low energy efficiency (cat. F-H), the target standard is efficiency house standard EH 85 (61-73 kWh/m 2), for listed buildings EH 100/115 (74-86: 87-99 kWh/m 2), for buildings cat. D (100-130 kWh/m2), E (130-160 kWh/m2) the target is EH 70 (48-60 kWh/m2), for buildings from EH 115 the target is EH 70 + conversion of fossil fuels to heat pumps. This means an investment requirement (including indexed cost extrapolation) of EUR 635 million. At the same time, the focus is on developing a green and intergenerationally fair environment. This includes planting, mobility stations (car sharing, e-bikes), parcel boxes and rainwater retention and infiltration on the site. By the end of 2023, the LWB had installed 97 photovoltaic systems with a total output of 4.07 MWp. PV systems with a total output of 1 MWp will be added in 2024 alone. The systems will be installed and operated by the wholly owned subsidiary WSL Wohnen &amp; Service Leipzig GmbH. Since 2023, the LWB has also been supporting the construction of PV balcony power plants by tenants.

# STAKEHOLDER COMMITMENT AND ENGAGEMENT

Cities such as Leipzig are prepared to make a significant contribution to achieving the Paris Climate Agreement, but cannot realise this within the municipal framework alone. A municipality's sphere of influence depends on the accompanying political and economic framework conditions set by the EU, the federal government and the federal states. Together with the City of Dresden as another Mission City, we have also been able to obtain the support of the Free State of Saxony with the letter from the Minister President.

In addition, the efforts of all social actors in Leipzig are needed to achieve the vision of climate neutrality. Together with the Leipzig Group, local companies, committed institutions and an active citizenry, the City of Leipzig is a committed driver of climate protection on the ground. During the development process for this Climate City Agreement, various workshops were held with institutional and private sector stakeholder groups (business, science, social organisations) to communicate the idea and aspirations of the EU mission and the city's climate protection goals and to promote joint commitment. Action days with committed civil society (Future Day 2023) and the Saxon Energy Days (2024) in cooperation with the Saxon Ministry of Energy, Climate Protection and Agriculture in cooperation with the Saxony Consumer Advice Centre were also used to motivate a wide range of stakeholder groups to sign the Leipzig Preamble to the Climate City Agreement and to introduce their own measures and to implement a cross-sector network. The signatories of the Climate City Agreement were explicitly asked to document and submit their own measures and strategies in the field of climate protection and adaptation¹.

The participating companies, scientific organisations and social institutions share a common vision of an environmentally friendly, climate-protecting and community-oriented city. They see it as their responsibility to promote local quality of life, regional value creation and diversity, while actively involving the people of the city. The motivation of the signatories is to shape the city of Leipzig as a liveable and sustainable place that combines economic prosperity, social justice and ecological responsibility in a sustainable way. They are endeavouring to actively contribute to overcoming the climate crisis through their commitment and at the same time to act as a role model for other cities in Europe.

With the Environmental Research Centre (UFZ) and the German Biomass Research Centre (DBFZ), institutions of national importance are involved in the Climate City Agreement. With DHL, the University Hospital, BMW, Porsche and the state-owned company Sächsisches Immobilien- und Baumanagement, Leipzig's largest employers are also signatories to the Climate City Agreement.

They act as drivers, multipliers and ambassadors of this ambitious project and want to be part of a European pioneering city that is committed to the local transformation by proposing solutions.

With the large number of measures submitted, the participants have committed themselves to close cooperation with the activation of private capital for future-oriented investments to jointly massively increase energy and resource efficiency and significantly reduce overall urban emissions. Research institutions provide important findings for the political decision-making level and accompanied research while the public sector acts as an initiator and implementer of measures. The economy can make a major contribution to achieving sustainability goals through technological innovations and low-resource business models, while civil society acts as a driver for democratic activation and change processes and demands binding climate targets with corresponding measures.

# UPDATING AND MONITORING

The development and updating of the Leipzig Climate City Contract builds on the existing cooperation and participation processes as well as existing network structures of the City of Leipzig in the area of climate protection. In addition to the institutionalisation of a climate advisory board in accordance with the Saxon municipal code, companies, organisations and institutions from various industries and sectors are also integrated into the work process. The Leipzig Energy Efficiency and Climate Protection Network (EEKN), which was initiated in 2019 in cooperation with Leipziger Stadtwerke and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, provides an important platform for the implementation of measures and knowledge transfer and advises private sector players on effective climate protection measures and shows ways to achieve sustainable corporate transformation. A Leipzig cohort from the Climate City Contract will begin its work after submission.

A holistic approach underlies the monitoring of the Climate City Contract, which takes into account all sources of emissions caused by the City of Leipzig or the municipal economy and ties in with the monitoring of the EKSP. Various indicators such as the renewable share of the city's overall energy requirements, modal split indicators and the city's green supply are regularly reviewed to ensure that Leipzig remains on track. Both the measures of the Energy and Climate Protection Programme 2030 and the Leipzig Climate City Agreement are subject to a two-year reporting process and are continuously evaluated. The uniform nationwide method of greenhouse gas balancing according to the BISKO standard used in the Energy and Climate Protection Programme 2030 will be taken into account. Furthermore, the city's measures and strategies (e.g. heat planning, mobility strategy) are regularly updated and adapted to current urban developments in order to make the best possible contribution to achieving the climate targets. Findings from other cities as well as national and international bodies (German Association of Cities, Eurocities, Climate Alliance, EU Mission 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities, StronGER Cities, Smart City Community model projects) are incorporated to ensure that Leipzig is always at the cutting edge of technological, socio-political and scientific developments.

The city has developed a participation concept that enables the population to be actively involved in the discussion and implementation of climate protection targets and measures. To this end, regular workshops and events (analogue and online) are held to actively involve citizens in the energy and climate protection process. Important platforms include high-profile events such as climate conferences, the Ökofete, Klimafair and the annual city cycling event, as well as cooperation with climate groups and the active urban community. Further close cooperation with civil society players in the sense of the bottom-up approach is being sought.

The concrete participation process for updating the Climate City Contract will be part of Leipzig's application for the EU mission's Enabling City Transformation Programme (October 2024).

# EU-Mission „100 klimaneutrale und smarte Städte bis 2030“
unser gemeinsames Engagement

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

mit Beschluss des Stadtrates im Oktober 2022 hat sich die Stadt Leipzig das Ziel gesetzt, bis zum Jahr 2040 die Klimaneutralität erreicht zu haben. Meilensteine und Maßnahmen sind dazu im Energie- und Klimaschutzprogramm 2030 der Stadt Leipzig beschrieben.

Ein wesentlicher Baustein zur Realisierung dieses ambitionierten Ziels ist die Mitwirkung an der EU-Mission „100 klimaneutrale und smarte Städte bis 2030“. Als Präsident des Städtenetzwerks EUROCITIES freut es mich persönlich sehr, Teil dieser EU-weiten Mission zu sein und als Vorreiterstadt unsere Ideen, Projekte und Lösungsvorschläge einzubringen.

Dieses ambitionierte Vorhaben braucht gemeinsames Handeln und kann dann erfolgreich gelingen, wenn sich alle Akteure miteinander dieser gesamtgesellschaftlichen Aufgabe stellen. Gemeinsam mit Ihnen, als Vorreiter im Klimaschutz, möchten wir den Klimastadtvertrag als das erste gesamtstädtische Energie- und Klimaschutzprogramm erstellen. Mit einer Vielzahl von Aktivitäten wollen wir so – Stadtverwaltung und Unternehmen, Verbände und Forschungseinrichtung, Zivilgesellschaft und Bürgerschaft – unseren Beitrag für ein klimaneutrales Leipzig leisten.

Unter Leitung der städtischen Referate – Referat für Nachhaltige Entwicklung und Klimaschutz und Referat Digitale Stadt – wird bis September 2024 in einer Vielzahl von Mitwirkungsformaten der Leipziger Klimastadtvertrag erarbeitet. Diesen wollen wir, nach gemeinsamer Unterzeichnung, nach Brüssel zur Bewertung senden. Sollten wir eine positive Bewertung durch die EU-Kommission erhalten, ermöglicht uns das verliehene Mission-Label einen erleichterten Zugang zu EU-Fördergeldern.

Wir möchten Sie gerne dafür gewinnen, Ihre Perspektive, Ihre Ideen, Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten und praktischen Ansätze zur wirksamen Einsparung von Treibhausgasen in den Arbeitsprozess zum Klimastadtvertrag einzubringen.

Nutzen Sie unsere gemeinsame Mission, um – künftig dann mit dem offiziellen Mission-Label der EU – Ihr Engagement mit der Unterzeichnung der beiliegenden Präambel und mit der Einstellung auf der Leipziger Online-Plattform „Klimaneutrale und smarte Stadt Leipzig“ sichtbar zu machen.

Profitieren Sie von der Gemeinschaft, die wir als Wissens- und Kooperationsplattform aufbauen, engagieren Sie sich in Netzwerken wie dem Energieeffizienz- und Klimaschutznetzwerk, um sich auf dem Weg zur Klimaneutralität begleiten, beraten und inspirieren zu lassen.

Ich bin überzeugt, dass Leipzig als ein europäisches Innovationszentrum – wie Paris, Barcelona oder Kopenhagen – von der Vernetzung profitiert und als Vorbild für andere Städte wirkt.

Über Ihr Mitwirken und Ihre Rückmeldung würde ich mich sehr freuen!

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

# Der Leipziger Klimastadtvertrag – gemeinsam in eine lebenswerte Zukunft

Umweltverträglich, klimaschonend und gemeinwohlorientiert – mit der Transformation zur klimaneutralen Stadt wollen wir Leipzig für die Herausforderungen der Zukunft wappnen.

## Das Ziel

Im Pariser Klimaschutzabkommen wurde 2015 das Ziel ausgerufen, den weltweiten Temperaturanstieg möglichst auf 1,5 Grad Celsius, auf jeden Fall auf deutlich unter 2 Grad Celsius zu beschränken. Diesem Ziel fühlt sich die Stadt Leipzig verpflichtet und hat mit Beschluss des Leipziger Energie- und Klimaschutzprogramm 2030 das klimapolitische Ziel einer klimaneutralen Stadt bis 2040 festgelegt. Bereits bis zum Jahr 2030 wird damit eine Halbierung des gesamtstädtischen Treibhausgas-Ausstoßes angestrebt.

## Der Weg

Gemeinsam wollen wir für die Gesundheit und Lebensqualität aller Bürgerinnen und Bürger in unserer Stadt eine naturnahe Urbanität schaffen, die Teilhabe und Vielfalt fördert und regionale Wertschöpfung generiert. Nachhaltige Flächennutzungsplanung, regionale Ernährungs- und Kreislaufwirtschaft und eine klimaneutrale Energie- und Wärmeversorgung in einer Stadt der kurzen Wege sind nur einige Ansätze, die wir im intensiven Austausch weiterentwickeln. Dabei setzen wir schon heute unterschiedlichste Maßnahmen um, bei denen eine klimagerechte Quartiersentwicklung und digitale Steuerungsmechanismen ineinandergreifen. Die aktive Beteiligung der Menschen in unserer Stadt ist uns dabei ein besonderes Anliegen, denn nur gemeinsam finden wir die besten Lösungen für die Herausforderungen unserer Zeit.

## Die EU-Mission

Unser ambitioniertes Vorhaben kann dann erfolgreich gelingen, wenn sich alle Akteure miteinander dieser gesamtgesellschaftlichen Aufgabe stellen – in unserer Stadt, wie im Austausch mit den Kommunen der EU-Initiative „100 klimaneutrale und smarte Städte bis 2030“.

## Unser Beitrag

Wir freuen uns, Teil dieser EU-weiten Mission zu sein und als Vorreiterstadt unsere Ideen, Projekte und Lösungsvorschläge einzubringen um die notwendige Transformation lokal zu gestalten. Als klimabewusste Leipziger möchten wir mit dem Klimastadtvertrag das erste gesamtstädtische Energie- und Klimaschutzprogramm vorlegen. Mit einer Vielzahl von Aktivitäten wollen wir so einen Beitrag für ein klimaneutrales Leipzig leisten und werden diese gemeinsam mit der Stadtverwaltung vereinbaren und dokumentieren. Leipzig wird damit – wie Paris, Barcelona oder Kopenhagen – ein europäisches Innovationszentrum, das von der Vernetzung profitiert und als Vorbild für andere Städte wirkt.
