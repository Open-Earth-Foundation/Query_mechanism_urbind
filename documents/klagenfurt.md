# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

For several years the city of Klagenfurt follows extensive climate action measures. Thanks to these measures, a significant reduction of GHG emissions has already been achieved in recent years. Nevertheless, as illustrated in the action plan, further measures will be necessary to reach the envisaged climate neutrality till 2030. The climate actions are a combination of direct GHG emissions measures (83% from the baseline year 2011) and GHG emissions compensation measures (17%). Most of the climate actions can be primarily categorized as "hard actions" as their focus is on the creation of new infrastructure (e.g. the electrification of the entire bus fleet). However, in most cases these primarily "hard action" projects also involve "soft actions", such as raising awareness and behavioral changes (e.g. it's not sufficient to introduce electric buses in Klagenfurt without a corresponding shift from private mobility toward public mobility). Generally speaking, the necessary actions for reaching climate neutrality are in the fields of energy systems, mobility &amp; transport, and the built environment. For the successful implementation of the targeted climate actions, it is necessary that local authorities, local businesses, society as a whole and any relevant stakeholders cooperate and strive together for the goal of climate neutrality by 2030.

# 1 Introduction

The introduction should outline the local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and describe the gap it is addressing in broad terms.

## Introduction - textual element

In the 1st version of the Smart City Strategy (SCS) Klagenfurt, politically decided in 2018, GHG neutrality by 2050 was set. The city council decided on 25.5.2021, to bring forward the targets: The goal of the current smart city strategy version 6.0 is to reduce GHG by 70% by 2030 and by 90% by 2040, based on the baseline year 2011. Due to the participation in the EU-Cities Mission the city council decided on 30.12.2021 to reduce direct GHG by 80% and compensate residual emissions by 2030.

Thanks to the extensive measures of the city of Klagenfurt and all involved stakeholders, an outstanding reduction of GHG emissions from the baseline year (2011) to the most recent inventory (2018) could be achieved. Nevertheless, to reach the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 further 219.000t of GHG emissions need to be saved. Due to its pioneering role towards climate neutrality, the city of Klagenfurt has clear and quite ambitious climate actions sketched to reach the 2030 goal. This means, that if all planned climate actions will be successfully implemented, there will not be any gap. However, besides the presence of the sketched climate action plan, the city of Klagenfurt always welcomes further innovative climate action ideas as there might be some unpredicted challenges with the planned actions.

# 2 Work Process

This section should list the working steps carried out, for example along the NZC Climate Transition Map, or related steps planned as well as outline timeline and milestones for future iterations for the continuous development of the Action Plan.

## Work Process - combination of textual and visual elements

As it can be observed in figure 01, Klagenfurt managed to achieve a significant GHG emissions reduction from the baseline year 2011. From 2011 to the most recent GHG inventory of 2018 (GHG emissions inventory for 2020 is currently being finalized) GHG emissions could be reduced by about 53%. The strongest reduction took place in the field of electricity followed by district heating. A smaller (but still notable) reduction could be achieved in the field of end energy while GHG emissions from traffic remained constant.

From a thematic point of view, the city of Klagenfurt will focus on the following topics to reduce and compensate GHG emissions and thus achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The below listed documents are further presented in the attached figure 02 (key measures for GHG reductions) and figure 03 (key measures for compensation).

### Energy systems:

) Implementation of district cooling for selected larger companies and/or establishments in the city center (direct GHG emissions reduction)
) Expansion of district heating system (direct GHG emissions reduction)
) Replacement of natural gas by green synthetic gas, which will be important for companies which are currently still dependent on gas, or private buildings for which an alternative to gas is currently not feasible (direct GHG emissions reduction)
) Photovoltaic projects on municipality buildings (compensation measures)
) Energy storage (compensation measure)
) Photovoltaic projects in the central area of Carinthia (compensation measure)

### Mobility and transport:

) Klagenfurt Electric Bus Investment Project (KEBIP), leading to a GHG emissions free public transport (direct GHG emissions reduction measure)
) Expansion of e-mobility by the installation of further charging points targeted for individual and delivery traffic (direct GHG emissions reduction measure)
) Change of mobility behavior including bike and e-car sharing within the city (direct GHG emissions reduction)
) Change of mobility behavior in the central area of Carinthia – commuters (compensation measure)

### Built environment and housing:

) Thermal building renovation is expected to lead to the strongest GHG emissions reductions. Particularly measures such as isolation and improvements of heating systems of older buildings show high potential (direct GHG emissions reduction)

) Use of renewable raw materials (wood) in building industry (compensation measure)

Nature based and other innovative solutions:
) Smart City offensive with economy and private developers (direct GHG emissions reduction)
) Implementation of Smart City Measures (direct GHG emissions reduction)
) Forestation of open spaces (compensation measure)
) Climate projects in the central area of Carinthia (compensation measure)
) Other CCS projects (compensation measure)

For reaching the envisaged climate neutrality, it is fundamental to include society in the corresponding transformation processes. We therefore developed the Climamundus project which focuses on demonstrating and informing people on various climate action impact measures. Climamundus was submitted to the first NZC Call in November 2022.

In order to further include society, companies and organizations in the necessary transformations, the implementation of a Smart City Lab is planned. The aim of this lab is to connect various actors for climate action measures and prepare their ideas for project funding submissions. The establishment of the Smart City Lab has been submitted for funding and first staff has been hired.

Due to the tense financial situation of Klagenfurt, the implementation of climate actions strongly depends on corresponding project calls. There are many project ideas in the "pipeline" waiting for a corresponding call. The team of the climate and environment department is already looking forward to the next NZC call.

# 3 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

Part A "Current State of Climate Action" describes the point of departure of the city towards climate neutrality, including commitments and strategies of key local businesses, and informs the subsequent modules and the outlined pathways to accelerated climate action.

# 3.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

Module A-1 "Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory" should detail and describe the city's latest GHG inventory to establish the emission baseline and to establish the emissions gap to 2030 climate neutrality according to the inventory specifications defined in the Cities Mission's Info Kit for Cities and the process outlined in the Action Plan Guidance.

Please note: As Klagenfurt is a front runner city in terms of climate action and thus an Austrian leading city with several GHG emission inventories based on the methodology of the covenant of mayors (using LCA in t CO2eq). A common standardized GHG emission inventory approach is currently being planned together with the largest Austrian Cities following the tool kit by the EU. In this course, it is planned to update the emission inventory of the city of Klagenfurt by latest December 2024. Hereby a more recent baseline year (2018) will be used as well.

Figure 01: GHG emissions and saving 2011 – 2018 – 2030

A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

In 2011, most GHG emissions were in the field of electricity (244,000t GHG emissions), followed by other end energy (218,000t GHG emissions). GHG emissions from the field of traffic accumulate to 181,000t, while district heating was responsible for about 107,000t GHG emissions.

Please note: Klagenfurt uses the LCA method and refers to CO2e (equivalent) emissions. Other GHG emissions besides carbon dioxide are included in the mentioned CO2e emissions, but not exclusively reported. The above-mentioned Scope 2 values include both upstream emissions and direct emissions from local combustion.

# 3.2 Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

Module A-2 "Current Policies and Strategies" should list relevant policies, strategies, initiatives or regulation from local, regional and national level, relevant to the city's climate neutrality transition.

|  Local | Smart City Strategy Klagenfurt Version 6.1 | In the 1st version of the Smart City Strategy Klagenfurt, politically decided in 2018, GHG neutrality by 2050 was set. The city council decided on 25.5.2021, to bring forward the targets: The goal of the current smart city strategy version 6.0 is to reduce GHG by 70% by 2030 and by 90% by 2040, based on the baseline year 2011. Due to the participation in the EU-Cities Mission the city council decided on 30.12.2021 to reduce direct GHG by 80% and compensate residual emissions by 2030. | The Smart City Strategy is very relevant for reaching the envisaged climate neutrality by 2030 as it is the guiding strategy for all climate action measures. | All climate actions are directly or indirectly also contained in the Smart City Strategy.  |
|  Local | City Development Concept STEK2020+ | The city development concept is a local development concept whose legal basis is the Carinthian Municipal Planning Act. It includes, for example, the concept of natural space, population development, urban green and open spaces, mobility and infrastructure, economic mission statement, analysis of urban potentials. |  |   |
|  Local | Covenant of mayors | In 2011, the city of Klagenfurt am Wörthersee joined the "Covenant of Mayors1". joined. This initiative aims to achieve the EU's 20-20-20 targets, such as: - Increasing energy efficiency by 20%, - Increasing the share of renewable energy sources by 20%, - Reducing GHG emissions by 20% by 2020. |  |   |
|  Regional | Mobilityconcept Klagenfurt 2035 | Against the background of already existing goals, strategies and concepts in the present an overall mobility concept for Klagenfurt with a time horizon of 2035, was developed. The focus was on a reorientation of urban public transport, but beyond that the other modes of transport were also to be included. The mobility concept is based on a mission statement, which forms the foundation for the subsequent definition and determination of goals and measures. |  |   |

# A-2.2: Description &amp; assessment of policies

The above-described measures, which are at different stages (implemented, in the process of implementation, in preparation), strongly contribute to Klagenfurt's envisaged climate neutrality by 2030. Assessments however show, that further measures will be necessary. These measures may regard intensifications of in A-2.1 contained topics (mobility) as well as new approaches of further topics (e.g. energetic building renovations).

Please note: the base year in this document is 2011, so there is an 83% reduction in GHG emissions based on 2011. Klagenfurt also has another GHG inventory based on data from 2018. Therefore, the defined climate measures refer to the period 2018-2030.

As mentioned above, the emission inventory of the city of Klagenfurt will be updated by latest December 2024, including the application of a more recent baseline year (2018).

# 3.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

Module A-3 “Systemic Barriers to 2030 Climate Neutrality” should document the results of the stakeholder, systems and ecosystem mapping and identification of systemic barriers and opportunities.

|  System description | Stakeholders involved | Influence  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Technology | - BABEG (Kärntner Betriebsansiedlungs- und Beteiligungsgesellschaft)
Lakeside Science & Technology Park | Support the establishment of climate-friendly, technology-driven businesses. The main technology for the transition towards climate neutrality however needs to be acquired at the world market (e.g. e-cars, e-buses)
Openness of these stakeholders towards new technologies and their acknowledgment for climate protection may foster the 2030 goal; stubbornness instead may slow down the process.  |
|  Finance and business models | - Chamber of commerce (Carinthia / Austria)
Banks
FI, EIP | Strong influence as the city of Klagenfurt as well as companies and organizations need capital for the implementation of climate actions. Besides having a strong direct influence, banks etc. may take a leading role towards climate neutrality and hereby encourage others to follow the same path. New approaches to financing, e.g. such as climate bonds will create opportunities for climate actions; their absence instead may slow down the process.  |
|  Governance, policy and regulation | - BMK
Provincial government Carinthia
City senate and municipal council | Stakeholders belonging to this category not only set the legal framework conditions for necessary measures toward climate neutrality but also have the possibility to directly (financially) support them; through subsidy, grant etc.)
A large barrier in this category represents frequent political changes - particularly after elections, but also after unforeseen political resignations. Missing plannability represents a large barrier for many climate actions.  |
|  Democracy, social innovation and social change | - Society
(high) schools
University of applied science Carinthia
University of Klagenfurt
Social Organizations (Diakonie, Caritas)
Hospital Klagenfurt | For reaching climate neutrality, it is necessary that all parts of society act in concert. Therefore, sensibilization of the topic is necessary, starting with the youngest at schools, with students at the university, or with socially marginalized groups. Through cooperation with social organizations and social innovations, it must be assured that all parts of society are considered in climate actions.
Possible barriers in this system regard the challenge to reach all parts of society and encourage them to actively participate in climate actions and change their daily life behavior.  |
|  Capacity and capabilities | - Zentralraum Kärnten,
KWF
Neighboring communities | Despite the many climate actions within the city of Klagenfurt, to actually achieve climate neutrality it will be necessary to implement measures reaching beyond the city borders. By cooperating with the stakeholders belonging to this category it will be possible to enhance the capacity and capabilities needed for the implementation of climate actions beyond the city limits. Possible barriers regard missing cooperation and prioritization of own goals, leading to a neglection of the common need to foster climate actions.  |
|  Industry | - Influential companies
Companies (general)
Kärntner Messen | Through goal-oriented measures, also Klagenfurt's industry can strongly contribute to reaching climate neutrality.
Corresponding measures can regard either directly the company's production and operation process or important side aspects (e.g. employee mobility). While the industry might be generally open for innovative climate action measures, they often have to compete on the international market. As climate action measures usually do not pay off  |
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

AM WÖRTHERSEE

|   |  | in the short run, inexpensive competition might represent a barrier to implement them.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Transport | - Klagenfurt Mobil GmbH
Verkehrsverbund Kärnten GmbH
Mobilitätsplattform Österreich
ÖBB, mobility companies,
Logistikcenter Fürnitz
E-car sharing
E-scooter sharing | Stakeholders belonging to this group have a high influence for achieving Klagenfurt's climate neutrality as transport is currently one of the central GHG emission sources. The corresponding stakeholders regard passenger transport and cargo transport and stretches its boundaries inside and outside the city.
A fundamental barrier in the transportation system often regards the old mindsets of competitive thinking instead of goal-oriented cooperation.  |
|  Energy | - Bioenergie Kärnten
KDSG (Klagenfurt Dachstrom Gesellschaft)
Stadtwerke Klagenfurt AG
VDSG (Villacher Dachstrom GmbH) | This group of stakeholders has a high influence as they generate energy and heat for the city of Klagenfurt. High potential lies in a further GHG emission reduction of the district heating, the generation of locally produced green energy and intelligent use of waste heat, which can only be achieved if stakeholders belonging to this group cooperate.
Barriers in the energy system are mostly external (e.g. hurdles due to legislation) and not directly from the involved stakeholders.  |
|  Waste and land use | Abfallwirtschaftsverband |   |
|  Housing and building | - Schools and universities (BIG)
Housing developers (public and private)
Current and future house owners | Achieving climate neutrality strongly depends on stakeholders belonging to the housing and building category. Fundamental aspects regard energy generation (photovoltaic on roofs and façade), reductions on energy consumptions (insulation) as well as aspects of sustainable mobility. Housing and building stakeholders not only have high potential when constructing a building, but also when executing building renovations. Barriers regards the missing openness of building engineers (for considering innovative climate actions when planning a building) as well as current and future house owners. The same is valid for the public side (BIG), where missing openness for innovative climate actions in the building sector can represent a large barrier.  |

## A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers – textual elements

Due to the complexity and the necessary transition in various systems, the extensive goal of reaching climate neutrality by 2030 involves many barriers, which need to be overcome:

Population (commitment): There is currently a broad political consensus on achieving climate neutrality in 2030, but this goal is not yet firmly anchored in the population. The positive mood could change if the population has to make noticeable savings and increase fees in order to finance climate protection measures. The next municipal elections are not until March 2026, which means that there is a relatively large window of opportunity to objectively inform the population and actively involve them in the process toward climate neutrality. Compensatory measures must be found for socially disadvantaged population groups.

Infrastructure and mobility: mobility is responsible for most GHG emissions. A large-scale transformation however is very challenging. Society and all relevant actors are often stubborn and don't have the urgently needed open mindset.

Funds, project calls, and other financial support

Funding: due to the Corona pandemic, the city cannot balance its financial budget and must cover the loss with reserves. If it is not possible to secure the investments needed to achieve the climate goals through grants and loans, their implementation is at risk. Many of the climate actions planned are therefore strongly dependent on financial support through corresponding project calls at regional, national and international levels.

Regional, national and European strategies and laws: suitable strategies and laws can represent a large enhancer and lever, while unsuitable ones can represent a large barrier and, in some cases, may even hinder innovative and urgently needed projects completely.

Price increases: due to the war in Ukraine and market instabilities, certain sectors currently experience extreme price increases (high inflation). Such unpredictable price increases represent a risk for the implementation of planned projects and measures.

Obviously, none of the above-mentioned barriers can be entirely removed. Nevertheless, thanks to the progress the city of Klagenfurt already made towards climate neutrality and the experience with successfully implementing climate actions, they can be significantly reduced. Thanks to the expertise the involved team has, possible modifications and adaptations of climate actions to overcome unforeseen barriers are shortly possible.

## A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

Klagenfurt has been committed to the active participation of citizens in the form of participatory processes for several years. For example, events have already been held for ongoing projects and the attitude of the population has been captured and considered correspondingly. The project "SLiKH - Smart Living in Klagenfurt Harbach", a feasibility study for the development of one of the 8 Smart City target areas of the city, can be mentioned as an example. In multi-stage workshops, the ideas and needs for the urban development project were requested from the citizens and considered. In the currently running funding project "Mission Klagenfurt climate neutral and smart by 2030" in preparation for participation in the EU-Cities Mission, a participation process was initiated in which students from two Klagenfurt schools helped to shape and develop climate neutrality for Klagenfurt in a foresight process. The results from this involvement of youth shaped the city's Smart City Strategy, which focuses on climate neutrality by 2030. Thus, already today youth has the possibility to influence city short- and long-term developments. To foster this approach further, a youth advisory board is to be established to act as an advisory body on major projects, including climate neutrality. As further activities of the city, a public workshop series can be mentioned, about which information is regularly provided on various topics of climate change.

With the recently submitted Climamundus project and the included task to establish a Climatefund, the active participation of citizens is further strengthened and their role reaches a new level as they can receive financial support for their own climate action measure projects.

Additionally, the previously introduced Smart City Lab, is an approach to further enhance the active participation of citizens and relevant stakeholders. The lab will be located directly in the center of Klagenfurt and thus offers a low-threshold possibility of citizens to inform themselves and engage in climate action projects.

Last but not least, a youth advisory board is currently established. The central aim of this board is to act as an advisory body on major projects, particularly on project in the field of climate neutrality.

## 4 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B represents the core of the Action Plan, shaped by local authorities, local businesses and stakeholders, comprising of the most essential elements: scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, action portfolios and indicators for monitoring, evaluation and learning.

## 4.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Module B-1 "Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways" should list impact pathways, early and late outcomes and direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits) according to and adapted from the NZC Theory of Change and the AP Guidance – clustered by fields of action.

All six levers will be relevant for the corresponding fields of action. The impact of each lever, however, may vary significantly depending on the field of action and will change as the prevailing conditions will change in the future. The envisaged direct impact of the various levers is a reduction of GHG emissions, leading to climate neutrality by 2030. Indirect impacts instead mostly regard an improved quality of life and/or a better social cohesion.

# 4.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

Module B-2 "Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design" should contain a project description for each intervention planned, including interventions by local businesses and industry, according to the template B-2.1, including actions those interventions targeted at enhancing carbon sinks to address residual emissions. Narrative analysis and comments can be provided in B-2.2. A summary of how residual emissions are addressed, should be provided in B-2.3.

|  B-2.1: Description of action portfolios - textual or visual  |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Fields of action | Portfolio description  |   |
|   |  List of actions | Descriptions  |
|  Energy systems | 1) Implementation of district cooling
) Expansion of district heating system
) Replacement of natural gas by green synthetic gas
) Photovoltaic projects on municipality buildings
) Energy storage
) Photovoltaic projects in the central area of Carinthia | The actions belonging to the field of energy actions either regard direct GHG reduction measures or GHG compensation measures. Some of the actions are completely new implementations such as district cooling which until now does not exist in Klagenfurt, while others are an extension of already existing approaches (e.g. district heating system). Other actions require the development and implementation of innovative technologies (generation of green synthetic gas). Additionally, the started photovoltaic initiative needs to be further fostered on municipality buildings and in the future also energy storage systems such as large batteries will play an important role.  |
|  Mobility & transport | 7) Klagenfurt Electric Bus Investment Project (KEBIP)
) Expansion of e-mobility (individual and delivery traffic)
) Change of mobility behavior including bike and e-car sharing within the city
) Change of mobility behavior in the central area of Carinthia (commuters) | All mobility and transport actions strive towards an emission-free mobility. On one hand, by the electrification of the entire bus fleet, Klagenfurt will be one of the first cities offering completely GHG emission-free public transport. Together with measures aiming to intensify the use of public transport, a strong lever is targeted. On the other hand, when public transport is not possible, there will be a strong focus on fostering emission-free mobility (e.g. electric cars). Furthermore, several measures fostering bike usage are planned. These do not only include the construction of bike trails, but also priorities at busy intersections and safe parking facilities. For people not having their own bike at hand (e.g. as they arrive by public transport), the existing bike sharing system (nextbike) will be further extended  |
|  Built environment and housing | 11) Thermal building renovation
) Use of renewable raw materials (wood) in the building industry | Poorly insulated buildings and/or outdated heating systems are responsible for a large share of GHG emissions. Therefore, a thermal renovation campaign is needed. Where possible, in the course of this campaign, more houses will be connected to the city's district heating system. Furthermore, innovative measures for the usage of renewable raw materials (wood) in the building industry will lead to a reduction of emissions in the built environment  |
|  Nature-based and other innovative solutions | 13) Smart City offensive with economy and private developers
) Implementation of Smart City Measures
) Forestation of open spaces
) Climate projects in the central area of Carinthia
) Other CCS projects | The Smart City offensive with economy and private developers will be continued and concrete smart city measures implemented. Forestation of open spaces, climate projects in the central area of Carinthia, will be the most important compensation measures, as well as other CCS projects.  |

|   |  Action description | For reaching the envisaged climate neutrality, a fundamental change in mobility behavior is necessary. This primarily means, a switch from private individual mobility with cars towards public transport. Additionally, bike usage needs to be intensified. Even though the bike trail system in Klagenfurt was recently extended, to fully unfold its potential further extensions and renewals are necessary. At busy car intersections, a safe crossing for bikes must be guaranteed and generally, bikes must have priority over individual car traffic. Further measures to enhance the attractiveness of bike usage regard safe and practical parking positions. For people not having their own bike at hand (e.g. as they arrive by public transport), the well-functioning bike sharing system (nextbike) will be further extended.  |

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

Not applicable. The currently planned actions reduce GHG emissions by 83%. The remaining GHG emissions will be compensated by the above-described actions. n.b. the described actions include hard (infrastructure) measures and soft (compensation, raising awareness) measures.

# 4.3 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

Module B-3 "Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning" should contain a selection of indicators taken from the Comprehensive Indicator Sets developed by NZC. The following should be provided: An overview table listing the indicators selected per outcome and impact including targets and evaluation points (B-3.1); and a metadata table for each indicator selected, as specified in the Comprehensive Indicator Sets (B-3.2).

Since 2018 the city of Klagenfurt has a Smart City Strategy. In its latest version (Smart City Strategy V7.0), it contains nine fields of action with 25 targets which are measured by various indicators. The action fields of the Smart City Strategy and its indicators are strongly linked to the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) of the United Nation. While some of the fields of action match with the above-described climate actions, others are rather fundamental levers, turbocharging GHG emission reductions.

The latest version of indicators is currently under development. It is expected that many of them will be suitable for the CCC. The below-suggested indicators will be updated and adjusted as soon as the indicators from the latest Smart City Strategy are finalized.

Additionally, the GHG emissions of Klagenfurt are frequently analyzed by an external expert. It is foreseen to increase the frequency of GHG monitoring (e.g. every two years). A higher frequency will allow to identify successes and challenges on the way to climate neutrality faster and undertake corresponding measures.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  For a successful transition towards climate neutrality, it is fundamental to include all groups of society. Therefore, it is planned to develop and implement a Climatefund, aiming to financially support small-scale climate actions initiated by citizens. Through cooperation with social organizations, it will be assured that the accessibility of the Climatefund will be low-threshold and all social groups will be included. | Department of climate and environment protection (City of Klagenfurt) | City of Klagenfurt, social organizations (Diakonie, Caritas) | The Climatefund has two primary focuses. First through calls and corresponding events, workshops etc., it raises awareness about the importance for climate protection. Second, thanks to the financial support of small-scale climate actions, it actively fosters climate action measures. | Besides the positive climate effects, an important co-benefit will be the strengthening of the social cohesion. A strong social cohesion is not only important for successful climate actions but also for various other challenges we face (ageing society, energy crisis etc.)  |
|  **Intervention name: Smart City Lab**  |   |   |   |   |
|  The Smart City lab will be the contact point for anyone having a concrete climate action project in mind. Thus, firms, (social) organizations), individuals etc. The Smart City Lab team will evaluate the project idea, connect corresponding stakeholders and assist in setting up the project for submitting it to a funding agency | Department of climate and environment protection (City of Klagenfurt) | City of Klagenfurt | Many actors have climate action projects in mind. However, they are unsure about their feasibility and funding. Thus, these ideas often remain a single thought. The Smart City Lab offers large potential to evaluate such ideas and assist in its implementation. | A significant co-benefit will be the strengthened relationship of various actors. This strengthened relationship is not only relevant for climate actions, but also for many other challenges we face.  |

# C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions – textual and visual elements

The above-described social innovation interventions assure that all social groups are included in the transitions toward climate neutrality. The introduction of the Climatefund and the Smart City Lab may only be a starting point. In case the inclusion of all social groups will be dissatisfying, further social innovation interventions will be developed and introduced.

# 5.3 Module C-3 Financing of Action Portfolio

Module C-3 "Financing of Action Portfolio" should contain the list of action portfolios and interventions outlined in Modules B-2, and those from C-1 and C-2 with cost implication to provide a summary list of interventions that need to be unpacked in the Investment Plan.

# 6 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for further refining the Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract.

# Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration - textual elements

As general circumstances, climate and social challenges may be subject to unforeseeable changes, the climate city contract is a "living document". This means that single envisaged climate actions may be modified due to the given circumstances. The overall goal of climate neutrality by 2030 however remains the strict focus of all relevant stakeholders. Targeting this strict focus means that the city of Klagenfurt and relevant stakeholders work together on concretizing the above-described climate actions will in the following years.

# 1 Introduction

Explain your city's motivation to join the EU Mission “100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030” and highlight your city's present commitments to climate action. You may also want to include the aims of this document.

## Your text

The city of Klagenfurt has been a member of the European Climate Alliance Network since 1996. By joining the Covenant of Mayors through a unanimous municipal council and city senate resolution in 2011, Klagenfurt committed itself for the first time to meeting climate targets, voluntarily increasing energy efficiency and using sustainable energy sources. By joining the new Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy through a unanimous city senate resolution in 2016, this process was strengthened and measures to adapt to climate change were taken into account.

Additionally, a Smart City Strategy was developed together with Stadtwerke Klagenfurt AG and adopted by the city senate in November 2018. It includes all previous concepts on climate protection and sustainability. Progress is reported annually to the City Senate in the course of monitoring report. The goal is to reduce GHG emissions by 40% by 2030 and 90% by 2050, both relative to the baseline year 2011 while maintaining a good quality of life for the current population or enabling it for future generations.

As an interim result, the city senate decided in May 2021 to bring forward the previously mentioned targets: the new goal of the Smart City Strategy is to reduce GHG emissions by 70% by 2030 and 90% by 2040, relative to the baseline year of 2011, while incorporating the Sustainable Developments Goals (SDGs) as important indicators in the Smart City Strategy. By participating in the "EU Cities Mission" as one of 112 European cities aiming to become climate neutral by 2030, the already ambitious targets were further advanced to achieve this ambitious goal. This means that climate measures already implemented and/or planned in Klagenfurt will be intensified and new measures will be developed.

The City of Klagenfurt has identified various climate measures to be implemented in the following years until 2030 and beyond. These include both direct GHG emission reductions and GHG offsets. By participating in the EU Cities Mission, the ambitious goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2030 has been set. To achieve this, 83% of greenhouse gases are to be directly saved compared to the base year 2011 and 17% of the remaining emissions are to be compensated through climate protection measures in Klagenfurt and the central are of Carinthia.

The EU Cities Mission enables the exchange of experience and ideas with more than 100 other European cities and Klagenfurt expects to receive further inspiring ideas for climate measures. In addition, one of the central goals of the EU mission is to promote cooperation between stakeholders, which is essential for the successful path to climate neutrality. Based on this strengthened stakeholder cooperation, the city of Klagenfurt has the opportunity to apply for special "EU Cities Mission" calls and thus receive financial support for pioneering climate measures to achieve the 2030 target.

Achieving climate neutrality already by 2030 is a major organizational and budgetary challenge for a city, which in the case of the City of Klagenfurt requires close cooperation with the public utility provider (Stadtwerke Klagenfurt AG), the provincial government of Carinthia and the federal government - in particular the Federal Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (German short: BMK).

The main goal of this document is to inform stakeholder groups about the city's overall climate goals as well as planned climate action. Since circumstances, technologies, etc. may change on the path to climate neutrality by 2030, the Climate Roadmap can be considered a "living document." For this reason, stakeholders do not commit to fixed climate measures, but to their general support for Klagenfurt's climate neutrality goal.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Articulate your 2030 climate neutrality ambition, as expressed and defined in your Cities Mission Expression of Interest (EoI). This should include your ambition and commitment to a 2030 horizon as a whole city, as well as describe any exclusion areas and summarise how these areas would be addressed beyond 2030. (A more detailed plan for exclusion areas should be included in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.) Your 2030 ambition should be supported at a minimum by a Council decision, and it is recommended that it is also supported by a wider stakeholder group. We also recommend you to list other co-benefits you aim to achieve when working towards the climate neutrality goal, like well-being, health, equity, justice, financial savings.

## Your text

Klagenfurt has already made significant progress towards climate neutrality. By participating in the EU mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030", Klagenfurt aims to build on this success and strives for climate neutrality by 2030 (83% GHG emission reduction and compensation of the remaining 17% GHG emissions). The necessary climate measures will lead to several positive side effects, such as a more livable city/neighborhood, increased urban biodiversity or better social cohesion (especially between different social groups). Closer and more intensive cooperation between different stakeholders is not only important for successful climate protection measures but also for many other challenges we are currently facing (and will face in the coming years).

As the only Austrian city participating in the EU Cities Mission " 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030", Klagenfurt takes a pioneering role on the way to climate neutrality in Austria and thus avoids the upcoming European emission penalties.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

This is the core section of the Commitments document that should summarise at least 3 or 4 systemic strategic priorities that need to be implemented for your city to become climate neutral by 2030. These should be meaningful changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in your city, like decarbonizing the heating system in the city or generating 100% energy from renewables. The individual commitments between your city and other stakeholders should address these key priorities and contribute to reaching them. The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan should describe the all interventions, including those to reach your priorities as well as all further actions, in detail and describe how your city plans to implement them.

## Your text

To achieve climate neutrality, many measures, including behavioral changes and the use of innovative technologies, are necessary. Klagenfurt's priorities can be summarized in the following four key areas:

) Energy systems: an expansion of the district heating network and the introduction of a district cooling system are planned. In addition, the remaining GHG emissions in the district heating network need to be further reduced. For sectors where natural gas cannot be replaced by other green energy sources, the production and availability of green synthetic natural gas (green SNG) will be essential. In addition, the generation of green electricity (especially photovoltaics) must be intensified and smart storage systems installed.

) Mobility and transport: a fundamental aspect in the field of mobility will be the electrification of public and private transport. The electrification of the bus fleet goes hand in hand with an increase in bus frequencies and represents a central approach in the field of mobility. In addition, a general change in mobility behavior (towards public transport, bicycle use, car sharing and other environmentally friendly mobility solutions) is envisaged for which various measures will be required. For a successful mobility change, the support of different stakeholder groups is necessary.

) Building facilities and housing: This area mainly includes thermal building renovations, which are accompanied by a conversion of installed heating systems to more climate-friendly heating alternatives (e.g., replacement of oil heating systems with district heating). In addition, this area also includes the gradual introduction of renewable and more climate-friendly raw materials in the construction industry (e.g., replacing cement with wood).

) Nature-based and other innovative solutions: This area is primarily concerned with innovative compensation measures within the city of Klagenfurt and in the central area of Carinthia. These measures pursue the goal of binding greenhouse gas emissions and additionally contribute to further positive environmental effects (biodiversity). Furthermore, innovative CCU pilot projects belong to this area. Cooperation with companies inside and outside the city is elementary.

# 4 Principles and process

Highlight the key principles that will guide your city as it implements its Climate City Contract, like accountability, transparency, or an open attitude to new approaches. The process should encompass principles like co-creation, innovation, multi-actor and citizen engagement, and should be systemic and demand-driven in nature. It should also be based on monitoring and joint learning. The Commitments Guidance document provides more specific guidance on how integrate these principles into your own process.

# Your text

A fundamental guiding document for achieving climate neutrality by 2030 is the Smart City Strategy of the City of Klagenfurt. It was first adopted by the city senate in November 2018 and the status of implementation is now submitted to it annually as a monitoring report. In the course of the Smart City Strategy, various workshops are held together with the public utility provider (Stadtwerke Klagenfurt AG), which leads to an ongoing update of the strategy. Regular monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions takes place. It is planned to shorten the monitoring intervals to 2-3 years in order to better identify progress and gaps on the way to climate neutrality.

Klagenfurt is part of several topic-relevant national and international platforms, missions and initiatives, such as the "Austrian Smart Cities Networking Platform" or the Austrian Association of Cities, which enable an exchange of experience and learning as well as interesting inputs on a national level. As one of 50 cities on a global level, Klagenfurt participates in the "Urban Transition Mission" group within the "Mission Innovation" initiative. In addition, Klagenfurt is involved in several national and international projects that enable innovative climate protection measures to be developed and tested in practice. Cooperations with social organizations such as Diakonie or Caritas are intended to ensure that all social groups are included in the path to climate neutrality.

An essential step towards achieving climate neutrality by 2030 is the active involvement of citizens. For this purpose, a Smart City Lab will be installed as a citizens' office in the center of Klagenfurt, which will be the contact and information point for topics and projects of the city's Smart City Strategy and EU Cities Mission. In addition, a Youth Council has already been installed, which is considered and consulted as an Advisory Board in political decision-making.

Existing cooperations and relationships with various stakeholders will be further expanded and new partnerships will be established. With the provincial government of Carinthia, the installation of a working group for the implementation of the EU Cities Mission is planned. The Federal Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (German short: BMK) has already set a focus through the national mission "Klimaneutrale Stadt - climate-neutral city", which has an impact beyond RTI funding. An elementary part of the mission is also to support the city of Klagenfurt in achieving the goals set in the course of the EU Cities Mission. For this purpose, the BMK is developing both the demand-oriented programming of RTI funding for climate-neutral cities
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

KLAGENFURT AM WÖRTHERSEE

and the linking of RTI funding with investment funding. BMK, FFG (Austrian Research Promotion Agency) and the Austrian Climate Fund are in a position to offer funding portfolios that can empower highly ambitious cities such as the EU Cities Mission City of Klagenfurt to demonstrate the achievement of urban climate neutrality in an exemplary manner.

Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)

between

the provincial capital of Klagenfurt at Lake Wörthersee,

the Federal Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK) and

the regional government of Carinthia.

on the implementation of the Austrian participation in the EU mission "100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" (EU Cities Mission).

Relevance of the EU Cities Mission

In its climate targets, the European Union has pledged to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 compared to the level of 1990. The basis for this is the European Green Deal (EGD) as a key activity of the European Commission. This includes a sustainable growth strategy for a climate-neutral and resource-conserving economy. With the Climate Agreement of Paris in 2015, Austria also committed to limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, if possible even below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

At an urban dimension, the European Commission launched the mission "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", which supports 100 highly ambitious European cities to becoming climate neutral by 2030. These European model cities are to serve as role models for all cities in Europe and also globally as pioneers of climate neutrality. Successful measures and learning effects are to be replicated on the basis of their experience and best practices are to be replicated and promoted in order to promote the achievement of climate neutrality in all cities.

An indispensable prerequisite for successful climate protection is solid anchoring at the local level, in the cities and municipalities. The provincial capital of Klagenfurt at Lake Wörthersee has already been an exemplary in the field of climate actions, as impressively demonstrated by its Smart City Strategy, and has thus created the prerequisites as the only Austrian city to be included in the group of European pilot cities (100 in the EU, another 12 in associated countries) of the EU Cities Mission. Klagenfurt will be an important role model and lighthouse in the implementation of national ambitions for climate protection measures and a pioneer for cities and municipalities in Austria.

Achieving climate neutrality by 2030 is a major organizational and budgetary challenge for a city, which in the case of the City of Klagenfurt requires close cooperation with the regional government of Carinthia and the Federal Government. The BMK (federal ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology) has already significantly supported the application of the city of Klagenfurt by financing the preliminary project "Mission KS 30" within the framework of "FIT4UrbanMission".

In addition, with the national mission "Climate Neutral City – Klimaneutrale Stadt", an RTI focal point was initiated, in which Austrian cities are supported on their way to climate neutrality. The BMK's RTI offerings are supplemented by other funding programs such as "EBIN -Emission-free buses and infrastructure".
Translation

## Key project KEBIP

A key project of the city of Klagenfurt on the way to climate neutrality by 2030 and thus for the ambitions within the framework of the EU Cities Mission is the KEBIP project (Klagenfurt Electric Bus Investment Project) with an investment volume of € 144 million. The KEBIP project was selected by an independent, international jury of experts of the BMK's EBIN funding program as particularly worthy of support. The next step is to ensure its implementation.

## Joint Declaration of Intent

Due to the importance of the city of Klagenfurt, as the only Austrian EU Mission City and its lighthouse effect, which reaches far beyond Austria, the BMK and the regional government of Carinthia, continue to support the provincial capital Klagenfurt at Lake Wörthersee in the participation in the EU-Cities Mission to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 and in the measures required for its achievement.

On the part of the BMK and the regional government of Carinthia, we are in favor of the participation of the provincial capital Klagenfurt in the mission "100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030". We acknowledge the corresponding role model and pioneer function on the way to climate neutrality in Carinthia and in entire Austria.

As partners at the federal, regional, and city levels, we consider the mission "100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" as a valuable opportunity to learn from and with other committed European cities, to build capacities in the field of climate protection and, in close cooperation with the city, the regional and federal government and the European Union to work together on the process of achieving climate neutrality and shaping the corresponding pathway. We expect this European mission to provide important impetus and solution modules for achieving the climate targets at the national and regional level.

# 1 Einleitung

Erläutern Sie die Motivation Ihrer Stadt, sich der EU-Mission " 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" anzuschließen, und heben Sie die derzeitigen Maßnahmen Ihrer Stadt zum Klimaschutz hervor. Ebenfalls können Sie die Ziele dieses Dokuments erwähnen.

## Ihr Text

Die Stadt Klagenfurt ist seit 1996 Mitglied im europäischen Climate Alliance Network. Mit dem Beitritt zum Konvent der BürgermeisterInnen durch einen einstimmigen Gemeinderats- und Stadtsenatsbeschluss im Jahr 2011 verpflichtete sich Klagenfurt erstmals zur Einhaltung der Klimaziele, der freiwilligen Steigerung der Energieeffizienz und zur Nutzung nachhaltiger Energieträger. Mit dem Beitritt zum neuen Konvent der BürgermeisterInnen für Klima und Energie durch einen einstimmigen Gemeinderatsbeschluss im Jahr 2016 wurde dieser Prozess gestärkt und Maßnahmen zur Anpassung an den Klimawandel wurden berücksichtigt.

Ebenfalls wurde gemeinsam mit der Stadtwerken Klagenfurt AG eine Smart City Strategie entwickelt und im November 2018 vom Stadtsenat beschlossen. Sie beinhaltet alle bisherigen Konzepte zu Klimaschutz und Nachhaltigkeit. Über die Fortschritte werden dem Stadtsenat jährlich im Zuge eines Monitorings berichtet. Ziel ist es, die THG-Emissionen bis 2030 um 40 % und bis 2050 um 90 % zu reduzieren, jeweils bezogen auf das Basisjahr 2011. Gleichzeitig soll eine gute Lebensqualität für die aktuelle Bevölkerung erhalten bleiben bzw. für zukünftige Generationen ermöglicht werden.

Als Zwischenergebnis beschloss der Stadtsenat im Mai 2021, die zuvor genannten Ziele vorzuziehen: Das neue Ziel der Smart-City-Strategie ist es, die THG-Emissionen bis 2030 um 70 % und bis 2040 um 90 % zu reduzieren, bezogen auf das Basisjahr 2011. Gleichzeitig wurden die Sustainable Developments Goals (SDGs) als wichtige Indikatoren in die Smart-City-Strategie aufgenommen. Durch die Teilnahme an der "EU-Cities Mission" als eine von 112 europäischen Städten, die sich zum Ziel gesetzt haben, bis 2030 klimaneutral zu werden, wurden die bereits ehrgeizigen Ziele weiter vorangetrieben, um dieses ambitionierte Ziel zu erreichen. Dies bedeutet, dass bereits umgesetzte und/oder geplante Klimamaßnahmen in Klagenfurt intensiviert und neue Maßnahmen entwickelt werden.

Die Stadt Klagenfurt hat verschiedene Klimamaßnahmen festgelegt, die in den folgenden Jahren bis 2030 und darüber hinaus umgesetzt werden sollen. Diese beinhalten sowohl direkte THG-Emissionsreduktionen als auch THG-Kompensationen. Durch die Teilnahme an der EU-Cities Mission wurde das ehrgeizige Ziel gesetzt, bis 2030 Klimaneutralität zu erreichen. Dazu sollen 83% der Treibhausgase im Vergleich zum Basisjahr 2011 direkt eingespart und 17% der verbleibenden Emissionen durch Klimaschutzmaßnahmen in Klagenfurt und im Kärntner Zentralraum kompensiert werden.

Die EU-Cities Mission ermöglicht den Erfahrungs- und Ideenaustausch mit mehr als 100 anderen europäischen Städten und Klagenfurt erwartet sich weitere inspirierende Ideen für Klimamaßnahmen. Darüber hinaus ist es eines der zentralen Ziele der EU-Mission, die Zusammenarbeit zwischen den Stakeholdern zu fördern, die für den erfolgreichen Weg zur Klimaneutralität von grundlegender Bedeutung ist. Auf Basis dieser gestärkten Stakeholder-Zusammenarbeit hat die Stadt Klagenfurt die Möglichkeit, sich bei speziellen "EU-Cities Mission"-Ausschreibungen zu bewerben und so finanzielle Unterstützung für wegweisende Klimamaßnahmen zur Erreichung des 2030-Ziels zu erhalten.

Klimaneutralität schon bis 2030 zu erreichen, ist für eine Stadt eine große organisatorische und haushaltstechnische Herausforderung, welche im Falle der Stadt Klagenfurt eine enge Kooperation mit den Stadtwerken, dem Land Kärnten und dem Bund - insbesondere dem Bundesministerium für Klimaschutz, Umwelt, Energie, Mobilität, Innovation und Technologie (BMK) - bedarf.

Das Hauptziel dieses Dokuments ist es, den Stakeholdergruppen über die allgemeinen Klimaziele der Stadt sowie über die geplanten Klimaschutzmaßnahmen zu informieren. Da sich die Gegebenheiten, Technologien, etc. auf dem Weg zur Klimaneutralität bis 2030 ändern können, kann der Klimafahrplan als "lebendes Dokument" betrachtet werden. Aus diesem Grund verpflichten sich die Stakeholder nicht zu festgelegten Klimamaßnahmen, sondern zu ihrer allgemeinen Unterstützung für Klagenfurts Klimaneutralitätsziel.

# 2 Ziel: Klimaneutralität bis 2030

Legen Sie Ihr Ziel der Klimaneutralität bis 2030 dar, wie es in Ihrer Interessensbekundung für die EU-Cities Mission (Expression of Interest - EoI) zum Ausdruck gebracht und definiert wurde. Dies soll ebenfalls Ihren Ehrgeiz und Ihr Engagement für einen 2030-Horizont als ganze Stadt einschließen, sowie alle Ausschlussbereiche beschreiben und zusammenfassen, wie diese Bereiche nach 2030 angegangen werden sollen. (Ein detaillierterer Plan für Ausschlussbereiche sollen in den Action Plan zur Klimaneutralität 2030 aufgenommen werden). Ihr Ziel für 2030 sollte mindestens durch einen Ratsbeschluss unterstützt werden, und es wird empfohlen, dass es auch von einer breiteren Interessengruppe unterstützt wird. Wir empfehlen Ihnen auch, andere Zusatznutzen aufzulisten, die Sie mit der Erreichung des Klimaneutralitätsziels anstreben, wie Wohlbefinden, Gesundheit, Gerechtigkeit, finanzielle Einsparungen.

## Ihr Text

Klagenfurt hat bereits bedeutende Fortschritte in Richtung Klimaneutralität gemacht. Durch die Teilnahme an der EU-Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" will Klagenfurt auf diesem Erfolg aufbauen und strebt die Klimaneutralität bis 2030 an (83% THG Emissionsreduktion und Kompensation der restlichen 17% THG Emissionen). Die notwendigen Klimamaßnahmen werden zu mehreren positiven Nebeneffekten führen, wie z.B. einer lebenswerteren Stadt/Nachbarschaft, einer erhöhten städtischen Biodiversität oder einem besseren sozialen Zusammenhalt (insbesondere zwischen verschiedenen sozialen Gruppen). Eine engere und intensivere Zusammenarbeit zwischen verschiedenen Stakeholdern ist nicht nur für erfolgreiche Klimaschutzmaßnahmen von Bedeutung, sondern auch für viele andere Herausforderungen, mit denen wir derzeit konfrontiert sind (und in den kommenden Jahren konfrontiert sein werden). Als einzige österreichische Stadt, die an der EU-Cities Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" teilnimmt, nimmt Klagenfurt eine Vorreiterrolle auf dem Weg zur Klimaneutralität in Österreich ein und vermeidet so die anstehenden europäischen Emissionsstrafen.

# 3 Schlüsselprioritäten und strategische Interventionen

Dies ist der zentrale Abschnitt des Commitment-Dokuments, der mindestens drei oder vier systemische strategische Prioritäten zusammenfassen sollte, die umgesetzt werden müssen, damit Ihre Stadt bis 2030 klimaneutral wird. Dabei sollte es sich um bedeutsame Veränderungen handeln, die einen tiefgreifenden Einfluss auf die Reduzierung der THG-Emissionen in Ihrer Stadt haben, wie die Dekarbonisierung des Heizsystems in der Stadt oder die Erzeugung von 100 % Energie aus erneuerbaren Quellen. Die individuellen Verpflichtungen Ihrer Stadt und anderer Interessengruppen sollten sich auf diese Schlüsselprioritäten beziehen und dazu beitragen, sie zu erreichen. Der beigefügte Action Plan zur Klimaneutralität 2030 sollte alle Maßnahmen, einschließlich der Maßnahmen zur Erreichung Ihrer Prioritäten, sowie alle weiteren Maßnahmen im Detail beschreiben und darlegen, wie Ihre Stadt diese umzusetzen plant.

## Ihr Text

Um Klimaneutralität zu erreichen, sind viele Maßnahmen, einschließlich Verhaltensänderungen und der Einsatz innovativer Technologien, notwendig. Die Prioritäten Klagenfurts lassen sich in den folgenden vier Schlüsselbereichen zusammenfassen:

) Energiesysteme: Es ist ein Ausbau des Fernwärmenetzes und die Einführung eines Fernkältesystems geplant. Außerdem müssen die verbleibenden THG-Emissionen im Fernwärmenetz weiter reduziert werden. Für Sektoren, in denen Erdgas nicht durch andere grüne Energieträger ersetzt werden kann, wird die Erzeugung und Verfügbarkeit von grünem synthetischem Erdgas (green SNG) von grundlegender Bedeutung sein. Darüber hinaus muss die Erzeugung von

Commitments

Ökostrom (insbesondere Photovoltaik) intensiviert und intelligente Speichersysteme installiert werden.

) Mobilität und Verkehr: Ein grundlegender Aspekt im Bereich der Mobilität wird die Elektrifizierung des öffentlichen und privaten Verkehrs sein. Die Elektrifizierung der Busflotte geht mit einer Erhöhung der Busfrequenzen einher und stellt einen zentralen Ansatz im Bereich der Mobilität dar. Darüber hinaus ist eine generelle Änderung des Mobilitätsverhaltens (hin zu öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln, Fahrradnutzung, Carsharing und anderen umweltfreundlichen Mobilitätslösungen) vorgesehen für die verschiedene Maßnahmen erforderlich sein werden. Für einen erfolgreichen Mobilitätswandel ist die Unterstützung verschiedener Stakeholdergruppen notwendig.

) Bauliche Anlagen und Wohnungen: Dieser Bereich umfasst vor allem thermische Gebäudesanierungen, die mit einer Umstellung der installierten Heizungssysteme auf klimafreundlichere Heizungsalternativen einhergehen (z.B. Ersatz von Ölheizungen durch Fernwärme). Darüber hinaus umfasst dieser Bereich auch die schrittweise Einführung erneuerbarer und klimafreundlicherer Rohstoffe in der Bauindustrie (z. B. Ersatz von Zement durch Holz).

) Naturbezogene und sonstige innovative Lösungen: In diesem Bereich geht es in erster Linie um innovative Kompensationsmaßnahmen innerhalb der Stadt Klagenfurt und im Zentralraum Kärntens. Diese Maßnahmen verfolgen das Ziel, Treibhausgasemissionen zu binden und tragen zusätzlich zu weiteren positiven Umwelt effekten (Biodiversität) bei. Weiters gehören innovative CCU-Pilotprojekte zu diesem Bereich. Die Zusammenarbeit mit Unternehmen innerhalb und außerhalb der Stadt ist elementar.

# 4 Prinzipien und Ablauf

Heben Sie die wichtigsten Grundsätze hervor, die Ihre Stadt bei der Umsetzung ihrer Klimastadt-Aktionen leiten werden, wie z. B. Verantwortlichkeit, Transparenz oder eine offene Haltung gegenüber neuen Ansätzen. Der Prozess sollte Prinzipien wie Co-Creation, Innovation, Multi-Akteure- und Bürgerbeteiligung umfassen und ebenfalls systemisch und bedarfsorientiert sein. Er sollte sich auch auf Monitoring und gemeinsames Lernen stützen. Das Dokument "Commitments Guidance" enthält spezifischere Hinweise zur Integration dieser Grundsätze in Ihren eigenen Prozess.

# Ihr Text

Ein grundsätzliches Leitdokument zur Erreichung der Klimaneutralität bis 2030 ist die Smart City Strategie der Stadt Klagenfurt. Sie wurde im November 2018 erstmals vom Stadtsenat beschlossen und wird ihm nun jährlich der Stand der Umsetzung als Monitoring Bericht vorgelegt. Im Zuge der Smart City Strategie werden verschiedene Workshops gemeinsam mit den Stadtwerken abgehalten, die zu einer laufenden Aktualisierung der Strategie führen. Es findet ein regelmäßiges Monitoring der Treibhausgasemissionen statt. Es ist geplant, die Monitoring-Intervalle auf 2-3 Jahre zu verkürzen, um Fortschritte und Lücken auf dem Weg zur Klimaneutralität besser erkennen zu können.

Klagenfurt ist Teil mehrerer themenrelevanter nationaler und internationaler Plattformen, Missionen und Initiativen, wie z.B. der "Österreichischen Smart Cities Networking Plattform" oder des Österreichischen Städtebundes, die einen Erfahrungs- und Lernaustausch sowie interessante Inputs auf nationaler Ebene ermöglichen. Als eine von 50 Städten auf globaler Ebene nimmt Klagenfurt im Rahmen der Initiative Mission Innovation in der Gruppe "Urban Transition Mission" teil. Darüber hinaus ist Klagenfurt in mehreren nationalen und internationalen Projekten involviert, die es ermöglichen, innovative Klimaschutzmaßnahmen zu entwickeln und in der Praxis zu testen. Kooperationen mit sozialen Organisationen wie der Diakonie oder der Caritas sollen sicherstellen, dass alle gesellschaftlichen Gruppen in den Weg zur Klimaneutralität einbezogen werden.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

KLAGENFURT AM WÖRTHERSEE

Ein wesentlicher Schritt zur Erreichung der Klimaneutralität bis 2030 ist die aktive Einbindung der Bürgerinnen und Bürger. Zu diesem Zweck wird ein Smart City Lab als BürgerInnenbüro in der Klagenfurter Innenstadt eingerichtet, welches Anlauf- und Auskunftsstelle für Themen und Projekte der städtischen Smart City Strategie und EU-Cities Mission ist. Zusätzlich wurde bereits ein Jugendrat installiert, der als Advisory Board in der politischen Entscheidungsfindung berücksichtigt und konsultiert wird.

Bestehende Kooperationen und Beziehungen mit verschiedenen Stakeholdern werden weiter ausgebaut und neue Partnerschaften etabliert. Mit dem Land Kärnten ist die Installierung einer Arbeitsgruppe zur Umsetzung der EU-Cities-Mission geplant. Das BMK hat durch die nationale Mission „klimaneutrale Stadt“ bereits einen Schwerpunkt gesetzt, welcher über die FTI-Förderung hinauswirkt. Elementarer Teil der Mission ist hierbei auch die Unterstützung der Stadt Klagenfurt in der Erreichung der gesetzten Ziele im Zuge der EU-Cities-Mission. Hierfür wird vom BMK sowohl die bedarfsorientierte Programmierung der FTI-Förderungen für klimaneutrale Städte, als auch die Verknüpfung von FTI-Förderungen mit Investitions-Förderungen erarbeitet. BMK, FFG (österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft) und der österreichische Klimafonds sind hierbei in der Lage Förderportfolios anzubieten, welche höchst ambitionierte Städte wie die EU-Cities-Mission Stadt Klagenfurt dabei ermächtigen kann beispielhaft das Erreichen der urbanen Klimaneutralität zu demonstrieren.

zur Umsetzung der österreichischen Beteiligung an der EU-Mission „100 Klimaneutrale und Intelligente Städte bis 2030“ (EU-Cities-Mission)

## Bedeutung der EU-Cities-Mission

Die Europäische Union hat sich in ihren Klimazielen dazu verpflichtet, bis 2030 den CO2-Ausstoß gegenüber 1990 um mindestens 55 Prozent zu senken. Die Grundlage hierfür bildet der Europäische Green Deal (EGD) als Schlüsselaktivität der Europäischen Kommission. Dieser beinhaltet eine nachhaltige Wachstumsstrategie für eine klimaneutrale und ressourcenschonende Wirtschaft. Mit dem Klimaübereinkommen von Paris hat sich im Jahr 2015 auch Österreich dazu bekannt, die Erderwärmung auf deutlich unter 2 Grad Celsius, wenn möglich auf unter 1,5 Grad Celsius, zu begrenzen.

In der städtischen Dimension wurde von der Europäischen Kommission die Mission „100 Klimaneutrale und Intelligente Städte bis 2030“ gestartet, welche 100 höchst-ambitionierte europäische Städte dabei unterstützt, bis 2030 klimaneutral zu werden. Diese europäischen Modellstädte sollen in den kommenden Jahren als Vorbilder für alle Städte in Europa und auch global als Pioniere der Klimaneutralität sichtbar werden. Erfolgreiche Maßnahmen und Lerneffekte sollen auf der Basis ihrer Erfahrungen und Best Practices repliziert und vorangetrieben werden, um das Erreichen der Klimaneutralität in allen Städten zu ermöglichen.

Eine unabdingbare Voraussetzung für erfolgreichen Klimaschutz ist die solide Verankerung auf lokaler Ebene, in den Städten und Gemeinden. Die Landeshauptstadt Klagenfurt am Wörthersee hat schon bisher vorbildhaft agiert, wie die Smart City Strategie eindrucksvoll beweist und damit die Voraussetzungen dafür geschaffen, als einzige österreichische Stadt in die Riege der europäischen Pilotstädte (100 in der EU, weitere 12 in assoziierten Ländern) der EU-Cities-Mission aufgenommen zu werden. Klagenfurt wird damit zu einem wichtigen Vorbild und Leuchtturm bei der Umsetzung der nationalen Ambitionen im Klimaschutz und zur Vorreiterin der Städte und Gemeinden in Österreich.

Klimaneutralität schon bis 2030 zu erreichen, ist für eine Stadt eine große organisatorische und haushaltstechnische Herausforderung, welche im Falle der Stadt Klagenfurt einer engen Kooperationen mit dem Land Kärnten und dem Bund bedarf. Das BMK hat bereits die Bewerbung der Stadt Klagenfurt durch die Finanzierung des Vorprojekts „Mission KS 30“ im Rahmen von „FIT4UrbanMission“ maßgeblich unterstützt. Darüber hinaus wurde mit der nationalen Mission „Klimaneutrale Stadt“ ein FTI-Schwerpunkt initiiert, in dem österreichische Städte auf ihrem Weg zur Klimaneutralität unterstützt werden. Ergänzt werden die FTI-Angebote des BMK durch weitere Förderprogramme wie z.B. „EBIN - Emissionsfreie Busse und Infrastruktur“.
# Schlüsselprojekt KEBIP

Ein Schlüsselprojekt der Stadt Klagenfurt auf dem Weg zur Klimaneutralität bis 2030 und somit zur Umsetzung der eigenen Ambitionen im Rahmen der EU-Cities-Mission ist das Projekt KEBIP (Klagenfurt Electric Bus Investment Project) mit einem Investitionsvolumen von 144 Mio €. Das Projekt KEBIP wurde von einer unabhängigen, internationalen Expert:innen-Jury des BMK-Förderprogramms EBIN als besonders förderwürdig bewertet. In weiterer Folge gilt es, die Umsetzung sicherzustellen.

# Gemeinsame Absichtserklärung

Aufgrund der Bedeutung der Stadt Klagenfurt, als einzige österreichische EU Mission Stadt und deren Leuchtturmwirkung, die weit über Österreich hinausreicht, beabsichtigen das BMK und das Land Kärnten, die Landeshauptstadt Klagenfurt am Wörthersee bei der Teilnahme an der EU-Cities Mission zur Erreichung der Klimaneutralität bis 2030 und bei den erforderlichen Maßnahmen zur Umsetzung weiterhin zu unterstützen.

Seitens des BMK und des Landes Kärnten sprechen wir uns für die Teilnahme der Landeshauptstadt Klagenfurt an der Mission „100 Klimaneutrale und Intelligente Städte bis 2030“ aus. Wir anerkennen die damit verbundene Vorbildwirkung und Pionierfunktion auf dem Weg zur Klimaneutralität in Kärnten und in ganz Österreich.

Als Partner:innen auf den Ebenen von Bund, Land und Stadt sehen wir die Mission „100 Klimaneutrale und Intelligente Städte bis 2030“ als wertvolle Chance, von und mit anderen engagierten europäischen Städten zu lernen, Kapazitäten im Bereich des Klimaschutzes aufzubauen und im Schulterschluss von Stadt, Bundesland, Bund und der Europäischen Union am Prozess zur Erreichung der Klimaneutralität zu arbeiten und diesen mitzugestalten. Wir erwarten uns von dieser europäischen Mission wichtige Impulse und Lösungsbausteine für die Erreichung der Klimaziele auf nationaler und regionaler Ebene.
