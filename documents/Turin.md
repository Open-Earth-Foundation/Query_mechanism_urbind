# Summary

Città di Torino is the institutional name of the Città di Torino.

See https://www.torinocambia.it/

As stated in the Commitments, the vision of a sustainable and resilient city is realized through a diverse array of activities, including emissions mitigation and climate change adaptation, among others. The Climate City Contract (CCC) of the Città di Torino¹ stems from a general vision that steers the ecological transition of the city with an in-house dynamic and multilayer model. In parallel with the framework of activities encompassed in the "Torino Vivibile" webpage (mentioned in the Commitments, Section 1), which focuses on sustainability, the current Administration, under the motto "Torino Cambia"², has implemented an initiative to collect and carry out over 300 actions for the regeneration of the urban fabric. These actions are diverse, physical and immaterial, and occur at various scales. The "Torino Cambia" initiatives are supported by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, European funds, and national funds.

In the framework of the CCC implementation, we have developed a work process based on three pillars: ① a process governance for managing the transition process; ② a City's actors involvement process, for a coordinated engagement of the heterogeneous players (Municipality, utilities, research institutions, industrial and financial companies, and organizations, citizens) in the road towards climate neutrality; ③ a science-based support to the City's policy decision-making, for quantitatively assessing ex-ante and "in silico" (through ad hoc models and IT tools) the costs/to identify the most appropriate ones.

In particular, the proposed vision aims at being: integrated, i.e. based on analyses of the interrelationships between the GHG emission sources and the different domains involved (environmental, social, economic); science-based, i.e. based on scientific approaches, models and tools, quantitatively describing the urban systems and the other intertwined domains, comparing (through scenario analyses) the impacts of possible alternative strategic choices; dynamic, i.e. able to consider and track the evolutionary trajectory of the urban systems and to compare it with the ideal trajectory to be followed for reaching the set targets, thus identifying the possible differences and allowing

for interventions on policy actions in order to realign them; quantitative, i.e. able to quantify, by means of indicators and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), the current status of the urban systems and its evolution over time, thus monitoring the energy transition trend with respect to the set targets; inclusive, i.e. able to create a dialogue with the social fabric of the city, involving the citizens and making them aware of the cost/benefit ratio of the energy transition; transversal, i.e. integrating the communication with the players and stakeholders, and synthesizing visions and competencies in different domains.

In 2019 (chosen as reference year for the CCC as the most recent one for which data are available, leaving aside 2020 to exclude anomalous trends associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, against which to quantify the impacts of the designed policy strategies for decarbonization and climate neutrality), the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission inventory of Torino accounted for 2.4 Mt/y, mainly due (about $82\%$) to residential, tertiary, industry and private transport in terms of sectors and to natural gas ($33\%$) and refined petroleum products ($25\%$) in terms of energy commodities.

To reduce this value, in coherence with the European and national environmental sustainability goals and by the targets of the New Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy that the Città di Torino signed in 2019, the Municipality already implemented several policy actions, like those included in the Piano d’Azione per l’Energia Sostenibile e il Clima (PAESC – Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan, by 2023)¹; the Torino Action Plan for Energy (TAPE, by 2010 with a Third Monitoring Report in 2021²), identifying public and private buildings and transport as priority areas of intervention; the Piano Regolatore per l’Illuminazione Comunale (PRIC – Regulatory Plan for Municipal Public Lighting, by 2012)³; the Piano Urbano per la Mobilità Sostenibile (PUMS – Urban Plan for Sustainable Mobility, by 2022)⁴; the Piano Strategico dell’Infrastruttura Verde (Strategic Plan for Green Infrastructure, by 2020). These plans already contribute to improving urban sustainability, as demonstrated by the continuous reduction trend in the city’s historical series of emission inventory.

The inclusion of Torino in the set of cities of the “EU Mission: Climate Neutral and Smart Cities” represents a unique opportunity for significantly boosting this decarbonization process and building an integrated sustainability strategy involving all the actors of the city system.

The three pillars have been concretely implemented with a structured set of activities.

As for the governance, an integrated Mission Team – with the goal of managing the definition of the decarbonization pathways of Torino, their impacts and costs, and the monitoring of the evolutionary trajectories of the city itself towards the set goals – has been created, merging two working groups: ① the Transition Team of the Municipality of Torino, in turn involving two different Departments (the Dipartimento Ambiente e Transizione Ecologica - Department of Environment and Ecological Transition and the Dipartimento Fondi Europei e PNRR - European Funds and PNNR Department), supported by the Interdepartmental Working Group “Climate Change”, composed of internal technical representatives with expertise in the fields of action of the CCC; ② the working group established at the Energy Center of the Politecnico di Torino under the scientific coordination of the EST@energycenter Lab – a multidisciplinary team involving different competencies in the energy, environmental and architectural domains, with expertise in modelling and analysis of energy systems at different spatial and time scales, assessment of the environmental impacts of alternative policy scenarios, quantification of GHG skinks due to urban green infrastructures, modelling of building physics, urban morphology and regulations.

Concerning the involvement of the City’s actors, a co-design process with local stakeholders has been set up, also exploiting the experience already carried out through three “framework initiatives” under way, i.e. Torino City Lab, CTE Next, Torino Social Impact (described in Section 5), gradually including an increasingly large number of public and private subjects, to engage them as active participants in the challenge. In particular, the local “ecosystem” involved encompasses multilevel players: institutional bodies besides the Municipality of Torino (namely, the Regione Piemonte and the Città Metropolitana di Torino², which enables a vertical multi-level external governance), public multi-utility companies, the private sector (corporate, banking system, trade associations), the Third Sector Entities and non-profit organizations, the academic world and the citizens, with a specific focus on the younger generations and vulnerable targets. The involvement of the local ecosystem has been implemented through various instruments, including: ① working tables with the territory’s leading actors, aiming at informing on the Mission and promoting a common action perspective for the climate

transition; ② a cycle of workshops with thematic stakeholders (business world, Third Sector Entities, investee companies) to co-create the framework of knowledge on the City's carbon footprint and to initiate the co-design of the portfolio of actions and the engagement for the implementation of initiatives; ③ meetings addressed to young people and youth associations, aiming at raising awareness of the challenges that the City will have to face to achieve the 2030 targets and at building a dialogue between young people and the City Administration; ④ activities to engage vulnerable subjects.

Eventually, for what concerns the science-based support to the City's policy decision-making, the proposed vision has been implemented along a sequence of steps.

First, a data management approach has been defined for systematically collecting, polishing, validating, and updating all the existing data that characterize the various sectors and sub-sectors forming the urban system. In this framework, the design of an “Energy & Transition Data Room,” located at the Energy Center of the Politecnico di Torino, intended as a “research mirror” for hosting a copy of all the relevant data of the City, is currently in phase of implementation. The Data Room is conceptually based on the coupling of a data lakehouse approach, which allows for storing and managing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and a distributed database approach, which allows for higher resilience (because data are not stored on a single physical machine, but distributed across multiple nodes physically located in different machines and replicated in such a way as to ensure redundancy) and performance (for balancing the workload across different servers, even in the presence of numerous simultaneous queries) concerning traditional databases. This infrastructure is based on an hyperconverged cluster and a distributed architecture with five nodes (and three copies of all the data distributed on these nodes).

Secondly, the design and implementation of a web-based IT platform CLICC (CLImate City Contract) have provided the means to assess ex-ante and “in silico” the impacts, in terms of CO2 emissions avoided and related costs, of different possible policy actions and strategies, based on ad hoc models and algorithms, thus permitting the City's decision makers to verify and compare them quantitatively and objectively. The platform also makes it possible to compile the various sections of the CCC itself automatically. Furthermore, this tool -- fed by the data of the Energy & Transition Data Room to be built -- will allow for tracking the evolution of the urban systems and the related emissions, for checking the coherence between them and what is expected by the Torino's CCC, and for implementing (when needed) corrective actions for realigning the evolutionary trajectory with the one requested for reaching the set targets.

This approach has made it possible to define a set of macro-actions (presented in this Action Plan, in Part B). These macro-actions are not intended as specific punctual interventions, with a limited area of application and consequent limited impacts in terms of contribution to the reduction of CO_{2} emissions in the city. Instead, they are wide-scale actions able to impact the overall urban system significantly, leading to relevant effects on Torino's emission inventory. The macro-actions cover all the macro-areas emitting CO_{2}, namely stationary energy (including municipal buildings, public lighting, residential, tertiary, and industrial sectors), transport (including municipal fleet, private and public transport), waste (including landfill, wastes, and wastewater treatment). For the AFOLU - Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses sector (which includes the urban green infrastructure that acts as a CO2 sink), the macro-action approach was adopted for offsetting residual emissions. A set of 27 macro-actions has been defied for what concerns the CO2 emission reduction; moreover, 4 macro-actions have been identified for addressing the residual emissions.

The overall set of interventions for both emission reduction and compensation include: energy requalification of buildings (residential, tertiary, industrial and municipal); expansion of the district heating network; electrification of a part of the heating systems through heat pumps; creation of Renewable Energy Communities; efficiency improvement of the industrial processes; increase in efficiency of public lighting; enhancement of the share of photovoltaic (PV) electricity production; electrification of the private vehicles fleet, of the buses for public transport and the municipal fleet; implementation of zones with limitations to private traffic; promotion of alternative mobility modes (bicycles, carsharing, carpooling); construction of a second metro line; reduction in waste generation and increase in separate waste collection; installation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) systems on the waste-to-energy plant and district heating generation plants; increase in urban forestry and development of green roofs.

For each macro-action, related co-benefits have been identified in various fields, from improving air quality to combating energy poverty and social inequalities to positive effects on health.

Moreover, a mapping (portfolio) of 227 micro-actions already in progress or to be developed in the City has been created, associating them with the different fields of action and collecting them under the related macro-actions domain (see Annex I to this Action Plan). All the micro-actions have been uploaded to the CLICC web platform to monitor their evolution.

The overall effect of implementing the macro-actions for emissions reduction has been quantified to a reduction of 1.6 Mt/y of CO₂ emissions (-66.7%) concerning the reference year (2019) value of 2.4 Mt/y. The investment cost associated to the macro-actions for emission reduction is estimated at 21.8 G€, as detailed in Torino's CCC's Investment Plan.

Likewise, the overall effect of implementing the macro-actions for residual emissions compensation has been quantified to a compensation of 55.4% of the residual emissions, i.e., 442,318 t/y (corresponding to 18.5% of the 2019 baseline emissions). The investment cost associated to the macro-actions for emission compensation is estimated at 5.3 G€, as detailed in Torino's CCC's Investment Plan.

The vision and the methodological approach defined and implemented for the preparation of the Climate City Contract of Torino aim at constituting a sort of "Torino Model" for the science-based support to Cities in the energy/environmental policy decision-making field, which could be made available and reproducible, in a scalable way, in other national and international contexts.

# I. Introduction

Torino, the capital of the Regione Piemonte and the Città Metropolitana of the same name, boasts a population of 860,973 inhabitants (as of December 31, 2023) and covers an area of 130 km², divided into eight districts (Figure I-1.1). It stands as the fourth-largest economic and productive complex in Italy and serves as a pivotal hub for industry, universities, arts, tourism, sciences, and culture.

With an ancient history dating back to the 3rd century, Turin was transformed into a Roman colony, known as *Iulia Augusta Taurinorum*, in the 1st century B.C. It has played a significant role in the history of Italy, serving as its capital between 1861 and 1865.

Torino's territory encompasses significant historical sites, including those listed in the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Savoia Dynasty residences in Piedmont, as well as the natural ecosystem formed by the collinear areas surrounding the Po River, designated as a biosphere reserve.

Throughout its recent history, Torino has hosted numerous cultural and sporting events, such as the Universal Exposition in 1911 and the 20th Winter Olympic Games in 2006. Additionally, it serves as the epicenter of Italy's automobile industry and is a vital hub for publishing, banking, insurance, information technology, cinema, food and wine, aerospace, industrial design, sports, fashion, and artificial intelligence industry.

The city's growing importance on the international stage has earned it the status of a global city, placing it as the third-largest Italian city after Milano and Roma in the Gamma category of the GaWC 2020 classification.

## Demographics and employment

Torino has undergone significant economic and demographic changes in recent decades, with the effects further compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since its peak in 2012, the resident population has been on a decline, with figures standing at 860,973 as of December 31, 2023. This trend is mirrored in the Città Metropolitana and at the regional level, with a 4% decrease in the overall population. The demographic makeup remains fairly balanced, with 446,947 females and 414,026 males. However, analysis by age group reveals an aging population, characterized by a decline in the younger demographic and an increase in the elderly population (65 years and older).

In 2022, employment in Torino experienced a 2% increase from the previous year, reaching 361,000 employed individuals. This growth surpassed that of Milano and Genova, largely attributed to the contributions of the city's female workforce. However, a comparison with 2019, the last pre-COVID year, reveals a persistent negative gap (-3.1%), indicating only partial recovery and unfavorable demographic trends.

## Education

In the 25-39 age group, the proportion of graduates in Torino stands at 30%, surpassing the Italian average of 27%. However, this figure is relatively lower compared to other metropolitan areas in Northern Italy, such as Bologna (41%) and Milano (40%). Despite this, enrollments in Torino's universities are on the rise, indicating strong appeal both nationally and internationally. In 2021, the Università di Torino boasted 77,000 enrolled students, while the Politecnico di Torino had 34,000 students.

## Manufacturing

The process of deindustrialization, which has affected Torino and other European cities in recent decades, has had significant impacts on various manufacturing supply chains. This has led to negative repercussions in terms of employment, which, only now, appear to have been partially but not entirely absorbed by other sectors, resulting in a structural change in the city's economic landscape.

Nevertheless, compared to other European metropolitan cities, Torino's manufacturing sector still holds significant importance, with a total of 8,978 activities (7,399 headquarters and 1,579 local offices). The entrepreneurial system in Torino is heavily characterized by small and micro-enterprises. However, the relatively low presence of medium and large enterprises complicates both technology transfer processes and the retention of local human capital created by the network of local academic institutions.

# Political-administrative directions: a metropolitan Green Deal

The current municipal administration, led by Mayor Stefano Lo Russo, was elected in 2021 from among center-left forces.

Recently, Torino has committed to embarking on the path towards ecological and related transitions, including energy, digital and IT, economic-productive, and socio-cultural transitions. Specifically, the city is evaluating strategies to promote and oversee the urban energy transition. The urgency of the energy transition is highlighted by the significant presence of fossil fuels in the city's energy mix, encompassing buildings, equipment, facilities, and transportation. This reliance on fossil fuels has notable implications for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollutants.

As of 2019, fossil fuels, including natural gas and refined petroleum products, accounted for over 60% of Torino's final energy consumption. Fossil fuels also played a substantial role in the generation mix of electricity and heat for the city's district heating network. The emission factors for electricity generation and district heating were estimated at 0.245 tCO₂/MWh and 0.161 tCO₂/MWh, respectively. Torino's district heating network, established in 1982, is one of Europe's most extensive systems, consisting of a double line of pipelines spanning over 700 km and serving nearly 500,000 inhabitants.

As outlined in the City's Guidelines, environmental sustainability and ecological transition are explicitly recognized as top priorities, serving as essential tools to propel the city, in collaboration with municipalities in the metropolitan area, towards a new phase of growth.

Key aspects related to achieving environmental objectives include energy production from renewable sources, fostering energy communities, implementing measures for energy reduction and upgrading of both public and private building stocks, promoting separate waste collection, and reducing emissions.

Addressing air quality and environmental emergencies stands at the forefront of structural policies, particularly concerning the energy conversion of buildings and public and private transportation vehicles.

Investee companies are also integral to this effort, and their role must be reinforced to function effectively as a network within the metropolitan area. Collaboration among these entities is essential for advancing environmental sustainability goals across the entire metropolitan territory.

The administration is committed to embracing the challenge posed by the Green New Deal, initiated by the European Commission in 2020, aimed at reducing CO₂ emissions and achieving climate neutrality. This involves supporting innovation in industry, transportation, and heating systems, with a focus on investing in electric mobility and enhancing energy efficiency.

To this end, there are plans to develop a comprehensive strategic plan, in collaboration with all municipalities in the Città Metropolitana, to facilitate the ecological and energy transition. This metropolitan Green Deal will encompass initiatives related to the management and implementation of green infrastructure, as well as the execution of large-scale urban reforestation projects.

Furthermore, a key aspect of territorial development involves bolstering measures for hydrogeological risk mitigation through increased investment. This proactive approach aims to enhance the resilience of the metropolitan territory against potential hydrogeological hazards.

In addition, the administration has identified, among the objectives to be pursued, the preparation of a definitive protection and enhancement plan for city rivers to improve their environmental conditions, encourage navigation, and develop sports and recreational activities.

Addressing air pollution reduction is of utmost importance, especially considering the frequent exceedance levels observed. To combat this issue, coordinated efforts are underway to reduce traffic emissions across the entire metropolitan area. Additionally, incentives are being provided for the replacement of the most polluting vehicles.

Furthermore, energy efficiency initiatives targeting both public and private buildings are being prioritized, along with tax incentive policies aimed at promoting the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources.

# 2. Work Process

The work process adopted for defining the CCC's Action Plan is rooted in the Vision outlined in the Section 4 of the CCC Commitments. This approach integrates interdisciplinary methods and closely intertwines a science-based approach with governance strategies. The focus lies on assessing the city's environmental sustainability, specifically in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, limited to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ for the purposes of the Action Plan.

The implementation of the Vision revolves around three conceptual pillars outlined in the Summary. These pillars underpin the creation and formalization of the work process, guiding the city through its transition towards sustainability. They are translated into a series of actions, which are graphically synthesized in Figure 2.1.

In particular, we consider three flows that encapsulate and organize the work process:

P1) Process governance: defining structured groups and a network of responsibility and interrelations to manage the governance process supporting the Action Plan.

P2) City's actors' involvement and Transition co-design: coordinated engagement of all the actors and stakeholders of the city involved in the transition process towards climate neutrality project at different levels and roles (municipality, utilities, research and educational institutions, industrial and financial companies, and institution, citizens associations and individuals).

P3) Science-based support to the city: definition of a "data lakehouse" for collecting, storing, and managing the data that characterize the urban system and mathematical modeling and algorithms for assessing/monitoring the status and the evolution of the city in terms of GHG – evaluating ex-ante and "in silico" the impacts and cost/benefit ratio of the actions in a strategy and pinpointing the most appropriate ones.

These three pillars are intertwined: their actions proceed in parallel, but some sections (Inventory of the City's GHG emissions, micro-action reference catalog, creation of the CLICC platform) are transversal and represent a common link in the work process: they are pivotal sections of convergence between governance, city actor involvement and science-based support.

## P1 – Process governance

### Definition of a "Mission Team"

The process undertaken by the Città di Torino in building the CCC and achieving climate neutrality by 2030 starts with the definition of a Mission Team. The Mission Team is an integrated bilateral working group formed by the City's in-house operational core (Transition Team) and the Politecnico di Torino interdisciplinary group at the EST@energycenter Lab.

The main goal of the Mission Team is to ensure a systemic and synergetic approach to governing climate action. It engages, with a different level of involvement, 45 people from the Città di Torino and 25 from the EST@energycenter Lab.

The Transition Team is the Mission Team component within the City Administration. It is composed of ① Department for Ecological and Digital Transition, Innovation, Mobility and

Transport (which coordinates, on the political side, the different departments involved in the Mission's activities); ② Referees of the Environment and Ecological Transition Department and the European Funds and NRP Department. The Team operates under the guidance of the General Management of the Città di Torino, the competent Councillor, and the Mayor and ensures the full involvement of all cross-functional skills within the administration through the activation of the Interdepartmental Working Group "Climate Change" composed of technical representatives of the different City Services – that works at the construction and updating of the common framework of actors, networks, barriers and main levers towards climate neutrality.

The Città di Torino has activated the "Climate Change" working group to overcome internal governance barriers with an integrated multidisciplinary approach. Under the leadership of the Environment and Ecological Transition Department, it involves all the components whose activities may influence the pathway to climate neutrality.

The working group of the EST@energycenter Lab has been established at the Energy Center of the Politecnico di Torino. It involves a multidisciplinary team merging different energy, environmental, and architectural competencies.

The team embodies the operational convergence and cultural diversity of three departments of the Politecnico di Torino: the Department of Architecture and Design (DAD), the Department of Energy (DENERG), and the Department of Environment, Territorial and Infrastructure Engineering (DIATI).

The expertise of the team ranges from the modelling and analysis of the energy systems at different spatial scales (urban, national, supranational, global) and over different time horizons (short, medium, and long term) to the assessment of the environmental impacts associated to the various energy mixes, alternative policy scenarios, and the quantification of the GHG sinks due to urban forestation, to the modeling of building physics, to the evaluation of the role played by urban morphology and regulations in the effective implementation of decarbonization policies

The working group supports the Municipality of Torino in guaranteeing the scientific validity of the initial knowledge framework and of the actions/measures defined within the general strategy to contrast greenhouse gas emissions – building ad hoc models and IT tools for assessing their effects and tracking

the evolution of the city energy system over time.

The EST@energycenter Lab also represents a physical space: it is the venue where the Mission Team can meet and work together, directly sharing knowledge and competencies in different domains – jointly defining targets and methodologies in designing strategies, pathways, and actions for the transition of Torino towards the climate neutrality.

The close synergy between the Città di Torino and the EST@ energycenter Lab allows a better understanding of the urban energy balance's starting conditions (data, relationships, and barriers) and related emissions – thus building the basis for the subsequent strategy definition and monitoring phases.

# Mission Team Goals Toward 2030

In particular, from an operational point of view, the Mission Team is in charge of coordinating the governance activity of the transition phase of the City towards climate neutrality. In this framework, several specific activities are encompassed, including preparing and drafting the CCC in the following phases, in terms of future further revisions/integrations of the contract itself to follow the implementation of the various decarbonization actions of the City coherently with what defined in the CCC, also detecting the possible barriers to their implementation (and, therefore, to the achievement of the target) and evaluating the possible options for decreasing them, and identifying the main levers of change that support the transition process; to define ad hoc Key Performance Indicators and track the evolutionary trajectory of the system; to monitor the financial aspects related to the implementation of the various actions; to manage the strategies for the involvement of the different City's actors.

In the phase following the signing of the CCC, in particular,

the Mission Team will continue its activity of coordinating and monitoring the actions necessary for the achievement of climate neutrality, continuing to ensure (and, where possible, to strengthen) the moments and spaces for periodic discussions between representatives of the Transition Team and EST@ energycenter Lab Team.

Meetings with citizens and stakeholders, progressively identified by the City to support the path to climate neutrality, will also continue.

Finally, the Mission Team will be tasked with offering periodic reports to the Mayor and the Council to ensure the most comprehensive sharing of data on the progress of planned actions toward full implementation of the CCC. Through the construction of this dual channel of communication, to the outside world and civil society, on the one hand, and to the inside and the local government, on the other, the political and administrative leadership of the Entity will benefit from all the data necessary to keep the guidance toward climate neutrality firmly in place and adopt corrections where necessary.

# P2 – City's actors' involvement and Transition co-design

Along with the Mission Team, an articulated system of actors in the territory, internal and external to the Administration, is engaged in the contract.

# The local socio-economic ecosystem

A systemic and multi-level approach involves the entire local ecosystem, composed of the city's different public and private actors, down to individual citizens (see Section 5).

The path outlined by the Città di Torino envisages different levels of involvement and is based on network governance. In particular, it was decided to gradually and transversally embrace the local ecosystem, stemming from an initial group (the "Core Team") – made up of actors pooled together in networks already involved in other processes and with a high potential in terms of direct/indirect effects on the reduction of climate-changing gas emissions –, up to individual citizens and fragile/vulnerable subjects.

Specifically, the local ecosystem currently includes multi-level institutional actors: public authorities-companies, the private sector (corporate, banking system, trade associations, etc.), the

In this document, the notion of "fragile/vulnerable subjects" broadly refers to social groups that are marginalized and/or exposed to inequalities/obstacles that jeopardize them to being granted full socio-economic status (e.g., people in energy poverty, young people and foreigners).

Work Process
Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Città di Torino
Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Città di Torino

Third Sector and associative world, the academic world and citizens, with a specific focus on the younger generations and fragile/vulnerable subjects.

The involvement of the local ecosystem is being implemented through different approaches: ① Meetings of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Climate Change; ② Targeted meetings with the services/offices within the municipal Administration; ③ Working tables with the territory's leading actors, municipal subsidiaries companies and thematic stakeholders, representative spheres of action of the Climate City Contract; ④ Workshops with thematic stakeholders to co-design a "portfolio of actions" – implementing the knowledge on the city's carbon footprint, and the identification of initial strategies towards climate neutrality by 2030 and beyond; ⑤ Meetings addressed to young people and youth associations with the aim of promoting the dialogue between young people and the city; ⑥ Activities to engage fragile/vulnerable subjects; ⑦ involvement of the private sector through the support of the Management Department of the University of Torino – in cooperation with other institutions, productive entities and the Third Sector.

This initial core is set to gradually grow through the reinforcement of engagement initiatives, information, and communication activities involving targets identified in barriers (see Section 3) and levers for change and the actors' mapping (see Section 5) – to promote, support, and broadening the active involvement of the local ecosystem.

The CCC will be gradually enriched by co-creating new actions and alliances. New opportunities will stem from confrontation, co-design with the territory, and integration with other ongoing policies and projects. "Widespread territorial workshops" will be set up as an opportunity to reflect on the most suitable solutions. At the same time, meetings addressed to young people and youth associations will consolidate the relationship between the younger generations and the municipal Administration.

## Co-creation of a portfolio of actions

For the drafting of the CCC, the Città di Torino has started a co-design process with local stakeholders, gradually involving an increasingly large number of public and private subjects as active participants in the challenge undertaken by the city.

The first phase of the process involved about 16 representatives of public entities, 40 participants from private companies, 35 participants from non-profit organizations, and also 20 associations for vulnerable people to arrive at a joint definition of the actions and investments that could be activated in the short, medium and long term to achieve the Mission's goals.

Also, thanks to the dialogue with the different stakeholders of the city and to the inputs received from them, according to a co-creation approach, a set of macro-actions (wide-scale actions able to significantly impact the overall urban system and leading to relevant effects on the emission inventory), covering all the sectors was set. For each macro-action, possible co-benefits were identified in various fields, from improving air quality to contrasting energy poverty and social inequalities to critical positive effects on health (see Section 4).

A portfolio of all the "micro-actions" already in progress or to be developed in the city¹⁰ was then created, associating them with the different fields of action and collecting them under the related macro-actions domain (see Annex I).

## Involvement of other institutional levels

Within the framework of the local coalition, the involvement of the Regione Piemonte and the Torino Città Metropolitana is crucial in defining a vertical multi-level external governance that allows for the development of actions both in coordination with the regional strategies and in full connection with a supra-local scale.

Such an interaction has made it possible to systemize the reconstruction of the baseline emission framework and the potential impact of future strategies. The interaction with the Città Metropolitana has deepened the effect on the municipal territory of policies promoting accessible, safe, and less polluting mobility towards environmental, economic, and social sustainability, such as the Piano Urbano per la Mobilità Sostenibile (PUMS – Urban Plan for Sustainable Mobility) issued in 2022 (see Section 3 – Part A). In a regional framework, the interaction with the Regione Piemonte was an opportunity to explore the interlocking of Municipal and Regional paths towards climate neutrality. In this sense, the definition of the Regional Climate Change Strategy in 2022¹¹ aims to direct regional administrative and political actions to counter climate change along a double-edged trajectory: on the one side, by adopting mitigation strategies to reduce climate-altering gas emissions; on the other, by increasing both resilience

¹⁰ The PAESC issued in 2023 had already systematised actions and projects initiated and/or financed and to be implemented by 2030, mainly triggered by the municipal administration and the investee companies that manage the main local public services.

¹¹ The first draft was approved in February 2022.

¹² In this document, we refer to the notion of "resilience" as the ability to survive and elaborate prompt recovery strategies from extreme weather/meteorological/ natural events due to climate change; and to "adaptation" as the capacity urban societies to ensure the city's functioning in an environmentally sustainable, energy efficient and economically affordable manner in the face of mutations in the environmental setting as a result of ongoing climate change.

and adaptation approaches¹² to prepare the territory and its inhabitants to face the inevitable consequences of global warming.

Supra-local cooperation expands nationally by launching working tables and agreements with ministries involved in the energy transition. In 2022, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Ministero delle Infrastrutture e delle Mobilità Sostenibili (Ministry of Infrastructure and Sustainable Mobility) and nine Italian cities involved in the path towards climate neutrality – which sees Torino as part of an expanded network sharing potentials and barriers in the path towards climate neutrality, but also methodologies for engagement, data collection/sharing, and the definition of new financial instruments to support the achievement of the objective. In this framework, the Let's GOv project, launched on 1 June 2023 with a duration of 24 months and in which the Città di Torino is a consortium partner and the EST@energycenter Lab is a scientific partner (see Section 5 and Annex II), represents an opportunity for the nine Italian cities (which jointly applied to the related call) to share good practices and projects – to create a knowledge base to other municipalities, public administrations or public bodies to move more quickly and efficiently towards the goals of the Mission of the Cities.¹³

## P3 – Science-based support to the city

The science-based approach provided by EST@energycenter Lab of the Politecnico di Torino to the city supports the first two pillars of the work process in quantitatively assessing – ex-ante and in silico, through ad hoc models and IT tools – policy actions and overall strategies towards carbon neutrality. Such cooperation is essential to building a shared vision, creating an operational approach, implementing concrete and measurable actions, and accompanying the city along the transition trajectory.

## Developing a City Ontology

The overarching action upstream of the P-3 structure is the creation of a "City Ontology." The City Ontology (Fig.2.2) allows the formalization of several correlations and interactions among the domains participating in Torino's energy transition. The ontology conceptualized by the EST@energycenter Lab of the Politecnico di Torino comprises classes and relationships, including individuals, classes, attributes, relations, functions, terms, restrictions, rules, axioms, and events. The Ontology is the basis of the definition of the single actions and, consequently, is preparatory to implementing a "what if" analysis scenario.

Considering the complexity of managing widely heterogeneous data, the evolution of data management is leading to the migration from traditional data warehouses to more flexible and scalable solutions like data lakes, and to the new approach of data lakehouses. With the increasing volume, variety, and velocity of data, in fact, data warehouses face limitations in handling unstructured and raw data. Data lakes provide, instead, a scalable solution for storing vast amounts of both structured and unstructured data in its native format. They offer advantages such as flexible schema, support for real-time and batch processing, and the ability to incorporate new data sources seamlessly. Due to the need for bridging the gap between data storage and data analytics, the concept of a data lakehouse has thus emerged – combining the benefits of both data warehouses and data lakes, and providing a unified platform that enables data storage, data processing, and analytics in a single architecture.

As of 31 December 2019.

# Data collection and data lakehouse

Systematized data collection and classification are pivotal to creating cognitive and decision-making value through open-source data intelligence. Data and information that characterize the city are organized and stored in a data lakehouse,¹⁴ gathering and managing structured, partially structured, and completely unstructured data. The data lakehouse ensures a shared data hub for hosting all the relevant data of the city, which helps manage the energy transition and the sustainability process to feed the models for scenario analyses and allow for the evolutive tracking of the urban system.

# Inventory of the City's GHG (CO₂) emissions

The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline is the "zero degree" of the decarbonization process of the urban system towards climate neutrality – indicating the amount of greenhouse gas emissions to be removed from the urban energy system by 2030 to reach the climate neutrality condition.

The reference year for constructing the Greenhouse Gas Emission Baseline Inventory is 2019,¹⁵ corresponding to the PAESC (Piano di Azione per l'Energia Sostenibile e il Clima – Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan)¹⁶ and the Third Monitoring Report of the TAPE – TorinoAction Plan for Energy.¹⁷ Also, 2019 is considered by the European Commission as an acceptable reference year for all cities that have joined the NetZeroCities protocol.

The definition of the Baseline Inventory mirrors and encapsulates the peculiarities of the local situation and conditions characterizing the Città di Torino; therefore, the PAESC and the Third Monitoring Report of the TAPE represent the primary reference documents. However, to overcome the limitation in the available data and to increase the level of reliability of the presented emission inventory, a complete revision process of the energy consumption and emissions values for all the macro-areas (stationary energy, transport, waste, IPPU and AFOLU) and sectors, with further ad-hoc analyses and calculations, has been performed with respect to the preliminary assessment presented into the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission Call for Expression of Interest. In particular, for what concerns the industrial sector (for which, in the Expression of Interest all the emissions related to the sectorial energy consumption were attributed to the IPPU macro-area, not complying with the indications provided by the NetZeroCities 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan Guidance and Explanation

(p. 8, pp. 31-32), furthermore including both ETS industry – for which only the consumption of natural gas was considered – and Non-ETS industry – for which both natural gas and electricity consumptions were taken into account) a fully revised assessment has been performed, taking into account that emissions from energy use in manufacturing and industrial facilities, construction activities and energy industries fall under the stationary energy macro-area, and not under the IPPU one. In particular, in this new estimation, only non-ETS (Emissions Trading System) industries have been considered.¹⁸ The electricity consumption has been evaluated starting from the consumption data provided by the IRETI S.p.A. company¹⁹ (belonging to the Iren Multi-utility company and devoted to the management of the urban electricity distribution network) via the Regione Piemonte and filtering and aggregating them according to a clustering of the different industrial facilities based on the ATECUE code (that identifies and allows to classify the all the various economic and productive activities). Concerning natural gas, data have been provided by the Regione Piemonte (based on data from SNAM and Italgas companies²⁰), classified according to the intended use. From them, the industrial component has been first extracted, and the consumption of the ETS industry (obtained through a direct request to the industries classified as ETS) has been subtracted from this component to get the non-ETS industrial consumption only. Eventually, the related emissions have been calculated by multiplying the electricity and natural gas consumption values by the related emissions factors adopted by the PAESC.

The division of the Baseline into Scopes, Macro-areas, and Sectors follows the guidelines developed by the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories V.1.1.²¹ The categorization into Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 refers to the geographical location of energy consumption and emissions, using the administrative boundaries of the Città di Torino as a reference.²²

In particular, the following macro-areas and sectors have been considered:

① Stationary energy (sectors: residential, tertiary, industrial and municipal buildings, industrial processes, waste-to-energy plant, and public lighting)

② Transport (sectors: municipal vehicles, private transport, and public transport)

ETS industries are those that participates to the Emission Trading System (ETS) of the European Union. The ETS is a cap &amp; trade mechanism, setting the overall maximum value (cap) on the emissions permitted on European territory in the sectors covered by the ETS scheme, which corresponds to an equivalent number of allowances (1 ton of CO2eq. = 1 allowance) that can be purchased/sold on a specific market (trade). Each industrial operator active in the sectors covered by the scheme must compensate its actual annual emissions with a corresponding quantity of allowances. As requested in the Guidelines, only non-ETS industries have been considered for the calculation of the baseline.

# Implementation of a facility for structuring &amp; management, polishing &amp; validation, and data storage (Torino's Energy &amp; Transition Data Room – ETDR)

The data lakehouse is implemented by developing ad hoc web crawler systems for collecting and constantly updating the stored data and coding functions for data association among different datasets in different data sources. Contextually, data validation algorithms are developed – aiming to test the data's consistency and make any anomalies apparent to the users. Data are then validated and polished, when necessary, through dedicated software. The objective is the creation of an "Energy &amp; Transition DataBase" of Torino – relational, integrated, and multi-domain – that allows data to be hosted on dedicated servers, validated, and made available for consultation or as input to both the models for scenario and impact assessment analyses and to the tracking of the evolutionary trajectory of the urban system. A prototype database version is already available and will be further developed.

In this framework, a "Torino's Energy &amp; Transition Data Room" and visualization center (intended as a "research mirror" for hosting a copy of all the most relevant data of the city), which will be hosted at the EST@energycenter Lab of the Politecnico di Torino, has been designed and is currently in the implementation phase, with specific hardware and software equipment and 24-hour dedicated servers (for online calculation, database management, pre-and post-calculation support, visualization). In this perspective, the data lakehouse approach is coupled with the distributed database approach, which allows for higher resilience (since data are not stored on a single physical machine but distributed across multiple nodes physically located in different machines and replicated in such a way as to ensure redundancy) and performances (as through proper load balancers it is possible to balance the workload between different servers, even in the presence of numerous simultaneous queries) in comparison with traditional databases. This infrastructure will be based on a hyperconverged cluster and a distributed architecture with five nodes (and three copies of all the data distributed on these nodes).

# Macro-action approach and catalog of the actions

The setting up of a data lakehouse and the calculation of the Baseline is preparatory to the definition of the actions to be implemented for reaching the 2030 decarbonization goal: for each sector and subsector, one or more macro-actions were defined.

The Action Plan for the Climate City Contract for Torino defines a set of 31 macro-actions – 27 macro-actions for emission reduction and 4 macro-actions for emission compensation (See Section 4, Part B). Macro-actions constitute both conceptual and operational scaffolding. Conceiving a strategy for decarbonizing the city implies an integrated and cross-sectoral vision of all macro-areas, sectors, and scopes covered by the Baseline. This synoptic vision aims to identify the different types of interventions possible in each industry, assessing their potential impact on the city in quantitative (GHG reduction) and qualitative (co-benefits) terms. This approach makes it possible to define macro-areas of intervention, thus setting strategies and defining policies to achieve the city's 2030 target.

They are not punctual interventions, with limited application area (e.g., a single building, a small stock of public vehicles) and limited impacts on GHG emissions reduction and compensation. Instead, they are intended as a broader taxonomy of actions (e.g., heat pumps, PV systems) targeting macro-areas and sectors (e.g., buildings, transport, lighting) – able to impact the overall urban system significantly and leading to relevant effects on the emission inventory of Torino. These wide-scale actions thus represent the general reference framework in which all the already ongoing/ planned policies and the possible future interventions must be collocated.

Along the macro-actions, different sets of micro-actions targeting punctual elements of the sectors (e.g., a single municipal building, a school) have also been considered concerning the macro-area they belong to exemplify the macro-actions and account for the already implemented activities for sustainability (See Annex II).

# Models and algorithm for impact assessment

For the different macro-actions, ad hoc in-house models were

Work Process
Work Process
Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Città di Torino
Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Città di Torino

developed and documented to quantify – before and after the implementation of each action – the impact in terms of energy commodity consumption and GHG emissions associated with the consumption of the various commodities. The mathematical functions implementing the models are formalized and implemented through scripts coded in Python, translating the algorithms and JSON files to define their parameters.

The functions are then incorporated into the CLICC IT platform – which can elaborate the simultaneous combination of different types of actions for the estimation of their impacts in terms of GHG emissions avoided and the assessment of the related costs, providing a pre-compiled template for the documents (i.e., Commitment, Action Plan and Investment Plan of the CCC).

# Development of an ad hoc IT platform for CCC definition and formalization in the framework of a more general digital twin tool for the city

For supporting the definition and drafting phases of the CCC, the CLICC platform was specifically designed and implemented to quantitatively assess the impacts of actions and pathways in terms of GHG emission reduction and the related costs, allowing the City decision-makers to test in silico, interactively, different policy options and identifying the combination of them that mainly fits with their strategies for reaching the climate neutrality.

The CLICC platform is the initial stepping stone of a broader strategic framework in which Torino is developing a digital twin of the city (currently under construction), intended to: ① provide a comprehensive and synoptic view of the urban system ② elaborate integrated multi-level and multi-sector urban models – comprising environmental models, models of the city building stock, transport models, models of urban energy infrastructures, models of waste treatment and circular economy and including stakeholders/social interactions and behavioral models; ③ assessing, in a multidimensional way, the impacts of the possible energy transition pathways of the city.

The CLICC platform is able to explore different "what if?" scenario analyses and impact assessments of diverse implementable sustainability pathways and track the system's evolution concerning the set targets.

Through a continuous interaction between the Municipality and the EST@energycenter Lab, the IT tool is translated in a user-friendly interface: a web platform supporting the policy decision-maker in exploring and comparing different strategies and policies related to the definition of the CCC and to the quantitative tracking of the city system's evolution, with respect to the set sustainability goals – selecting the preferred one based on his/her preferences in a user-friendly environment.

Furthermore, once defined the set of actions and the pathway, the platform allows for an automatic completion of the various sections of the CCC itself.

The CLICC platform is intended for several types of users: technical staff, in charge of the system management and operation; officers and administrators of the City, which can access to and exploit all the functions of the platform; utilities, which can create and test a set of actions; citizens, which can access to general evolutive tracking of the urban system towards the transition goals.

# 3. PART A

The starting point for Torino: current state of emissions and climate actions

# 3.1 Module A-I: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

As mentioned in Section 2, the division of the Baseline into Scopes, Macro-areas and sectors follows the guidelines developed by the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The categorization into Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 refers to the geographical location of energy consumption and emissions, using the administrative boundaries of the city as a reference. Scope 1 accounts for direct consumption and emissions related to fuels and other energy sources within the city boundaries; Scope 2 accounts for indirect consumption and emissions related to electricity and heating supply within the city boundaries; finally, Scope 3 accounts for energy consumption and emissions that occur outside the city boundaries as a result of activities within the administrative boundaries.

In particular, the following macro-areas and subsectors have been considered (see Figure 3.1.1):

Stationary energy (sectors: residential buildings, tertiary buildings, industrial buildings and municipal buildings, industrial processes, waste-to-energy plant and public lighting)²³
Transport (sectors: municipal vehicles, private transport and public transport)
Waste (sectors: landfill, waste and wastewater treatment systems)
Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU)
Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)

A1) Electricity generation and Waste-to-Energy (WtE) Power Plant: In the Città di Torino, the power station "Centrale Torino Nord"  $^{24}$  (which is an ETS plant), operated by the multi-utility company Iren and connected to the urban district heating network, is the prevailing source of GHG emissions related to the electricity and thermal energy generation within the city's boundaries. In any case, according to the EU Mission Info Kit for Cities and the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories V.1.1 all the emissions related to the consumption of electricity and heat for district heating are accounted under the Scope 2.

Consistent with the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories V.1.1,[25] the emissions from waste-to-energy were accounted for in the Stationary Energy macro-area. The emission data of the waste-to-energy plant were obtained through the data indicated in 2022 Environmental Statement of the Torino Gerbido Waste-to-energy Plant[26], reduced in order to consider an average percentage of biogenic carbon of  $60\%$ .[27,28] This emission factor was applied to the data of urban waste flows of 2019 provided by ISPRA (Istituto Superiore per la Sostenibilità Ambientale - Institute for Environmental Sustainability),[29] AMIAT (Azienda Multiservizi Igiene Ambientale Torino - Multiservice Company Environmental Hygiene Torino),[30] Città Metropolitana di Torino and ATOR (Associazione d'Ambito Torinese per il Governo dei Rifiuti - TorinoArea Association for Waste Management).[31]

A2) Industrial Sector: The emissions and consumption of the industrial sector have been included in the macro-area "Stationary Energy". This is also in coherence with Deliverable 2.5 "Identified climate impact indicators based on existing indicators review" of the NetZeroCities project, which reports within the definition of "Stationary Energy", the entry "Energy industries: All emissions from energy production and energy use in energy industries".

According to the European Commission, contributions from industrial sectors that fall under the ETS are not considered; only those from non-ETS industries are relevant in the balance. The energy consumption and the emission of the industrial sector have been calculated according the procedure described in Section 2 (see pp. 27-28 of this Action Plan).

A3) Waste macro-area: The waste sector is not included in the PAESC and TAPE reports, but is required when defining the Baseline. For the calculation of the Baseline, emissions related to the Basse di Stura landfill were therefore considered. 32

The Basse di Stura controlled burial landfill plant covers an area of nearly one million square meters, with a total volume of nearly 20 m³; It is "the first Italian landfill equipped with an environmental management system with UNI EN ISO 14001:2004 certification, considered among the most advanced in Italy and Europe for the treatment and disposal of undifferentiated waste". 33

The Basse di Stura landfill is divided into two parts: the Old Landfill, whose contribution began in 1947 and continued until 1981, and the New Landfill, which was authorized in December 1979 and ceased in 2010; in 2010, the "post-mortem" management of the site began, which led to the total environmental recovery of the area through both the planting of the vegetation cover (turf) of the site and the creation of tree barriers around the perimeter of the site to mitigate the visual impact of the plant, and the "securing of the old landfill, already converted into a green area (Marmorina Park), which had been in operation from the post-war period until the 1980s and was only partially waterproofed".34

Today, the unsorted waste collected by AMIAT (the company that provides integrated management of soil hygiene, waste collection and disposal services in the Città di Torino) within the perimeter of the Città di Torino is directed to the metropolitan waste-to-energy plant.

Referring to the waste treatment, the quantity of sorted waste produced by the Città di Torino in 2019 was identified in accordance with AMIAT's guidelines.35 Thanks to the "Waste Management Status Report",36 it was possible to identify the waste processed within the city limits (included in Scope 1) and outside of it (included in Scope 3). The emission factors applied are in line with IFEU's recommendations.37

The emissions associated with wastewater were instead calculated by applying a proportion based on the population of Torino, using the values reported in SMAT's 2020 Sustainability Report. 38,39,40 As the city's wastewater is treated outside its municipal boundaries, these emissions have been categorized within Scope 3.

A4) IPPU and AFOLU: Emissions associated with the IPPU and AFOLU macro-areas have been considered negligible, in the framework of the Baseline calculation.

The IPPU macro-area only includes the uses of commodities not related to energy. It has to report "Emissions from GHGs used in, or as a by-product of industrial processes and products (if present / significant)",41 while the AFOLU macro-area should report "Changes in GHG emissions from any changes in land use giving rise to (sources) or sequestering (sinks) emissions (if significant)".

The consumptions and emissions values related to the IPPU macro-area originally released in the Expression of Interest were a preliminary assessment of the whole industrial sector for the third monitoring report of the Turin Action Plan for Energy (TAPE), issued in 2022. In particular, all the emissions related to the industrial energy consumption were attributed to the IPPU macro-area, not complying with the indications provided by the NetZeroCities 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan Guidance and Explanation (see p.8, pp.31-32): they were referred to the overall industrial sector including both ETS industry (for which only the consumption of natural gas was considered) and Non-ETS industry (for which both natural gas and electricity consumptions were taken into account).

For the definition of the baseline emission inventory of the Climate City Contract, instead, a complete review of this assessment has been made, taking into account that emissions from energy use in manufacturing and industrial facilities, construction activities and energy industries fall under the stationary energy macro-area, and not under the IPPU one. Consequently, the emissions associated to the IPPU macro-area have been considered negligible due to the fact that within the boundary of the city there are no major industries that chemically or physically transform materials releasing significant amount of GHGs.

Regarding emissions from the AFOLU macro-area, which are predominantly non-CO₂ gases (especially N₂O and CH₄⁻⁶), they have been considered negligible due to the limited area that is devoted to crop production and livestock activities within the city of Turin. In fact, the crop surface within the urban boundary is limited to 2 km²,⁴³ corresponding to 2% of the total green area. Moreover, it has been shown,⁴⁴,⁴⁵ that urban food production actually plays a positive role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared with the conventional food system because of its potential to produce food with lower intensity of transportation, energy use, and packaging, and greater carbon sequestration

when the proper crop is selected⁴⁶ and the garden is managed individually.

Finally, in the AFOLU framework, the impact of maintenance activities is minimal, further justifying the negligible consideration of AFOLU emissions in the urban context. Urban green-related emissions are ascribable to construction works (excavation, transportation and forestry production) and maintenance activities (the use of lawnmowers, trimmers, leaf blowers, trees pruning and transportation of personnel and equipment). Additionally, the production and transport of fertilizers and other maintenance materials can contribute to CO₂ emissions. The total CO₂ emissions associated with urban green have been estimated around 5% of the amount of CO₂ absorbed⁴⁷ which is within the uncertainty band of the estimated CO₂ capture. Due to this reason, this value has not been accounted for in the present version of the Climate City Contract.

The AFOLU macro-area, although negligible in terms of emissions, is nevertheless particularly important with regard to CO₂ sinks (associated with urban forestation and greenery), as it is in this sector that these negative contributions should be accounted for.

Emissions associated with biomass consumption have always been assumed to be zero – i.e., assuming that all biomass used is certified.

Summary of energy consumption by Scopes and Sectors. With regard to Scopes 1 and 2, the most relevant energy consumption belongs to the Stationary Energy macro-area and involves the residential sector (3,617,957 MWh/y, i.e., 34.5% of the total), followed by the tertiary sector (2,431,809 MWh/y, 23.2% of the total) and the non-ETS industrial sector (1,581,721 MWh/y, 15.1% of the total). The whole Stationary Energy macro-area accounts for 76.1% of the total final energy consumption of Torino in 2019.

Another macro-sector that significantly affects the overall energy consumption is private transport (21.8% of the total), mainly due to passenger cars (1,537,698 MWh/y) and industrial vehicles (620,268 MWh/y); as far as public transport is concerned, urban vehicles (169,078 MWh/y) have the greatest impact. The whole public transport, however, is responsible for just 1.8% of the overall energy consumption of the city.

The energy commodities utilized in wastewater treatment, waste treatment, and waste-to-energy processes are excluded from this table. This omission is due to their inclusion in the emission factors used to assess emissions within the waste sector. Specifically, the adopted methodology integrates emissions associated with energy commodity consumption (such as diesel and electricity) into the treatment processes for various types of waste. This approach aims to prevent double counting; hence energy commodity consumption is not separately listed here.

Moreover, the energy consumption in the IPPU and AFOLU macro-areas are not accounted for in the calculation. In fact, as previously mentioned, there are no relevant industries that chemically or physically transform materials releasing GHGs nor agricultural activities within the urban perimeter; only the absorption of emissions from urban green areas - including parks, trees, green areas and hilly green areas - is taken into account, but this does not affect the energy consumption.

Summary of consumption by commodity. In the residential sector, consumption related to heat for district heating (1,279,118 MWh/y, i.e., 35.4% of the total energy consumption of the sector) and natural gas (1,424,218 MWh/y, 39.4% of the sectorial total) are the most important ones, followed by electricity (856,616 MWh/y, 23.7% of the sectorial total). For the tertiary sector, the most relevant commodities are electricity (1,126,551 MWh/y, 46.3% of the sectorial total) and natural gas (942,040 MWh/y, 38.7% of the sectorial total). For the non-ETS industrial sector, a

major role is played by natural gas (1,344,411 MWh/y, 85% of the sectorial total).

In the private transport sector, as expected, the commodities with the greatest impact in terms of consumption are gasoline for passenger cars (859,809 MWh/y, 55.9% of the sectorial total) and diesel from industrial vehicles (492,399 MWh/y, 91.0% of the sectorial total). In 2019 the electrification of private transport was still negligible.

Overall consumption balance. The largest consumption results from the use of natural gas (3,915,833 MWh/y, 37.4% of the total), electricity (2,384,240 MWh/y, 22.8% of the total), heat for district heating network (1,780,925 MWh/y) and refined petroleum products (2,371,715 MWh/y, 22.6% of the total).

The energy consumption in 2019 by scope, macro-area and sector is graphically represented in the following Figures 3.1.2 and 3.1.3.

Table A-1.2 shows the Emission Factors used to define the Baseline of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions. In adherence to what is reported in the PAESC, in order to calculate the municipal emissions balance, the determination of the Emission Factors considered different sources: the 2006 IPCC – Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories[46] were integrated with the data provided by ISPRA and Iren Energia (in the reworking provided by the PAESC).

The analysis of the activity sectors included in the emissions inventory (with the exception of the IPPU and AFOLU macro-areas) and the associated GHG emissions has maintained an approach based mainly on the calculation of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ alone, with the exception of the Waste macro-area, because the significance of the other main GHGs ($\mathrm{CH}_4$ and $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$) in the sectors considered is not relevant and no specific measures for their reduction are planned. In the Waste macro-area, instead, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalent emissions have been considered, as waste treatment processes involve significant greenhouse gas emissions other than $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, such as methane and nitrous oxide; considering, for example, anaerobic digestion and composting, the emissions of $\mathrm{CH}_4$ (methane) and $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$ (nitrous oxide) are relevant, especially by taking into account their Global Warming Potential[49] per 100 years of 27.2 and 273 respectively (2006 IPCC Guidelines).

For what concerns the waste sector, the emissions related to the sorted waste (paper, glass, aluminum, plastic, green waste, organic waste, metals) treated in Torino, which in 2019 overall amounted to 208,736 t/y[50] and the emissions related to the treatment of wastewater (accounting to 120.25 Mm³/y).

Moreover, the emission data of the waste-to-energy plant were obtained through the data indicated in 2022 Environmental Statement of the Torino Gerbido Waste-to-energy Plant[51], reduced in order to consider a mean percentage of biogenic carbon of $60\%$ [52,53]. This emission factor was applied to the urban unsorted waste flow of 2019 equal to $229,020~\mathrm{t / y}$, provided by ISPRA, AMIAT, Città Metropolitana di Torino and ATOR.[54,55,56]

With regard to electricity consumption and district heating, a local emission factor was defined, calculated according to the methodology defined in the PAESC Guidelines.

The local emission factor associated with the heat distributed by the city's district heating network was calculated from the data reported in the environmental declarations of the relevant power stations (IREN Torino Nord power station and IREN Moncalieri power station).

With regard to the FENEE factor (national emission factor for electricity), in line with what is indicated by the Covenant of Mayors guidelines, the national one proposed by the Istituto superiore per la protezione e la ricerca ambientale (ISPRA - Superior Institute for Environmental Protection and Re-search) was used instead of the IPCC one.

## Assumption on the emissions calculation

Table A-1.3 shows the Baseline $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions (in terms of tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ per year) calculated for Scopes, Macro-areas, Sectors and Subsectors; emissions of the remaining GHG were considered negligible, as their impact on the total balance is limited. A quantitative assessment of their contribution will be performed in

IPCC National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme (2006) 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/

The Global Warming Potential is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 t of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 t of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$

subsequent releases of the CCC. For all macro-areas and sectors, a re-evaluation of the consumption and emissions values was carried out compared to the estimates reported in the PAESC and third TAPE monitoring report.

Emissions associated with the consumption of biomass have been assumed to be zero, i.e., assuming that all biomass used is certified (according to the criteria set out in the "Info Kit" of the "EU Mission: Climate Neutral and Smart Cities" it would be necessary to know whether the biomass considered in the energy balance is certified, and therefore does not contribute to GHG emissions).

# Stationary Energy

Stationary Energy includes the following sectors and sub-sectors: municipal buildings; public lighting; residential buildings; tertiary buildings; waste-to-energy plant (according to the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories V.1.1⁵⁷); non-ETS industry (for which the emissions related to the consumption of energy commodities have been accounted for coherently with what described in Section 2, pp. 27-28 of this Action Plan).

Emissions associated to the consumption of fossil commodities (predominantly natural gas) have been included into Scope 1, while emissions related to the consumption of electricity and heat for district heating have been included in Scope 2.

# Transport

Transport includes municipal vehicles, private transport and public transport, further subdivided according to different types of vehicles (e.g., passenger cars, motorcycles, industrial vehicles and buses for what concerns private transport; tramway, rail, metro, urban vehicles for what concerns public transport; motorcycles, passenger vehicles and trucks for municipal vehicles).

Emissions associated to the consumption of fossil commodities (especially refined oil products) have been included into Scope 1, while emissions related to the consumption of electricity have been included in Scope 2.

# Waste

According to the CCC guidelines, emissions from waste generated and managed within the city have been accounted for in Scope 1, while Scope 3 includes emissions from waste generated within the city but managed externally.

## Scope 1:

residual emissions from the Basse di Stura landfill⁵⁸
emissions from the waste-to-energy plant (share related to waste from the Città di Torino)
emissions from sorted waste management within the Città di Torino

## Scope 3:

emissions from the management of sorted waste produced by the Città di Torino and treated outside the city boundaries

emissions from wastewater treatment

As stated in the JRC guidelines⁵⁹, the only percentage of carbon to be considered for the calculation of emissions is carbon of fossil origin, which for municipal waste is around 40% of the total. The emission factor of the waste-to-energy plant (measured in the stack) is then multiplied by this percentage, resulting in 2019 emissions of 99,351 tCO₂/y.

In the Waste macro-area, wastewater emissions were also added, calculated on the basis of the emissions declared by SMAT and considering only the amount of wastewater from the Città di Torino. Emissions have been accounted in Scope 3, due to the fact that the treatment plant is located in Castiglione Torinese, outside the boundaries of the city.

# IPPU and AFOLU

As previously stated, the IPPU and AFOLU macro-areas have not been accounted for in terms of emissions. For what concerns the AFOLU macro-area, the absorption of CO2 by existing green areas has been considered.

## Summary of emissions by Scope and Sectors

As far as Scope 1 and 2 are concerned, the largest emissions concern the Stationary Energy macro-area and involve the residential sector (712,008 t/y, i.e. 29.7% of the total CO₂ emissions of the city), followed by the tertiary sector (524,538 t/y, 21.9% of the total) and the non-ETS industrial sector (329,712 t/y 13.8% of the total).

Another sector widely affecting emissions is private transport, especially with reference to by passenger cars (387,421 t/y 16.2% of the total), industrial vehicles (163,493 t/y, 6.8% of the total); as far as public transport is concerned, urban vehicles account for only 1.7% of the total urban emissions (41,127 t/y).

Regarding the AFOLU macro-area, the existing green areas are able to absorb 35,117 t/y of CO2, corresponding to 1.5% of the total.

## Summary of CO₂ emissions by commodity and by sector (t/y)

In the residential sector, emissions related to natural gas (287,692 t/y, 40.4% of the total emissions of the sector), electricity (209,871 t/y, 29.5% of the sectorial total) and heat for district heating (205,938 t/y, 28.9% of the sectorial total) have the greatest impact. For the tertiary sector, the commodities

with the greatest incidence are mainly electricity (276,005 t/y, 52.6% of the sectorial total) and natural gas (190,292 t/y, 36.3% of the sectorial total). For the non-ETS industrial sector, the consumption of natural gas is responsible of the largest part of the sectorial emissions (271,571 t/y, 82.4% of the sectorial total) is the most important commodity.

In the private transport sector, the majority of CO₂ emissions arises from gasoline consumption of passenger cars (214,092 t/y, 55.3% of the sectorial total) and diesel consumption of industrial vehicles (150,645 t/y, 92.1% of the sectorial total).

Overall emissions balance. The baseline of the Torino CCC, as of 2019, has been quantified at 2,396,907 tCO₂/y. The largest emissions come from the use of natural gas (790,998 t/y, 33.0% of the total), electricity (584,139 t/y, 24.4% of the total) and refined petroleum products (609,483 t/y, 25.4% of the total).

The emissions in 2019 by scope, macro-area and sector are graphically represented in the following Figures 3.1.4 and 3.1.5.

# Stationary Energy macro-area (Municipal and Private Buildings)

Municipal and private buildings' emissions appertain to both Scope 1 and Scope 2. The calculation of GHG emissions for this sub-sector for the reference base year 2019, was elaborated on the basis of the ISTAT (Istituto Nazionale di Statistica - National Institute of Statistics) data concerning the stock of buildings in Torino, as referred to in the PAESC.

In order to determine the stock of buildings, the data from the ISTAT census issued in 2011 was taken as a reference – showing a stock of 63,764 buildings, 411,264 properties with at least 1 resident, and 36,158 residential buildings.

In addition to the number of buildings and properties, the heated surface area was also taken into account as a proxy to determine GHG emissions. The average heated surface area of the buildings for each intended use was determined by skimming and statistically processing the 329,655 energy performance certificates available today for the Città di Torino, from which the total air-conditioned surface area of the buildings considered was derived (amounting to 52 million m², of which 35 million m² related to the residential sector – consistent with the figures given in the PAESC) and their breakdown by energy class according to their related use and energy class.

# Stationary Energy macro-area (Non-ETS Industry)

The Non-ETS Industry Sub-sector encompasses Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. For the evaluation of electricity consumption in the industrial sector, a process was initially conducted to extract the consumption of companies, aggregated according to the ATECUE code.⁶¹ Data on consumption were provided by the Regione Piemonte database – notably with the source identified as IRETI SpA.⁶² Only the ATECUE codes falling within the industrial sector were considered.

Regarding natural gas, relevant data were retrieved from the Regione Piemonte database, with sources from the companies SNAM and Italgas.63 The aggregation of these data is less specific than data on electricity, due to their classification based solely on use. In this context, only the industrial component was taken into account; the consumption of the ETS industry was subtracted from this component, which was obtained through a direct request to the entities belonging to it.

In addition, a detailed cataloguing of all industries located within the boundaries of the municipality of Torino was carried out. Each industry was characterized by its ATECO code and subdivided into registered office and local units. At the moment, this cataloguing was not used for the calculation of the baseline, but could be useful for the more accurate development of future interventions.

For the non-ETS Industry sector, a complete re-evaluation of the consumption and emissions values was carried out compared to the estimates reported in the PAESC and in the third TAPE monitoring report, and included to the Stationary Energy macro-area according to the NetZeroCities 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan Guidance and Explanation (see p. 8, pp. 31-32).

## Transport macro-area

Transport emissions also appertains to both Scope 1 and Scope 2. The calculation of emissions for the Transport sector was based on a comprehensive analysis of the vehicles in the Città di Torino as of 2019. The calculation of GHG emissions has systematized the data regarding both municipal and private vehicle stocks (as of 31 December 2019), cancellations (cessations of circulation), first registrations of new vehicles and ownership transfers that occurred during 2019 in the Città di Torino. The data have been calculated on the basis of the findings on the legal status of vehicles counted in the PRA (Pubblico Registro Automobilistico - Public Register of Motor Vehicles).64

The research counted a stock of 698,626 public and private vehicles, divided into different types,65 different emission categories (Euro 0 to Euro 6) and emission profiles.66

In addition to the number of vehicles, the calculation of emissions took into account odometer mileage on urban routes, expressed in km.

## Waste macro-area

The Waste Sector emissions appertains to both Scope 1 and Scope 3. For the calculation of the emissions related to the waste sector in 2019, data from the report issued by the Waste Register of ISPRA - Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale 69 were taken into account.

The report records 437,805 t/y of waste produced by the Città di Torino in 2019.70 According to the data reported by ISPRA and the company AMIAT - Azienda Multiservizi Igiene Ambientale Torino S.p.A., updated to 31 December 2019, the share of sorted waste represents 47,7% of the total (about 208,736 t/y).71

On the other hand, unsorted Municipal Waste represents the amount of residual waste (229,069 t/y). According to the "Report on the state of the waste management system" compiled in November 2020 by the Waste Metropolitan Observatory and ATOR - the Torino Waste Management Association, residual waste is treated almost entirely by the Gerbido72 waste-to-energy plant (and represents about 40.7% of the total waste treated by the plant).

# AFOLU macro-area

The evaluation of the AFOLU Sector has taken into account the number of trees declared by the municipality of Torino (arboreal account), their CO₂ storage factors, and the distribution of species in the city as assessed by the PAESC.

The arboreal account encompasses the urban greenery within the boundaries of Torino Municipality. The total volume of CO₂ stored by the extension of urban greenery is calculated as a function of the number of forest categories in the municipality of Torino and in relation to their capacity to absorb carbon dioxide (tCO₂/tree/y). According to arboreal balance estimates, there are about 147,000 trees in the urban area of Torino – of which 48,000 represents the street trees; in addition, there are about 230,000 trees in the Municipality's hilly area.

The Environment Park is a technological private/public partnership hub focused on environmental innovation and promoting environmental sustainability as a competitiveness engine. See https://www.envipark.com

As for the street trees, the distribution of species is known and it is therefore possible to associate the relative absorption capacity with each species. The species distribution available for street trees is used as representative for the entire municipality to a first approximation.

In order to make a comparison, an estimate of the CO₂ stored by urban greenery is also made by using the data on tree distribution over the municipality provided by the Environment Park⁷⁴: this second evaluation slightly differs from that of the street trees reported in the tree balance.

For the 2019 baseline, the CO₂ storage capacity of greenery was calculated on a total green area (including urban green and forest green) of 53.67 million m².

# 3.2 Module A-2
## Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

The Città di Torino has always been committed to developing actions to protect the environment and reduce emissions and climate-changing gases – including through careful strategic energy management.

In this sense, the first Piano Energetico Comunale (PENCO - Municipal Energy Plan) was drafted – back in 1992 – by the offices of the Azienda Energetica Municipale (Municipal Energy Company), on behalf of the Città di Torino, in order to elaborate an urban energy balance and set out measures that could be adopted to rationalize energy consumption – mainly aimed at the Transport, Industry, Residential and Tertiary Sectors.

The document was subsequently followed, in 1993, by the so-called Piano Energetico Urbano (Urban Energy Plan), elaborated within the TEST (Torino Energy Strategy) project and developed to organise an information system capable of defining the relationship between incoming energy flows and final demand, for the different sectors.

These two initial actions were followed by the adoption of the Piano Urbano per la Mobilità Sostenibile (PUMS - Urban Plan for Sustainable Mobility) in 2008-2011, initially falling under the City's purview: the strategic plan builds on existing planning tools and takes due account of the principles of integration, participation and evaluation to meet the mobility needs of people and goods, with the aim of improving the quality of life in and around cities.

In 2009, the Città di Torino joined the Covenant of Mayors, which committed cities to prepare and implement a Sustainable Energy Action Plan, with the goal of reducing their $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions by more than $20\%$ by 2020 – through increased energy efficiency, increased use of renewable energy sources, and appropriate promotion and communication actions.

The City Council Resolution of 13 September 2010 also approved the Torino Action Plan for Energy (TAPE) – thus reinforcing its commitment to significantly reduce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions by 2020. TAPE's priority areas of implementation are public and private buildings, mobility and transport, in which major structural investments have been launched.

The 2009 Covenant was subsequently updated with the adoption of the Mayors Adapt, in 2015, initiated by the EU Commission to incentivize cities to voluntarily undertake local adaptation strategies and awareness-raising activities on climate change. Furthermore, in 2019, the New Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy was signed, whereby the City committed to reduce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (and possibly other greenhouse gas) emissions by at least $40\%$ by 2030 through improved energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy sources, to enhance the resilience of its territory and to share vision, results, experience and know-how with other local and regional authorities in the EU. The Piano d'Azione per l'Energia Sostenibile e il Clima (PAESC - Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan) was elaborated in 2023 as an output of the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy.

Other recently activated actions include: the Piano della Mobilità Ciclistica (BICIPLAN - Bicycle Mobility Plan), approved in 2013 and aimed at increasing (to at least $15\%$) bicycle travel within the next 10 years (from about 15,000 to 75,000 people); the Allegato Energetico - Ambientale al Regolamento Edilizio della Città di Torino (Energy-Environmental Annex to the Building Regulations of the Città di Torino), aimed at identifying a series of requirements, some mandatory and others voluntary, with a view to the energy and environmental qualification of building processes and products; the Piano di Resilienza Climatica (Climate Resilience Plan), adopted in 2020 and drawn up in synergy with various institutional subjects, including ARPA, the Regione Piemonte, Torino Universities and the Società Metropolitana Acque Torino (SMAT - Torino Metropolitan Water Company), in order to identify the territory's main vulnerabilities and identify short- and long-term adaptation measures, defining a series of nearly 80 actions to reduce the impacts caused mainly by heat waves and flooding.

The actions adopted by the Città di Torino have found tight synergy with the Plans and Strategies contextually activated at the provincial/metropolitan and regional level.

In particular, it should be noted that, as early as 1999, the Province of Torino (later Città Metropolitana), in its own Piano territoriale di coordinamento provinciale (Provincial territorial coordination plan) – a development planning tool that systematizes the territories and proposes the best possible territorial arrangement – indicated fair access to resources (combating territorial and

population marginality and socio-economic development), health, safety, mobility, culture, and the "beauty and harmony" of places as among the shared "values" and "rights".

More recently, following the introduction of the guidelines for the drafting of PUMS, contained in Ministerial Decree 397/2017, which introduced the responsibility of Metropolitan Cities to draft a single PUMS for all municipalities within their territorial scope, also the Città Metropolitana has adopted its own Piano Urbano della Mobilità Sostenibile (PUMS - Urban Plan for Sustainable Mobility). This updated plan envisages a set of actions and interventions with a ten-year time horizon (from 2020 to 2030), to develop a vision of a more accessible, safer and less polluting mobility and transport system, oriented to improve people's quality of life. Also, in September 2022, work started on the approval of the Piano della Mobilità Ciclistica (BICIPLAN - Bicycle Mobility Plan) of the Città Metropolitana di Torino: the Città Metropolitana is drawing up an initial knowledge framework, from which a proposal for metropolitan cycle corridors and bike-to-rail nodes will be derived.

Moreover, in 2022-2023, the Città Metropolitana issued the Agenda per lo sviluppo sostenibile della Città metropolitana di Torino e del suo territorio (AMSvS - Agenda for the sustainable development of the Metropolitan Città di Torino and its territory) 2023, which consists of work processes involving a plurality of subjects and territories, giving rise to useful tools for collective action and documents – products of shared work paths – that will be fed and updated over time.

Finally, the Regione Piemonte is particularly committed to the development of actions to protect the environment and reduce the production of climate-changing gases, also with a view to redeveloping and enhancing the mountain and semi-mountainous areas of which it is mainly composed.

Among the main actions developed by the Regione Piemonte, it is worth to mention:

the Relazione Programmatica sull'Energia - Programmatic Report on Energy (2009), containing the objectives and directions of the regional energy policy, preparatory to the proposal for the new Piano Energetico Ambientale Regionale (PEAR - Regional Environmental Energy Plan);
the Piano Paesaggistico Regionale (PPR - Regional landscape plan), adopted in 2017 as an instrument for the protection and promotion of the local landscape, aimed at regulating its transformations and supporting its strategic role in the sustainable development of the territory;
the Piano Regionale di Qualità dell'Aria (PRQA - Regional Air Quality Plan), approved in 2019 to illustrate the state of air quality and the identification of the areas that have the greatest influence on it (Agriculture, Energy, Transport, Industry) and which was implemented by the amendments introduced by L.R. (Regional Law) no. 2/2021 to the text of L.R. no. 43/2000 - Disposizioni per la tutela dell'ambiente in materia di inquinamento atmosferico (Provisions for the protection of the environment with regard to air pollution);
the Piano Tutela delle Acque (PTA - Water Conservation Plan), issued in 2021 for the protection and enhancement of surface and groundwater in the territory with a view to the sustainable development of the community and the full achievement of the environmental objectives set out in the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC;
the Strategia Regionale per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile del Piemonte (SRSvS - Regional Strategy for Sustainable Development of Piedmont) of 2022, which outlines the areas and objectives that the Regione Piemonte intends to pursue within the framework defined by the United Nations 2030 Agenda and in coherence with and implementation of the Strategia Nazionale per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile;
the Piano Energetico Ambientale Regionale (PEAR - Regional Environmental Energy Plan), which aims to align regional policies with those of the Climate and Energy Package and the Piano Nazionale Integrato per l'Energia e il Clima (National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan), and to support and promote an entire industrial and research chain in this sector.

In order to provide a more organic view of the actions taken at a local, regional and national level for the abatement of climate-changing emissions, it has been decided to collect those of a more normative and general nature in Table A-2.1, reporting instead the individual Projects undertaken by the Città di Torino and the Regione Piemonte in the following Table A-2.1b.

|  Piano | Piano d'Azione per l'Energia Sostenibile della Città (TAPE – Torino Action Plan for Energy) 2010 | It formalizes the City's commitment to significantly reduce its CO₂ emissions by 2020. In the TAPE, 1991 was defined as the base year for calculating the CO₂ emission reduction target, this target was initially set at a 40% reduction, later scaled down to 30%. Priority areas for TAPE implementation are public and private buildings, mobility and transport, where major structural investments have been initiated, with short and medium-term effects. A gradual reduction in CO₂ emissions was expected, estimated to exceed 40% by 2020, compared to the 1991 level. Three Plan monitoring reports were developed, which periodically verified the consistency of the reduction trend with the 2020 target. Specifically, the third monitoring report found a 46 percent reduction in CO₂ emissions in 2019 compared to the base year.  |
|  Piano Regolatore di Illuminazione Pubblica Comunale (PRIC - Municipal Public Lighting Master Plan) 2012 | Plan to ensure the fulfilment, alongside the typical needs for safety and security through public lighting, of the new requirements of environmental, monumental and landscape enhancement, towards balancing the need for good lighting with energy saving. |   |
|  Piano della mobilità ciclabile (BICIPLAN - Bicycle Mobility Plan) 2013 | Plan aimed at reaffirming the importance of soft mobility in the general framework of urban mobility, given the high levels of atmospheric pollution and urban congestion that compromise the quality of life in the city, and at encouraging the use of bicycles not only for leisure but especially for home-school and home-work trips. The objective of the Bicplan is to increase (reaching at least 15% of the mobility share) cycling trips within the next 10 years (from about 15,000 to 75,000 persons). The planning process was shared with districts and associations. |   |
|  Piano Nuovo Patto dei Sindaci per il Clima e l'Energia (PAESC - New Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy) 2019 | By joining the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, the City has committed itself to:
• reduce CO₂ (and possibly other greenhouse gas) emissions in its territory by at least 40% by 2030, in particular through improved energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy sources;
• increase the resilience of their territory by adapting to the effects of climate change;
• share vision, results, experience and know-how with other local and regional authorities in the EU and beyond through direct cooperation and peer-to-peer exchange, in particular within the Global Covenant of Mayors. |   |

|  Piano di Resilienza Climatica (Climate Resilience Plan) 2020 | The City's Resilience Plan, prepared by representatives of 15 City departments and offices and numerous other subjects, including ARPA, the Regione Piemonte, Torino Universities and SMAT, identifies the territory's main vulnerabilities and identifies a series of short and long term adaptation measures, defining a series of actions (about 80 in total) aimed at reducing the impacts caused mainly by heat waves and flooding, which represent the main risks related to climate change to which the city is exposed. |   |
|  Piano Strategico dell'Infrastruttura Verde (Green Infrastructure Strategic Plan) 2022 | An analysis and planning tool to direct investments and management policies for Torino's public urban green system in the coming decades, supplementing urban planning instruments. The Plan analyses in depth Torino's urban green system defining medium-long term strategies for its enhancement and development. It is a planning document to direct investments in new works and maintenance interventions, define management priorities of the urban green infrastructure system, starting from an overall analysis of the public green system, identifying strengths and weaknesses, assessing opportunities and defining strategies, objectives and actions. It is largely based on two analytical approaches: 1) the first, the so-called "greenprint", is both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the entire public green system.2) The second is the quantitative and economic analysis of the ecosystem services generated by the city's entire green infrastructure system as a basis for future planning of its functions. |   |
|  Piano Strategico e Piano d'Azione sul tema della gestione sostenibile delle acque in ambito urbano (Strategic Plan and Action Plan on the topic of sustainable urban water management) | The Strategic Plan (SP) defines the "fundamental" objectives, any lower-ranking objectives (operational objectives) and identifies the main lines of action to achieve them. For each objective, it sets a medium-term horizon of 2030 and a long-term horizon of 2050. Particular emphasis is placed on the measures falling within the competence of the FUA (Functional Urban Areas) and the Municipalities forming the Città Metropolitana, concerning the urban territory and the Integrated Water Service. The Action Plan (AP), which identifies the priority actions to be implemented within a short time horizon (4 years), is made up of individual action sheets described in detail to allow their implementation in the short term. The AP is renewed every 4 years, so that through the implementation of the first two APs the mid-term objectives of the SP (2030) are expected to be achieved. |   |

| The National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRP) is part of the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme, the EUR 750 billion package, roughly half of which consists of grants, agreed by the European Union in response to the pandemic crisis. The main component of the NGEU programme is the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), which has a duration of six years, from 2021 to 2026, and a total size of EUR 672.5 billion (312.5 grants, the remaining 360 billion low-interest loans).
Italia Domani, the Recovery and Resilience Plan presented by Italy, envisages investments and a coherent package of reforms, to which resources amounting to EUR 191.5 billion are allocated, financed through the Recovery and Resilience Facility and EUR 30.6 billion through the Supplementary Fund established by Decree-Law No. 59 of 6 May 2021, based on the multi-year budget variance approved in the Council of Ministers on 15 April. The total of the planned funds amounts to EUR 222.1 billion. In addition, a further EUR 26 billion has been earmarked for the realisation of specific works and for replenishing the resources of the Development and Cohesion Fund by 2032. In total, some EUR 248 billion will thus be available. In addition to these resources, there are also those made available by the REACT-EU programme, which are to be spent in the years 2021-2023, as provided for by EU regulations. These funds amount to a further 13 billion. The Plan is developed around three strategic axes shared at European level: digitalisation and innovation, ecological transition, and social inclusion. It is an intervention that intends to repair the economic and social damage of the pandemic crisis, help resolve the structural weaknesses of the Italian economy, and accompany the country on a path of ecological and environmental transition. The NRP will contribute substantially to reducing territorial, generational and gender gaps.  |

| --- | --- |
|  TORINO | The Città di Torino, as part of the process aimed at drawing up the Climate Resilience Plan, developed an activity of comparison with cities, both Italian and non-Italian, that already had an adaptation strategy or plan. In particular, thanks to the technical and economic support of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, during 2017 a collaboration was established with the American cities of Portland (Oregon), Oakland (California) and New Orleans (Louisiana), which made it possible to observe positive models of participatory processes and to verify the impact of adaptation measures already implemented, albeit in territorial contexts different from that of Torino.

Specifically, there were several moments of in-depth discussion with the City of Portland in which representatives of the two cities fruitfully confronted each other, both in the territory of Torino and in the city of Portland, deepening the strategy and the strengths and weaknesses of the American process and thus constituting an important model for the development of the Resilience Plan of Torino.

Instead, the subject of the comparison with New Orleans was the co-creation model of the adaptation strategy that the American city is developing, which envisages the active participation of citizens in the planning and construction of the plan. This approach favours the acceptance of the solutions identified and the co-responsibility of citizens, who are not third parties but active participants in the choices made by the administration.*  |
|  TITAN | Mille alberi per Torino
(A Thousand Trees for Torino) | Over the last few decades, qualitatively and numerically significant volunteer experiences have developed, i.e. of citizens asking or accepting to collaborate, voluntarily and absolutely free of charge, with their administration in projects aimed at improving the quality of life in their city, without the intermediation of an association.

The project envisaged the shared planting of new trees in all the districts by city technicians and groups of citizens: a participatory care of the area in which all citizens are invited to participate by sharing a day of work to plant the trees, of which they will then also be custodians and guardians as they grow.  |

|  TITAN | LABORATORIO PER LO SVILUPPO SOSTENIBILE DEL PIEMONTE
(Laboratory For Sustainable Development Of Piedmont) | The Region has started work on the collaborative construction of the Piemonte Sustainability Laboratory, one of the main implementation tools of the Regional Strategy for Sustainable Development.

The project, coordinated by the Regione Piemonte and IRES Piemonte (Istituto di Ricerche Economico Sociali del Piemonte), sees the active participation of managers and officials of the two bodies and the contact persons of the main regional thematic observatories, as well as regional and national experts from the knowledge and monitoring system.

The general aim of the Laboratory is to support political and technical decision-makers with the necessary knowledge for integrated multi-level and multi-dimensional planning and programming, in order to promote policies that are consistent with sustainability objectives and to design flexible strategies that can be adapted to changing circumstances and events, adopting a long-term vision, also thanks to the development of new forecasting and reprogramming skills.  |

The following Tables A-2.2 and A-2.3 present the overall vision for the decarbonization, in terms of reaching at least 80% of reduction (i.e. at least 1.92 Mt/y) of CO₂ with respect to the Baseline.

In Table A.2.3, The blue columns provide the baseline for the emissions – divided by macro-areas and sectors – in t/y (“Absolute Value”) and the weight in percentage of each sector on the total emissions in the baseline (“Share on the Total Baseline”).

The first block of green columns lists the proposed macro-actions for the city, for which specific mathematical models, implemented in the CLICC SW Platform, have been designed in order to compute the expected $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reductions associated to them; the third column reports the value in t/y. The second and third blocks of green columns provide a subdivision of the effects of the macro-actions between the ongoing actions and the ones foreseen by the Climate City Contract (CCC).

The orange block of columns provides the residual emissions of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in t/y.

In each block of columns, there is a column (pu - per unit, %/100) that must be read by row and allows for tracking the reduction the residual emissions for each macro-area. For example, assuming the overall emissions for transport sector equal to 1 in the baseline, the whole set of macro-actions in the macro-area would reduce the emission to 0.40 (reduction of 0.60 pu, equal to 60%). Of this reduction, the actions already in place reduce the value in the baseline by 0.224 pu (22.4%) and the ones designed for the CCC reduce the value in the baseline by 0.375 pu (37.5%). Altogether, the expected effect of the reduction is $0.224 + 0.375 = 0.599$ pu $\sim 0.60$ pu (60%). The residual emission for the macro-area is $1 - 0.224 - 0.375 = 0.401$ pu $\sim 0.40$ pu, which corresponds to 40% of the baseline emissions (reduction of 60%).

## 3.3 Module A-3
Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

The Climate City Contract is a strategic document with relevant social and political implications. It involves a wide and dense network of social, political and economic stakeholders – raising questions and potential barriers on the way to its implementation.

Within this framework, different types of systemic barriers – organized in separate, yet closely intertwined categories (Governance, Politics, Funding, Engagement, Infrastructure/ Technologies) have been identified in order to frame better climate action and a stronger collaboration with the city's ecosystem.

These barriers do not exclusively represent contingent criticalities to be 'solved' in the definition and implementation of the Climate City Contract; rather, they have a strategic and proactive character. Future strategies stem from systemic barriers, outlining opportunities for the definition of a new pact between the city, stakeholders and citizens.

In particular, the tables inserted downstream from the description of the Governance and Engagement barriers/actions clarify the link between the barriers detected and the actions that the City identifies to break them down by exploiting existing and strengthenable assets, resources, relationships and competences. Enabling actions are reported and described in detail in Section 5 of this Action Plan.

Table A-3.1: Opportunities and systemic barriers to climate neutrality by 2030
Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

|  Governance | Horizontal internal governance
(Opportunity) | A greater push for an inter-sectoral overcome of the municipality's vertical organizational structure is an indispensable element for (i) face the challenge of climate neutrality in a structural and responsible manner; (ii) systemize policies/strategic choices to use the available funds by effectively orienting programs, plans, projects and interventions; (iii) contribute to the strengthening of multi-level institutional governance and, more generally, make collaboration with the actors of the city ecosystem efficient; (iv) link activation initiatives and dialogue with the community by implementing skills in participatory process design.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Governance | Multilevel external vertical governance
(Opportunity) | A strengthening of relations on the level of multi-level institutional governance and, in particular, with the Region and the Città Metropolitana appears useful to generate coordinated, synergic action capable of territorializing supra-local strategies. The Città di Torino, which is very active in projects financed with European funds, is present in various international and national networks active in environmental and climate change issues. The experience gained over the years through the exchange with many actors in the different fields of action of the CCC represents an asset and an opportunity for: (i) improve the efficiency/effectiveness of multilevel institutional governance (local/regional/national/community); (ii) strengthen the relationship with (non-governmental) stakeholders of the local ecosystem; (iii) refine engagement models of partners relevant to the energy transition; (iv) give greater impetus to the co-creation of partnership actions with significant impacts on the abatement of climate-changing emissions.  |
|  Governance | Digital infrastructure enabling multi-level governance
(Opportunity) | The systematization of knowledge to underpin the interaction with the ecosystem of actors is, without a doubt, an indispensable factor to support the collective understanding of the challenge, facilitate dialogue, foster alliances and partnerships on projects/initiatives with relevant direct and indirect impacts, and guarantee constant monitoring and corrections to be introduced during the implementation and deployment of the Action Plan. The City, taking advantage of consolidated relations with the academic and scientific world, provides itself with a digital platform useful to detect the incisiveness of the abatement of climate-altering emissions of multilevel interventions financed with multiple funds (EU, national, regional, local). This platform is instrumental in the construction and monitoring of the CCC but, by targeting the integration of data on the Digital Twin, it represents a useful tool for governing multi-actor decision-making processes by coordinating climate partnership action.  |

Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

|  100 | Engagement | Barrier to the participation of fragile groups in society | It is an obstacle related to social inequalities in terms of the ability to engage and co-empower marginalized, vulnerable and intergenerational targets (people in energy poverty, young people and foreigners). It includes issues related to climate justice and intergenerational equity. In particular, youth participation is not always truly integrated into a systemic view of the different dimensions of governance to foster deeper structural changes. In order to overcome this barrier, the Città di Torino has initiated a participatory process with various stakeholders involved, including school youth and associations that support people in economic and energy poverty.  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Engagement | Barrier linked to the weakening of the bond of trust between citizens and the Public Administration | They are related to the context of projects and interventions with significant environmental impacts that in recent years have led to urban conflicts that are still ongoing. This barrier may hinder the city's adoption of a truly transformative and empowerment-generating approach. Tackling complex issues such as the challenge towards climate neutrality with honesty also means acting on behavioral changes and cultural issues that need to be considered urgently and in a necessarily shared perspective capable of building new connections within the city ecosystem. The development of participatory pathways and the direct involvement of citizens in the journey toward climate neutrality may, therefore, provide a valuable opportunity to regenerate and strengthen the relationship of trust between citizens and institutions.  |
|   |  Administrative Policy | Barrier linked to multilevel policy frameworks | The relationship between urban/regional policies or the national and European frameworks is not always well defined, and the timing for their coherent configuration can be problematic. However, this issue can be a starting point for future alignment between frameworks  |
|   |  Administrative Policy | Barrier linked to multilevel policy frameworks | The lack of specific regulatory references accompanying the community and stakeholders towards decarbonization may prove to be an opportunity to reconfigure part of the Città di Torino's building and urban regulations to the energy transition – providing them with targeted norms. In any case, these regulations depend also on European and national standards, and have to be aligned with them.  |
|  Administrative/ Policy | Barrier linked to political cycles | The political discontinuity resulting from the changes of administration after local elections, coupled with the priority given to different political strategies in each political cycle, is a potential barrier to the continuity/stability necessary for the realization of a medium- to long-term project such as the Climate City Contract. However, the transversality of intentions of the Climate Contract makes it an opportunity to overcome political contingency and establish a common path beyond political representation. This is linked to problems related to long term planning.  |   |

Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

|  Technical barriers | Barrier linked to the competences of the Municipality | Given the multifaceted nature of the Climate City Contract, as most actions require the direct participation of the stakeholders involved (companies, citizens), techno-infrastructural limits emerge involving local government in terms of limits of competences and limits of available human resources. Awareness of these organizational limitations and the desire to accelerate the path to climate neutrality, however, can help the City continue to invest in the creation of a cross-cutting group of human resources, with professional and high-level expertise on relevant issues of the project.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Barrier linked to the limitations in specialized manpower | The highly technical and specialized nature of the actions to be carried out to upgrade the existing building stock and equipment currently in use in the urban area (e.g., vehicles and electricity) and the implementation of the foreseen actions poses limitations regarding the procurement of specialized labor and companies with consolidated expertise and know-how. This limitation, however, can become an opportunity to foster the creation of new jobs and the emergence of new businesses related to the energy transition and environmental protection, as well as to encourage the development of vocational training pathways for schools and the reintegration of figures currently struggling to find spaces.  |
|  Technical barriers | Barrier linked to the constant technological evolution | The long-term perspective of the Climate City Contract implies the deployment of constantly updated energy balance monitoring technologies towards the decarbonization. Even this requirement, which could prove critical from the point of view of economic resources to invest, can be an incentive for the development of start-ups and newco's in the field of digitization and home automation related to the energy transition.  |
|  Financial barriers | Barrier linked to the coordination of investment by multiple actors | The Climate City contract envisages major changes affecting the urban building fabric. Its full implementation implies substantial economic investments by both municipalities and private individuals and concerns the management of procurement and the implementation of many parallel actions. However, interventions on public and private buildings will ensure economic improvement in terms of savings on utility bills (and, consequently, help for families and situations of energy and economic poverty); greater attention to future urban development; improved livability of urban areas; and the possibility of intercepting the resources allocated, nationally and at the European level, in the building sector – directing them toward compliance with the principles of environmental sustainability.  |
|  Financial barriers | Barrier linked to financial instruments | Major financial issues concern the procurement of funds in view of the diversity of actors implementing the actions, their interconnection and the need for their timely availability. At the same time, it is anticipated that many actions will require innovative financial solutions not yet fully in place.  |

(*) These actions have not a direct effect in terms of CO2 emissions reduction, but they allow for a reduction of the emission factor of the electricity generation mix, gas and heat generation for district heating, lowering the emissions associated to the energy consumption in all the other actions.

(**) This action quantifies the effect of emission reduction due to the change of the emission factors for electricity, gas and district heating not directly accounted by the other actions.

(***) Only the contribution of CO2 emission reduction related to the combustion of the fossil fraction of Torino waste is taken into consideration in this section as reduction measure. The contribution of CCS to the removal of the emissions related to the biogenic fraction of treated waste is considered for the compensation of the residual emission.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

The proposed impact pathway summarized in Table 2.1 is composed by a set of sectorial macro-actions, aiming at significantly lowering the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission budget of the city.

These macro-actions, on the one hand, represent the general framework with respect to which all the already defined climate actions and project and the future ones can be categorized and mapped, in order to ensure their coherence with the overall decarbonization strategy of the City. On the other hand, they push forward and strengthen the main transition goals set in the existing plans and policy actions described in section A-2, both at urban (like the PAESC, TAPE and PUMS plans) and national (like the PNIEC plan) level.

In particular, the main pillars of the proposed macro-actions, in coherence with the principles expressed in the Commitments, are ① the electrification of the urban energy system (especially for what concerns the building and the transport sectors), ② the penetration of renewable energy sources in the electricity generation mix, ③ the increase in energy efficiency (mainly in the building and industrial sector), ④ the promotion of alternative mobility modes with respect to the private one by cars, ⑤ the introduction of innovative technological options for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ capture. The overall actions cover 66.7% of the baseline CO2 emissions, with a relevant emissions reduction in Stationary Energy (-38% with respect to the 2019 emissions of the macro-area) and in Transport (-60%) macro-areas.

In the selection of these actions, not only their direct impacts in terms of emissions reduction have been considered, but also their systemic impacts (allowing for a relevant decrease of the carbon content of electricity, of gas and of heat for district heating, able to reduce the emission factors associated to the consumption of these commodities, thus obtaining a decrease by 20% of the baseline emissions) and their indirect impacts. Concerning the latter, in particular, the possible co-benefits arising from the implementation of these actions have been taken into account, focusing on the positive effects in terms of growth of local economy, creation of new job positions, and tangible improvement of life quality of citizens. The identified actions, in fact, can act not just as drivers of a change in the urban energy system, but also as levers for a socio-economic development of the City itself along its transition route towards climate neutrality.

(*) Macro-action FS12a accounts only for the contribution of CO2 emission reduction related to the combustion of the fossil fraction of Torino waste. The contribution of CCS to the removal of the emissions related to the biogenic fraction of treated waste (FS12b) is considered for the compensation of the residual emission. Macro-actions FS12a and FS12b, from an implementation point of view, represent a unique macro-action, which has been split in the CCC Action Plan in order to account its different contributions to both emission reduction and residual emissions compensation. Macro-action FS12b is detailed in the Section B-2.3 of this Action Plan.

(*) These actions have not a direct effect in terms of CO2 emissions reduction, but they allow for a reduction of the emission factor of the electricity generation mix, gas and heat generation for district heating, lowering the emissions associated to the energy consumption in all the other actions

(**) This action quantifies the effect of emission reduction due to the change of the emission factors for electricity, gas and district heating not directly accounted by the other actions

In the calculation of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, the evaluation of carbon content in commodities, such as electricity, gas, and district heating, is crucial. This is quantified in terms of emission factors, indicating the amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced per unit of energy $(\mathrm{kgCO}_{2} / \mathrm{kWh})$.

Emission factors can be determined at the national level based on existing values and future projections (e.g., 2030), or at the municipal level in a base year. When undertaking initiatives to guide a city towards carbon neutrality, changes in commodity consumption composition are made, emphasizing renewable sources or procuring "green" (carbon-free) certified products.

This alteration affects the emission factor of the commodity. For instance, the national emission factor for electricity in 2019 is $0.269\mathrm{kgCO_2 / kWh}$, expected to decrease to $0.0767\mathrm{kgCO_2 / kWh}$ by 2030, aligning with the projected increase in renewables in the national electricity mix outlined in the National Integrated Plan for Energy and Climate (PNIEC). At the municipal level, the emission factor is lower $(0.245\mathrm{kgCO_2 / kWh}$ in 2019) due to factors like the presence of PV plants within the city and the use of Green Certified electricity.

Actions taken within the Climate City Contract, such as installing new PVs or procuring additional Green Certified electricity, necessitate a recalculation of the local emission factor of electricity, which is then applied to the overall electricity consumption. Similarly, the introduction of biogas reduces the emission factor of the gas commodity, and utilizing waste heat from data centers reduces the emission factor of district heat.

In the calculation of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, this "summation effect" is considered, accounting for the cumulative impact of all actions. The projected municipal emission factors for 2030 are: electricity $0.0302\mathrm{kgCO_2 / kWh}$, gas $0.1798\mathrm{kgCO_2 / kWh}$, and district heat $0.1050\mathrm{kgCO_2 / kWh}$.

Besides the set of macro-actions, a portfolio of all the "micro-actions" already in progress or to be developed in the City has been created, uploaded in the CLICC web platform in order to monitor their evolution over time, and reported in Annex I, mapping them with respect to the related of macro-actions domain. This portfolio includes micro-actions, under the direct responsibility of the Municipality and of the City's stakeholders, already implemented starting from 2019, currently ongoing and planned/funded to be implemented by 2030.

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

As a result of the emission reduction actions presented in this Action Plan in Module 4.1 and Module 4.2, the City of Turin expects to achieve by 2030 a share of reduced emissions equal to $66.7\%$ of the 2019 baseline, i.e. about 1.6 Mt/y. Following this estimate, residual emissions are expected to be $33.3\%$ of the 2019 baseline, i.e. 797,761 t/y (Fig. 4.2.1).

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Fig. 4.2.1. Total Emission Reduction and Compensation

Considering these figures, four macro-actions have been planned to compensate $55.4\%$ of the residual emissions, i.e., 442,318 t/y (corresponding to $18.5\%$ of the 2019 baseline emissions) (Fig. 4.2.2).

These macro-actions include:

the contribution of the CCS installation on the Torino's waste-to-energy plant to the removal of the CO2 emissions related to the combustion of the biogenic fraction of the wastes treated by the plant (FS12b). This macro-action, from an implementation point of view, has to be jointly considered

with the macro-action FS12a, taking into consideration the CO2 reduction effect related to the combustion of the fossil fraction of the wastes treated by the plant. Therefore, macro-actions FS12a and FS12b, from a practical perspective, represent a unique macro-action, which has been split in order to account for its different contributions to both emission reduction and residual emissions compensation;

three macro-actions related to the CO2 removal in the AFOLU macro-area, through the increase in planted trees (FG1), the implementation of the so-called "green roofs" (FG2) and the treatment of soil to make it able to capture CO2 (FG3).

A synoptic description of these macro-actions is reported in Tab. B-2.3.1.

The City of Torino commits to introduce, in future releases of the Climate City Contract, measures to deal with the share of residual emissions currently uncovered, corresponding to 355,443 t/y, i.e., 14.8% of the 2019 baseline emissions, accordingly to the overall climate neutrality goal of the "EU Mission: Climate Neutral and Smart Cities". Even if presently specific reduction/compensation measures are not precisely defined, the city intends to follow several paths for furthering the path towards climate neutrality, namely:

Continuation of the mitigation of emissions in the building stock:

The effort for improving the energy performance of buildings will go on up to at least 2050, building on the ambitious pathways envisioned by the new Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EU/2024/1275) targeting the entire building stock and the phase-out of fossil fuels in buildings. It must be taken into consideration the large stock (more than 130,000 buildings) and the age of a great majority of it. This process cannot be easily accelerated as it depends on two factors that are impossible to resolve by the Municipality on its own: specialized manpower for the execution of the work in suitable numbers for the quantity of buildings to revamp, and investments instruments fitting the financial faculties of the owners of the residential dwellings.

Optimize the local production of electricity from photovoltaic in buildings and urban areas, including their integration in energy communities and positive energy districts. This will require further interactions with the power utilities, in the context of the still lacking national rules for this type of interventions.

Complementary measures for fostering the implementation of the new rules for new and refurbished buildings and civil construction in general. One can anticipate as a key initiative the use of low-carbon or recycled building materials. Though this heavily depends on the evolution of the European and national zero-carbon-ready building standards.

The electrification of the vehicle stock will carry on at a pace that although foreseen as persistent is hard to anticipate

as it depends on the evolution of technologies and the car market. This, together with the steady extension of public transport and the adoption by the public of solutions such as transport-as-service, car-sharing and car-pooling, will minimize the remainder emissions from transport.

Test and apply as more convenient innovative nature-based solutions (NBS) to reduce and remove emissions: this will include: 1) The study of biochar interventions, adding it to terrains as convenient; this will be linked to the conversion of sustainably obtained biomass, in balance with its use for other purposes (i.e. production of biogas, burning at the waste-to-energy plant). 2) Restoration of soils and of surfaces currently covered by cement/asphalt/abandoned industrial or commercial areas; restoration of green and river coastal areas for improving their mitigation performance. 3) Increase the reforestation and plantation of trees in appropriate zones.
The emissions from waste will be minimized with enhancements in the planning and execution of waste collection and treatment, dissemination of social behavioral changes fostered by education and promotion of joint efforts with the population, and the tight linking of waste-related activities to recycling and biomass applications.

As the abatement of residual emissions is central to the CCC strategy, the Municipality will intensify its initiatives, it will be important to maintain a high alliance with the local ecosystem as an active part of the necessary strategies.

# 5. PART C

The enablers for Torino's Climate Neutrality by 2030

## 5.1 Module C-I: Governance Innovation Interventions

This section explores the "P1 - Governance" and "P2 - City's actors' involvement and Transition co-design" pillars described in the Work Process (see Section 2).

The participatory governance model is organized interconnecting internal and external groups with respect to the City's Administration – both horizontally and vertically. The activities to enable Climate neutrality by 2030 are of two types: the implementation of a multi-layer governance system, and the incremental engagement of the local eco-system.

The implementation of a dedicated governance and the engagement of the local ecosystem are fundamental steps to accompanying the city on the path towards carbon neutrality. They are guided by the three core principles: ① Transparency and inclusion ② A focus on people and interconnection for a fair transition  ${}^{87}$  ; ③ Shared responsibility and collaborative learning. These principles inspire the formation of teams within the local coalition and the modalities/spaces of collaboration with actors in the local ecosystem.

## A roadmap in Two Steps

The path accompanying Torino's CCC implies building a system of participatory spaces from an incremental and multi-actor perspective. The participatory path stems from – and expands – three "framework initiatives" already under way, that adopt a cross-sectoral approach and create useful synergies to identify new actions to accelerate the change process:

② CTE Next, the House of Emerging Technologies, to transform Torino into a widespread technology transfer center in emerging sectors identified as strategic for the area; https://ctenext.it
③ Torino Social Impact, the territorial coordination for the promotion of the social impact economy, in collaboration

with the Torino Chamber of Commerce; https://www.torinosocialimpact.it.

The participatory governance model of the CCC also follows an operational roadmap (Fig. 5.1) that runs along two macro phases of work, interconnected by a series of cross-cutting activities. The work is organized in four main areas: path co-design, listening, action co-design and outreach (Fig. 5.2 and 5.3).

The implementation of internal governance (see Table C-1.1) is accompanied by a network of initiatives aimed at fostering the local eco-system engagement. The CCC will be thus nurtured over time through the co-creation of new actions/alliances to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 – enhancing integration with other policies, coordinating the implementation of the Plan and producing social innovation for the climate challenge (see Table C-2.1).

## Roadmap: Step I¹⁹

Step I (April 2022 - March 2024) accompanied the co-creation of the CCC:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Fig. 5.2 – Scheme of Step I

Step I has been implemented by means of:

① Injection of the path with the Mission Team organization (see Tab. C-1.2). n. 50 meetings were held involving 25 people (17 people involved by the Città di Torino; 8 people involved by the EST@energycenter of Politecnico di Torino);
② Organization of the Climate Change Working Group (CC WG) (see Tab. C-1.2). n. 2 meeting have been held, involving 15 sectors with a total of 33 participants;
③ Organization of working tables with the main actors in the area, investee companies, and representative actors from the main areas of action of the CCC (see Tab. C-2.1);
④ Initial gathering of proposals for climate neutrality through two surveys, one dedicated to the business community and one dedicated to Third Sector entities. Two surveys were organized, gathering a total of 60 companies and 21 organizations as stakeholders, and 43 proposals;
⑤ Implementation of a cycle of workshops gradually involving a growing number of thematic actors as an opportunity to inform, listen and initiate the co-design of the portfolio of actions and implementation of change initiatives (see Tab. C-2.1);⁹⁰
⑥ Involvement of thematic experts in 4 fields: green infrastructure and Nature-Based Solutions (NBS), Built Environment and Energy System, Mobility and Infrastructure, and Waste and Circular Economy;
⑦ Activities to engage vulnerable people using the integration opportunity related to the European project SEFIT - Social Ecosystem for Fair and Inclusive Transition (see Tab C-2.1);
⑧ "On twin Transition" workshop, organized by Fondazione Brodolini as Lead partner – along with the Città di Torino, Rethink Ireland, and the City of Cork – has involved local actors in identifying social challenges related to climate adaptation and digital innovations.⁹¹

For a detailed overview of the initiatives undertaken through Step I, see Annex II of this Action.

The outcomes of the first two workshops and the surveys that preceded them contributed to the co-creation of the City's carbon footprint knowledge framework, the identification of initial directions for a useful strategy to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 (and beyond).

Two workshops have been held so far: one dedicated to the world of business and start-ups (July 2023) involving 80 delegates from 40 Torino-based entities; and one dedicated to ETSs and investee companies (September 2023) with the participation of 90 actors. The workshop identified ideas and proposals useful for the drafting of a Call that will be addressed to organizations and social innovators. The Call will support projects that propose concrete contributions to climate neutrality goals and the democratization of digital innovations – also vis-à-vis disadvantaged social groups.

# Roadmap: Step 2$^{92}$

Step 2 (March 2024 – December 2030) accompanies the enhancement and monitoring of the CCC:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Fig. 5.3 – Scheme of Step 2

For a detailed overview of the initiatives undertaken through Step 2, see Annex II of this Action.

The Policy Lab of the Città di Torino is a laboratory for co-design and experimentation of public policies and innovative services aimed at facilitating new forms of collaboration between public decision makers, territorial actors and citizens, from an inclusive perspective in the pursuit of shared administration.

Step 2 will be enhanced through:

① Design and empowerment of Diffuse Territorial Labs (see Tab. C-2.2). In this framework, the Policy Lab$^{93}$ could become a stable space where to activate actors with a variable level of participation according to the needs detected during the CCC construction and monitoring phase. The Labs will create opportunities for discussion/share actions stemming from other ongoing municipal and European policies. Diffuse Territorial Labs are opportunities to discuss the most appropriate solutions on specific issues towards 2030. They can be linked to and implement, in the context of the climate neutrality challenge, the principles contained in the Torino Manifesto "New European Bauhaus: Inclusion, Sustainability and Beauty".$^{94}$ The Labs use links and capitalize on opportunities related to the Living Labs previously promoted under the FUSILLI and To Move social innovation initiatives (see Tab C-2.2).

② Meetings to involve young people and youth associations/ Forum (see Tab. C-2.1 and C-2.2) through information, training and interaction. $^{95}$ Territorial resources and networks already active at the city level, youth associations and groups (including informal ones) active on climate change issues will be involved in thematic workshops/Forum to broaden the map of actors, overcome generational barriers and find new ways for society to participate.

③ Let's GOv Toolkit$^{96}$ (see Tab. C-2.2). Toolkits represent the instruments that will be produced at the end of the co-design meetings of the 9 cities involved and will be made available to other cities to facilitate the easiest identification and implementation of pathways and actions toward climate neutrality.

④ Search for "Climate Ambassadors" and testimonials. Broadening the role of stakeholders by creating incentive packages and assigning labels to public and private actors who propose new actions, perspectives, connections and integrations within the CCC's main fields of action for climate neutrality.

⑤ Monitoring Actions. The activities of measuring, reporting, monitoring and implementing the plan are essential in order to make the CCC's collective commitment enduring, consolidate shared learning, and reshape strategies and actions to show the community, partners and actors the progress and milestones achieved. In this sense, the definition of proper Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for quantifying the multidimensional (energy,

The Città di Torino - with the support of the Torino Committee of the New European Bauhaus - has written the first version of the New European Bauhaus Manifesto for Torino. The Manifesto was born as the first form of local expression of the inspiring principles of the "New European Bauhaus: Inclusion, Sustainability and Beauty"

These meetings/ Forum will stem from a specific co-design activity: it is conceived as a space for mutual learning, in which young people can contribute to efforts to democratize scientific production, for example, by promoting climate-focused "citizen-science" initiatives together with the City; Two propaedeutic activities have been launched, one aimed at high schools and one at youth associations and informal groups active on climate transition issues. The dialogue with high schools in Torino and province aims to raise awareness of the challenges and commitments that the Città di Torino will face in achieving Climate Neutrality to 2030, contribute to the promotion of dialogue between young people and the city administration in the construction of CCC strategies and actions

Let's GOv is a pilot project involving the Città di Torino together with 8 other Italian cities (Bergamo, Bologna, Florence, Milan, Padua, Parma, Prato, and Rome) of the European Mission "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030." University of Bologna and the EST@energycenter Lab of the Politecnico di Torino (scientific partners) and AESS - Agency for Energy and Sustainable Development (technical partner). The project involves the 9 partner cities in testing a multi-level governance model for emissions reduction. The Città di Torino plans to support the creation of Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) through the mapping of municipal buildings on which to install Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The experimentation will also establish a public-private governance model to spread energy efficiency practices and renewable energy production.

environmental, economic, social) impacts of actions, the continuous tracking of the evolutionary trajectory of the system (also through ad hoc IT tools) and the possible definition of corrective actions for realigning the trajectory with the ideal one needed for reaching the climate neutrality goal are crucial elements to be effectively implemented.

⑥ Multi-actor workshop dedicated to gathering proposals and discussing the main activities that have been implemented. 97

## Cross-cutting actions

Information, awareness and communication hold a strategic role in bonding the governance system and the local ecosystem in effectively accompanying the implementation of CCC, its monitoring and its deployment. Communication initiatives have an impact on the local ecosystem, making it more responsible and open to take responsibility vis-à-vis its effects on the climate.

The focus revolves around three keys:

① Awareness and understanding of the climate phenomenon, the collective challenge, and the systemic levers on which to act in sustainable timeframes and ways;

② Knowledge and transparency of the process and actual progress of the city towards climate neutrality (e.g.: through activation of in itinere civic monitoring; tracking of change; etc.);

③ Thematic information for climate neutrality to foster awareness, enable knowledge transfer to increase the local ecosystem's skills, and incentivize informed and responsible participation.

These aspects are aimed at expanding engagement and broadening the pool of potential climate action partners – within the framework of the CCC's multilevel and multi-actor approach.

The communication activities will involve specific information spaces on the thematic areas of the CCC – either by creating new events of diverse nature and scale at the city level, or by leaning on existing events that are already consolidated and enjoy relevant level of participation. 98 These spaces will present moments of dissemination of both the efforts deployed by the local ecosystem and obstacles and challenges to be overcome by engaging additional partners.

The communication of the path towards climate neutrality will aim at addressing all city actors, and will necessarily have to go through the adaptation, in a dissemination key, of all the elements useful to create the right conditions for the partnership network to act properly. This informational support will have to provide all the information necessary to manage and facilitate the engagement process, making effective the collaboration of the different actors within the spaces of participation that are articulated along the roadmap accompanying the CCC.

The following activities are planned/have been implemented:

① Activation of differentiated information/communication channels to raise awareness among the local ecosystem (especially citizens) and support the CCC creation/implementation process;

② Design of a communication plan according to the different actors, barriers and levers of change –with the aim of informing and raising awareness, supporting and broadening the active involvement of the local ecosystem;

③ Creation of an information space on the CCC within the municipal website and through a dedicated website (see Tab. C-2.2); specific posters for each thematic workshop have been made, promoted through social/web channels of different active networks;

④ Promotion of an awareness campaign targeting citizens and small events to understand the challenge and disseminate information (see Tab. C-2.2);

⑤ Drafting of thematic information pills by the experts involved on the 4 fields of action of the CCC; (100)

⑥ Design and identification of "Climate Ambassadors" as part of engagement activities with the business community;

⑦ Presentation moments at relevant thematic events or other initiatives pertinent to climate neutrality topics.

It will be an opportunity to present the baseline to 2019 and an important milestone in order to raise awareness, act on identified levers of change, and promote collaborative approaches toward building a zero-emission city. The meeting was crucial to consolidate new alliances, coordinate public-private partnership actions, address the time dimension of the Plan and its future monitoring, and define new models to be tested in terms of co-responsibility in the implementation and co-management of change action.

For instance, the Cinemambiente, the Biennale Democrazia and the Biennale Tecnologia initiatives; annual events of bank foundations.

The dedicated website is in progress.

In Step 1, 4 thematic pills were produced as support for informed participation in the September 2023 workshop, and then posted on the municipal website and sent to all participants.

# C-1.1: Description and visualization of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

There are 3 levels of internal governance, which articulately respond to the Systemic Barriers described in Table A-3.1 and are detailed in Table C-1.2.

## ① Consolidation of internal horizontal governance

The "Mission Team" is at the core of the governance model and is responsible for the implementation of pillar "PI - Governance." The Mission Team is formed by two entities internal to the Città di Torino (the "Transition Team" and the "Climate Change Interdepartmental Working Group") and the partnership with the working group of the EST@energycenter Lab, established at the Energy Center of the Politecnico di Torino, which involves a multidisciplinary team embodying the operational convergence and cultural diversity of three departments of the Politecnico di Torino: DAD (Department of Architecture and Design), DENERG (Department of Energy) and DIATI (Department of Environment, Territorial and Infrastructure Engineering).

## ② External multi-level governance

Inter-stakeholder relationships foster the adoption of a cross-sectoral approach at the institutional level (horizontal and vertical multilevel), closer collaboration between public actors at different spatial scales, and greater capacity for different community actors to relate to each other, refining partner engagement models and strengthening the relationship with non-governmental actors in the local ecosystem.

The Mission Team intertwines the European, national, regional and local dimensions in relation to different governance objectives through the connection of networks at different territorial scales; the capitalization of experience from the local to the international level; the territorialization of supra-local strategies through the incorporation of climate action into local-scale planning instruments, regulations and projects.

## ③ Organizational and cooperative science-based governance

The engagement of the EST@energycenter Lab multi-disciplinary working group aims, coherently with the general vision (Section 2), at guaranteeing a science- and science-based approach from the very first steps - starting, in particular, from the definition of the knowledge framework on climate-altering emissions at baseline (year 2019) and the calculation of the direct impacts of the actions needed for reaching the climate neutrality goal.

# 5.2 Module C-2: Social Innovation Interventions

The construction and implementation of the CCC is based on the gradual involvement of the local ecosystem (thus intercepting the second pillar "P2 – City actors' involvement and Transition co-design"). The main kernel of the local coalition engaged in the construction of the CCC is the Core Team – strongly institutional-based and formed around relationships already present and established in the territory. The Core Team is made up of public subjects co-signing the Commitment and public/private subjects already involved who support the initiative by signing "membership letters". Starting with the Core Team, the Governance around the Climate City Contract aims to broaden the group of actors.

The actors of the local ecosystem – those already involved and those to be involved – are clustered in different sectors: institutional actors, private actors, participatory companies, Third Sector and civil society actors, university bodies and schools.

ACTORS AND NETWORKS DIAGRAM OF THE LOCAL COALITION
Fig.5.6 – Scheme of actors and network

Fig. 5.6 highlights, within each cluster, the networks already activated and those to be involved in the construction of the CCC. In the current system of relations between the ecosystem's different actors, the networks of the Third Sector, the business world, the banking system and the Participated Companies (utilities) represent a relevant contribution. Furthermore, a major focus is put on empowering the younger generations by involving schools, academia, and youth entrepreneurship in building the conditions for achieving climate neutrality.

In this framework, experience with highly differentiated targets makes it possible to test (and refine) effective ways and models of engagement of relevant partners in the concrete implementation of the city transition towards environmental sustainability. The work on this topic, making the most of previous experience at the local level, will also benefit from the comparison with other Italian cities engaged in the EU Mission. It will also be enriched from insights that will emerge within national and international networks of which Torino is a member, thus unleashing the potential of communities of practice on these issues.

The main social innovation actions and projects aimed at local ecosystem engagement are shown in Table C.2.1. They are to be interpreted as a response to the Systemic Barriers highlighted in Table A-2.3. They consist of three macro-categories of intervention:

① Creation of diverse engagement spaces, which are amplified by harnessing the engagement capacity of active networks to act collectively, responsibly and equitably, and generate lasting impacts over time;
② Promotion of synergies and coordination with interventions envisaged by local, National and European social innovation projects to address climate neutrality strategies by strengthening links with other public, private, Third Sector and citizen entities for the empowerment of the entire local ecosystem;
③ Implementation of awareness and information to strengthen the bonds between citizens and PA – broaden the involvement of vulnerable and intergenerational actors to encourage social behavior change, strengthen active local engagement.

# Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iterations

Città di Torino is determined to continue with its transition towards climate neutrality implementing the pathways detailed in this ambitious Action Plan. This Plan is in line with the policies, strategies and activities carried out in the last years, and is therefore a natural (though much more ambitious) expansion of the processes and measures already in place.

The novelties in this Action Plan concern: i) the better and deeper structuring of the governance of the climate action, looking to intensifying the links with all social actors in the awareness that without their participation this effort will be impossible to fulfil; and ii) the implementation of a solid scientific base for gathering and processing all the data needed, the models and algorithms required for the calculation of the emissions and their technical factors (energy, traffic, waste treatment, etc.), and the synthesis and presentations of the results. The latter has taken the form of a software platform, developed in partnership with the academic partners of the city, and which for its relevance can be of great value to other cities that will join the Mission Cities.

The next steps by Città di Torino will be:

**Governance**: empowerment of Torino's Mission Team, for the immediate launching of the planning and execution of projects;
**Actor's involvement and Transition co-design**: launching of joint working tables and groups with relevant actors for the concrete discussion of the implementation of the planned actions.
**Finalization of the tool for supporting the implementation of the Action Plan**: the city will further develop the science-based tool for now supporting the detailed planning and tracking of the execution of the planned actions.

# I. The engagement process

The Città di Torino has embarked on the journey toward climate neutrality with a deep understanding of the complexity of the challenge ahead and the opportunities it presents to leverage knowledge, planning, and collaborative processes. At each stage of compiling the CCC, there was a deliberate examination of dynamics, relationships, data, plans, and partnerships, with a focus on elements that could provide strong support for the structure of the CCC and its accompanying processes of ideation, realization, monitoring, and implementation.

The firm commitment of the political mandate to align with the EU Mission serves as a driving force in establishing the principles, approaches, and operational core that will guide the city in creating increasingly structural and effective conditions and partnerships to accelerate its decarbonization efforts.

The construction and implementation of the Torino CCC are founded on the decision to bring together multiple stakeholders and progressively increase their level of participation. Beginning with robust governance within the municipal administration, engagement expands to encompass a broader nucleus involving key targets within the local ecosystem—actors and entities deeply involved in other processes with high potential for direct and/or indirect impacts on achieving climate neutrality.

As mentioned in Section 5 of the Action Plan, this inclusive approach extends to individual citizens, reflecting a commitment to inform, involve, and activate various territorial stakeholders and the community in collectively addressing the challenge of achieving climate neutrality by 2030.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Città di Torino
Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Città di Torino

## 1.1 The principles

The Città di Torino's engagement process is guided by the 3 key principles, in line with what is set out in the Commitments and the Action Plan:

### Transparency and inclusion.

The accessibility and understanding of climate neutrality must necessarily pass through its translation into a popular key, to create the right conditions for the partnership network to act effectively, systematizing knowledge, experience and lessons learned. At the same time, a partnership that intends to be effective in climate terms must engage and activate the right alliances, in order to take a systemic approach to the vulnerabilities of the local ecosystem and seize the opportunity to set up effective policies, projects and resources to contrast the energy poverty of certain targets and marginal areas of the city.

### A focus on people and interconnection, for a fair transition¹.

The approach underscores the importance of interconnection and of putting people first, with their needs and abilities, in building a positive environment in which to co-create and make decisions together.

### Shared responsibility and collaborative learning.

Such a significant change calls for commitment, drive, creativity and resources from a broad range of actors, working together towards a common goal. And above all, it calls for new forms of governance and collaboration that actively engage the entire local ecosystem with different degrees of empowerment and in learning that enhances collective intelligence, resulting in a process of change that is open, continuous, rooted, monitorable and implementable over time.

These principles are recognized and embraced by the signatory parties, the main partners and the supporters who have joined the initiative by signing the Climate City Contract together with the Città di Torino and the "membership letters" enclosed with the Commitment Plan. The same principles will guide the search for future coalitions with other ecosystem actors.

## 1.2 The intensity of the engagement process

The CCC is the result of an iterative process of consultation and co-creation led by the Città di Torino, in which various stakeholders collaborate to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

The process involves different levels of engagement—depending on the commitment required—of the following subjects and/or clusters of actors:

public sector (municipal administration; the various levels of city government and the institutions and agencies involved);
private sector (large corporations, SME, startups, accelerators, incubators, etc.);
universities, research centers, schools;
banks and Foundations:
third sector agencies and associations (non-profit associations, NGO, foundations, professional associations, etc.);
city residents.

As part of the information and citizen engagement activities, special attention is dedicated to the new generations and vulnerable groups, who stand to suffer most from the climate crisis.

## 1.3 Mapping the stakeholders

Mapping stakeholders was the inaugural task undertaken by the Transition Team, as outlined in the Action Plan Summary. The objective was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the local ecosystem. Stakeholders were categorized into four intervention areas identified by the Città di Torino: mobility, buildings and energy systems, green infrastructures, and waste and circular economy. Additionally, two cross-cutting themes of participation and governance were incorporated. Utilizing these thematic areas facilitated the Città di Torino in delineating each actor's potential role in the process, thereby determining their level of involvement and responsibility.

The stakeholder mapping conducted at the outset of the process is not intended to be static; rather, it serves as a dynamic and continuously updated collaborative tool for the Transition Team.

This mapping forms the basis for communication actions and the structuring of the Climate Partnership. Additionally, it provides a reference for Table A-3.2 (Mapping of system and stakeholders) in Section 5 of the Action Plan.

Following stakeholder mapping, an analysis of the relative importance of the actors was initiated (Fig. AII-2). This analysis aids in clarifying the interests and influence of key stakeholders, including individuals, companies, organizations, and public bodies, in the context of actions required to effectively address climate change.

# 2. Process stages

As indicated in Section 5 of the Action Plan, the process of accompanying the Città di Torino in the CCC schematized in the road map (Fig. AII-3) is divided, according to a systemic approach, in two macro stages (Fig. AII-4, Fig. AII-6), which precede (Step 1) and follow (Step 2) the presentation of the CCC, for the construction of a set of incremental, multi-level, multi-actor participatory spaces featuring moments of information, discussion and collective exchange.

Activities based on informing and raising awareness, thematic training and widespread communication are grafted onto this architecture.

In its effort to engage the local ecosystem, the Città di Torino took advantage of the existence of "framework initiatives", which act as municipal platforms for dialogue and collaboration in the economic and social sectors.

The framework initiatives are:

Torino City Lab (TCL), the open-air urban innovation lab of the Città di Torino, which from 2018 until today has attracted more than 90 partners (representing the corporate world, public utilities, backers of research, innovation and entrepreneurship, international networks and scaling partners and venture capitalists) and a community of over 100 experimental companies (mostly SME and startups). The initiative is designed to create simplified conditions for companies and other stakeholders to co-create and test their own solutions or business projects in the area. To this end, TCL offers a series of areas and workshops, simplified access to contacts and data from the Città di Torino and utilities, networking with international partners. With the aim of accelerating technological innovation with a social impact, and co-creating innovative solutions for the benefit of the territory and the city's inhabitants. Over the years, the themes prioritized and the technologies utilized have changed along with the evolution of local, national and European policies, ranging from cutting-edge technologies applied to urban mobility to the recent finalization of an ecological and digital

transition towards a "zero-emissions city". Recently, Torino City Lab has been strengthened by the addition of "ToMove Living Lab", which will promote large-scale experiments on future mobility scenarios inspired by "Mobility as a service" and able to integrate cooperative, autonomous and connected driving solutions for the mobility of people and goods. TCL also promotes and transfers the open innovation model of "Living Lab" thanks to its participation in European networks such as "European Network of Living Labs - Enoll" (of which it has been a certified and active member since 2018) and its participation in European projects, with which it sets up dedicated labs, like the Circular Food Lab (associated with the EU "Fusilli" project), NBS living lab (associated with the EU ProGiReg project) and the Tech&amp;Cultura lab (part of the former EU 5G Tours project, now Trialsnet).

CTE Next, the Torino Home of Emerging Technologies is an open technology transfer center specializing in new technologies enabled by 5G (Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Blockchain), applied to strategic areas for Torino: Smart Mobility, Advanced Urban Air Mobility, Industry 4.0 and Smart City services. Funded by the Ministry for Enterprise and Made in Italy, the CTE NEXT partners include 12 public and private entities, coordinated by the Città di Torino, with the common objective of promoting the acceleration of startups and technology transfer to SME as well as the development and adoption of innovative solutions in the aforementioned sectors. Operative since March 2021, today CTE NEXT boasts a community of about 600 companies, mostly startups and SME, not just from Torino and Piemonte, but from other parts of Italy and abroad. These companies benefit from a catalogue of over 30 services supporting business acceleration, technological development and social impact analysis, as well as field experimentation activities. Additional financing is expected to be available for development and testing activities, as well as training courses and transversal, large-scale community and networking actions (with more than 4,000 users involved in approximately 84 events). Recently, CTE NEXT has also become an instrument of promotion and change towards a model of "zero-emissions city": since 2022 there have been several training opportunities generating ideas and networking on the topic, also in collaboration with

Torino's two universities. The last two calls for companies were also focused on raising the potential of emerging technologies in areas related to the transition to climate neutrality in sectors such as mobility, energy systems, the built environment, circular economy and waste management, as well as transversal actions for the involvement and education of the public. For example, 30 early-stage startups are candidates for the Call for Acceleration 5G&amp;Emerging Tech for Climate Neutrality, with the deadline for applications set at 29 January 2024: of these, about 8 companies and 3 informal groups will be assisted in developing a business model with social and environmental benefits and possible application in the Torino area.

Torino Social Impact. It is an alliance an alliance between companies and public and private institutions to make Torino an attractive place to do business and finance by intentionally and jointly pursuing objectives of economic profitability and social impact. A cluster of skills, activities and services to strengthen and promote the local ecosystem in the framework of the 2030 Agenda. Torino Social Impact is an open platform with more than 290 participants, including private companies, institutions, financial sector operators and Third Sector entities, that have underwritten a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aimed at pooling ideas, experiences, projects and resources to catalyze and attract forms of entrepreneurship that exploit the opportunities presented by new technologies to offer solutions to emerging social problems through economically sustainable business models. Torino Social Impact accelerates, reinforces and promotes the projects, activities and events of all the local subjects that act to find solutions to the area's social needs. The TSI platform enables the involvement and pivotal role of partners, activating and facilitating Communities of Practice on shared issues and challenges and drawing on the expertise of network partners to collaborate on emerging projects, as in the case of the establishment of the Community of Practice on the Circular Economy, which took place in July 2023 as a result of the European Respondet project. Website: www.torinosocialimpact.it

The capitalization and valorization of the existing "framework initiatives" led to the creation of a participatory process capable of engaging multiple actors from different sectors in a shared

endeavor.

The intensity of the engagement of local actors within the various participation spaces developed increases based on the object of discussion (strategy, action, elimination of barriers, etc.) and the desired outcome. It takes on an informative, consultative nature, even providing for concrete meetings for the co-design of actions and/or policies in support of climate neutrality.

The participatory process assisting the local ecosystem in adhering to the CCC follows the path laid out in the operational roadmap shown in Figure AII-3. The roadmap is not to be read sequentially, but in an integrated and systemic manner. It sums up the various interconnected stages and describes the milestones and the instruments utilized, along with the information and communication action, which develops transversally throughout the entire process.

The most suitable methodologies and tools, which have been and will be used to engage stakeholders, are defined by the Città

The National Competence Center for social innovation, funded by the European Easi Program, is based in Torino and coordinated by the Città di Torino itself, as project leader. The mission of the Competence Center is to facilitate the promotion, mainstreaming and upscaling of social innovation, according to the specific characteristics of the context of each partner involved and based on a strong strategic alliance between the public administration, universities and research centers, intermediaries and professionals who share a common vision of social innovation as a key driver for inclusive and sustainable European development.

Step I (April 2022 - March 2024) had the objective of

building a strong governance;
understanding the system, starting with the data and technical-scientific expertise, along with the qualitative contribution of local actors;
exploring possible avenues and co-creating a portfolio of actions for the shared creation of the Action Plan.

The process of engagement, in its diversified structure starting from the Mission Team (introduced in the Summary of the Action Plan) and the Working Group on Climate Change (WG CC), aims to cross-pollinate, open and integrate all urban policies by making the ambition of successfully facing the climate challenge the heart of an integrated and transversal approach within the Public Administration (PA) and capable of reverberating throughout the entire local coalition.

## 2.1.1 Instruments for information, discussion and participation in Step I

### Thematic stakeholder round tables

a) The round tables with the area's main actors, public-private companies and the stakeholders relevant to the theme, representing the areas of intervention of the path to the CCC were organized as bilateral meetings, with the aim of providing information on the Mission and initiating an action of engagement by promoting a vision of shared participation in actions necessary to the climatic transition.

The process began with 17 meetings for single categories of actors, which took place from March to June 2023, and saw the participation of:

category associations;
investee companies part-owned by the Città di Torino;
the academic and research community;
public institutions above the local level;
the main banking groups;
the city's bank foundations;

The meetings held are described in Tab. All-2.

The aim of the EfficienTO project, dedicated to improving the efficiency of school buildings in the Città di Torino, is to reduce emissions by 33% by saving energy, reducing toxic emissions, upgrading technology and connecting with sources of renewable energy.

Meetings with representatives of supra-local public institutions were important because, in addition to informing and sharing the path that Torino has undertaken, they were intended to promote the coordination of climate policies and plans between the different levels of government, in order to facilitate more effective and longer lasting actions.

Also worth mentioning is the dialogue with banking foundations and financial institutions, which has made it possible to launch coordinated actions and prepare an enabling context that will lead to the identification of possible sources of financing for the actions of the Plan and at the same time over-see the implementation phase.

The commitment of Intesa San Paolo and its Innovation Center and, in general, of banking foundations in this area is also evidenced by the investment in attracting the International Accelerator and Techstars, which accelerates the best European startups with solutions for #Transformative Cities.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Città di Torino

The Città di Torino has launched a series of workshops to engage stakeholders in opportunities to inform, listen and start the co-design of actions.

Workshop: “Torino towards Climate Neutrality by 2030. An open discussion with local businesses.”

On Thursday, 20 July 2023, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., at CSI NEXT, headquarters of the Torino House of Emerging Technologies, the meeting “Torino towards Climate Neutrality by 2030. An open discussion with local businesses” was held, with a view towards engaging the Torino business community in the process of developing the “Torino Climate City Contract”. The event was attended by 80 people, representing more than 40 Torino businesses.

The workshop began with an informative introduction, which introduced the elements of the context: the 100 Climate-Neutral Cities challenge: the path undertaken by the Città di Torino towards the “Climate City Contract”, the science-based approach and data collection methods used to analyze reductions in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, the objectives and the initial results of the call. The second part was devoted to work sub-groups, for a total of 4 round tables, intended to collect ideas and identify areas for collaboration relevant to the main pillars of the CCC: energy systems, mobility and transportation, waste management and circular economy, green infrastructures and nature-based solutions, the built environment, digital solutions and other actions designed to increase engagement and education.

“The Città di Torino meets the Third Sector”

The workshop dedicated to Third Sector Entities (ETS, or non-profit) and representatives of investee companies was held on 20 September 2023.

The first part of the workshop was dedicated to illustrating the policies and guidelines and to reconstructing the initial cognitive framework within which the CCC Action Plan is embedded.

The inventory of city emissions per base year (2019) and the data by thematic area of the CCC were presented. These are used to identify the systemic barriers that the actions that will be tracked with the support of local stakeholders will have to overcome to bring about a significant change.

Afterwards, participants were presented with a thematic update of an informative and educational nature by 4 experts on the thematic areas of the path towards the CCC.

This segment included the involvement of experts on 4 thematic areas: green infrastructures and NBS (Nature Based Solutions), Built Environment and Energy Systems, Mobility and Infrastructures and Waste Management and Circular Economy.

Workshop: “Torino’s schools for the Climate City Contract”

An experience dedicated to the city’s high schools, which were selected with a dedicated call - “Dimmi la tua” (literally, Let’s hear from you) – promoted in conjunction with the Torino Metropolitan Area.

The intervention was divided into a workshop, an intermediate stage of work by the classes within their schools and a final meeting:

The workshop involved the organization of several segments dedicated to providing information and training and the themes of the CCC and constructive interactive activities designed to engage young people and encourage their active participation;

For the intermediate stage, the schools, taking the outcomes of the workshop as their point of departure, drew up proposals to present to the city as their contribution to the collective effort towards climate neutrality;

The final meeting was aimed at creating a space for exchange between the Public Administration and young people, through the public presentation of all the proposals elaborated by the various classes, with the Mayor of the Città di Torino and the Torino Metropolitan Area, Stefano Lo Russo, in attendance, along with the Deputy Mayor of the Torino Metropolitan Area, Jacopo Suppo, and the Councilwoman in charge of the ecological and digital transition, mobility, transportation and innovation for the Città di Torino, Chiara Foglietta, clearly indicating a reciprocal commitment to a collective action for the realization of policies aimed at climate neutrality.

The intervention saw the participation of 16 third, fourth and fifth-year classes from 6 high schools in Torino, for a total of 200 students and 16 faculty members.

The first workshop, held on 8 February from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., was designed to increase the participants’ awareness concerning

Annex II
Annex II
Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Città di Torino
Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Città di Torino

the challenges and commitments that the Città di Torino must make in order to reach climate neutrality by 2030, as well as contributing to building a dialogue between young people and the city government regarding the strategies and actions outlined in the CCC and their active participation.

The workshop was divided into 12 thematic round tables operating simultaneously: 4 tables on Green Infrastructures and NBS, 3 on Mobility and Transportation, 2 on Waste Management and Circular Economy and 2 on the Built Environment and Energy Systems (Renewable Energy Communities, CER). A 13th round table, not thematic but transversal, was composed of the 16 faculty members from the various schools.

The round table discussions were guided by questions and moderated by a support figure to ensure constructive interaction.

The final meeting took place on 4 March 2024 at the central offices of the Torino Metropolitan Area. The aim of the meeting was to report the results of the discussions and reflections of the classes involved to the political representatives of Torino for a collective commitment in the construction of the CCC.

During the meeting, the voices and considerations of the young participants in the project on the thematic areas proposed in the workshop were heard.

Call to action - An activity designed to engage vulnerable targets

An initial activity aimed at involving vulnerable targets has been planned as part of the European project SEFIT Social Ecosystem for Fair and Inclusive Transition, whose objective is to fund projects with the ambition of promoting green and/or digital transitions, involving disadvantaged people and providing social innovation solutions to address and mitigate the current and future impacts of climate change in Torino.

The social innovations presented must be congruent with the objectives of the EU Mission for 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030.

The workshop, organized on December 15, 2023, engaged local actors and stakeholders in the activity of identifying the specific challenges of the call for action:

Financial and Consumption Education: projects empowering people through energy conservation skills and promoting behavior change as a countermeasure to the growing poverty caused by the high cost of energy;

Green Jobs: projects focusing on the training and employment of disadvantaged individuals in the green economy;

Sustainable mobility: projects focusing on improving the sustainability of transport and mobility in the Città di Torino

Youth Participation: Promoting youth involvement in the framework of climate change to encourage their dialogue with the Municipality of Torino and local stakeholders on climate change issues. This initiative aims to activate a Torino Climate Change Youth Forum, including vulnerable targets such as NEETs (Not in Education, Employment or Training), second-generation individuals and others.

The call for action, which was issued in February 2024, is aimed at local organizations and includes grants for a total value of 200,000 euro.

Decentralized territorial lab. An activity favoring discussion and awareness raising with city residents with regard to the revision of the GRP.

The General Regulatory Plan (GRP/Land Use Plan) is the main planning instrument for the municipal territory: an indispensable technical document, but also a strategic document of primary importance. The GRP determines the orientation of future transformations and configurations of the urban space, sets rules, establishes limits and indicates the future of already built-up areas and those to be developed or regenerated.

The GRP is entrusted with the responsibility of a synoptic look, necessary to evaluate the connections between physical spaces, social environments and economic dynamics, and to express a political vision of the city and its future.

The drafting of a new Plan is framed in an administrative and bureaucratic perspective, responding to regional regulations with timeframes, constraints and procedures defined by law. The drafting process is currently in its second phase, in fact the most important, which will lead to the drafting of the Preliminary Project. It must be tackled in a shared manner with the various parties that act, operate and live in Torino, in order to capture the territory's needs, orient the lines of government for the benefit of the entire community and define shared objectives, strategies

and actions for the city of tomorrow.

For this reason, the Città di Torino with Urban Lab, has planned a path to discuss the guidelines being defined with institutions, organizations and citizens. A series of moments of collective work and learning where local actors can express their point of view and suggest development trajectories, share aspirations and experiences and align visions and values.

In 2023 the dialogue between the local authorities and stakeholders occurred at three main appointments: 7 and 8 June; 20,21 and 22 October; 14,15 and 16 November 2023. The events included collaborative work organized by thematic tables, which alternated with keynote lectures, public meetings, presentations by various associations in the area and round table discussions on city change.

The initiatives realized throughout 2023 actively engaged more than 1000 people (representing more than 350 organizations and institutions) in in-person participatory activities. An online survey, open to all those who live, work and study in Torino, collected more than 4600 feedbacks on the city's assets and future trajectories, while more than 1500 people followed the keynote lectures, public conferences and meetings that accompanied the process.

Regarding climate change and Torino's need for mitigation and adaptation tools, a number of key issues and topics were highlighted in the different phases of the discussion. In particular, the main principles and operational approaches were defined, along with discussions on the relationship between environment and transformation, which resulted in the early definition of the "City as an Ecosystem". Here the conversation focused on:

* regenerating abandoned areas
* making transformations sustainable by identifying new value creation mechanisms
* activating virtuous processes through temporary uses and monitored experiments
* integrating urban systems and the functionally and spatially constructed city
* differentiating and renewing the uses of urban greenery (e.g., agricultural parks, urban parks)
* coordinating specific transformations and systemic strategies, including supralocal ones

* "de-consuming" soil and making land use more mindful
* improving urban resilience with adaptation and mitigation strategies
* integrating ecosystem services into planning processes (not just as compensation)
* monitoring and encouraging improved efficiency and recovery of the building stock

Through the spring and summer of 2024, the conversation and interaction with communities and citizens will continue with a focus on quality of life in neighborhoods. The debate that took place in the previous phase will frame the forthcoming activities along the 9 most recurring themes, guiding a conversation focused on quality of physical spaces (public spaces, parks, green areas) and quality and accessibility of public and collective services at the local level:

* blending multiple identities
* repopulating Torino
* connected city
* sustainability and resiliency
* publicness
* transformations
* safe and dynamic city
* inclusiveness
* participation and cooperation

The themes summarize what has been learned about the problems and resources of the territory, and thus compose a framework that - consistently with the suggestions proposed during the public meetings and local workshops - envisions the development prospects of the city over the coming years and the challenges to be faced in order to become a climate neutral city.

## 2.2 STEP 2 – Accompanying the realization, implementation and monitoring of the CCC

Step 2 (March 2024 - December 2030) has the objective of accompanying and participating in the realization, implementation and monitoring of the CCC.

The activities in Step 2 are intended to stimulate collective reflection and learning to achieve lasting change. Some of the actions will be dedicated to monitoring and consolidating the Action Plan in progress. The transversal action of communication remains.

In continuity with Step 1, the implementation of transversal and cross-cutting actions will be encouraged. These will be designed to raise awareness, inform in an accurate, accessible and transparent way and strengthen the bonds of trust between residents and the PA by creating enabling conditions, as well as to support the overcoming of the barriers on involvement and co-responsibility linked to social inequalities (vulnerable targets) and intergenerational inequalities (young people and foreigners).

Fig. AII - 6 – Scheme of Step 2

## 2.2.1 Co-design activities in the realization stage

### Multi Stakeholder thematic round tables

These are multi-actor workshops, coordinated by the Città di Torino, dedicated to co-constructing the main activities to implement the Plan.

They are aimed at generating shared responsibility for action by guiding and coordinating all the different contributions from the local ecosystem.

### Decentralized territorial labs

The creation of decentralized territorial labs (the Competence Center for Social Innovation could be designated to coordinate the activity) will offer an opportunity for exchange and co-design - within which to activate subjects already involved/to be involved with a variable level of intensity of participation (information, consultation, co-design, etc.) depending on the needs identified during the construction/implementation and monitoring phase of the CCC. The labs could identify opportunities and integrate actions deriving from other policies (such as the process of drawing up the GRP and the EU projects that overlap the fields of intervention of the CCC).

The decentralized territorial labs will make use of ties and capitalize on opportunities associated with the Living Labs, promoted in the framework of urban innovation projects such as, for example, FUSILLI®, TIP4PED, CTE NEXT and Torino City Lab with TO MOVE®.

With this as the point of departure, new actions will be tested by implementing an integrated approach based on the portfolio of actions that derive from multiple projects in the common direction of the fight against climate change, with the aim of involving more stakeholders and stimulating collective learning. In this way, we try to break down the silos of the public administration, by working in a transversal and inter-departmental way on different projects and experimenting with new organizational methods that generate results that can be implemented and scaled more effectively.

### Other initiatives aimed at young people for the ecological transition

The open innovation initiatives launched by the Città di Torino - Torino City Lab (with ToMove) and CTE NEXT NET - call for several listening, animation and co-development activities aimed

FUSILLI Project - Foster the transformation of the urban food system through the implementation of innovative Living Labs. The Municipality of Torino is responsible, together with its third parties (UNITO, UNISG, ORTI GENERALI) and in collaboration with the Mirafiori Community Foundation, for the creation of the "Food Innovation Living Lab". https://www.torinocitylab.it/

TO MOVE Project is a Living Lab distributed in various locations throughout the Città di Torino, focused on the development of new smart and sustainable urban mobility scenarios that use innovative cooperative, connected and autonomous mobility solutions, integrating them into the "Mobility as a Service" paradigm.

at the younger generations. For example:

* Torino City Lab includes a laboratory dedicated to technological innovation for education called Edu.Lab: embedded in a middle school, it hosts testing activities with companies and researchers on new educational models and content. One of the focuses is precisely on the ecological transition, applied to school buildings as well as the promotion of sustainable lifestyles based on circularity, with dedicated workshops.
* Similarly, starting in 2023, CTE NEXT launched a training catalogue with over 22 free courses aimed at boys and girls from Torino schools from primary school onwards - part of the "Growing Up in the City" educational services initiative - focused on the theme of ecological and digital transition, entrepreneurial capacity and how to become "agents of change".
* The search for ambassadors and testimonials ready to act collectively for the Climate.

The City will issue a call for "Climate Ambassadors", starting from the involvement of the companies and groups that have signed the statements of support. The aim is to expand their active roles during Step 2, by creating incentive packages and assigning "labels" to public and private entities that propose new actions, ideate and build links, connections and integrations to act within the main fields of action of the CCC for climate neutrality.

## 2.3 A transversal action (information, awareness raising and communication)

This transversal action follows the entire process (Step I + Step 2) of participation in the CCC.

Information and communication play a strategic role in the activation of the local ecosystem and in increasing the efficacy of the process of supporting the realization, monitoring and implementation of the Action Plan of the CCC.

The external information activities will have the task of acting on the change of the ecosystem, making it more responsible and predisposed to assume responsibility for the impacts of its actions on the climate. They will concentrate on three key aspects:

raising awareness and increasing understanding of the climate phenomenon, the collective challenge and the

systemic levers to act on, with sustainable methods and times;

knowledge and transparency of the process of the city's progress in achieving climate neutrality;

thematic information on climate neutrality, to foster greater and more widespread awareness, allow a transfer of knowledge to increase the competences of the local ecosystem, systematize and pool knowledge for a more informed and responsible participation.

As indicated in Section 5 of the Action Plan, the information activity will be structured to propose specific moments of in-depth study on the thematic areas proposed in the course, or will link events that already possess an organizational structure and enjoy a high level of participation (for example: Cinemambiente; Biennale Democrazia; the annual events hosted by bank foundations, etc.). At the neighborhood level, meetings with local residents will be set up thanks to the direct and widespread awareness raising ability of the Network⁶ of the 8 Neighborhood Houses of Torino⁷ and, depending on the various targets to be reached, of other active local civic groups (for example: the Youth Centers).

To expand its reach to various targets, the Città di Torino can rely on a diversified range of communication tools.

## Online communication:

Activation of social channels through the creation of graphics and content related to the various stages launched and planned;
Website to:
* Share the key moments of the process of achieving the CCC with stakeholders
* Information on the stages of engagement, single moments of participation and sharing the outcomes and the relative documentation in order to make the process transparent
* Reinforce key messages with new formats and engaging storytelling
* Sharing of inspirational and informative videos and interviews realized during the entire process
* Creation of graphics and images to summarize and update on the activities undertaken

The Network is a local organization comprising the 8 Neighborhood Houses of Torino, whose mission is to disseminate good practices in the areas of social innovation and urban regeneration, prioritizing local needs and making the city's residents protagonists of the community's social and cultural life.

The Neighborhood Houses are regenerated public spaces, open to residents of all ages. They are designed to respond to a variety of needs and propose a wide range of different initiatives; cultural events, personal services, consulting, catering services and much more.

SME4GREEN is a project funded by the COSME-LGD (Local Green Deals) program that provides support to at least 120 SME to drive the twin green and digital transitions through the implementation of actions aimed at steering the local economy of Torino (Italy) and Ilfov (Romania) on a sustainable and inclusive path.

CLIMABOROUGH - Local engagement of citizens in the co-creation of societal transformational change for climate resilience is a project of the Città di Torino with 20 partners, funded by the European Union's Horizon Europe program. The aim of the project is to bridge the gap between the design and implementation of urban innovations, especially in the face of the climate emergency and the consequent mitigation and adaptation needs that cities must meet to protect their citizens.

In April 2019, Torino was chosen as the venue for the Nitto ATP Finals from 2021 to 2025.

* Possibility of receiving feedback on the process and/or request information through a dedicated email address
Podcast: featuring the experts, who explain the state of the art of the process that the Città di Torino has undertaken, with theme-based, in-depth close-ups, aimed at young people and using a more up to date and accessible lexicon. A monthly appointment broadcast on the Città di Torino's YouTube channel.

## Offline communication:

Creation of posters and flyers for posting in the area, in strategic points of greatest visibility for the process, to make the challenge visible and recognizable
Creation of postcards, flyers and brochures for widespread distribution in schools, the Neighborhood Houses and other civic networks, such as the info points of the Città di Torino;

## 2.3.1 What has been achieved in Step I

Step I has seen the creation of an information space on the CCC on the website of the Città di Torino.

In addition, the following were produced:

* invitation cards and brochures specific to each thematic workshop, which were posted and promoted on all the social and web channels of the various active networks, such as TSI, TCL and CTE NEXT;
* two videostories and interviews during the workshops;
* 8 presentations in thematic info short format by the experts involved in the 4 action areas of the CCC. Step I saw the realization of:
* 4 thematic shorts serving as support for informed participation in the workshop held in September 2023 and dedicated to Third Sector Entities, which were then posted on the Città di Torino's website and sent to all participants;
* 4 thematic shorts as information and learning activities during the workshop held in February 2024, dedicated to secondary schools, which were then posted and sent to all the participating classes. Schools are also an exceptional vehicle for disseminating information from the students to

their families;

* press releases and articles in local dailies.

Several presentations have been organized in the area on the occasion of thematic events or other initiatives related to the City's EU projects, such as SME4GREEN or Climaborough as part of which a program of three online meetings entitled "Climawebinars" has been organized and is currently underway.

Torino's path to Climate Neutrality was presented in the context of the Nitto ATP Finals and in particular at the Nitto innovation Summit on 9/11/2023.

On 26 March, as part of the event "Innovation on the move. Maas4Italy for the mobility of the future", one of the key themes of the CCC will be addressed: mobility seen from the perspective of innovation and sustainability.

# I. Introduction

## Motivation

The Città di Torino is firmly committed to transitioning towards a sustainable and resilient future. This commitment is underpinned by a dedicated and coherent political agenda, which has already yielded a range of impactful actions. The programs and projects stemming from this agenda form the foundation of the Climate City Contract outlined in the accompanying Action Plan and Investment Plan documents.

The ultimate goal is to transform the city into a more accessible, circular, and green urban environment. This vision of a sustainable and resilient city is realized through a diverse array of activities, including emissions mitigation and climate change adaptation, among others. The dedicated webpage "Torino Vivibile" serves as a permanent link with citizens and other stakeholders, providing access to Torino's "Piano di Resilienza Climatica" (Climate Resilience Plan) and updated information on all relevant thematic areas, whether directly related to climate or broader environmental issues.

The Climate City Contract (CCC) has been conceived as an ambitious program to complement and enhance the climate initiatives launched in recent years. Torino's CCC aims to guide the city towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 65% by 2030, using 2019 as a reference year, and defining a strategy for mitigating and compensating the residual emission in order to reach the net-zero emissions goal. The Action Plan outlines the areas of intervention and the actions Torino intends to continue, enhance, or initiate from scratch. The Investment Plan details Torino's approach to funding and financing all planned actions.

## General background

Torino was the first capital of Italy and currently is the capital of the Regione Piemonte. Covering approximately 130 km² it is located in north-western Italy, close to the Alps, and is the fourth largest Italian city by population, with about 860,000 inhabitants. Since the 1990s, the city has embarked on a radical transformation

See https://www.torinovivibile.it

Introduction
Climate Neutrality Commitments | Città di Torino

Climate Neutrality Commitments | Città di Torino

due to the paradigm shift that has affected its urban economy, weakening the value chains linked to industrial production. During the last 30 years, the historic Italian industrial capital – and home to a significant concentration of automotive and mechanical manufacturing companies – has thus gradually renegotiated its identity as a city of innovation in education and culture, in the diversification of the economic offer and tourism, affirming itself at the national and European level.

The deindustrialization processes that have affected Torino – physiologically connected to a broader trend that has invested and transformed other Western urban areas with a formerly productive vocation – have deposited significant spatial traces on the city's fabric. Although it represents a critical issue, this economic, social, and spatial change has become an essential opportunity to redevelop large urban and industrial legacy sites, creating new spaces dedicated to services and new areas within the city.

Reusing the industrial legacy is an occasion to introduce new cultural and service spaces, reshaping the city's economy's production processes and value chains. The historic FIAT (Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino) factory, designed in 1921-1923 by Giacomo Mattè-Trucco and decommissioned in 1982, has been converted since 1986 by RPBW - Renzo Piano Building Workshop architecture studio into a multifunctional space including cultural, commercial and research spaces. In 2017, after a three-year recovery project, the OGR - Officine Grandi Riparazioni - a 35,000 m² space built between 1885 and 1895 for train maintenance - was reopened as a hub dedicated to artistic, scientific-technological, industrial, and cultural research.

The decommissioning of large industrial sites has also favored the development of large urban green areas – enhancing those already existing. Currently, Torino is one of the Italian cities with the most significant extension of public green spaces thanks to the large parks and tree-lined avenues inherited from the Napoleonic period – and the projects carried out from the 1990s to today to convert industrial sites into green sinks and recover river corridors as ecological areas. Today, green areas cover 37% of the city's surface (approximately 48 km², of which 25% are green urban areas, 5% cultivated land, and 7% woods), and the green area per inhabitant is 55.43 m².

In this sense, a flagship project is the redevelopment designed by the Latz + Partner landscape design agency between 2004 and 2012 of the 37 hectares-wide industrial area, formerly occupied by the Ferriere Piemontesi steel and sheet metal works and the Michelin tire factory, as part of a larger green urban redevelopment project. Nearby, a 20-year planning and participatory process coordinated by the Città di Torino led to the transformation of a dismissed manufacturing site of about 43,000 m² into the Aurelio Peccei Public Park.

Despite the crucial transformations introduced and the progresses made so far on the path towards sustainability, Torino still suffers from important environmental critical issues. Specifically, the concentration of air pollutants in Torino is notable due to anthropogenic emissions, such as those from heating and transportation, as well as the unique geo-orographic context and meteorological-climatic characteristics. The proximity of the northern Alpine arc to the urban agglomeration substantially impedes the dispersion of air pollutants, resulting in Torino being one of the Italian cities with the highest levels of air pollution.

Torino is confronted with the effects of climate change, including heat waves and heavy rainfall. The city's vital waterways and the hydrogeological vulnerabilities of its surrounding hilly landscape expose the urban area to the impacts of extreme weather events. Consequently, the realities of climate change can no longer be ignored. The Administration is steadfastly committed to taking tangible actions: not only to address the damage caused by past or ongoing phenomena but also – and most importantly – to safeguard human settlements from probable future events. Some of these events may be partly inevitable, even with the strictest policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The Administration is acutely aware, as articulated in the programmatic guidelines for actions to be undertaken during the 2021-2026 mandate, that the climate emergency stands as one of the foremost challenges of our time. It acknowledges the significance of this emergency in both present and future social, economic, and spatial transformations, and deems it imperative to take prompt measures to mitigate its impacts. In this regard, the urban environment assumes a critical role as it accommodates a large population and serves as the primary location for the production and provision of essential community services.

Introduction

Introduction

All the policies are detailed in the Action Plan, Section 3.2.
Città di Torino (2021) TAPE – Turin Action Plan for Energy. Terzo Rapporto di Monitoraggio. http://www.comune.torino.it/ambiente/bm~doc/report_terzo_monitoraggio_ec1.pdf

Therefore, Torino has decided to participate in the Mission “100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030” to bolster and expedite a process that has been ongoing for years. This Commitment involves various initiatives, projects, and investments aimed at combating climate change, encompassing both mitigation and adaptation policies. More broadly, it aims to create a sustainable, livable, resilient, and circular city. This participation represents an opportunity to streamline the objectives and impacts of policies affecting different areas of the city. The ultimate goal is to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, leveraging the synergy of efforts and commitments from both the Administration and the network of stakeholders involved in the process.

Being part of the 100 cities in the Mission also enables Torino to collaborate and exchange ideas with other communities dedicated to achieving the same objective. This collaboration involves sharing best practices and innovative solutions to address both the root causes and effects of climate change. It also entails discussing strategies to overcome obstacles while simultaneously developing a “Torino model” for sustainability and climate neutrality. This model might serve as a valuable reference point for other cities in Italy and across Europe.

## Policy framework

The goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2030 represents for Torino the natural evolution of the commitments made and pursued so far in terms of sustainable development, and particularly the reduction of climate-changing gas emissions.

Indeed, Torino was among the first major Italian cities to join the Covenant of Mayors, becoming a participant in 2009. In September 2010, the City Council approved the City’s Sustainable Energy Action Plan, known as TAPE (Torino Action Plan for Energy). This plan was regularly monitored to track progress on actions and ensure that the trajectory of emission reduction remained on course to meet the 2020 targets. Subsequent to the approval, three Monitoring Reports were issued, with the most recent one being released in 2021. Through a comparison between the emissions inventory of 1991 and that of 2019, this report revealed an overall reduction in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions by $47\%$. This achievement notably surpassed the city’s self-imposed target of $30\%$ reduction by 2020 and approached the binding target set by the European Union for 2030, which aims for a $55\%$ reduction from the 1990 level. This significant reduction in emissions stands as a testament to the city’s dedication and commitment to combatting climate change. It underscores the implementation of substantial actions across various emission sectors, particularly in stationary energy and transportation.

The Municipal Administration recognizes that a mitigation-focused policy alone is insufficient to address climate change; adaptation to change is also crucial. Therefore, in 2019, the City joined the New Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, embracing its commitments. This initiative not only aims to increase the percentage of greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030 but also entails developing a local adaptation strategy to identify more useful and effective solutions overall. To meet this new commitment, the Città di Torino approved the PAESC (Piano d’Azione per l’Energia Sostenibile e per il Clima - Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan) in February 2023. This plan implements the new emission reduction targets set by the European Commission ($-55\%$ by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050). The PAESC defines the objective of reducing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions by $68\%$ compared to 1991 through a system of local actions to be implemented by 2030.

The PAESC has been developed collaboratively with other vital local planning tools, notably the Piano di Resilienza Climatica (Climate Resilience Plan) issued in 2020. This plan outlines the strategy and adaptation actions necessary to prepare the territory for the impacts of climate events. Additionally, the PUMS (Piano Urbano per la Mobilità Sostenibile - Urban Plan for Sustainable Mobility) serves as another significant reference point. With a time horizon spanning ten years (from 2020 to 2030), the PUMS envisions a mobility and transport system that is more accessible, safer, and less polluting, ultimately aiming to enhance people’s quality of life.

## Opportunities

The signing of the Climate City Contract presents a significant opportunity for Torino to delineate and uphold climate commitments, reinforced by a partnership between the Administration and the local stakeholder network. Together, they will strive towards establishing a resilient city with zero emissions contributing to climate change.

The engagement of businesses and citizens, in tandem with

institutional dedication, is a pivotal stride towards realizing these objectives. There is a burgeoning recognition, particularly among businesses, of their pivotal role in emissions generation and the imperative to curtail their carbon footprint. This entails adopting energy efficiency policies, investing in renewable energy sources, promoting sustainable production practices, and fostering consumer awareness.

Attaining climate neutrality aligns with the broader imperative of sustainability and ecological transition and stands as an utmost priority for Torino. It serves as a key driver to propel the city, in collaboration with municipalities within the wider Città Metropolitana, towards a new phase of growth. Today, the international competition among major metropolitan cities also hinges on environmental quality; a city's attractiveness is intertwined with its sustainability across various facets of the urban landscape.

The Città Metropolitana di Torino (Metropolitan Città di Torino) as an administrative territorial entity has replaced the Province of Torino in 2015.

# 2. Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Aligned with the sentiments expressed in the Mission Expression of Interest (EoI), Torino aims to approach climate neutrality (Net-zero GHG emissions) across its municipal territory by 2030, leaving no area of the city or sector of the economy untouched. The objective set forth in this Contract is to achieve a minimum of an 65% reduction in emissions relative to 2019 levels, and to define a strategy for mitigating and compensating the residual emission in order to reach the net-zero emissions goal.

To tackle this challenge, Torino intends to exert a positive influence on decision-making processes through the implementation of a structured approach. This approach is characterized by its integration across various levels, acknowledging the interconnectedness of different areas involved.

It relies on scientific foundations, utilizing measurements, mathematical models, and analytical tools to assess potential impacts of strategic choices beforehand. It is dynamic, identifying trajectories and adapting political decisions throughout their evolution. Furthermore, it adopts a quantitative approach, continuously quantifying and monitoring system states using tailored metrics. Finally, it emphasizes inclusivity and collaboration, fostering constant interaction with citizens and stakeholders across sectors.

Achieving such a medium-to-long-term goal requires the implementation of multiple interconnected actions that align with the overarching vision of climate neutrality. This endeavor is made possible through the collaborative efforts of the Administration and organizations that have committed to sharing this objective with the city. To structure this process effectively, Torino has established a Mission team comprising two working groups: the Transition team within the City Administration, and the technical working group established at the Energy Security and Transition EST@EnergyCenterLab of the Politecnico di Torino. This team has played a pivotal role in guiding the co-design of the CCC with various city stakeholders.

Introduction

Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030
Climate Neutrality Commitments | Città di Torino

Climate Neutrality Commitments | Città di Torino

The implementation of the strategy and measures aimed at achieving this ambitious goal must consider the imperative for environmental and sustainability policies to harmoniously integrate with the growth and innovation needs of the urban area. Additionally, they must address social needs, safeguard cultural heritage, and align with urban planning efforts to ensure balanced urban development.

In pursuit of these goals, the integration of environmental and sustainability policies can yield significant co-benefits for the city. Improved air quality resulting from reduced combustion emissions, not only enhances public health but also contributes to a more livable urban environment. The implementation of green infrastructure projects and sustainable transportation systems can create employment opportunities and fostering economic growth. Prioritizing resilience measures alongside environmental initiatives can enhance the city's ability to adapt to the effects of climate change, which are more and more frequent and severe. Only by embracing a comprehensive approach that considers the interconnectedness of environmental, social, and economic factors, the city can effectively address its sustainability challenges while ensuring inclusive growth and improving the overall well-being of its residents.

# 3. Strategic priorities and interventions

To achieve climate neutrality by 2030, the Città di Torino has identified the following systemic strategic priorities in coordination with key stakeholders. Priorities were defined based on the baseline calculation relating to emissions (referring to 2019), which mapped the macro-areas, sectors, and sub-sectors with the most relevant impact on climate (detailed in Section A of the Action Plan). The baseline of Torino's Climate City Contract, as of 2019, has been quantified at 2,396,907 tCO₂/y. The mapping of the macro-areas, sectors, and sub-sectors has outlined the systemic priorities and the taxonomy of macro- and micro-actions.⁵

The first priority concerns the Stationary Energy macro-area, which accounts for 72.4% of local CO₂ emissions (1,734,424 t/y). The main priorities concerning this macro-area involve buildings. The actions concern the thermal insulation of residential buildings; the energy retrofitting of 800 municipal buildings; the installation of heat pumps according to energy class for a part of buildings using natural gas (coupled with the installation of photovoltaic systems to cover the electrical needs of heat pumps); the implementation of the electrification of heating systems in buildings not connected to the city's district heating network; the improvement of the energy efficiency of industrial processes.

At the same time, the increase in energy produced from renewable sources is planned, optimizing its production and encouraging the establishment of renewable energy communities (RECs), allowing citizens, public bodies, and small and medium-sized enterprises to share the energy they produce and minimize network losses. The overall reduction of CO₂ emissions in Stationary Energy is estimated at -665,055 t/y.

Another priority is action on Energy Systems. The containment of emission factors through the variation of the carbon content of the Electricity/Gas/District Heating on the energy consumption should lead to a reduction in CO₂ emissions of -480,530 t/y.

Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Strategic priorities and interventions
Reducing emissions from the transport and mobility sector -- which accounts for 26.5% of total emissions (636,277 t/y) -- is the third priority. In this sense, the planned actions focus on reducing travel needs (encouraging remote working methods, expanding areas with limitations on private traffic, and implementing Metro Line 2). On the other hand, the reinforcement and efficiency of public and private transport vehicles (replacement of private cars with electric vehicles; renewal of the local public transport fleet; development of carsharing and carpooling policies) and support for the development of active mobility (by expanding existing cycle paths and implementing new ones) -- for an overall reduction in emissions of -381,089 t/y.The Città di Torino also aims to offset the residual share of unavoidable emissions by exploiting Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) solutions for the removal of the biogenic portion of CO_{2} emission from the Torino's waste-to-energy plant (estimated CO_{2} removal: -365,080 t/y) and by increasing the presence of trees and green areas in urban areas also through the construction of green roofs and vertical forests (estimated CO_{2} removal: -74,770 t/y).

Across the strategic priorities identified, the promotion of a sustainability-oriented cultural change will aim to encourage the implementation of an articulated series of measures that see citizens and private individuals as actors in the transition through a series of communication and awareness-raising activities that the City will carry out in the short to medium term.

## Vision and principles for an integrated framework for (environmental) sustainability

The definition and signature of the Climate City Contract by the Municipality and by main urban stakeholders, both public and private, with a direct involvement of all the citizens (starting from young generations), represents not only an arrival point of the significant journey already undertaken in past years towards environmental sustainability, but also -- and above all -- a new starting point towards the achievement of the climate neutrality target, which is certainly ambitious but that can no longer be postponed.

The transition towards decarbonization has been clearly identified as a key priority for both the Città di Torino and the whole metropolitan area. It represents an important lever for a new socio-economic development phase. In this sense, the Climate City Contract can constitute a crucial element for building a common framework in which all the sustainability actions can be collocated according to a structured, integrated and coherent vision.

Moreover, the definition and implementation of the Climate City Contract is an opportunity for building a systemic approach that can be shared by other Italian and European cities, thus creating a common playground for effectively facing the challenge of the environmental sustainability, according to the goals of the “Green Deal” launched by the European Commission.

For reaching these purposes, the Città di Torino has chosen to propose an own perspective (consistent with the peculiarities of its socio-economic, productive and administrative system), where, in particular, the CCC is understood as the overall concept for the transition towards climate neutrality and not only as a plan for the actions required to cover the gap between the results of already planned actions and the neutrality goal. According to this, we tried to introduce into the Action Plan elements able to facilitate a strategic view of the transition, focusing not just on concrete micro-actions, but identifying a set of general macro-actions through which addressing the climate neutrality target and
Climate Neutrality Commitments | Città di Torino

Climate Neutrality Commitments | Città di Torino

providing a broad umbrella for the following detailed actions (for which ad hoc plans will detail their specific goals, objectives, tasks, budget, schedule and success criteria).

Therefore, the Climate City Contract of the Città di Torino was developed according to this perspective. This approach draws on the combination of three elements that constitute the pillars for the implementation of the vision: ① an ad hoc process governance, ② an effective involvement of the city's actors, and ③ science-based support for quantitatively assessing ex-ante the costs/benefits of the single policy actions and of the overall strategies to be adopted. ⁶

In particular, the proposed vision is characterized by key attributes. Namely, it is intended to be:

Integrated: the analysis of the city's urban systems and the assessment of the impacts that different policy actions might have must be contextualized by the consideration of the integrated interrelationships of the different domains involved: environment (climate-changing emissions, air pollution, land use and impacts on the territory); economic system (development of new business models new industrial value chains and value chains related to the exploitation of renewable energy sources; need for new professional skills and competencies, and consequent creation of new job positions); social system (individual perceptions and attitudes; social acceptance and economic affordability of the transition process; human behavior and consequences on energy consumption patterns; positive impacts of the decarbonization on the citizens' life, both at individual and community level); digital system (data collection and management; data infrastructures, data sharing systems, Internet of Things (IoT) and smart metering; communication systems and protocols).

Multi-layer: the city has to be modeled and analyzed as a complex, multi-layer system with different interrelated components: the energy system (in terms of energy generation, distribution infrastructures, and final uses by sector and commodity), the built environment (with the different intended uses: residential, tertiary/services, industrial), the mobility system (with the various possible mobility modes), the waste and water management and the green infrastructures.

Science-based: the policy decision-making process should be supported by scientific approaches, models, and tools, analytically and quantitatively describing the various urban systems to evaluate the possible impacts of the strategic choices and decisions undertaken. The objective is to create skills and models to accompany the choices of the political decision-maker, developing knowledge of the possible scenarios and alternative strategic options and awareness of the consequent impacts on the different interacting domains without suggesting any scenario or option as preferential.

Dynamic: in a world in transition, whose dynamics have increasingly become too expeditious to anticipate, it is impossible to think about equilibria; instead, it is necessary to do so regarding trajectories that must be followed against which to calibrate the political choices. What is commonly called "equilibrium" is a point of a given trajectory. The trajectories arise from continuous "non-linear" interactions between the different dimensions (technological, environmental, economic, financial, social) and actors (institutional, industrial, financial, and social) involved, which generate complex system dynamics and emerging integrated properties.

Quantitative: political choices must be supported, as said, by a science-based approach. This approach must make it possible to quantify the main relevant variables of the climate and sustainability-related actions: emissions and costs. Pertinent other aspects to quantify are the reference configuration of the system, the possible multi-dimensional impacts deriving from different future scenarios (associated with diverse policy choices and decisions that can be taken), and the evolution of the system itself over time, thus enabling the monitoring the progress of the transition according to the implemented policies. This quantitative approach requires the availability and systematic management of the data to describe the urban systems (e.g., energy consumption and production, installed capacities, emissions, building stock and energy classes, mobility data, and macroeconomic data).

Inclusive and transversal: to make the decision-making process effective and able to produce a positive impact, it is necessary to create constant interactions and a continuous dialogue with the social fabric of the city to make individual citizens, companies, and social entities aware of the cost/benefit ratio of the energy transition detailing the strategic choices according to the peculiarities of the different realities

Principles and process

Principles and process
of the urban territory. Furthermore, it is strictly needed to carry on an intense dialogue with the city's actors and stakeholders directly involved in the transition actions (multi-utility companies operating in the area, corporate, banking system, trade associations, investors, research institutions), thus fostering a coherent vision and shared sustainability goals, and consequently orienting, in a coordinated way, political and business decisions, investment plans and corporate strategic choices. Finally, given the complexity and multidimensionality of the transition process, having a systematic approach might open concrete opportunities for the growth and development of the whole city.

Developing and implementing the vision requires identifying different functional areas, in which the key attributes can be concretely embodied and can be synthesized as follows: The systematized collection and classification of data support the extraction of useful information for decision-making. The Città di Torino implements an “open-source data intelligence” process in this framework. Data is obtained from relevant data sources managed by various city actors (municipality, utilities and energy companies, public transport companies, environmental monitoring, and protection bodies), validated and organized within innovative databases (e.g. data lakehouse and distributed databases), automatically updated through web crawlers, with a time granularity fine enough to allow detailed analysis of the current situation and mid/long-term scenario analyses. Data are needed for feeding: models and tools for “what if?” scenario analyses, assessing the impacts of different alternative policies, and monitoring systems for quantitatively tracking the evolutionary trajectories of the urban system over time.Constant monitoring of the evolution of the national and international legislative and regulatory framework and the general and specific targets related to the energy transition is necessary to have a constantly updated snapshot of the current possibilities and those foreseeable in the short/medium term.Creating continuously updated catalogs of policy choices already implemented in other urban contexts at the national and international scales could inspire the implementation of interventions already tested elsewhere or the definition of new policy actions. This approach is intended to encourage policies that are easily replicable and adaptable to different urban contexts (at a national and international level) to facilitate the diffusion of practical actions for decarbonizing the energy system and achieving the climate neutrality goal.Modeling of the urban systems includes stationary energy (municipal buildings, public lighting, residential, tertiary, and industrial sectors), transport (both public and private), waste (including landfill, wastes, and wastewater treatment), Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) and Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU, including the urban green infrastructure that acts as a CO_{2} sink). In particular, these sectorial models should be able to quantify the impacts of different possible policy actions and strategies regarding CO_{2} emissions reduction and compensation and related costs and allow for their comparison.A system of formalized relations with the various local and national stakeholders directly or indirectly involved in the transition process identifies possible convergences and shared courses of action (also through the definition of ad hoc agreements and the creation of a network of both national and international collaborations with other cities for sharing knowledge and best practices).Communication with citizens and engagement through websites, social networks, events, and printed paper allows them to constantly be aware of the strategic choices and decisions adopted, their time horizon, and actual impacts almost “in real-time.” The communication process must not only be unidirectional (from the City Administration to the citizens) but, as far as possible, bidirectional, systematically collecting feedback and requests of citizens themselves, analyzing them, and possibly accepting them as corrective measures for the choices made.Identifying funds and financing opportunities, including those already foreseen in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, possible ad hoc European and National funds, and activating dedicated financing lines by private investors (e.g. banking foundations).

Therefore, the three pillars can be mapped according to this conceptual framework. On the one hand, they are closely intertwined with one or more of the critical attributes of the vision. At the same time, on the other, they encompass the

implementation of one or more functional areas (as graphically shown in Figure 1).

Figure 1: Conceptual framework of the CCC Vision

For each pillar, and in particular, for the governance, it is necessary to create an ad hoc integrated Mission team, able to merge different competencies, covering the various domains involved in the transition process, to properly manage the definition of the decarbonization pathways of the City, the assessment of their impacts and costs, and the monitoring of the evolutionary trajectories of the City towards the set goals. This system of competencies should range from modeling and analysis of urban systems (regarding the various sectors) at different spatial and time scales to the mapping of the urban morphology, to the evaluation of the environmental impacts of alternative policy scenarios, to the assessment of the contribution of urban green infrastructures to the absorption of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  to the knowledge of the administrative and regulatory procedures for defining and implementing policies and strategic plans at the urban level.

This approach allows for a synergic cross-fertilization of expertise and know-how, consistent with the adoption of an integrated and multi-layer perspective, and requires the close involvement of two of the key City's players: the Municipality

(able to provide competencies in the administrative, regulatory and policy domain) and Academia (able to deliver the required scientific competencies).

The Mission Team should be able to coordinate and accompany the City along the whole path towards climate neutrality, ensuring: ① the identification of the set of actions needed for the decarbonization of the City by 2030 and the assessment of their multidimensional impacts and costs; ② the implementation of the participatory process of involvement of the various City's actors; ③ the territorialization of supra-local strategies through the insertion of climate actions into planning tools, regulations and projects on a local scale; ④ the capitalization of experience and lessons learned from local to international levels; ⑤ the creation of connection networks with other urban realities, at both national and international level; ⑥ the management of the preparation phase of the Climate City Contract and of their future revision phases; ⑦ the monitoring of the implementation of the decarbonization actions and of their effects, the tracking of the evolutionary trajectory of the urban system and the check of the coherence with the ideal trajectory to be followed for reaching set goals; ⑧ the financial planning and the optimization of spending oriented towards climate neutrality.

Considering the second pillar, i.e., the involvement of the City's actors, a crucial aspect is the development of participatory paths with all local stakeholders, both internal and external to the municipal administration, involved in the process of co-designing the set of actions needed for the decarbonization of the City and in the subsequent process of achieving the climate neutrality target. The construction and implementation of the Climate City Contract firmly lean on incremental participation. The participatory process stems from creating a solid mandate within the municipal administration (Mission Team, Mission Group, and Climate Change Working Group). It gradually expands from a first kernel that involves defined targets of the local ecosystem (actors and subjects strongly engaged in other processes and with a high potential in terms of direct and/or indirect effects on achieving climate neutrality) to individual citizens.[7]

Such a participatory path outlines and activates diverse spaces for collaboration (information, consultation, co-creation) that gradually expand to potentially include all citizens. By adopting a

systemic and multi-level approach, the entire local ecosystem, made up of the different actors and subjects of the city -- public and private and including citizens -- is positively involved in the common challenge. The path takes place through the experimentation of forms of social innovation and governance innovation as enabling factors for effective, inclusive, and bottom-up climate neutrality transformations. In particular, according to the three key principles of ① Transparency and inclusion ② A focus on people and interconnection for a fair transition 8 ; ③ Shared responsibility and collaborative learning, the local “ecosystem” to be involved should include multilevel players: institutional bodies besides the Municipality of Torino (like the Regione Piemonte and the Torino Città Metropolitana), public multi-utility companies, the private sector (corporate, banking system, trade associations), the Third Sector and non-profit organizations, the academic world and the citizens, with specific attention devoted to the younger generations (which could actively sustain and push the transition process in the following decades) and to vulnerable targets (which should not suffer from adverse effects, especially from the economic point of view, of the pathways towards climate neutrality, and for which it is crucial to ensure equity of the process). This engagement of urban actors as active participants in the City's challenge should represent the basis for co-creating the knowledge framework on the City's carbon footprint and co-designing the portfolio of actions and their monitoring. One of the mandates of the governance (the first pillar of the vision) is, therefore, the identification and implementation of proper stakeholders' communication and engagement approaches (e.g. meetings, working tables, workshops, thematic forums, widespread policy labs) for ensuring the effective involvement of the local “ecosystem” of actors and for promoting a common action perspective for the transition towards climate neutrality.

The third pillar, which focuses on science-based support for the City's policy decision-making, seeks to offer practical and effective tools. These tools are grounded in robust scientific methodologies and models and are designed to facilitate the comparative assessment of the impacts of different policy actions and strategic choices. They also enable the tracking of system evolution and verification of coherence with defined targets. This approach allows for the introduction of corrective actions, if necessary, in line with the quantitative and dynamic perspective described earlier. Its implementation is based on a set of key elements: ① the creation of a database of the whole urban system, allowing for collecting, validating, storing, managing and constantly updating all the data needed for the characterization of the City's urban systems and for feeding both the models and tools for “what if?” scenario analyses and the tracking system for the monitoring of the evolutionary trajectories; ② the definition of sectorial models for the ex-ante evaluation of the multidimensional effects of possible different policy actions; ③ the identification of a system of Key Performance Indicators for tracking the evolutionary trajectory of the City's transition with respect the main dimensions involved (energy, environmental, economic, social); ④ the development of IT tools directly accessible and usable by the City's policy decision-makers; in particular, these tools should be oriented, on the one hand, to the specific definition and formalization of the CCC (including an automatic compiling of the various sections of the contract itself) and, on the other hand, to the creation of a Digital Twin of the City, (under costruction). This tool will enable the follow up of the evolution of the urban systems, not just with reference to the GHG emissions but in terms of the multidimensional impacts (energy, economic, environmental, social) of the transition pathways, in a measurable and interactive (by means of a detailed geomatic representation and modelling of the City) manner.

As detailed in the Action Plan,9 the CLICC (CLimate City Contract) IT platform has been developed as an instrument to define and formalize the CCC in the framework of a more general digital twin tool for the city. The platform can elaborate the simultaneous combination of different types of actions to estimate their impacts in terms of avoided GHG emissions and assess the related costs, providing a pre-compiled template for the documents (i.e. commitment, action, and investment plans of the CCC). CLICC was designed and implemented to quantitatively assess the impacts of actions and pathways in terms of GHG emission reduction and the related costs, allowing the City decision-makers to test in silico, interactively, different policy options and identifying the combination of them that mainly fits with their strategies for reaching the climate neutrality. In a broader stragic framework, the digital twin of the city is intended to: ① provide a comprehensive and synoptic view of the urban system ② elaborate integrated multilevel and multi-sector urban models -- comprising environmental models, models of the city building

stock, transport models, models of urban energy infrastructures, models of waste treatment and circular economy and including stakeholders/social interactions and behavioral models; (3) assessing, in a multidimensional way, the impacts of the possible energy transition pathways of the city.

The proposed vision and methodological approach will result in a "Torino Model" for the science-based support of Cities in the climate and environmental policy decision-making field. The ultimate goal is to make the approach and the tools available to other cities. Such a framework is in line with the general purpose of the "EU Mission: Climate Neutral and Smart Cities": selecting a pool of pioneer European cities that, trying to anticipate the climate neutrality goal to 2030, could serve as a model and a forerunner for other cities aiming at reaching this crucial and ambitious target by 2050.

# 5. Signatories, Main Partners, Supporters

The process of building and consolidating the local ecosystem and the stakeholder engagement have identified three levels of commitment of the actors in the Climate City Contract:

Signatories. The Signatories are mainly institutional bodies that, together with the City, sign the Climate City Contract;
Main Partners. The Main Partners (e.g., investee companies, banking institutions, and foundations) are entities that support the City in the final goal through the signing of a letter of support and with the identification of concrete actions for the reduction of climate-changing emissions;
Supporters (e.g., trade associations, companies, third sector entities, and associations) endorse the City in the final goal by signing a letter of support and identifying the micro-actions and actions enabling the context of intervention for a change that is widespread and lasting.
