# Introduction

At a crucial moment in the global response to climate-related emergencies, the EU is committed to leading climate action and has set the targets and legislation to achieve this. Thus, the EU must reduce its emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and achieve climate neutrality by mid-century. In this context, cities have a key role to play, both to accelerate the decarbonisation process and to ensure a fair and equitable transformation that contributes to the well-being of society as a whole.

Cities, despite occupying only about 3% of the earth's surface, generate more than 70% of greenhouse gas emissions and consume more than 65% of global energy. And it is important that they act as centres of experimentation and innovation in the transition to climate neutrality.

The EU Mission "100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" (hereafter the Mission, or the Climate Mission) aims to support the transformation of cities to accelerate compliance with the Paris Agreement, and to be both a catalyst and driver for the implementation of the European Green Pact, and a demonstrator that it is possible to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

In Spain, on 8 September 2021, the Government of Spain and the City Councils of Barcelona, Madrid, Seville and Valencia signed the Declaration "Climate Neutral Cities in 2030", as a boost to the commitments and initiatives of the signatory cities and as government support for the transformation of these cities to achieve climate neutrality and improve their resilience. Following the path opened, the City Councils of Soria, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza adhered to the Declaration on 13 December.

In addition, on 15 September 2021, the Plenary of the Senate approved a motion urging the Government to push for climate neutrality of cities in the framework of the European Cities Mission. The motion recognises the fundamental role of cities in the response to the climate emergency and highlights the opportunity to accelerate the necessary and cross-cutting changes to make cities climate neutral by 2030. It also values that the different territorial administrations promote and facilitate the climate neutrality of Spanish cities through their incorporation into the Mission of Cities and through the development of transformation projects.

Climate City Contract. Seville

In this regard, on 25 November 2021, the Cities Mission launched a call for expression of interest addressed to European cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants interested in participating. Of the 377 that applied, 100 were selected from the EU-27, including the Spanish cities of Barcelona, Madrid, Seville, Valencia, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza.

The Mission Implementation Plan foresees that each of the 100 selected cities will develop a Climate City Contract (CCC) adapted to its own reality, through a process of co-creation and in close collaboration with the whole of civil society and citizens, detailing the strategy for the deployment and monitoring of innovative and digital solutions to achieve climate neutrality; and enabling other cities to follow their example by 2050. This document thus constitutes a clear political commitment, not only to the European Commission and national, regional, and local authorities, but also to citizens, and includes a first package of proposals for a comprehensive climate action plan in the different sectors, such as energy, buildings, waste management and transport, together with the corresponding investment projections that would be required, according to the estimates of this European Mission. This is in line with the process already initiated in the city of Seville since 2009, in the framework of the Covenant of Mayors for Sustainable Climate and Energy.

In this way, this document responds to the requirements of the European Cities Mission. It has been prepared by the city and takes into account the concerns and forecasts of other public and private actors, establishing an indicative plan to achieve climate neutrality¹.

In particular, it recognises that the Mission cannot succeed without being solidly anchored in the local community and garnering broad support. It therefore involves civil society, youth groups, cultural institutions and creative sectors, foundations, local media, small and medium-sized enterprises, private industry, trade unions, academia and research, and the public sector, among others, in their respective roles as decision-makers, users, consumers, producers and owners.

Furthermore, it integrates the city's own qualities and heritage, which guarantee the local dimension of the transition to climate neutrality; but also, its inclusive character, in line with the values of the New European Bauhaus (art/culture, sustainability,

¹ The document incorporates the responses to the shortcomings identified by NetZeroCities on the first version of 15 April 2023.

society). It fosters a sense of ownership and ownership by the city's inhabitants and professional actors, showing that their unique contribution is relevant, and that the fulfilment of this document will result in a better quality of life and a better environment (including health) for all.

On the other hand, the entire Mission is configured in the framework of an iterative process, as a document that will be subject to monitoring and updating, both through the signing of addenda and other documents of adhesion, thus bringing together other actors necessary for the city to achieve the goal of climate neutrality established with the maximum involvement of the different actors. In particular, the commitments contained therein may be extended or updated to effectively contribute to the achievement of climate neutrality in the city. Special relevance will be given to supramunicipal policies that are incorporated into regional and national planning.

The document is divided into several parts: one concerning the city's commitment to achieve climate neutrality in the city; one concerning the institutional support and coordination of the different public administrations; one concerning its monitoring and updating; and a final part comprising the annexes corresponding to the Climate Action Plan, the Climate Investment Plan and the city's stakeholder support and commitments. In all cases and for the 100 participating cities, the models developed by NetZeroCities² are followed.

² The NetZeroCities (NZC) project is part of the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme and provides the necessary technical, regulatory, and financial assistance to cities in the European Cities Mission (https://netzerocities.eu/the-nzc-project/).

# Seville's commitment to climate neutrality

## Introduction

Seville and its metropolitan area represent one of the European urban regions located in the front line of global warming. Its latitude and climate place it in an area with a high incidence of rising temperatures and adverse climate scenarios (droughts, heat waves, rain, and river flooding). In accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals, Seville has set itself the strategic objective of reducing emissions and combating climate change, placing special emphasis on actions that have an impact on sustainability, adaptation to the environment and decarbonisation. In this sense, Seville is promoting a rigorous strategy to reduce emissions, leading an energy transition towards a more sustainable model, based on more sustainable energy sources, energy saving and a more rational management of the transport of people and goods.

To achieve this objective, it is essential to improve energy efficiency and effectiveness in all areas of urban life: transport, construction and conservation of public and private buildings, street lighting, waste management, etc. Along the same lines, the development of distributed renewable energy production is promoted, with buildings mainly producing photovoltaic electricity, facilitating, and providing economic incentives for the installation of panels and self-consumption of electricity in public and private buildings. The use of clean energy sources for public and private transport is also favoured, developing the necessary infrastructures for this purpose. Actions aimed at improving the thermal comfort of citizens in public spaces are also implemented.

In the development of the city adapted to climate change, green space and trees take centre stage, both as natural sinks for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and as climate moderators for a more liveable city. In this way, the management of trees and green spaces in general becomes a strategic element in achieving this city objective. Seville will continue and reinforce its commitment to sustainable urban mobility, which it has been developing since the last decade, with relevant milestones such as the development of cycle lanes, new means of electric transport (metro and tram), traffic calming and the facilitation of pedestrian mobility.

The commitment to sustainable mobility in Seville must be based on the existence of multiple transport systems, with priority given to decarbonised public transport and non-motorised mobility, with the development of pedestrian routes and the extension of cycle lanes. It is also committed to innovative mobility.

Seville is also committed to complying with the principles of the circular economy, incorporating into its strategy the sustainable use of resources, compliance with the waste management hierarchy emanating from the European Union and the promotion of public procurement of green products. And all this from instruments of awareness, sensitisation, and participation, promoting R&amp;D&amp;I and the generation of public-private alliances and partnerships.

# Climate neutrality target for 2030

The City of Seville's interest in joining the Mission of Cities and committing to the goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2030, as defined in the context of the Mission, is contained in three institutional agreements: the first, is evidenced by being part of the Covenant of Mayors for Sustainable Climate and Energy since 2009 (with subsequent ratifications in 2013 and 2016); the second, was approved by the Governing Board in session held on 30 July 2021, based on the provisions of the Seville 2030 Strategic Plan, which had been approved by the Seville City Council Plenary on 11 April 2019; and the third is contained in the Seville Local Action Plan to develop the Urban Agenda 2030, approved by the Seville City Council Plenary on 21 July 2022.

Therefore, the Mission's commitments are explicitly contained in those institutional agreements of the Seville City Council. We must also add the Declaration of Climate Emergency by the Seville City Council, approved by the Municipal Plenary on 24 July 2019, which was the first initiative in this sense, at national level.

The commitment implicit in the declaration is not just a mere acknowledgement of intentions but commits all public institutions and organisations to the implementation of precise and detailed actions to combat Climate Change in our local environment, all of which are framed within the SDGs agreed by the United Nations. The declaration reinforces all the actions that have been planned and will be implemented in the coming years by the local corporation itself and its municipal companies. In view of this Declaration of Climate Emergency, each of the municipal companies (management of the integral water cycle, housing, waste, and public transport) have established their commitment, planning and prioritisation of actions, and reflect this in the following documents of the Corporation of Municipal Companies of Seville.

Figure: Documents of the Commitments, plannings and prioritisations of actions of the Corporation of Municipal Companies of Seville.

And as we have been reiterating in this document, we must highlight the preparation of the Seville Climate Action Plan (PACC), whose revision is scheduled for the first quarter of 2024, in compliance with the requirement contained in Law 8/2018, on climate change in the Autonomous Community of Andalusia (art. 15). This update will fully contain the forecasts and commitments established by the Mission, which we are

now dealing with. And it will give shape in a single document to all the actions derived from the 2030 Agenda and the Strategic Plan.

In accordance with the objectives of the Mission, the decarbonisation of the City of Seville will be carried out through intervention in three main sectors that generate CO emissions², all of which are included in the different planning instruments mentioned above. The results of the 2019 GHG Emissions Inventory for these three sectors show the following balance:

Road traffic, which accounts for about 38.7% of the total, approximately.
Electricity consumption, which represents 36.1%.
Consumption of miscellaneous fuels and waste management, with a weight of approximately 20.6% (integrating solid urban waste and wastewater treatment).

It should be borne in mind that GHG emissions may present some differences depending on the methodology used for their inventory. This will be the case in the development of the Climate Mission, which uses a very precise methodology, as opposed to the more general methodology used by the Covenant of Mayors.

For its part, regional planning to combat climate change, which is established through the Andalusian Climate Action Plan (PAAC), approved by the Governing Council on 13 October 2021 and published by Decree 234/2021 of 13 October, which approves the Andalusian Climate Action Plan, in BOJA No. 87 of 23 October 2021, is the general strategic planning instrument in Andalusia for the fight against climate change, and derives from Law 8/2018 on climate change in Andalusia. Its mission is to integrate climate change into regional and local planning, in order to align them with the plans of the Spanish Government, the European Green Pact and the Paris Agreement, contributing to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations Agenda 2030.

The PAAC establishes 6 strategic objectives for 2030, 12 sectoral objectives and more than 137 lines of action distributed in three Programmes: Mitigation and Energy Transition, Adaptation and Communication/Participation, which are developed in their operational deployments with a 2022, 2026 and 2030 horizon. The Emission Mitigation Programme for Energy Transition aims to establish the strategies and actions necessary to achieve the objective of reducing emissions, as well as the coordination, monitoring and promotion of policies, plans and actions that contribute to this
Climate City Contract. Seville

reduction and the transition to a new energy model. It defines ten strategic areas in terms of mitigation, in line with the forecasts established in the city of Seville, and aligned with the objectives of the EU Climate Mission.

The Carbon Footprint of Andalusian Municipalities (HCM) application is a tool that provides access to data on GHG emissions at municipal level in the main emitting sectors. The HCM has been developed by the Regional Ministry and made available to citizens and decision-makers of all Andalusian municipalities³, including the city of Seville.

The application calculates emissions of carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂ O) and fluorinated gases (PFCs) and expresses the results in terms of CO₂ equivalent. The emitting sectors considered are electricity consumption, road traffic, waste and wastewater management, agriculture, livestock, fossil fuel consumption in stationary installations, and fluorinated gases. In addition, information is included on the consumption of renewable energies and the sink capacity, which allows the municipality to have an approximate figure of the annual carbon absorption that takes place in its municipal district according to the activities contemplated by the Kyoto Protocol.

The initial data are based on statistical sources from the Multi-territorial Information System of Andalusia (SIMA), the National Inventory of GHG Emissions and various departments of the Andalusian Regional Government. These data are processed following sectoral methodologies for the calculation of emissions, based on the guidelines and guidelines for the preparation of GHG inventories of the National Inventory and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)⁴.

This tool, which has been in operation since 2009 and has been improved in 2021, allows consultation on the GHG emissions inventories of Andalusian municipalities, with a historical series since 2005. The new version of the HCM presents improvements, incorporates new emitting sectors, updates the calculation methodologies, and uses better sources of statistical information.

Seville's total emissions reach 2,087,988.7 tCO₂ eq for 2019. This represents a per capita emission of 2,9828 tCO₂ eq per inhabitant per year, which predicts a significant impact of the metropolitan area on its central area: Seville has 693,229 inhabitants (2023), and the metropolitan area (the fourth largest in Spain) reached 1,548,741 inhabitants in 2021.

The following is a breakdown of GHG emissions by sector (from highest to lowest impact in Seville):

+ Road traffic/transport 807.735,56 (38,7%)
+ Electricity consumption: 753.248,91 (36,08%)
+ Consumption of other fuels: 223,792.41 (10.71%)
+ Wastewater: 142.290,71 (6,81%)
+ Fluorinated gases: 89.638,84 (4,29%)
+ Waste: 63.811,32 (3,06%)
+ Agriculture: 4.993,48 (0,24%)
+ Livestock: 2.477,47 (0,12%)

In terms of the categories established for the Mission, we would have:

+ Road traffic: 807.735,6 (38,7%)
+ Electricity consumption: 753.248,9 (36,08%)
+ Consumption of miscellaneous fuels and waste: 429.894,4 (20,58%)

These categories account for 1,990,878.9 t CO2 eq, leaving a total of 97,109.8 t CO2 eq (4.6%) in the "others" group, corresponding to emissions from agriculture, livestock and fluorinated gases. These, although not very representative in the city, are also included in this Climate City Contract.

These sub-sectors or categories are treated by the Climate City Contract in a segregated manner (sometimes not coinciding with the criteria followed by the municipal climate change plans) with the aim of establishing common criteria for the 100 cities that are the subject of the process.

We assume that it will be necessary to adapt the methodologies followed for the Seville emissions inventory to the model established in the Climate City Contract for the 100 selected cities; although we understand that this complex task will be the subject of future iterations for a good part of the participating cities. Nevertheless, the

present document already advances results in the application of that common model of the Mission.

Now, our Mission must integrate all these sectoral instruments to take advantage of existing synergies, setting the goal of full decarbonisation by 2030. This requires a redoubling of efforts, within the framework of a more active and participatory work dynamic, in a multi-level, iterative and continuous learning process, which will allow us, through joint and co-creative work, to achieve the goal. The active participation of the quintuple helix, the cooperation between cities and, above all, the support of the NZC project, with citiES2030 in Spain, will be essential.

# Strategic priorities and interventions

The following is a detailed analysis of the sectors covered by the Climate City Contract, based on the data obtained from the Seville 2019 emissions inventory. As already mentioned, the appropriate treatment of this data in the document will sometimes be conditioned by the different calculation methodologies used. Likewise, in the case of the planned actions, the calculation of these actions follows different calculation methods, which logically does not allow for a comparison in terms of emission reductions.

# Road traffic

Transport is the main GHG emitter in Seville, with 807.735,6 t of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalent. This represents $38.7\%$ of total emissions. On average in Seville, 1,15 t of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ eq per inhabitant per year are emitted by transport. By type of vehicle, passenger cars account for the highest percentage of emissions (71%), followed by lorries and vans (21%). The remaining vehicles have less significant $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in road traffic as a whole.

Passenger cars: 591.006,41
Trucks: 104.411,73
Vans: 69.289,58
Motorbikes: 21.300,65
Buses: 16.613,90
Mopeds: 5.113,27

Mobility has always been an integral part of everyday human life. Economic and social development has always been linked to the possibilities that humanity has had to move around. Nowadays, cities are spaces of freedom and coexistence that increasingly concentrate more and more people. They are not cities isolated from each other; they are becoming true cities whose limits go beyond their own administrative boundaries. This population structure conditions the very development and organisation of mobility and transport, and how we face the challenges of movement in cities will largely determine whether we have spaces for coexistence that are habitable, healthy, and sustainable.

Climate City Contract. Seville
Climate City Contract. Seville

Building the cities of the present and the future to be a space of freedom, culture and progress is a collective task so that the activities carried out in their environment offer opportunities to the entire population. And in this sense, the mobility of any city and its correct integration with metropolitan and territorial environments is an urgent necessity. The interrelationships of mobility with urban structure and integrated planning are evident. Strategies towards sustainable mobility contribute to eleven of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations (SDGs). We must therefore consider the movement of people and goods as an easy, safe and environmentally, economically and socially sustainable organisation within the framework of strategic planning and the development and transformation of the city in order to reaffirm its universality for people and its vocation as a common and public space.

All efforts are focused on achieving a more sustainable city by adopting a more economically and functionally efficient, socially equitable and environmentally protective mobility model. The main objective of the Sustainable Mobility Strategy will therefore be to improve the modal split of the city, reducing the share of private vehicles in favour of public transport and soft modes (cycling and walking) and reclaiming public space for people.

Specifically, the following specific objectives are set out in the Seville Municipal Sustainable Urban Plan (PMUS):

+ The City of Seville will become a large Low Emission Zone in which 2/3 of journeys are made by more sustainable modes and only 1/3 by private vehicle. This would imply that the share of private vehicles in the modal split of the city would decrease to 33.33%, and that the transport system would be more efficient, improving average journey times for each mode.

+ In this sense, it is established as an objective that the average journey time should not exceed 20 minutes, and that in no case should it exceed 25 minutes per mode, i.e. that no journey in the different modes of transport should take more than 25% of the average journey time.

+ Given the significant volume of journeys between Seville and the Metropolitan Area, which accounts for 46% of the total number of vehicles in the city centre, integration elements will be established to improve the transport system between Seville and the Metropolitan Area. The share of zero-emission private

6
Climate City Contract. Seville
7

vehicles should reach 10% by 2030, and to this end, measures will be adopted to encourage the promotion of electric vehicles, as well as the necessary infrastructures for the evolution of the electric vehicle fleet itself, with aid and incentives for this type of mobility.

+ Within this line of action, the specific objective is that 100% of journeys made by public transport should be made in zero-emission vehicles.

These objectives establish specific values that will make it possible to monitor the impact of the Plan's measures and which will have a direct impact on the reduction of emissions in the city as a result of the transfer of users from private vehicles to more sustainable modes, a more efficient transport system reducing average travel times, and improving the transport system with the metropolitan area.

The measures envisaged for the improvement of internal mobility in the SUMP are developed in 8 chapters, organised thematically, according to the following scheme:

Mobility management
Proposals for pedestrian mobility
Proposals for cycling mobility
Public Transport
Distribution of Goods
Roads and Circulation
Parking
Measures to support decarbonisation in transport.
Climate City Contract. Seville

# Electricity consumption

Electricity consumption represents the second largest sector of GHG emissions in Seville, with 36.08% of total emissions. By area, the sectors with the highest emissions from electricity consumption are residential, followed by commerce and services, and administration and public services.

+ Residential 334.239,57
+ Trade 237.097,02
+ Administration/Public Services 111.141,21
+ Industry 65.844,115
+ Rest 4.926,99

The high consumption for cooling in the city of Seville explains these data which, far from improving, are likely to worsen year by year due to increasingly warmer conditions in a context of accelerated climate change. On the other hand, it should be noted that the reduction in electricity consumption is not always associated with a reduction in emissions, as it depends on the equivalent energy mix. In this case, for 2019, the emission factor applied by the Junta de Andalucía was 0.31 tCO₂ eq/MWh consumed⁶.

The measures envisaged by the Seville City Council to reduce electricity consumption are developed in 7 chapters, organised by theme, according to the following scheme:

Municipal buildings and facilities
Buildings and equipment/ Facilities in the tertiary sector
Residential buildings
Street lighting
Local electricity production
Local heating/cooling production
Forestry and bioclimatic urban planning.

Seville has almost 3,500 hours of sunshine per year, which makes it an ideal place for the implementation of solar energy. Photovoltaic generation on roofs, pergolas, roads and car parks will be connected to energy communities, which will set up self-

⁵ The Climate City Contract does not include industry subject to emissions trading.
⁶ The Climate City Contract will apply an emission factor of 0.22% in Spain.

Climate City Contract. Seville

consumption networks in each of the city's districts. In addition, large-scale storage facilities will be developed to regulate generation and manage the load curve as an integrating element of this, the constitution of a smart grid will be possible through automation and control of the current distribution network.

The treatment of organic waste and wastewater will be used for the generation of biogas or green hydrogen for self-consumption, in treatment plants and for transport.

With regard to the residential sector, Seville has a housing stock of some 300,000 homes in which the energy rehabilitation of buildings together with cooling networks will improve energy efficiency by offering more efficient air conditioning systems and a greater reduction in energy demand, and on the other hand, the use of renewable energies and energy generation. These are two complementary measures in new urbanisation and urban regeneration processes. In this sense, the rehabilitation offices will constitute platforms of actors that will connect some actions with others, mainly in areas of greater degradation and with worse levels of energy efficiency and poverty.

Afforestation and bioclimatic urban planning would be the third major action to reduce energy demand in the city. The progressive elimination of shiny smooth surfaces for draining pavements with rainwater storage systems, and the increase of vegetation as a fundamental pillar of shading up to three-storey buildings are part of the healthy city model, mitigating the heat island effect.

# Consumption of miscellaneous fuels and waste

The consumption of other fuels (LPG, diesel, natural gas, butane, propane, fuel oil and coal) together with waste and wastewater treatment represent the third sector of GHG emissions in Seville, with 20.6% of total emissions. Their use in Seville is expected to decrease as electricity consumption for cooling increases. Coal has disappeared significantly, shifting consumption to natural gas and butane, which is used more for domestic hot water. The production of renewable energy will be the determining element for the elimination of residual consumption of other fuels.

The distribution of emissions according to the 2019 inventory is as follows:

+ Natural Gas 157.833,24⁷
+ LPG 51.216,29
+ Coal 6.842,89
+ Diesel C 6.117,12
+ Agricultural diesel B 1.782,86

Municipal waste management has the following emissions by sub-sector:

+ CH₄ generated by deposit in landfill site 51.092,35
+ Stabilisation of organic matter 12.700,15
+ Biogas combustion 18,82

Lastly, wastewater management contributes a total of 142,290.7 tCO₂ eq, which is due to

+ CH₄ generated by organic matter degradation 129,513.33
+ N₂ O from waste water 12.769,72
+ Biogas combustion 7,65

⁷ 75% are considered to be associated with the buildings sector for the purposes of the Mission's plan.

# Other issuers

The emitters that complete the GHG inventory of Seville are the following:

## Agriculture, where emissions are expressed per use:

Herbaceous 3.590,01
Woody 1.068,66
Grazing 334,80

## Livestock, the emission types of which are as follows:

CH₄ by enteric fermentation 1.932,26
CH₄ for manure management 391,54
N₂ O for manure management 153,67

And as for the F-Gas sector, we have:

HFCs and PFCs emissions 86.949,46
SF6s emissions 2.689,38

# Emissions offsets

According to the 2019 Inventory, Seville has an absorption capacity of 526,2 t CO₂ eq. We must remember the small size of the municipal area (141,4 km²) and its high degree of urbanisation. The resulting population density is 4,887 inhabitants per km².

The development of the City's Green Belt is planned, through the creation and/or adaptation of a green infrastructure of some 42 km, which will serve as an ecological corridor and link a large number of existing green spaces and parks.

Also, the recovery of areas of high ecological potential which, belonging to the H.P.D. on the left bank of the River Guadalquivir, currently lack access, or have not been stripped of the riparian vegetation that allows the development of diverse and enriching ecosystems. These sections would provide a connection to the rest of the paths that run along this bank of the river, which are of enormous scenic and environmental attraction, as well as being frequently used for cycling, equestrian, birdwatching and general enjoyment of nature.

The performances in general will be:

Creation of a native vegetation cover along its entire length to mark out the proposed route, improve environmental conditions and promote an increase and diversification of biodiversity.
Construction of several bridges/bridges to bridge existing infrastructure.
Defence of river and stream banks and regeneration of primeval forest-galleries in the DPH and in the areas affected by the new green ring/corridor.
Conditioning of paths for public use, so as to enhance the use of the new space by citizens.
Improving and promoting accessibility.
Installation of viewpoints for birdwatching in strategic places, mainly wetlands and the Guadalquivir river.

The collaboration of various companies (local, national and international) is also foreseen for the offsetting of emissions, such as the initiative promoted with Iberia for the offsetting of its aircraft operations at airports.

Both at the municipal level and among the business sector, work is being done to find effective alternatives to maximise the possibilities of offsetting the city's carbon

footprint. An example of this is the Real Betis Balompié Football Club, which already officially registers its calculated emissions, is in the process of reducing and offsetting GHG emissions due to its activities.

Currently, more than 50 companies operating in Seville are registered in the Spanish Government's Carbon Footprint, offsetting and absorption projects. The aim is to cement collaboration strategies from the local level to integrate these actions into the framework of the Mission process, which will undoubtedly contribute significantly to increasing the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ sink capacities of the city of Seville.

# Strategic interventions

The set of actions planned and being implemented are included in the Seville Sustainable Climate and Energy Action Plan (rev. 2020), a consequence of Seville City Council's participation in the EU Covenant of Mayors. This work, which began in 2009, has an estimated reduction of 54,28% in GHG emissions compared to the 2005 Inventory.

In the case of electricity consumption, Seville has achieved a reduction 2005-2019 of 592.469,9 tCO₂ eq (44%); and for road traffic, 424.717 tCO₂eq (34,5%). The challenge now is to achieve neutrality by 2030.

This will require action in four main areas: minimising road transport, reducing electricity consumption, reducing the use of other fuels in the residential sector, and improving waste and wastewater management.

In terms of transport, the main interventions should focus on passenger cars, which are responsible for 73% of road traffic emissions in Seville. And freight transport, which accounts for almost 22% of emissions. We must be aware that the electrification of these modes of transport will lead to an increase in the city's electricity consumption, so that in the design of measures it is necessary to achieve a net reduction for each sector that makes the desired neutrality possible.

It is essential to work together with the populations of the metropolitan area (and multilevel institutional collaboration) to reduce private vehicle journeys from the peripheral area to the centre, represented by a large part of the city of Seville, and not just the historic centre. The transport of goods from the logistics centres to the city (last mile) must also be managed effectively to avoid its significant impact on road traffic emissions.

In terms of electricity consumption, intervention in the residential sector is key, which accounts for 44,4% of total consumption in Seville. And in commerce, with 31,5%. Not forgetting the impact of administration and public service buildings, with annual emissions of 111.141,21 tCO₂ eq. It should be borne in mind that Spain's energy mix heavily penalises emissions from electricity consumption; a reduction in this mix could contribute significantly to reducing emissions.

Climate City Contract. Seville
Climate City Contract. Seville

According to some unofficial studies, a 1°C reduction in the public thoroughfare could save up to 2% in building cooling consumption. For this reason, it is necessary to intervene on public roads with a shading plan capable of minimising the temperature in the summer season, and especially in the face of heat waves, which are becoming more frequent and intense. In commerce, immediate interventions are needed to inform about the significant impact on GHG emissions due to certain open-door commercial policies, with indoor/outdoor temperature differences of more than 30°C in many cases during the summer season. This is in addition to the implementation of other alternatives.

Just over 10% of the city's total emissions are mainly due to the consumption of natural gas and LPG. Intervention in these sub-sectors will be needed to reduce their consumption in fixed installations, mainly linked to the residential sector and small and medium-sized industry.

Finally, a change in the municipal waste management model is needed. It is necessary to reduce as much as possible the CH₄ generated by the deposit of waste in landfills, either by preventing the arrival of organic matter or by implementing new management alternatives.

Three strategic, clearly cross-cutting interventions are reproduced below as examples:

+ The eCitySevilla project proposes the development of an open ecosystem, digital, decarbonised and sustainable city model on Isla de la Cartuja by 2025, bringing the energy and climate targets set for 2050 forward by twenty-five years. The project is fully aligned with all the forecasts contained in the Mission's Climate City Contract so that, at different scales, they will have very similar paths.

With eCitySevilla, we are leading the way for sustainable cities of the future. In the field of energy, the aim is to ensure that the PCT Cartuja has a 100% renewable electricity supply, generated on the Isla de la Cartuja itself and with more efficient buildings. Furthermore, from the point of view of mobility, sustainable models will be encouraged, with more space for pedestrians and cyclists and promoting the use of electric vehicles thanks to a new network of charging infrastructures. All this, supported by a firm commitment to digitalisation, with a connected and autonomous system, through an intelligent

5
Climate City Contract. Seville

electrical network (Smart Grid) that will also allow an open data platform for the intelligent management of the park. This is a pioneering Smart City project on an international scale to ensure that an urban space as large as Isla de la Cartuja, which is a true city in itself, covering 200 hectares, where 523 companies and entities live and where nearly 23,000 people work, becomes 100% self-sufficient in terms of energy and emission-free.

+ Cartuja Qanat is the natural continuation of the climate control work that began on the occasion of EXPO'92, expanding and updating the concepts and procedures carried out in the original work.

Without losing the working spirit of that time, the more than 30 years that have passed since then have allowed the incorporation of ICTs in aspects such as remote sensing or artificial intelligence for the optimal management of the facilities using presence control, user preferences, climate prediction, etc.

Likewise, innovative components and strategies are incorporated such as variable solar control, night-time dissipation towards the sky, dissipation towards the ground with night-time evaporative regeneration, thermal storage in Qanats or the production of solar electricity. All this will contribute to the outcome of the project as a pioneering zero-energy and zero-emission installation on a yearly basis, bringing new business models combined with scientific knowledge for change, through eco-innovation and adaptation to new solutions for microclimatic improvement Cartuja Qanat will be developed through an innovative system of public-private-citizen governance, based on democratic principles, Good Governance and Open Government, through the co-responsibility of all actors through the application of urban care rights.

Finally, the project for the largest implementation of charging points for electric vehicles to be carried out in a Spanish city is being implemented, with 350 double points (700 places) on public roads. This network has several peculiarities:

It is designed to bring each recharging point as close as possible to the citizen by means of a homogeneous network in each of the 11 districts of the city, so that regardless of the neighbourhood or district where you live, you will have access to the network.

6
Climate City Contract. Seville

All districts will have semi-fast recharging points with a minimum of 44KW, fast recharging with a minimum of 100Kw and ultra-fast recharging with a minimum of 350Kw.
Electric mobility is promoted equally throughout the city, avoiding an increase in vehicle journeys between districts or neighbourhoods of the city.
Four different operators will be established in order to guarantee free competition and better fares for citizens.
It also favours the implementation in La Cartuja where the first Low Emission Zone of Seville will be developed in the coming months, which in 2025 will move to zero emissions and where electric mobility and its infrastructure will play an important role in achieving its objectives.

# Principles and process

We have already referred to Seville's diagnosis and situation in terms of forecasts and commitments in its planning for the fight against climate change, as well as the role that we understand should prevail in the work to achieve the objectives of the Climate Mission. We now complete the situation to clarify the existing reality in terms of the principles and process that should govern future actions to achieve these goals.

The Seville 2030 Strategic Plan establishes in its fourth objective the strategy to develop governance and citizen participation, stating that, in order to fulfil the central objective, it is essential to articulate in the city renewed forms of good governance based on transparency, consensus and equity.

The strategy that guarantees the objective of climate neutrality stems from the following sectoral plans approved by the Seville City Council Plenary:

Climate and Sustainable Energy Action Plan
General Urban Development Plan (Plan General de Ordenación Urbana)
Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan
Tree Master Plan for Seville
Bicycle Plan
Seville Digital Agenda
Municipal Housing, Land and Rehabilitation Plan

All of them make up Goal Three to create a sustainable city that mitigates and adapts to climate change. Seville aims to reduce the vulnerability of its economic, social, and natural systems, focusing on the creation of a green, sustainable and climate change-adapted city, seeking to improve the quality of life.

These strategies must in turn be an economic and social driving force for Seville and its metropolitan area. At a global level, the preparation of the Seville Urban Agenda will be the governance instrument that will guarantee compliance with the Climate City Contract by integrating all sectors of society and the rest of the provincial, regional, and state territorial administrations.

Thus, the Seville Urban Agenda is made up of 10 strategic axes, 30 specific challenges and 291 lines of action to achieve a more liveable, sustainable, and innovative city,
Climate City Contract. Seville

with a new economic model and better public services. The ten strategic axes on which the Urban Agenda is based are:

+ Axis 1. A sustainable and connected territorial model.
+ Axis 2. A compact, accessible, and quality urban organisation
+ Axis 3. Building adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change
+ Axis 4. Promoting the responsible management of urban resources and the circular economy
+ Axis 5. Promoting sustainable mobility
+ Axis 6. Strengthening social cohesion, integration, and equity
+ Axis 7. Boosting the economy and employment generation capacities
+ Axis 8. System facilitating access to housing.
+ Axis 9. Enhancing digital innovation and urban intelligence capacity
+ Axis 10. Strengthening governance and participation Under these ten axes, each of the climate actions that incorporate all social visions will be studied, analysed and reflected upon for their final formulation.

The municipal citizen participation mechanisms have been established through whose channels the work of the Urban Agenda will be fed.

Within the framework of the specific planning that directly concerns this Climate City Contract, social participation is articulated through the Advisory and Public Participation Council of the Energy and Sustainability Agency of Seville (regulated by the Municipal Ordinance on Energy Management, Climate Change and Sustainability), in which the participation of the quintuple helix innovation model is guaranteed: administrations, companies, civil society, academia and the media.

This participation council, constituted in 2014 and periodically renewed, meets regularly in four sessions per year, and will be responsible for assessing the degree of progress of the commitments acquired in the Seville' Climate City Contract. It will also intervene in the iterative and co-creation process that characterises the Climate Mission, reviewing the diagnoses and giving its opinion on the action plans on an annual basis. It will therefore have a consultative character for the positions of the highest municipal decision-making body, the Plenary.

In conclusion, the process in the new Climate City Contract that is formalised should enable an increase in the targets initially set out in the Climate Action Plan (SECAP, Rev. 2020), with a 54.28% reduction in GHG emissions compared to the baseline year

9
Climate City Contract. Seville

(2005), to reach at least an 80% reduction by 2030. This margin to a climate neutral city could be achieved through local absorption capacities, as well as public and private offsetting actions developed in and/or from the city.

Therefore, the Seville Climate Action Plan (CAP) will integrate the PMCC due to the autonomous Law 8/2018, the Climate Agenda 2030, and the Climate City Contract of the Climate Neutral Cities Mission. At the epicentre of the CAP will be eCitySevilla, the technological, geographical, and temporal spearhead for the Climate Mission.

This process should enable the decarbonisation of the city of Seville in this period, without affecting its aspirations for economic growth and social welfare, which will place us in the group of the 100 climate-neutral cities in the EU. The expected co-benefits can lead to a net result that exceeds the necessary investments, especially in terms of health benefits, employment benefits, energy savings, and ecosystem services (local, regional, and global). Some medium-sized cities have assessed the co-benefits of mobility actions at more than 400 M €.

The process will be driven in a very significant way by the collaboration of the Seville City Council with the Academy. We can now highlight the strong cooperation in the training and internship programmes with the following teaching and research activities:

+ Master's degree in smart cities from the European University Ulysseus
This programme https://ulysseus.eu/ulysseuscitiesmd/ of the European university Ulysseus, led by the University of Seville, is aimed at tackling the challenges that connect the areas of Energy, Transport, Mobility and Smart Cities, and addresses priority issues in European policy such as energy transition and decarbonised systems. It is the first joint Ulysseus degree and is aligned with the latest needs of the labour market, research, and innovation, including a just transition to renewable energies and the development of smart cities and urban areas.

The university alliance, made up of eight universities, has been responsible for the design of the master's degree and has built a joint academic governance structure and its joint administrative and financial management bodies.

Climate City Contract. Seville

During the first year, the programme will provide students with a theoretical grounding in the technical and technological aspects specific to the smart and climate-neutral cities of the future, while the second year is designed to be more flexible. The academic offer will cover cross-cutting aspects, including an intensive course on entrepreneurship, and additional courses to enrich the technical curriculum, equipping students with cutting-edge knowledge and skills.

During the second year, students will have the possibility to complete a professional internship, which will allow them to deepen their fields of specialisation. At the end of the second year, students will complete a thesis that may allow them to pursue further doctoral studies.

Ulysseus is one of the 44 European Universities selected by the European Commission to become the universities of the future. Coordinated by the University of Seville, together with seven other European universities - the University of Genoa (Italy), the Côte d'Azur University (France), the Technical University of Košice (Slovakia), MCI The Entrepreneurial School (Austria), the University of Applied Sciences of Haaga-Helia (Finland), the University of Münster (Germany) and the University of Montenegro (Montenegro) - the project will allow students, researchers and graduates to move freely between universities, develop internships in companies or administrations and promote high-impact research projects.

+ Master's Degree in Eco-efficient Rehabilitation of Buildings and Neighbourhoods, University of Seville

This training plan is based on the fact that 40% of the total energy consumption in the European Union corresponds to buildings; therefore, the reduction of energy consumption and the use of renewable energy in buildings are priority energy objectives. In this sense, the minimum energy performance requirements for buildings have been modified to become more and more restrictive and move towards the construction of Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB).

1
Climate City Contract. Seville
2

In the current building landscape, the European Union places particular emphasis on the retrofitting of existing buildings as a key instrument to achieve energy targets. In addition, environmental policies advocate the use of eco-efficient materials, better use of material resources and improved waste management in construction as a sustainability measure that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and can mitigate climate change.

These strategies are not only restricted to buildings but should also be extended to public space to mitigate the heat island effect.

The objective of this Master is to provide professionals, administration technicians and future researchers with the tools and knowledge necessary to apply eco-efficient rehabilitation techniques in buildings and neighbourhoods.

+ Master Intelligent Systems in Energy and Transport

This Official University Master's Degree is an initiative framed within the Campus of International Excellence Andalucía Tech that aims to respond to the need for highly qualified technicians in certain areas related to the application of ICTs to sectors such as Energy, Environment or Transport.

The syllabus consists of 90 ECTS credits, taught over 3 terms, structured around two specialisations: Smart Cities and Mechanics and Energy. In both specialisations, you can choose between a professionally oriented pathway (with work placements in companies) or an introduction to research.

The Master has been designed with three main objectives in mind:

To complete the training of graduates with excellent training to take on R&amp;D&amp;I projects and activities in high-level technological companies.
To respond to the demand for professionals in a sector considered to have "high growth potential".
To prepare students to carry out research work, making it possible, for those who wish to do so, to write a doctoral thesis in the specialised areas of the Master's degree, after joining a doctoral programme.

+ **Master Sustainable City and Architecture**

The basic objective of the master's degree is the acquisition, by professionals, administration technicians and future researchers, of advanced transdisciplinary training in the field of Sustainability, focusing on the regeneration of the City and Architecture, and using, among other instruments, those developed by architecture such as the project and planning.

Starting from a common core that guarantees in its first five subjects a transdisciplinary training in the field of City, Architecture and Sustainability, based on learning and mastery of regeneration actions on an urban and territorial scale, two itineraries have been defined, with a character of both training synthesis and deepening.

The professional orientation is designed to provide students with professional training in the field of the City, Architecture and Sustainability. It is designed so that students will be able to join interdisciplinary groups to tackle regeneration at all scales of intervention with scientific and technical rigour, as well as design skills, promoting its transdisciplinary projection. The research itinerary is designed to provide basic research training in the field of the construction of sustainable buildings and cities, priority lines of research in Andalusia, Spain and Europe in their R+D+i research plans, as well as Spanish and European construction technology platforms, promoting the opening up of new lines of research in sustainability, ecology and energy efficiency in cities and buildings.

+ **Chair of Circular Economy of the University of Seville**

The Chair of Waste Management in the Circular Economy arises as a response to the important need for collaboration between academia and industry to intensify efforts in research, dissemination and training, in order to meet the challenges facing our society, and more particularly the environment and waste management sector, in order to become circular.

The Chair is the result of collaboration between the University of Seville, through the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering of the School of Engineering of the University of Seville, and the company Aborgase (Abonos Orgánicos Sevilla).
Climate City Contract. Seville

The purpose of the Chair is to promote teaching, research and dissemination activities that study the reality, problems and prospects of waste management, from all points of view that are considered relevant in the field of sustainability in general, and the Circular Economy in particular, taking care of developing training programmes and research tasks that contribute to improving training in these matters among students and graduates of the University of Seville.

The collaboration and participation of these training programmes in the Seville Mission will undoubtedly lead to an enrichment of the process until 2030, with the greatest levels of talent with the involvement of the teaching staff and during the students' curricular internships in the process.

All the details for the fulfilment of this overall objective of the Mission will be presented in the relevant annexes to this document.

However, the present Climate City Contract with the EU is a process proposal to achieve the EU Mission's targets set for the 100 climate neutral cities, rather than a formal commitment, which will only be possible after the stages of final shaping of the local partnerships, multi-level cooperation, and coordination and co-creation between the twinned cities (iterative process). In any case, these tasks must be completed by 31 December 2023.

The European Mission, like all the cities that are part of it, is aware that the challenge will not be possible without the active participation of the private sector. But it is the case, as on so many other occasions, that the business sector is moving more firmly towards the goal of decarbonisation than the public sector, which is an advantage for that alliance.

All indications are that the EU Climate Mission will generate considerable investment appetite in the participating cities, which should also be the subject of numerous demonstration projects and consolidated applications for mitigation. This will come with the European Mission City Label, which will give confidence and technical, legal and institutional security to the private sector for their investments.

Throughout the process it will be necessary to avoid interpretations of greenwashing, and to apply tools to measure achievements. In this respect, despite its complexity, it

4
Climate City Contract. Seville
5

will be necessary to resort to the most appropriate techniques, such as the green taxonomy, promoted by the EU, an area in which joint work between Mission cities is particularly welcome in order to harmonise criteria and take advantage of existing synergies.

In any scenario, everything points to the fact that a change of paradigm will be essential to face the new challenges and achieve decarbonisation from the city councils, being essential to make compatible the mitigation of GHG emissions, adaptation to climate phenomena, economic development, and social protection and welfare. The Seville City Council will formalise the necessary agreements with Caritas Seville and the Red Cross (in accordance with the work that has already been carried out for years) to ensure that the most disadvantaged are part of the diagnosis and that they will be attended to in the framework of the climate emergency, among other resources, through the provision and availability of the necessary climate shelters.

# Government of Spain's support for climate neutrality in Mission cities

Through the Declaration signed by the Third Vice-President of the Government and Minister for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, which is attached to this document, the Government of Spain expresses its commitment to the transformation process of the city of Seville, selected by the European Commission on 28 April 2022, to participate in the European Mission on Climate Neutral Cities 2030.

# Supporting statement of National Government for the climate neutrality of Spanish Mission Cities

I hereby place on record the Spanish Government's commitment to support the climate city contracts presented by the cities, which were selected by the European Commission on 28 April 2022 to participate in the European Cities Mission: Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, Valencia, Zaragoza, Valladolid and Vitoria-Gasteiz.

This support contributes to the ecological and energy transformation of cities and to a greater climate and social resilience, which is materialised in the Spanish State's framework of competences, among others, in the following aspects:

The impulse of a regulatory framework aligned with the systemic innovation and public-private collaboration required by the European Mission of Cities. In this context, it highlights:

+ The Spanish Urban Agenda, approved in February 2019, which highlights the need to achieve sustainability in urban development policies. It is constituted as a working method and a process for all the actors involved in cities that aspire to an equitable, fair and sustainable development from the different fields of action. This strategy is developed around 30 specific objectives and 291 action lines, which includes all villages and cities regardless of size and population, and it addresses economic, social and environmental sustainability.

+ Law 7/2021, of 20 May, on climate change and energy transition. This institutional framework guarantees, through its various measures, the coordination of sectoral policies, ensures coherence between them and synergies to achieve the objective of climate neutrality, and increases our capacity to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.
↑

The work commitment on the regulatory developments of the Law is clear. Due to the implications for the European Mission Cities, the following stand out: (i) in the energy field, work is being done to establish a framework to deploy energy efficiency in industries and buildings, and renewable energies as vectors towards decarbonisation, (ii) in terms of emission-free mobility, the mandate for cities to adopt sustainable urban mobility plans with mitigation measures, such as low-emission zones, is included, iii) in the area of green procurement, we are working to establish measures to integrate the fight against climate change in public procurement procedures, such as the inclusion of emission reduction and carbon footprint criteria specifically aimed at the fight against climate change as specific technical requirements in procurement specifications.

The launch of the Multi-stakeholder Collaboration Platform for the Climate Neutrality of Spanish Cities (citiES 2030), a tool created ad hoc and already in operation to facilitate the implementation of the Cities Mission.

With the implementation of this platform, the Government of Spain not only fulfils one of the initial activities of the Mission, but also becomes a reference for the other countries and cities in the programme.

This platform is a multi-stakeholder innovation and collaboration infrastructure to support and accelerate the transformation of Spanish cities towards climate neutrality.

The platform's main beneficiaries are city councils of Spanish cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants or provincial capitals that want to achieve full or partial climate neutrality by 2030, as well as cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants that want to initiate this process.

The platform offers cities a range of services, including:

+ Training, learning and skills enhancement
↑

+ The support for the development of local systemic innovation platforms for the design of transformative project portfolios;
+ The assistance in drafting and monitoring climate city contracts and the design of roadmaps in a multi-stakeholder environment;
+ The connection with related processes in other European cities; the incubation of multi-city projects; the citizen participation and activation;
+ The assistance to cities to structure transformation financing schemes, involving financial actors;
+ The strategic communication.

The Platform's governance is multi-stakeholder and multi-level, with the aim of facilitating, ordering and guaranteeing directionality and stability in these collaborations. In this way, it relies on the participation of the actors of the quintuple helix:

+ The public sector (administrations and public agencies).
+ The private sector (companies, financial sector, urban infrastructure sector and professional associations).
+ The academia (universities and research centres).
+ The civil society (NGOs and neighbourhood associations).
+ The media.

The support to mobilisation of green investments. A good example is the deployment of the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan through the mobilisation of an unprecedented volume of investment that prioritises not only mitigating the effects of the crisis, but also the transformation of our country towards a sustainable and inclusive economy.

The Recovery Plan recognises the fundamental role of cities in economic and social transformation, due to their capacity to generate short-term activity with a pull effect on industry and key sectors, and their importance in terms of the climate emergency. Thus, it includes initiatives aimed at essential aspects for the climate neutrality of cities, such as:

+ The improvement of sustainable mobility, with the promotion of electric and fuel cell vehicles and the extension of recharging infrastructures, through the different MOVES programmes.
+ The promotion of the renovation of urban residential environments, housing, buildings and neighbourhoods, with the priority objective of decreasing energy consumption and promoting decarbonisation in the household stock.
+ The development of energy communities that promote social innovation and citizen participation in renewables, energy efficiency and electric mobility, thereby contributing to fair and inclusive decarbonisation in urban areas.
+ The promotion of self-consumption for the energy use of urban roofs and decks, storage behind the meter and renewable HVAC in homes.
+ The development of transformative strategies and initiatives for urban renaturalisation, helping to increase green infrastructure and biodiversity in Spanish cities and favouring Nature-Based Solutions to respond to their socio-environmental challenges.
+ The support for the implementation of waste regulation, in collaboration with the autonomous communities and cities, with investments in
5

digitalisation for environmental management, through the Recovery Plan.

+ The deployment of calls for grants to municipalities and local entities for the implementation of low-emission zones in cities and the sustainable and digital transformation of urban transport.

The monitoring of the progress of the seven cities through the information processed in the citiES 2030 Platform, with the aim of integrating the urban transformation roadmap into the country's decarbonisation process.

As part of the iterative process of the European Cities Mission, the Spanish Government will participate in the monitoring and updating of the commitments made in the climate neutrality agreements of the cities of Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza, supporting the recognition and dissemination of the progress achieved.

# Monitoring, updating and amending the Climate City Contract and its Annexes

This indicative proposal for the Climate City Contract of the City of Seville with the EU is configured within the framework of an iterative process, as a dynamic and flexible document that will be subject to monitoring, updating and modification in order to review and adjust the commitments, actions and/or investments necessary to achieve the City’s climate neutrality objectives. It is a second version of the initial proposal, which complements and rectifies the one initially submitted in April this year.

The Climate City Contract requires at least biennial monitoring of the progress of the proposals assumed in this document and its Annexes and their due updating. This monitoring and updating is without prejudice to the fact that specific monitoring, review and updating methodologies are set out in the different Annexes.

Whenever it is necessary for the better achievement of its objective, does not affect its essential purpose, and provided that it involves a specification, improvement or upward revision of the objectives and commitments undertaken, amendments may be made to it and/or to any of its Annexes.

These amendments will preferably be made in the framework of the biennial monitoring and will be sent to the other signatory parties for information purposes.

# Annex 1: Climate Neutrality Action Plan of the Seville

## Introduction

The City of Seville has been a member of the Covenant of Mayors for Sustainable Energy and Climate since 2009. The objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2030 was ratified by the Governing Board in session held on 30 July 2021, based on the provisions of the Seville 2030 Strategic Plan approved by the Seville City Council Plenary on 11 April 2019, and the Seville Local Action Plan to develop the 2030 Urban Agenda, approved by the Seville City Council Plenary on 21 July 2022⁸.

There is a Municipal Ordinance for the management of energy, climate change and sustainability, approved by the Municipal Plenary (text approved by the Governing Council of the Local Energy Agency of Seville, in session held on 1 March 2012).

The Municipal Ordinance for the management of energy, climate change and sustainability in Seville responds to the need to comply with the commitments made by the city of Seville in three specific areas: **sustainable development**, as a result of signing the Aalborg Charter and joining the European Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign; **climate change**, having signed the Covenant of Mayors against Climate Change, and now joining the EU Climate Mission; and the continuous improvement of **energy management** at the local level, a task that had already been carried out since 1997.

Seville and its metropolitan area represent one of the European urban regions located in the front line of global warming. Its latitude and climate place it in an area with a high incidence of rising temperatures. In accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals, Seville has set itself the strategic objective of reducing emissions and combating climate change, placing special emphasis on actions that have an impact on sustainability, adaptation to the environment and decarbonisation. In this sense, Seville is promoting a strategy to reduce emissions, leading an energy transition towards a more sustainable model, based on the most sustainable energy sources.

To achieve this objective, it is essential to improve energy efficiency and effectiveness in all areas of urban life: mobility, construction and conservation of public and private buildings, street lighting, etc. Along the same lines, the development of distributed renewable energy production is promoted, with buildings mainly producing photovoltaic electricity, facilitating and providing economic incentives for the installation of panels and self-consumption of electricity in public and private buildings. The use of clean energy sources for public and private transport is also favoured, developing the necessary infrastructures for this purpose. Actions aimed at improving the thermal comfort of citizens in public spaces will also be implemented.

In the development of the city adapted to climate change, green space and trees take centre stage, both as natural sinks for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and as climate moderators for a more liveable city. In this way, the management of trees and green spaces in general becomes a strategic element in achieving this city objective. Seville will continue and reinforce its commitment to sustainable urban mobility, which it has been developing since the last decade, with relevant milestones such as the development of cycle lanes, new means of electric transport (metro and tram), traffic calming and the facilitation of pedestrian mobility.

The commitment to sustainable mobility in Seville must be based on the existence of multiple transport systems, with priority given to decarbonised public transport and non-motorised mobility, with the development of pedestrian routes and the extension of cycle lanes. It is also committed to innovative mobility.

Seville is committed to complying with the principles of the circular economy, incorporating into its strategy the sustainable use of resources, compliance with the waste management hierarchy emanating from the European Union and the promotion of public procurement of green products. And all this from instruments of awareness, sensitisation and participation, promoting R&amp;D&amp;I and the generation of public-private alliances and partnerships.

The main shortcomings stem from the scarcity of resources and means, with notable limitations to cope with the economic needs required for the numerous actions for emissions mitigation, and also adaptation.
Work process

The city of Seville, in its commitment to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 through the iterative process proposed by the Mission, has defined three planning framework lines that will characterise the work process until 2030:

First, at the global city level, the Seville 2030 Strategic Plan, which establishes among its objectives the strategy to develop governance and citizen participation, stating that for the fulfilment of the central objective it is essential to articulate new forms of good governance in the city based on transparency, consensus and equity. It will integrate the sectoral plans related to each of the SDGs. In addition, it aims to reduce the vulnerability of its economic, social and natural systems, focusing on the creation of a green, sustainable city adapted to the new climatic conditions, seeking to improve the quality of life. These strategies must in turn be an economic and social driving force for Seville and its metropolitan area.

Secondly, the Climate and Sustainable Energy Action Plan, which will be renamed Misión Clima Sevilla, and which will integrate all the agreements and commitments generated as a result of the European process that is now beginning, in addition to the legal prescriptions derived from Law 8/2018, on climate change in Andalusia. Thus, it will especially ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in the sectors of transport, electricity consumption, consumption of other fuels and urban solid waste and wastewater). The executive responsibility for this process will lie with the Energy and Sustainability Agency of Seville, which will have the support of the Corporation of Municipal Companies as well as the different municipal areas involved (Finance, Mobility, Urban Planning, etc.).

And thirdly, the full integration of the university fabric in the new proposals, through a symbiotic involvement that makes possible the necessary changes in the city through scientific knowledge, backed by the business fabric, and maintained by the new ways of managing the city from a holistic and systematic perspective.

As a consequence of the requirements of the aforementioned regional law, Seville must soon present its Municipal Plan against Climate Change (PMCC), which meets all the requirements of the Covenant of Mayors. The deadline for submission is April 2024.

And the next review of the Mission Climate Agreement will take place two years after its inception.

It should be clear that the GCMP and the Climate 2030 Agenda (Agenda 2030) will be consistent with the Seville Climate Mission Plan, integrating all sectoral actions for mitigating emissions that are projected in the city, with its system of indicators, evaluation and monitoring.

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of the Baseline GHG Inventory

Seville's total emissions amount to 2.087.988,7 tCO₂ eq. This is equivalent to a per capita emission of 2,9828 tCO₂ eq per inhabitant per year, which shows a notable impact of the metropolitan area on its central area.

The breakdown by sector is presented below:

Road traffic/transport: 807.735,56 (38,7%)
Electricity consumption: 753.248,91 (36,08%)
Consumption of other fuels: 223,792.41 (10.71%)
Wastewater: 142.290,71 (6,81%)
Fluorinated gases: 89.638,84 (4,29%)
Waste: 63.811,32 (3,06%)
Agriculture: 4.993,48 (0,24%)
Livestock: 2.477,47 (0,12%)
Climate City Contract. Seville

In terms of the categories established for the Mission, we would have:

+ Road traffic: 807.735,6 (38,7%)
+ Electricity consumption: 753.248,9 (36,08%)
+ Consumption of miscellaneous fuels and waste: 429.894,4 (20,58%)

This amounts to 1.990.878,9 t CO2 eq, leaving a total of 97.109,8 t CO2 eq (4.6%) in the "other" group, which corresponds to emissions from agriculture, livestock and fluorinated gases.

# A-2.2: Description and evaluation of policies

Seville is immersed in the new edition of the PMCC, in accordance with the provisions contained in the Andalusian Climate Change Law, mainly following the methodology for the elaboration of the municipal HC. Likewise, the diagnosis and drafting of goals within the framework of the 2030 Agenda (Agenda Clima 2030) is underway, and now the edition of the Seville Climate Mission Plan is underway.

Below is a summary of the main measures that were incorporated in the revision of the PACES 2018:

Municipal buildings and facilities
Buildings and equipment/ tertiary sector facilities
Residential buildings
Street lighting
Transport
Local electricity production
Local heating/cooling production
Other

The actions envisaged meant a reduction of 506,656.7 tonnes CO2 eq, well above the 55,213 tonnes CO2 eq that were required in 2015. The target was to achieve a 54.28% reduction compared to the old 2015 inventory, exceeding the commitment set in the Covenant of Mayors by 14.28%.

New policies and planning instruments, coupled with the commitment to the Climate Neutral Cities Mission 2030, imply a rethinking of the objectives to achieve the decarbonisation of the urban system.

However, this is a dynamic, iterative process, in continuous co-creation, which requires permanent updating of this planning, always attentive to the proposals that emanate from the different multilevel public participation procedures established within the framework of the Advisory and Public Participation Council of the Seville Energy and Sustainability Agency.

# A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers

The Spanish regulatory framework, often considered excessively prescriptive and rigid, could be a barrier to the necessary innovation in the process of transition to net neutrality in cities, with the currently existing management models. Often, the lack of agility in the regulatory and administrative process prevents the incorporation of innovations of various kinds. Regulations are not easily and quickly adapted to the requirements of climate innovation, preventing actions that could generate positive impacts. In the case of Andalusia, the regulatory framework and its application have been strengthened in order to intensify the fight against the climate crisis from the local entities, based on the competences attributed to the municipalities in the Statute of Autonomy.

Public-private collaboration is essential for the joint construction of new urban models and imaginaries, and it is not sufficiently developed. There are few mechanisms that explore formulas for collaboration beyond contracting and sponsorship. There is a lack of formulas that allow for a systemic and continuous participation of all the agents involved in the areas of action. In terms of urban management procedures, the conventional formulas of sponsorship and patronage, combined with the limitations of public procurement, do not allow for the flexible public-private management of investments required for the transition to carbon neutrality. The lack of financial mechanisms for the implementation of impact projects for climate neutrality, combining private and municipal public funds, can also be a constraint.

Citizen engagement is also critical for the fulfilment of the Climate Mission. Progress must be made in mechanisms for citizen participation in climate policies, plans and actions. An example may be the need to disseminate climate objectives to society in non-expert language.

With regard to municipal management, the current centralised model is a barrier, where the processes of planning, design, execution and maintenance are not adequately coordinated, nor are they implemented in a transversal manner in the organisation. The inertia of working in silos and the compartmentalised distribution of competences is an impediment to the development of integral actions necessary in the processes of urban transformation towards neutrality. These are limitations or barriers that affect a good part of the city councils of large cities, and are common issues in the known diagnoses.

Climate City Contract. Seville

Some opportunities for the city of Seville to support the planning of the Climate Action Plan are as follows:

+ There is an active interdepartmental and collaborative working group that has been functioning since 2013, which serves as a connection and communication between the different areas, but also as a space for collaboration on new projects.

+ Relations with the city's two public universities allow for very positive links and agreements to be established for both parties. Numerous existing chairs and postgraduate master's programmes focus their research on the fight against climate change, both in the areas of mitigation and adaptation.

+ Previous experiences, such as Re-habilitar El Carmen, have been demonstration projects in which multidisciplinary and multilevel participation has given very good results in the field of social intervention. These focal points of knowledge need to be strengthened and directed towards concrete achievements in the sectors of energy saving, mobility, water saving and waste management.

+ The existence of the Corporation of Municipal Companies (Emasesa, Lipasam, Tussam and Emvisesa), in charge of the integral water cycle, waste, public transport and housing sectors, strongly committed to planning and fighting climate change, led them to establish climate emergency protocols. They represent a strength for the implementation of the Seville Climate Action Plan.

+ And in connection with the above, dozens of companies are committed to the fight against climate change, having promoted their registration in the Ministry's Carbon Footprint Register in the phases of Calculate, Calculate and Reduce, and even Calculate, Reduce and Compensate. The Seville Climate Action Plan will promote these initiatives, increasing the number of committed companies and broadening their involvement in the process. Special emphasis will be placed on the commerce and real estate sectors, which account for almost three quarters of the emissions due to electricity consumption in Seville. Not forgetting the transport sector (bus companies, delivery companies, taxis, etc.), which also account for significant emissions due to road traffic.

However, we would highlight as an important barrier the insufficient communication that the business community maintains with local councils in this respect, perhaps due to the belief that local authorities do not have competence in this area.

A-3.3: Description or visualisation of the city's participatory model for climate neutrality

Climate City Contract. Seville
Climate City Contract. Seville

Seville is committed to complying with the principles of the circular economy, incorporating into its strategy the sustainable use of resources, compliance with the waste management hierarchy emanating from the European Union and the promotion of public procurement of green products. And all this from instruments of awareness, sensitisation and participation, promoting R&amp;D&amp;I and the generation of alliances and public-private partnerships.

The regional climate action plan establishes 6 strategic objectives for 2030, 12 sectoral objectives and more than 137 lines of action distributed in three Programmes: Mitigation and Energy Transition, Adaptation and Communication/Participation, which will be developed in their operational deployments with a 2022, 2026 and 2030 horizon. The city of Seville is part of this planning, which it will integrate into its municipal Climate Action Plan.

The Seville 2030 Strategic Plan establishes in its fourth objective the strategy to develop governance and citizen participation, stating that, in order to fulfil the central objective, it is essential to articulate in the city renewed forms of good governance based on transparency, consensus and equity.

Within the framework of the specific planning that directly concerns this Climate Agreement, social participation is articulated through the Advisory and Public Participation Council of the Energy and Sustainability Agency of Seville (regulated by the Municipal Ordinance on Energy Management, Climate Change and Sustainability), in which the participation of the quintuple helix is guaranteed: administrations, companies, civil society, academia and the media.

This participation council, constituted in 2014 and periodically renewed, meets regularly in four ordinary sessions per year, and will evaluate the degree of progress of the commitments acquired in the Seville Climate Agreement. It will also intervene in the iterative and co-creation process that characterises the Climate Mission, reviewing the diagnoses and giving its opinion on the action plans on an annual basis. It will therefore have a consultative character for the positions of the highest municipal decision-making body, the Plenary.

Given that there has been a change in the municipal corporation as a result of the last municipal elections, this Advisory and Public Participation Council has not yet been

6
+

constituted with the representatives appointed for the period 2023-2027. This appointment must take place before the end of December 2023.

However, prior to this change, a participatory process was launched among the members of the participation forum of the 2030 Agenda, where the scope and contents of the Mission have been presented. All the institutions and groups participating in this process have also adhered to the Climate Mission, which is why they are included in Annex III.

The Energy and Sustainability Agency has a Governing Board, as well as an Advisory and Public Participation Board, which meets periodically to address the Agency's own issues: Energy, Climate Change and Sustainability. The structure of this public participation forum is set out in the Agency's statutes:

The Presidency, which corresponds to the President of the Governing Board of the Energy and Sustainability Agency of Seville, or the person he/she delegates.
The Vice-Presidency, which shall be held by the head of the Directorate-General concerned.
A representative of each and every one of the municipal areas and companies, with a maximum of twelve members.
A representative of the Energy and Sustainability Agency of Seville.
One representative from among the consumer associations, at their proposal.
A representative of the Seville City Council Works Committee.
A representative of the business associations.
One representative from among the Professional Associations established in the city of Seville.
A representative of the city's residents' associations, at their proposal.
One representative from each of the public universities based in Seville.
Up to four members, at the proposal of the Energy and Sustainability Agency of Seville, from among competent technicians of recognised prestige working in the city of Seville.

In this section k), NGOs (environmental and social) and the media are integrated, thus ensuring the participation of the five helix in the process.

## B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

The main areas or impact pathways of the Seville Climate Action Plan are based on the following actions, firstly, in the area of mitigation:

Analysis and assessment of the GHG emissions of the municipality and, in particular, of municipal infrastructures, facilities and services.
Objectives and strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change and boosting the energy transition.
Actions to reduce emissions, particularly considering those with the greatest potential to improve air quality in the urban environment, within the framework of the Andalusian Climate Action Plan.
Actions for the promotion of research, development and innovation (R&amp;D&amp;I) for the implementation of mitigation, adaptation and energy transition measures in the area of its competence.
Actions for awareness raising and training on climate change and energy transition at local level, incorporating gender equality principles.
Actions for the progressive substitution of municipal consumption of fossil fuels for renewable energies produced in situ.
Actions in the field of construction and energy refurbishment of municipal buildings in order to achieve the energy efficiency and savings targets set out in the municipal plan.
Measures to boost energy transition within urban mobility plans.
Actions to optimise public lighting, minimising electricity consumption, guaranteeing maximum energy efficiency and reducing light pollution based on the best available technology.
Temporal programming of the planned actions, their economic evaluation and execution.

And in the context of adaptation:

Identification and characterisation of vulnerable elements and the impacts of climate change on the municipal territory, based on the analysis of regional Climate Scenarios, including the analysis of extreme weather events.
Actions to incorporate climate change adaptation and energy transition measures in municipal planning and programming instruments, especially in general urban planning.

This is supported by a rigorous emissions inventory that addresses the sectors included in the European Climate Mission: road traffic, electricity consumption,

| --- | --- | --- |
|  Issuing sector and sub-sector | Description of the portfolio of transformative actions  |   |
|   |  List of actions | General description  |
|  Transport | Electric vehicle charging point infrastructures | Implementation of charging systems for EVs. The aim is to promote the availability of charging points in the city.  |
|   |  Use of electric vehicles in LIPASAM's vehicle fleet | Renewal of the LIPASAM fleet with the acquisition of more energy-efficient electric vehicles with a lower impact on CO2 emissions. The project includes the purchase of 4 electric multi-purpose vehicles and 50 electric motorbikes.  |
|   |  Extension of the tram route | Extension of the tramway route from the San Bernardo area to the Santa Justa railway station. The budget includes the design and execution of the project (€27 million) and the purchase of 5 tram units. This project promotes intermodality between different public transport modes/ autonomous modes (bus, tram, bicycle, train).  |
|   |  Acquisition of eco-efficient vehicles for the municipal vehicle fleet | Renewal of 50% of the municipal vehicle fleet with the acquisition of more energy-efficient vehicles with lower associated CO2 emissions.  |
|   |  Implementation of an Efficient Driving System in the TUSSAM fleet. | An Efficient Driving System is to be implemented in the entire TUSSAM fleet (385 buses). The system includes the installation in all buses of the fleet of equipment that captures the necessary data on the driving of the vehicle and on the identity of the driver, storing them and allowing the subsequent analysis of the driving mode. During driving, a display shows the driver whether his driving is optimal. It includes training in efficient and safe driving for the 1200 drivers and middle management of TUSSAM and the monitoring of all drivers, analysing their driving style and encouraging efficient and safe driving with personalised monitoring. An average annual reduction of 8% in the fleet's fuel consumption is expected.  |

Climate City Contract. Seville
Climate City Contract. Seville

|   | Expansion of the Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) bus fleet by 93 units. | Project to expand the CNG public bus fleet by 93 units.
This is an alternative to traditional fuels in urban bus fleets. It is a measure already initiated in Seville and, thanks to the results obtained, the number of buses with this fuel, CNG, is expected to increase.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Incorporation of LIPASAM's vehicle fleet management system. | The aim is to manage LIPASAM's vehicle fleets to improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary journeys, thus avoiding emissions into the atmosphere, while improving the effectiveness of route control and reducing fuel consumption.
Management systems are essential to achieve operational excellence within a transport company and also reduce unnecessary costs.  |
|   |  Use of electric vehicles in LIPASAM's fleet of supervision vehicles. | The measure is based on its application to motorbikes and multi-purpose vehicles in the LIPASAM fleet.  |
|   |  Education and awareness-raising programmes to promote the use of Public Transport in schools (TUSSAM). | Awareness-raising campaigns will be promoted in educational centres at the Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO) level, aimed at pupils to encourage the use of Public Transport. The aim of these campaigns is to encourage them to adopt behaviour in their daily lives that will lead to a better perception of Public Transport and a greater use of it, which will result in a future reduction in the use of private vehicles and a reduction in CO2 emissions. The campaign consists of organising visits throughout the school year for secondary school pupils to representative facilities, with an exhibition of the advantages of Public Transport, a visit to the Control Centre, the Workshops, the solar photovoltaic plant, the CNG refuelling plant and other facilities. Emphasising the recycling of batteries, tyres, used motor oil, coolant and separation of other waste according to type.  |
|   |  Publicity campaigns to promote the use of public transport. | Between 5 and 7 publicity campaigns are carried out each year to promote the use of public transport and the reduction of private vehicle use. These campaigns aim to encourage the citizens of Seville in their daily lives to adopt behaviours that will lead to a better perception of Public Transport and a greater use of it, which will result in a future reduction in the use of private vehicles and a reduction in CO2 emissions. The campaigns are diverse in nature and emphasise both bus and tram use.  |

|   | Sustainable Mobility Management Plan | Within the SUMP, the management plan aims to bring together all the actions foreseen for its proper planning.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | Pedestrian Mobility Action Plan | This pedestrian mobility action plan encompasses a large number of actions with the aim of recovering public space for the citizen, creating certain infrastructures in the city to serve pedestrians, in parallel with the other ordinary strategies that are carried out to make progress in terms of universal accessibility and maintenance of pavements.  |
|   | Actions to promote cycling mobility | This plan foresees that they will be developed in the short term, with proposals focused on completing the current network, renovating sections or specific reforms, integrating the network into the historic centre, improving the maintenance of the cycleway network, as well as the provision of secure cycle parking facilities.  |
|   | Actions to promote public transport | In the short term, measures to improve the commercial speed of urban public transport and optimisation of the network to guarantee a quality service, as well as an improvement in the fare system and payment methods in order to make it easier for citizens to use public transport are foreseen.  |
|   | Last mile” urban distribution of goods | For the Urban Distribution of Goods action plan, the aim is to implement logistics platforms that will serve the Old Quarter and Triana Historical Quarter, where the greatest deficiency of the current goods distribution model was detected and which, given the need for prior studies to determine the construction and operation model for this type of facility in order to determine its economic and financial viability, are expected to be implemented in the long term.  |
|   | Road and traffic improvement actions | The measures aim to consolidate the hierarchy of roads by improving the flow of traffic on main roads and penalising traffic on local roads in favour of pedestrians and bicycles, promoting the outer ring roads as opposed to the inner or transversal roads by improving the outer ring roads and the communication between outer ring roads, reducing and calming traffic on the historic ring road and interrupting the main and penetration roads in favour of the outer ring roads, in addition to other complementary measures aimed at freeing the urban nucleus from through traffic by directing it towards the main road  |

|  Buildings and heating | Pumping efficiency in IMD installations | Improving efficiency of pumping equipment by installing variable speed drives  |
|   | Energy efficiency in swimming pool coverings | Modification of pool cover systems for annual use with more energy-efficient construction elements. Application to pools with presostatic covers in the Torreblanca and Tiro de Línea sports centres.  |
|   | TUSSAM Facilities Efficiency Plan | Development and implementation of a plan of energy saving and efficiency actions in TUSSAM's offices, depots and workshops, with the incorporation of more efficient lighting, improved air conditioning and insulation.  |
|   | Pilot building project based on high energy efficiency parameters for monitoring and analysis of its application to other municipal buildings. | Pilot project based on the Emvisesa headquarters building, which is equipped with numerous features to achieve high energy efficiency. Its design obeys very demanding energy efficiency parameters, such as intelligent lighting, with brightness sensors capable of regulating the lighting and intensity based on the natural light existing at any given time, or heat recovery systems, to enable constant ventilation in the building, taking advantage of the internal temperature and minimising energy consumption, among other aspects.  |
|   | Performance of energy audits and application of the corresponding EMASESA Energy Efficiency and Saving Improvement Plan. | The main objectives are to understand the current energy situation, inventory equipment and installations, take measurements of electrical, thermal and comfort parameters, and analyse options for optimising the demand for fuel and electricity.  |

|   | Energy management in WWTPs (ISO 50001) of EMASESA | The measure is based on a set of actions to be applied in WWTPs in order to obtain the best performance from the energy demanded by this type of facility.
The measure is applied in accordance with the UNE-EN ISO 50001:2011 Standard, which establishes the requirements that an Energy Management System must have, in order to make continuous and systematic improvements to the energy performance of organisations.
The certification of an energy management system ensures the systematic control and monitoring of energy aspects and the continuous improvement of energy performance. This contributes to a more efficient and sustainable use of energy, giving confidence in the management system.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Implementation of bioclimatic architectural techniques | Through the implementation of bioclimatic architectural techniques in the design and subsequent construction of housing, the energy efficiency of buildings can be significantly improved (greater acoustic and thermal insulation, better use of natural light, etc.).  |
|  Electricity Consumption | Centralisation of street lighting control | Reduction of electricity consumption by centralising the control of public lighting.  |
|   | Installation of a 1 MW photovoltaic solar plant on the roof of TUSSAM's workshops and offices. | Implementation of a 1 MW photovoltaic solar plant on the roofs of TUSSAM's workshops and offices. This will allow the roof to be rented to a specialised company in the energy sector. For this reason there is no investment for TUSSAM.  |
|   |  100 kw solar plant for self-consumption | 100 kw solar power plant in the Metrocentro depot for self-consumption.  |
|   |  Solar thermal collectors for DHW auxiliary parks | The aim is to heat water by capturing the maximum solar radiation. Solar thermal energy is proving to be the most economical and ecological hot water production system available today. The main benefit is the reduction of CO2 emissions.
The production of domestic hot water (DHW) is the main application of solar thermal energy, due to the low preparation temperatures and the homogeneity of its consumption throughout the year. The Technical Building Code requires that in new buildings and in the refurbishment of existing buildings there must be a minimum contribution of solar energy to cover the energy needs of DHW.  |

Finally, the implementation period for the current 2020-2030 period is established as follows  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  **Waste** | Home or community composting | This is the separation at source of the biowaste or organic fraction of urban waste (FORU) for recycling on site, through home or community composting. The measure is aimed at families, schools or neighbourhood communities, in semi-urban and urban areas. The implementation of the measure involves the distribution of composting machines among the target population, as well as an awareness-raising/training campaign among the households and communities involved.  |
|   | Installation of smart separate collection bins | Application of smart systems to the city's glass containers to improve the efficiency and sustainability of their management, as 65% of the containers for glass containers are emptied with very little glass (when they are only 25% full). This is a measure based on the Life Ewas project, which consists of the use of efficient and sustainable methodologies for waste management through the use of ICT tools to reduce polluting emissions.  |
|   | Separate collection of biowaste by side-loading container | Like the previous measures (65 and 66), this measure is closely related and has been defined as an evolution of these measures, being a third consolidation phase.
In short, the idea is to progressively introduce the side-loading container for the collection of bio-waste.

# B-2.3: Summary of residual emissions strategy

According to the 2019 GHG Inventory, Seville has the potential to absorb 526.22 tCO2 eq. It is foreseeable that with the implementation of the actions contained in the project for the city's Green Belt, this amount will increase significantly (around 1,800 t).

Creation of the Green Belt of the City of Seville:

The main phases of this project are as follows, although it is subject to some extensions and modifications at some stages:

+ F-0 Design of the set of phases, projection and creation of structure and process of citizen participation in interest groups, and other institutions or City Councils that could be affected. Tendering and contracting of the works for the next phase.

+ F-1 Section of 14,130 m between the Olympic Stadium and the Exclusa del Puerto. It involves, among other actions:
Recovery of the DPH in 2,500 m and its conditioning.
Construction of an elevated footbridge over the mouth of the old Guadaira riverbed.
Improvement of existing trees and reforestation of the riverbed and public land in the Tablada area.
Creation of accessible access areas, rest and recreation areas and rest areas.
Signage for public use
Construction and/or improvement of roads, and start of improvement of existing roads to municipalities in the Aljarafe area.

+ F-2 Section of 8,900 m between the Exclusa del Puerto and Guadaira Park 1:
Construction and/or improvement of roads, and the beginning of the route towards Alcalá de Guadaira.
Construction of elevated footbridges over the Utrera road and the Bellavista road.
Reforestation of the edges of the canal as well as the Guadaira River and nearby public land that can be integrated into the project.
Creation of fully accessible access areas and rest areas
Signage for public use

+ F-3 9,400 m stretch between Guadaira 1 Park and Tamarguillo Park. It involves, among other actions:
Demolition of the paving, conditioning and landscaping of the Ranillas canal as it passes through Palmete and areas of East Seville.
Construction and/or improvement of roads
Construction of elevated walkways over the Alcalá de Guadaira road and access road to the Airport Control Centre.

Reforestation of the edges of the canal and of public land close to and integrated into the project.
Creation of access and rest areas with full accessibility.
Signage for public use

+ F-4 9,200 m stretch between Tamarguillo Park and the Olympic Stadium. It involves, among other actions:
Construction and/or improvement of roads
Construction of elevated footbridges over the N IV road.
Reforestation of the edges of the canal and of public land close to and integrated into the project.
Creation of fully accessible access areas and rest areas
Signage for public use

+ F-5 Continuous improvement and fine-tuning of the whole on the basis of the guarantee periods of the works carried out.

Also in this area of green sinks, the City Council will carry out a new planting and replanting of green areas and roads with more than 350,000 trees, which will be consolidated before 2030.

It will be necessary to consider the potential contribution of Seville's green spaces as Ecosystem Services, and it is to be expected that their capacity for compensation will be considerable from a natural and cultural point of view.

On the other hand, the Seville Offsets Programme will be launched, similar to that designed in other cities such as Madrid, with plantations carried out by the City Council or directly by the participating entities. Among these entities (local and supralocal), those companies that carry out their activity in Seville and are part of the Ministry's HC reduction programme will have special relevance, regardless of whether they have reached the "compenso" level. It should be taken into account that all the companies attached to eCitySevilla (almost 100) will be part of this programme, having agreed to join the Climate Mission (they are listed in Annex III). In addition, other very relevant companies in the city, such as Heineken, Endesa Andalucía, Cepsa, ... have compensation plans that will be integrated (in whole or in part) in the compensation calculation of the city of Seville.
Climate City Contract. Seville

It will also have as special target groups the shops in Seville, due to their significant relevance in terms of electricity consumption in the GHG Inventory of Seville, as well as all passenger and freight transport companies. For these, information campaigns will be carried out to encourage them to join the Ministry's programme or to adopt measures in their sustainability plans.

The aim is to offset 16% of emissions in order to achieve full climate neutrality.

Although there are no agreements to assess the potential for CO capture₂ in the city, the issue is part of the university cooperation projects for the 2023-2024 academic year, in order to quantify the potential of these alternatives in the city.

Note: there is a need for a system of common indicators between the Mission cities that allows for the quantification of progress with the different actions implemented in the process, making comparability between cities possible.

In this respect, the Seville CAP includes the following indicators in its Indicator System (expressed in t CO₂ eq):

GHG emissions from stationary energy
GHG emissions from transport
GHG emissions from waste
GHG emissions from IPPU
AFOLU GHG emissions
GHG emissions from energy supplied by the grid

An indicator system is in place in the SECAP (Rev. 2020) from which it will be possible to generate the information as metadata. This task will be carried out with the Climate Action Plan (PAC), and will be included in the next iteration of this document.

An example of an action in the existing model, corresponding to the installation of PV generation in the city, is presented below:

## C-1.2: Description of organisational and governance interventions

The general objective of the Agency is to be an instrument of planning and management of the municipal environment, especially in the fields of Energy Management, Climate Change and Sustainable Development, both internally in the City Council and in the rest of the city, in coordination with all the Municipal Areas, Companies and Entities and with the different Administrations, with the aim of promoting energy saving and efficiency and the implementation of renewable energies, the development of Local Agenda 21 and the execution of the commitments acquired by joining the Covenant of Mayors (climate change) in order to contribute and progress towards a more sustainable city from the local level.

In all matters not provided for by the Autonomous Community or the State, the Agency is the competent body of the Excmo. Seville City Council for the planning of actions to improve air quality, waste management, contaminated soils, surface and underground water pollution, landscape conservation, environmental impact assessment of plans, programmes and projects, and integrated environmental authorisation, all without prejudice to the competences of the Municipal Delegation of Urban Planning, Environment and Parks and Gardens with regard to the control of qualified activities and in coordination and collaboration with the same, as well as with the municipal company LIPASAM with regard to waste.

For the correct fulfilment of this general objective, all areas of Seville City Council must previously submit to the Agency the proposals for Agreements to be adopted by the Municipal Plenary that could affect, directly or indirectly, energy management, the minimisation of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), or the sustainability (environmental, social or economic of the city). The Agency must issue a specific
Climate City Contract. Seville
9

validation report on the proposal, which will be mandatory and non-binding for its submission to the Plenary.

With regard to **energy management**, the Agency will aim at improving the use of local energy resources, as well as raising awareness among institutions, businesses and citizens of the scarcity of energy resources and the need for diversification and the introduction of clean energy. To this end, it is proposed:

Analyse the city's energy situation.
Develop municipal energy optimisation plans.
Plan and implement local projects that promote a more sustainable energy model.
Promote the use of renewable energies in City Council buildings and facilities and throughout the city.
Promote energy saving and efficiency measures in buildings and facilities, public lighting, urban mobility, etc.
To offer an energy information, awareness and communication service to citizens in all social spheres.
Advising, coordinating and promoting energy-related projects for the different areas, companies and municipal entities.
Encourage, promote and support projects that foster sustainable energy actions in the city.
To promote and bring together R&amp;D&amp;I tasks in companies related to the energy technology sector.

Any other activity that complements the above, in accordance with the aims and objectives entrusted to this Agency, under the terms established in the corresponding agreement of the competent municipal body. Still within the framework of energy management, the Agency's actions will focus primarily on four areas: buildings (energy certification), lighting (buildings, exterior, LED traffic lights), transport (promotion of cleaner vehicles) and energy management of municipal buildings.

Of particular significance are the basic energy saving requirements set out in Article 15 of the Technical Building Code (2006), developed in the Basic Document HE on Energy Saving: limitation of electricity demand, efficiency of thermal installations, energy efficiency of lighting installations, minimum solar contribution to domestic hot water, and minimum photovoltaic contribution to electrical energy.

With regard to the fight against climate change, as a result of Seville's adherence to the so-called Covenant of Mayors against Climate Change in 2009, the aim was to contribute to meeting the targets set by the EU for 2020, reducing CO₂ emissions by at least 20% through the implementation of a Sustainable Energy Action Plan, for which the following objectives had to be met:

Develop a baseline emissions inventory.
Implement a sustainable energy action plan.
Adapt municipal structures.
Mobilise civil society.
Submit follow-up reports.
Sharing our experiences.
Organise a Covenant of Mayors day.
Attend and participate in the EU Conference of Mayors.
Disseminate the message of the convention.

In relation to global sustainability, as a consequence of the signing of the Aalborg Charter, Seville City Council joined the European Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign (Lisbon, 1996). Later, it also ratified the Aalborg Commitments (Aalborg, 2004). These Commitments aim to raise awareness and highlight the need for local governments across Europe to act in an integrated way to address sustainability challenges. They were designed as a practical and flexible tool for action in local settings. The Commitments are designed around these ten themes:

Forms of government.
Municipal management towards sustainability.
Natural commons.
Responsible consumption and lifestyles.
Urban planning and design.
Improved mobility and traffic reduction.
Local action for health.
A vibrant and sustainable local economy.
Equality and social justice.
From local to global.

Once the 2019 GHG Diagnosis is available, and a first System of Indicators has been defined that contemplates each of the impact pathways envisaged in the Mission, the Seville Sustainability Accounting System will have to be set up. Finally, each cycle of

this process will culminate in an Action Plan, aimed at improving those Indicators that show deficits.

In terms of networks, Seville has chaired the Spanish Network of Cities for Climate since 2015, having developed numerous training and informative activities in various locations in Spain, as well as the annual assemblies. Among many other actions, the Network promotes the incorporation into the programme for the calculation and registration of the municipal HC, with support mechanisms for the different initiatives, which are then evaluated by the Spanish Climate Change Office.

Therefore, the Agency will be the entity of Seville City Council in charge of the organisation and governance of the CAP, which will integrate the PMAC, the CA 2030, and the Seville Climate Mission Plan.

|  Ecity Seville | The project proposes the development on Isla de la Cartuja of an open, digital, decarbonised and sustainable ecosystem city model in 2025, bringing the energy and climate targets set for 2050 forward by twenty-five years. With eCitySeville, we are leading the way for the sustainable cities of the future. In the field of energy, the aim is to ensure that the PCT Cartuja has a 100% renewable electricity supply, generated on the Isla de la Cartuja itself and with more efficient buildings. In addition, from the point of view of mobility, sustainable models will be encouraged, with more space for pedestrians and cyclists and promoting the use of electric vehicles thanks to a new network of charging infrastructures. All this, supported by a firm commitment to digitalisation, with a connected and autonomous system, through an intelligent electrical network (Smart Grid) that will also allow an open data platform for the intelligent management of the park.

°. It is designed to bring each recharging point as close as possible to the citizen by means of a homogeneous network in each of the 11 districts of the city, so that regardless of the neighbourhood or district where you live, you will have access to the network.
All districts will have semi-fast recharging points with a minimum of 44KW, fast recharging with a minimum of 100Kw and ultra-fast recharging with a minimum of 350Kw.

The actions and strategies of the Seville City Council's Social Innovation Master Plan are framed within the following territorial development areas:

+ Seville as a global node (International, European and National). From the point of view of the plan, this leads us to strengthen our leadership in networks such as the Cities for Climate, the Covenant of Mayors, the Seville Declaration for the Circular Economy, the Cities for Employment Network and to be a leader in Social Innovation and the social economy.

+ Seville as a regional node in Andalusia. This concerns the strengthening of the economic and territorial integration of the network of regional centres of Andalusia (its nine metropolitan areas) and, in particular, the reinforcement of the Seville-Malaga axis as the head of this network, from the point of view of innovation.

+ Seville as a metropolitan node. It is a central city with a population of around 1.5 million inhabitants, which functions as a common space from an economic point of view and which means that the development of the city cannot be understood in isolation from its metropolitan area.

+ Seville as an internal node articulating a systemic functioning towards maximum coordination between all the departments of the City Council, its municipal companies, its districts and the entire business, trade union, civil and political ecosystem.

Moving towards becoming one of the most innovative city councils in terms of administrative modernisation, with cutting-edge policies and exemplary local management. But these mechanisms and planning for social innovation must address the systemic barriers described in this Climate Agreement. For this, it will be essential:

+ Adapt the municipal structure to the needs required for the implementation of the necessary planning and concrete (often innovative) measures to combat climate change. Removing existing silos

+ Strengthening public-private partnership actions

+ Addressing the insufficiency of financial resources for mitigation and adaptation actions

+ Designing and strengthening public participation structures

+ Consolidate cooperation with academia and social NGOs.

# C-2.2: Description of social and other innovation actions

Numerous theorists assert that the attributes for a social innovation to be considered a significant practice for cities must be: novel, strategic, comprehensive or cross-cutting, effective, participatory, grounded and responsive to vulnerability, transferable, pluralistic and scalable.

Novelty: creativity and originality must be integrated, but not only in terms of the design of the innovation but also in terms of the population impacted or the territory benefited.
Strategy: the most valuable strategy is one that weakens the "economic, environmental, social, relational or political" drivers of vulnerability. It involves training, capacity building and community empowerment.
Comprehensiveness or transversality: understanding that today we must respond to accumulated urban challenges; social innovation must confront at least two major fields of vulnerability.
Effectiveness: the innovation must generate tangible impacts with its implementation.
Social participation and empowerment: innovation with spaces for actors at all stages and that strengthens links with and between the community.
Rationale and response to vulnerabilities: the significance of the practice will be greater if it is based on explicit diagnostic criteria.
Transferable: meaningful social innovation experiences should be cumulative and transferable, to the context in which they are created or to others.
Pluralism: an ideal innovation is one that does not exclude debate and diversity, but incorporates the multiplicity of interests, positions, perspectives and goes beyond the homogenisation of proposals or solutions.
Scalability: in a globalisation scenario, social innovation that involves different territorial and governmental spheres and the greatest number of public or private agents will be significant.

We understand that the examples presented in C-2.1 meet these criteria. Our Mission's Climate Action Plan will seek to respond to these requirements in all its social innovation interventions.

PERSPECTIVES AND NEXT STEPS

The present Seville Climate Agreement, as part of an iterative process of continuous improvement, will be reviewed within the next 2 years. The following are the next steps and plans in the process of reviewing and improving the Action Plan as part of the city's Climate Agreement.

+ Improvement and extension of the Economic Model: this refers to the review and adjustment of the current economic model with the aim of broadening its scope and refining its analysis so that it reflects even more accurately the ambition of the climate action plan and the capital and investment needs associated with it. This task will need to be undertaken in line with the rest of the Spanish Mission cities, especially as they have to comply with identical basic regulations in terms of budget management.

+ Specification of the initiatives and projects included in the Action Plan: this involves identifying and defining in detail the different actions, initiatives and projects that form part of the Action Plan, with the aim of ensuring their financing and adequate implementation. Likewise, in this task, co-creative work between cities seems fundamental, identifying and promoting those common actions that are most effective, supported by public-private partnerships that can strengthen the joint process of the Mission in Spain.

+ Expand interdepartmental collaboration to advance the implementation of the Climate Investment Plan: this refers to the need to promote greater collaboration between the different departments and work areas involved in the implementation of the Climate Investment Plan, in order to improve their coordination and increase their effectiveness. This internal organisation will be led by the Presidency of the Energy and Sustainability Agency of Seville.

+ Obtain specific commitments from various entities within the framework of the Climate Agreement (Letters of Accession): the aim is to increase the number of formal commitments from entities and

1

organisations within the framework of the Climate Agreement, through the signing of Letters of Accession, to support and collaborate in the achievement of the objectives and goals established in the Agreement.

+ Development of the monitoring and evaluation plan Climate Agreements: Key indicators of the CA, information collection method and monitoring reporting requirements: this refers to the development of a detailed plan for monitoring and evaluation of the Climate Agreement, identifying the key indicators to be measured, the information collection method and the monitoring reporting requirements. As noted above, the key indicators are defined, and it is essential to adapt them to the Mission's recommendations regarding the metadata tables.

+ Implementation of the monitoring and evaluation process, including communication of the plan to participating cities and guidance on data collection and reporting: this is the implementation of the monitoring and evaluation plan, including communication of the plan to participating actors and entities and guidance on how data is collected and related monitoring reports are produced.

+ Collection of baseline data on the key indicators identified in the M&amp;E plan: this refers to the collection of baseline data on the key indicators identified in the M&amp;E plan in order to establish a basis for comparison for future measurement and analysis. Again, collaboration between cities is essential in order to define a robust system of common indicators to make progress on actions in each city measurable and comparable. It is also necessary to measure the costs of inaction.

+ Analysis of benchmark indicators and degree of progress in achieving emission reduction targets: this involves analysing benchmark indicators and assessing the degree of progress in achieving the emission reduction targets set out in the Climate Agreement (climate neutrality in 2030).

+ Review of the Cities Climate Agreement based on the results of the evaluation process, including assessment of the effectiveness of the
Climate City Contract. Seville
2

monitoring and evaluation process and identification of areas for improvement: refers to the review of the Cities Climate Agreement based on the results of the evaluation process.

+ Throughout the process it will be necessary to identify and implement participatory and collaborative social innovation actions that minimise the barriers identified in this Climate Neutral Agreement.

+ The timelines below are indicative and may be modified and adapted as deemed necessary, keeping the maximum timeframe for a 2nd version of the Climate Agreement to a maximum of 2 years.

+ The tasks defined require continuous monitoring of the same, with the planned cycle of weekly meetings, incorporating the sectoral working groups that are considered appropriate for further progress in the process. Initially, as a proposal, it is considered appropriate to create four areas: transport, electricity consumption, consumption of other fuels, and waste.
