# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

# AP Summary

This first version (15SEP23) of the Action Plan (AP) of the Lemesos (Limassol) Climate City Contract is the result of a long series of consultations, public discussions, and focused workshops (September 2022 – September 2023) among city citizens, stakeholders, scientific thematic teams, city and central government political leaders and the Lemesos municipality (internal) transition team. The central coordination team was also greatly supported by the Mission City Advisor Mr. Bob D'Haeseleer, the Mission Summer School in Italy, the economic model consultant Mr. Sean Murray, Mr. Chrysses Nicolaides of the Mission Board, and professional financial consultants.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
The six facets of the transition plan

The action plan is built around objectives, principles, and methods; thematic action emission-reducing portfolios further analysed into more detailed activities and projects; innovative instruments for effective governance and citizen and stakeholder participation; and analysis of impact pathways, barriers and risks, opportunities and MEL approach including KPIs. The figure depicts the multiple facets taken into account.

The objective is for Lemesos to become climate neutral by 2030 in an inclusive, sustainable way; and its example to be useful to other cities. This will require monitoring emissions; building municipal capacity and an effective network of stakeholders; active and decisive citizen participation based on a modal shift of social attitude; sustainable and inclusive economic development; and broad knowledge transfer. It is guided by a comprehensive vision of justice, listening and realistic optimism.

The technical core of the AP was coordinated by 5+1 scientific teams mobilizing national resources who, starting from an analysis of the existing emissions situation, looked into our main emission-producing areas and emission-reducing solutions (energy production, built environment, transportation, waste, and coastal/sea). Since all solution portfolios include overlapping digital aspects, a sixth team integrated them into an additional portfolio of 'smart' solutions. The scientific recommendations were presented publicly, discussed with stakeholders, and assessed by the political city and national leadership, resulting in a large number of implementing projects and a smaller number for enactment in the next 36 months.

For implementation projects are selected based on their maturity; integration potential; scalability; social innovation and broad attractivity; cost/emissions reduction ratio; and intrinsic difficulty (for which a more lengthy and costly feasibility and technical study are required).

The graph shows the current 3-year plan 2023-26.

The political aspect of the AP is guided by three principles: keeping the stakeholders and especially citizens and SMEs positively engaged for the whole duration of the transition; maintain a positive economic development throughout for all, especially regarding jobs and small businesses; and balancing project timing for short-term versus long-term impact and visibility.

The deployment of the AP related to spatial, social and project selections. Spatially we start focusing on a central low traffic speed zone of the city, on the coastal zone, on the carenaggio district -a large, abandoned old repair yard area-, and public open spaces and buildings. Socially we start by focusing on youth and elderly, on the educated (both as allies and as possible adversaries), on the well-to-do (who produce most emissions) and the marginalized (who must not be left behind to be manipulated by climate deniers).

The main Stakeholders of the Transition are Citizens/Residents; Asset Owners; Professionals and Businesses; Financial institutions; Academia; local

and national Authorities; and social influencers.

The governance and participation model is best depicted in the figure below.

Governance and participation model

The main social participation innovation is the Lemesos Commons, the central holistic advisory body of the Transition; it expresses the integrated view of stakeholders and citizens on solutions designed by co-workshops; it consists of 25 randomly selected co-workshop 'graduates' with a six-month tenure (see Introduction Section 3.4). The main governance innovation is NZ Lemesos 2030, Inc. the multi shareholder executive branch of the Transition; initially established by the L.M. it is a broad-base shareholder company with the L.M. and other authorities holding about  $25\%$  (none more than  $10\%$ ), other institutional stakeholders about  $20\%$  (none more than  $3\%$ ), individual business about  $20\%$  (none more than  $2\%$ ) and individual citizens  $35\%$  (each up to  $1\%$ ).

Many essential projects do not have direct emissions impact but are enabling projects: observations, modelling, and digital infrastructure; co-workshops, capacity building, communication, education and training for new green jobs and SMEs; feasibility and technical studies; and MEL. Also, most infrastructure projects (bicycle lanes, electrical buses) have little impact on emissions unless they are accompanied by a modal attitude and behavioral shift. This creates a precedence circle; our way out of it is to create an impact pathway "growing spiral":

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
The "growing spiral" impact pathway

Some barriers can only be taken into account, in that we cannot do much about them: Cyprus is an island (so, for example, its electric grid is not internationally interconnected) and a third of it is under Turkish military occupation (so that many resources, including the attention of the central government, are diverted to this); similarly the existing high building density and lack of open spaces of the city is a hard fact. For other significant barriers the City with the Stakeholders can act: its own capacity; social attitude towards the climate crisis and our ability and responsibility to act; further construction; waste wasting; traffic congestion; and human resource development.

The main risks are the delay in completion of national climate plans especially regarding energy; faults in implementation timing can have cascading effects as well as public and stakeholder disillusionment; misapportioning of funding which can lead to many incomplete rather than fewer complete projects; and midterm social opposition to the Transition especially if we miss the objective of new jobs and SMEs for those affected.

The opportunities, economic, cultural and social are great for a new Lemesos, a different concept of 'development', and a society that is not just 'international' but also inclusive. As the NZ vision of Lemesos city council states:

A real threat need not lead to forced labor. Our vision is not only a clean, healthy, green and quiet city, where we can go to all our jobs and entertainment on foot or by bike in less than twenty minutes, where children will safely walk or skate to school, where the little energy needed for proper temperature will be solar-generated, where private cars will be rare. Our vision is also to reach this transformation through a completely different process: discussing, co-designing solutions suitable for our needs and enjoying it.

[...]

Lemesos of zero emissions does not have citizens who hope and wish for climate neutrality but expect it from someone else without their own, personal participation. No one says: "this is none of my business". Lemesos of zero emissions has citizens with active participation, each in a minuscule part of this huge project but also with active enjoyment of the whole of a clean, open, healthy, progressive, inclusive, green city. No one "builds windows without enjoying the view."

This is our vision for Limassol. A beautiful, collective path to a regenerative goal. With the active participation of everybody in all stages.

# Scope of this part of the AP

This document is intended as the first comprehensive non-technical introduction to the Lemesos "Climate City Contract" (CCC), which is the plan of L.M. and its partners for the Transition of the city to climate neutrality by 2030. Most of its content is included, verbatim or adapted, in the introductions of the Commitments document, the Action Plan and the Investment Plan.

It is intended for the Reviewers of the CCC (Mission, EU Commission, JRC, EIB), and along with its version in Greek for Lemesos City Council members and L.M. employees, for Transition partners and stakeholders, and the Citizens.

# 1.1 Objectives and Principles

## 1.1.1 Analysis

With its decision in January 2022 to express its interest in becoming one of the 100 NZC Mission Cities, the Lemesos Municipality (L.M.) declared that to maintain and enhance its position as a developed city it had to embrace change. Among others this means moving from fuel dependency (importing energy) to local resilience.

## 1.1.2 Central Objective

The Lemesos Municipality (L.M.) will lead the Lemesos Climate Transition (Transition), an effort by a broad spectrum of stakeholders (Section 1.2.2 below) with a dual result:

(a) That Lemesos City becomes climate neutral (net zero) by 31.12.2030 in an inclusive, and long-term sustainable way.
(b) That its example, including mistakes, will motivate other cities in Cyprus and the broader Eastern Med and Middle East towards similar objectives.

The Transition plan presented in this CCC does in fact meet the NZ goal as evidenced by the economic model analysis based on the Mission methodology and tool.

# Systemic Objectives

While

Improving Lemesos energy production and consumption, built environment, transport, waste and coastal energy efficiency towards climate neutrality, also work to:

Tackle social attitude towards climate change.
Stakeholder involvement: Listen, co-design, educate, train, interact, disseminate.
LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

6

Municipal capacity building, including augmented special regulatory frameworks.
Develop the economy inclusively attracting green investment and green jobs.
Monitor city emissions (Scope 1 &amp; 2).
Exchange practices, form alliances, scale up, and transfer.

## 1.1.3 Principles

The inclusive vision of Lemesos Transition to NZ by 2030

Do not ignore social and political objections and reality.

Just transition: Jobs lost, SMEs out of business, those left behind.

"Do no harm" principle.

Listen, listen, listen!

## 1.2 Political Will, Overall Strategy, Priorities and Focus

To achieve these objectives L.M. started communicating them to the stakeholders, drew up a flexible open master meta-plan, set up an internal Transition team from the Municipality and the Cyprus Institute (Cyl), concluded a series of collaboration agreements leading to a de facto external Transition team, successfully applied for the pilot project LC³ regarding emissions for cooling buildings, and collaboratively with the stakeholders drew the present CCC.

The basic tenets of the meta-plan are:

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The main obstacle to climate transition is not a lack of technologies, but the capacity to implement them. The Municipality by itself and as is does not have the capacity (regulatory, organizational, human, knowhow) to reach a NZC by 2030. Policies are usually set at national level and cities have little flexibility.
In 2030, unless we take drastic measures (i.e. in the "business as usual" scenario) Lemesos will have grown, will be hotter, most of its buildings will be those existing now; energy consumption, traffic and waste will grow and worsen by a lot; sea and atmosphere will be much more polluted.
For pilot projects to scale up they must involve and have the support of all stakeholders, from the international economic elite owning assets in Lemesos, to professionals earning their living from the current situation, to 'average' citizens. (By 'citizens' we refer to all people living, working, visiting or passing by Lemesos.)
Although the CCC and the NCZ goal specifically refer to the geographic area of the City of Lemesos, the plan recognizes that the City is part of an integrated Metropolitan area. Emissions flow in and out of the City; most activities affect and are affected by the whole Metropolitan area.

So the master plan specifies that while reducing GHG emissions through "ground transformations", the Transition will also include:

Monitoring city emissions by modeling, observations, data gathering and digitization in order to assess and optimize the impact of our actions
Building Municipal capacity (for designing, selecting, funding, and promoting) needed to propose, design, lead, participate in, or implement such actions
Reforming the regulatory framework regarding (a) municipal competences and (b) improve energy, building, transport, waste and coastal regulations in order to enable the City to encourage -and enforce- the changes necessary for such actions
Educating, training, interacting and disseminating within the municipality, stakeholders including professional groups, and the public in order to obtain the human resources and support needed to sustain, scale and transfer our actions
Developing Smart green financial instruments and other investment opportunities towards the CoA (City of Λεμεσός) NZC goal by 2030 and replacing imported fossil fuels and other heavy transport dependent articles.
Forming Alliances with Cypriot stakeholders, with EU and EMME cities, with the scientific community, NGOs, private and public economic actors and the civil society in order to obtain the long-term support needed for sustainability and the know-how transfer of the Lemesos experience. L.M. has an open view towards collaboration with the Metropolitan area, and will share experiences, capacities and possible funding opportunities with a coalition of the willing.

## 1.2.2 From thematic areas of emissions to mitigation projects

### Action Plan development methodology

The first analysis of the current situation was done based on thematic areas of emission production. In addition to the standard ones (Energy, Built Environment, Transportation, and Waste) it was important for Lemesos to add the Port and the Coastal area. This analysis initially undertaken by expert teams started with discussions with the relevant stakeholders in special workshops and then in co-design workshops with the City Council, the Municipality Administration, and the public. It resulted in about 30 broad mitigation Actions presented in the CCC template tables that follow; they will be implemented via several hundred projects such as the LC³ mission pilot, installation of electric cars charging stations, park (trans)formations and other microclimate interventions, participatory stakeholder co-design workshops, training for new green jobs, a variety of social innovation projects, a series of building deep retrofitting projects, an organic waste treatment factory, minimize solid waste that goes to the landfill (household shortening, pay as you throw), green energy

communities, land and sea carbon absorption NBS, and a tram line. (A concrete list of projects for 2023-26 is in Appendix I.) The thematic teams worked in weekly coordination meetings (to avoid silo mentality) along with a CCC coordination team by L.M. and the Cyl with political supervision from the City Council, scientific from the Cy.I., and organizational from the L.M. Transition Team.

The Port resembles an industrial operation, not only for the activities taking place on shore but also because moored ships use their diesel engines to produce electricity for their own use thus producing a lot of GHG emissions. The coastal area includes a narrow corridor of both land and sea and presents special opportunities, and challenges while sea breeze is a main factor defining the local Lemesos City microclimate.
L.M. concluded collaboration agreements with the Cyprus Institute, Frederick University, the University of Cyprus and the Cyprus University of Technology to lead six thematic teams. It also commissioned the Cyprus Energy Office to assist with the emissions baseline update and Deloitte Limassol to assist with the investment plan

To translate Actions into prioritized implementation Projects we used the guiding principles (Section 1.2.3), focus areas (Section 1.2.4) and project selection criteria (Section 1.4.1). Most projects and many actions benefit from the expertise and considerations of more than one thematic area.

For the first two years we expect to issue a new edition of the CCC every six months.

## 1.2.3 Guiding principles for project priorities

The first guiding principle for the Lemesos Transition priorities is to keep the stakeholders and especially the public positively engaged. Climate change mitigation and adaptation plans typically face mid-term strong social opposition; political changes often upend implementation (the Trump administration withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and the recent change in the City Administration of Sevilla are prime examples.) Involving people and organizations in the decisions and the implementation -even when the result is not the theoretically optimal- ensures completion and impact more than anything else.

To cultivate a positive social attitude towards climate change and active involvement in the Transition we include the following, which are included -at the appropriate scale- in all projects, actions, thematic areas, and the whole Transition:

Thus, the second guiding principle for the success of Lemesos Transition is to keep a positive economic balance for individuals, for businesses especially SMEs, and overall. We will ensure that during the whole Transition period not only is the overall job balance positive (i.e., more green jobs exist providing higher reward, productivity, quality, local added-value) but also (a) on a personal basis no one loses their job without multiple opportunities to get trained for and obtain a suitable and better one; and (b) no SME goes out of business without multiple opportunities to establish a suitable and better one. This is achieved through (a) the fact that projects stem from co-workshops with the stakeholders (b) detailed discussions in Lemesos Commons (c) the requirement for each project in addition to the environmental impact study to have an economic and social impact study. These will be preemptive activities agreed in detail beforehand.

Example: Activity 4 of the Transportation Thematic, namely Transport Demand Optimization will lead to a large reduction of in-city freight transport by trucks and thus a reduction of work for truck drivers who often own their vehicle thus functioning as a small business. (In a municipal meeting they already expressed their opposition to this Activity raising the specific concern.) Since Activity 1 of Transportation will lead to increase of public transportation, they can be offered the opportunity along with suitable financing and training to exchange their truck for a (percentage of a) bus and work as bus drivers. Similarly bus drivers will be offered jobs on the tram line along with suitable training.

Third guiding principle for the Lemesos Transition priorities is balanced timing: It is important to balance and combine short- and long-term actions with respect to visibility, implementation, and impact, even when they do not have an immediate climate impact or when this timing is not economically or climatically optimal.

Examples:

Electric buses (and cars) are visible and relatively easy to introduce; charging them with RE is invisible to the public and very complex (depends on the grid energy mix). Although introducing new electric buses before ensuring RE for them is not climatically optimal, it might make sense to do it for visibility and promotion of public transportation.
LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

A tram line takes a very long time to construct, a large part of it is invisible (planning, commissioning, financing), another large part is upsetting to the city life; however, has a huge long-term impact -but mainly after 2030. This is the reverse case, where impact trumps visibility.

## 1.3 Lemesos: Data, Focus, and Stakeholders

### 1.3.1 Lemesos Fundamentals

Lemesos is the second largest urban area in Cyprus after the capital, Lefcosia, with an urban population of 189600 and a metropolitan population of 248300 (CyStat 2019).

It is a fast-growing city which has developed rapidly especially within the last 10-15 years, development which resulted in a construction boom fuelled both by the tourist sector, as well as high and increasing foreign investments. It is a city on the East Med and Middle East, so it is particularly vulnerable to climate change with temperatures soaring the last years and the predictions for the years to come rather dire.

Lemesos port is the major seaport of Cyprus and therefore Lemesos is an important trade centre for the country, subsequently making the city the home of many offshore and shipping companies and thus greatly contributing to the economy of the country.

The City of Lemesos is a large fraction of the city, of 101000 inhabitants. The people who may be considered as part of this geographic area are far from homogeneous, in origin and activities. There are people who may live, work, visit, study, or just own property in the city, e.g., someone may work or study but not live in the city. Lemesos traditionally has had, except for the Greek, Turkish and Armenian communities. In the more recent years many Russians, Ukrainians, Israelis, Germans, Serbs, and others have moved to Lemesos, or spend significant amount of time there for business, vacation or just a second home. All these groups produce emissions with their activities in the city.

In terms of transportation, although Limassol is served by buses, public transportation is in generally not widely used and the percentage of usage now stands at 3% although the current goal set in 2018 was 10%.

Most of the energy consumed within the municipality limits is on buildings, especially cooling, and transport.

### 1.3.2 Geographic and Social Focus

For the next three years Transition projects will non-exclusively focus on certain geographic areas, certain social groups, and certain types of projects, as described below and in 1.4.1.

Geographic and spatial (see map): It makes technical, economic, social and communication sense to focus on certain geographic areas for the 2023-2026 planning period. The following parts of the city are currently undergoing significant changes, and as systems that are already in transition provide the opportunity to be further modified and exploited for Lemesos Transition plan. Interventions will focus on the following areas, which will be non-exclusively utilized:
#

LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
The City of Lemesos: The 30Km zone (green), the coastal zone, the port (bottom left), the carenaggio district, and several public buildings and open spaces.

The reduced traffic "30km/h" zone: the old city center (green on the map) is diverse and indicative of the shole city. It includes several public buildings, a marginalized neighbourhood, modern business office buildings, schools, churches, the central bus station and other characteristics making it ideal for integrated pilot projects ('Missionlets' below). This socially diverse zone has been decided by the City Council and will shortly become a 30 km/h maximum speed zone and it is a prime location where many pilot projects will be implemented, as it already is undergoing changes.
The coastal zone (tram line and the port): crucial for city life, central for local and foreign visitors, suitable showcase for all taking place there, it is the location for three very large, non-scalable but transferable projects: cold ironing of moored freight vessels (see Coastal Action 1), sea-based seagrass NBS (Coastal Action 4) and the Tram line (see Transportation Action 1).
The carenaggio district (Kapváyio- the old boat repair yard) A large, 1-Km abandoned, largely empty area where new innovative interventions will be developed. Old industrial area including large abandoned old buildings and boats; between the old and the new port areas.
Public spaces and public buildings: they present a broad spectrum of opportunities for emissions reduction, high visibility, social consensus, important co-benefits for citizens, surmountable though tricky regulatory issues, and funding opportunities. Public open spaces are crucial for the local microclimate especially for lowering ambient temperature and NBS (micro-forests).

Social: Involving all stakeholders and citizens is crucial throughout the Transition. However certain groups require special attention either as opportunity (the young for example) or as part of the just aspect of the Transition. Projects that target these groups and projects that they have selected (see planned project number 4 Social innovation: "Let 100 flowers bloom") will be given priority.

The priority social groups we consider and include in our stakeholders are:

The young and the old (defined as those outside main social production; combining in a

single group: the long-term 'dreamers' with the long-experience Blessed ones who want to plant trees under whose shade they will never sit, ensures the best forward-looking leverage of existing knowledge and skills for wise risk taking)

The educated (those ready to be convinced by and propose rational and scientific arguments)
The well-to-do (those producing the most emissions)
The pushed-away and left-behind (those who must benefit most from the Transition; vulnerable: affected by change, through various reasons unable to adapt without support)

These groups are potentially strong allies in the Transition effort; we do expect however significant minorities of them to oppose climate mitigation activities which is why our social innovation projects will pay special attention to them.
LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Stakeholders

Some stakeholders are authorities such as the Department of Energy or the Port Authority; their representation in the Transition is clearly resolved by the Authority hierarchy. Other stakeholders, however, are a group of people, such as the architects, the taxi drivers, or the apartment owners, who may or may not have an association or several, which may or may not actually represent them especially for issues related to the Transition. In this case we consider the group of people as the Stakeholder and their participation in the Transition is an issue to be resolved, often differently in different contexts.

‘Citizens’: Not ‘citizens’ in the legal sense, but all people who live, work, pass by, visit, own assets and in general have emissions-producing activities in Lemesos. Community (organized civil society, online influencers, and ad hoc local citizens). Residents in the city (for work and for living) and visitors (clients and tourists). They may be working in the target area and live elsewhere (including in other cities in Cyprus) or vice-versa. They represent "society-at-large". Civil society: NGO's and concerned citizens. Civil society, from environmental groups to political parties. We expect that being concerned citizens they already realize the risk of the Climate Crisis, but not necessarily in a scientifically correct way, neither have a realistic view of possible interventions.

→ Co-design and co-create the pilot activities (field and communication interventions aiming at attitude and behaviour changes)

Asset Owners: of buildings, public spaces, enterprises, the port, open spaces they constitute a special-interest group. The interventions will in general require their consent and since they might discomfort them, convincing them will be paramount.

→ Agree, co-design solutions, and allow implementation of the interventions in their properties. Post-intervention positive communal informal influencers. Ensure or acquire regulatory competence for interventions.

Professionals and Businesses (from construction, transportation, tourism, port, commerce, media, education and other services) and professional associations. Catalysts for the whole Mission as major city economic forces, co-designers of the interventions who will be called to apply them, they will need diversifying new skills. Professional opinion leaders, such as journalists and teachers.

→ Co-design and implement the interventions; provide education and training.

## Financial institutions:

→ Design and enable appropriate financial instruments.

Private businesses: They affect emissions a lot and are affected by the Transition very much. The can play a very positive role as investors and drivers of climate resilience actions or they can play a very negative role resisting the necessary changes. Including them, listening to them

Academia: Scientists/Researchers and Higher education and research institutions. Scientists in all aspects of climate science, energy, architecture, city planning etc as well as fields affected by climate change such as health and marine. They are expected to provide a broad spectrum of solutions, not always specific, practical, or economic.

→ Lead the scientific (technological and socio-psychological) aspects of the project innovation; monitor impact, including carbon footprint and attitude/behavior changes.
LIMASSOL2030
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
O

Authorities: Government and municipal agencies; Central Government agencies (e.g. Energy Dept): organizations and employees. We expect them to understand regulatory and procedural impediments and help overcome them.

So far we already see the very strong commitment of the mayor and the ity council, the incorporation of the Lemesos CCC in the new Republic of Cyprus plan for Energy and Climate, the Port Authority adopting the proposed cold ironing and climate friendliness of the Port, and the stakeholders engaged to create the related actions. The public statement of the president of Cyprus that supports the mission, and the high visibility role of the mission in events, forums and public meetings.

→ Allow the necessary experimentation at city level. Transfer the Lemesos experience to the whole country. Assist in necessary regulatory changes.

All stakeholders will participate in homogeneous co-design workshops (participants from the same stakeholder group) to get to a common understanding of the problems, reasons thereof, obstacles, and possible solutions to select based on participatory budgeting exercises and design at the detail possible given time constraints and the fact that each group has understanding of only one aspect.

To tie all workshops together and obtain a more spherical view of the problems, potential acceptable solutions a heterogenous co-workshop will be set up (see "Lemesos Commons" at the Governance section) in which participants from all aspects of the problem will discuss and codeign solutions. To include as many stakeholders as possible, and get a better overview of their opinions, the stakeholders of these workshops will be rotated.

Convincing stakeholders to participate will be a significant communication exercise, especially since we do NOT want only those who already agree and will be happy to participate. The views of the people who disagree and will be inconvenienced by the actions towards climate neutrality are particularly important and need to be considered in order to find solutions to their opposition and move towards a smooth and just transition.

Diversity and randomness of co-workshop participants greatly helps scalability as they will be used for reflexive learning: we expect to meet in the pilot most of the problems to be faced in the large scale.

## 1.3.4 Co-workshops and the Lemesos Commons

Active and impactful involvement of the Stakeholders and the Public.

(In our view the Public ('Citizens') are a stakeholder and there is no need for differentiation, but from Mission documents it seems that by "Stakeholders" often organizations are meant (e.g. we consider Architects to be Stakeholders; it seems that the Mission considers the Architect's Association as the Stakeholder; this is not hair-splitting semantics, it has to do with natural vs. legal persons, but this is not the place to discuss it.) So, we refer to "Stakeholders and Citizens" or "Stakeholders and the Public".)

Despite the general agreement about informing and involving all stakeholders and citizens in City Climate Transitions, specific methods, objectives and therefore results differ. The Lemesos Transition master plan includes two main instruments: Co-workshops and the Lemesos Commons. Their main objectives are (a) to achieve a shift in social attitude towards people becoming agents of change in the climate crisis (Appendix III) and (b) distilling collective wisdom for the Transition. This wisdom will materialize in the form of transition-advancing detailed project proposals that are well thought-out, consider multiple stakeholder concerns, are solidly grounded on science, can be socially monitored, have broad support, and deal positively and objectively with objections.

# Co-workshops: Participatory co-design solution workshops

Co-workshop methodology (protocol) has been developed in the pilot project LC³. A co-workshop is a transition-long effort by a team of 15-20 people from a single group of stakeholders (Section 1.3.3) and is in this respect only homogeneous. It is organized around one or more face-to-face 3-hour sessions and includes initial group selection and preparation, subsequent synchronous and asynchronous online communication, and long-term team building. It is guided by a Transition-trained facilitator whose role is to organize, listen, conduct the face-to-face sessions, monitor the progress, evaluate the outcome, and transfer the learning to the whole Transition arena. Each workshop has a central theme, a specific issue for consideration and solution design. The sessions are interactive with well-designed activities and a self-reflection ending in each. Experts may join parts of the physical or online interaction, especially at the beginning and for answering feasibility questions and transferring experience from beyond Lemesos. The evolving concrete outcome of co-workshops is their co-designed solutions developed. The main expected impact is the change of attitude of the participants towards Climate Change, the Municipality and their personal and collective capacity to become change agents. Both outcome and impact of co-workshops are open (may change) and long-term. Is it expected that co-workshop participation will evolve in time with some new members joining and old leaving.

# The Lemesos Commons: from solutions to projects

Around 20 experienced co-workshop participants, randomly selected from various stakeholder co-workshops, will form a heterogeneous stakeholder group, the Lemesos Commons, to review, harmonize, and integrate solutions developed from the homogeneous co-workshops. (Analyzing a problem first from one point of view by a homogeneous group and then from several points of view by a regrouped heterogeneous team is the well-known jigsaw method.) The reason for random selection is representativeness. Lemesos Commons members will commit their time for six months and then be replaced by other, also randomly selected, members from the same stakeholder group. (Each month 1/6th of Lemesos Commons members will be changed so that the change in membership is gradual.) The methodology for initial Lemesos Commons member preparation, physical sessions, synchronous and asynchronous online communication, progress monitoring, outcome evaluation, and transferring learning to the whole Transition arena is similar to those of the Co-workshops. An experienced member will act as the Lemesos Commons 'Speaker' for 6 months, representing the Commons to the Transition team, the City Council, and the broader society. The outcome of the Lemesos Commons will be transition-advancing detailed project proposals that are well thought-out, consider multiple stakeholder concerns, are based on scientific expertise, can be socially monitored, have broad support and deal positively with objections. Its authority stems from its members' social recognition, their institutionalized participation in the governance/monitoring of Transition projects, participation in the City Transition team and the Lemesos NZC 2030 organization advisory board, but mainly it is their expert and referent authority that is important, so that although they have no formal veto power, their collective opinions will be respected.

# Civic engagement: participation and challenges

Civic engagement is perhaps the major Transition action. Citizens are the main stakeholder and will be represented by random co-workshop "graduates" living/working in Lemesos, as economic actors (asset owners and users, professionals affected by or effecting the interventions), scientists and academics and political entities (government agencies and civil society). Co-design involves user engagement methods focused on collecting information from and empowering citizens to form a better understanding of their needs, through storytelling, workshops, and interactive design tools. The figure below (from LC³) presents the approach that to establish the "Limassol Commons" towards the implementation of pilot projects, their upscaling process and MEL. All this work will be accompanied by dissemination at several levels (local, national, international) and MEL.

WPP 4 GOVERNANCE
Establishing "Lemesos Commons"

There are three challenges related to citizen engagement. First is getting a representative, fair, inclusive distribution of citizen groups to participate in the workshops in physical presence (not online); for the successful implementation of this, a thorough stakeholder mapping process has been conducted. Second is conducting the workshops so that they are actually participative co-design and not "presentation - questions - vote". Third is keeping citizens engaged afterwards, in the Lemesos Commons and the interventions. The difficulty (and the pitfall) is not to select those already interested, active and concerned by the Climate Crisis, else whatever success the Transition may initially have will not be scalable.

Details matter a lot: preparing the methodology and materials for the co-workshops; selecting and training the workshop facilitators (including issues on climate and psychology); running an effective CoA campaign inviting citizens; dealing with climate deniers, political opponents of the city administration, narrow-minded interests etc.; utilizing the presence of journalists and educators; and keeping people actively engaged for a long period. But, if we do manage these, the collective narrative will actually be owned by the citizens of Lemesos.

It is important to show that political decision-making can improve the life of all in the long run, even if this would mean small sacrifice on the short term. This is based on trust building with the public.

## 1.4 Implementation: Method, Projects, Synchronization, Work Progress, Timeline

## 1.4.1 Governance and Participation

Although Governance and Participation are not the same, in our Transition Model they are closely interrelated.

Transition governance interventions relate to three fundamental aspects: 1) socially just transition for all, 2) sound science and technology and 3) effective and transparent execution. The "NZ Lemesos 2030, Inc." organization is the executive branch of the Transition, initially established by L.M. as a multi-shareholder company. L.M. politically coordinates participation instruments (co-workshops, the Lemesos Commons, the five transitions teams and the Cyprus NZ City Network) with governance instruments (NZ Lemesos 2030, Inc., EU Mission, the Cyprus Republic central government and particular authorities, and project implementation and finance.

) NZ LEMESOS 2030, Inc is a broad-base shareholder company with Lemesos Municipality and other governmental authorities holding about 25% (none more than 10%), other institutional stakeholders about 20% (none more than 3%), individual businesses about 20% (none more than 2%) and individual citizens 35% (each up to 0.1%). As a private-law public-interest company has flexibility and can accelerate project detailed design, initiation and execution (in comparison to the municipality current capacity). All views have been considered at the planning stage to avoid major obstacles. Barrier identification and dealing with opposition are key challenges to the Transition. 1) NZ Lemesos 2030, Inc increases transparency related to human and financial resources incorporation to the Transision. Equally important, the organization dumpens the effect of political change at the Municipality and the Central Government level.

) The co-workshops and the Lemesos Commons. Stakeholders and citizens engagement for co-design and co-implementation is fundamental. The Lemesos Climate Transition plan involves active stakeholder and public engagement through the Lemesos Commons. Co-workshops gather homogeneous groups to address climate issues, aiming to change attitudes. The Commons, comprising diverse participants, harmonizes solutions and proposes projects. The outcome of the Lemesos Commons will be transition-advancing detailed project proposals that are well thought-out, consider multiple stakeholder concerns, are based on scientific expertise, can be socially monitored, have broad support and deal positively with objections. These enable NZ LEMESOS 2030 to fulfill its role.

) The stakeholders Transition Arena constista of five transition teams:
the municipality (internal) transition team
the scientific (Thematic groups) transition team
the social groups transition team (including foreigners and migrants)
the political transition team (mayor and ex-mayor, local current and ex-members of the Cyprus Parliament, political parties, the media)
#

the implementation transition team (stakeholders, mainly businesses and financial institutions, who will be deeply involved in the Transition implementation)

The Arena, among others, creates strong social (and therefore political) support for controversial decisions and thus, helps in correct sequencing and timing of key projects and their upscaling (e.g., deep retrofitting, tram). In addition, the Arena could help in attracting human and financial resources.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Governance and participation in the transition model

The difference between 2 and 3 is that the Lemesos Commons (2) is more inclusive (random membership - no one left behind principle) while the Arena (3) is more selective (e.g., key scientists, institutions, and citizens). Both are needed: an individual truck driver can, by her participation in co-workshop and L. Commons have her view considered while a transportation professor can, by her participation in the Scientific transition Team and the stakeholder arena have her view considered. While not mutually exclusive, they will tend to attract different people and different discussions will take place in each. The municipality will add the political coordination and advance them to NZC Lemesos 2030, Inc. for execution.
#

LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Moreover, even though stakeholders and citizens are involved as shareholders in the NCZ 2030 Inc., they are needed in the Arena and the Commons: (a) NZC Lemesos 2030, Inc. is executive, it must act efficiently and effectively, rather than deliberate. The Arena and the Commons on the other hand are spaces for discussion, solution co-design, where bold proposals can be made without fear of risk. (b) NZC Lemesos 2030, Inc. may be economically just -within the capitalist system-, but is not socially just. (Not every family can afford a share in NZC Lemesos 2030, Inc and not every SME is willing to invest.) So, we have three qualitatively different pillars for the Transition: Commons (socially broad), Arena (expertise focused) and NZC Lemesos 2030, Inc (business-savy).

) The participation of L.M. in the EU NZC Mission, in the Network of Greek Mission Cities and the Cyprus Network of NZ Cities facilitates knowledge, skill and good practice transfer among cities. Scalability and transferability in both directions and stronger leverage towards central governments, the Mission and the EU. It leverages collective wisdom for a global problem and allows activities to be assessed on their social, economic and climate merits.
) These participation and governance innovations, briefly presented here facilitate the implementation, upscaling and MEL in the hundreds of Transitions projects ensuring that they all are effective, well-thought, transparent, and inclusive.
) The broad shareholder basis of NZ Lemesos 2030 Inc and the continuous gradual random replacement of Lemesos Commons representatives (1/6th every month for a 6-month term) ensure smooth implementation change against political changes.

These governance interventions cover six main aspects of the Lemesos Transition depicted below.

## 1.4.4 Intervention interdependencies and The Growing Spiral

The 30 actions included in the present Action Plan as designed by the Thematic Teams after the co-workshops with stakeholders and citizens are rather large and comprehensive. For their implementation several hundred sub-actions (or activities) and projects will be required. The figure below presents a first-level interdependency analysis of Action 3 (Energy Communities) by the Energy thematic team. Relevant projects are included in the 2023-26 plan under projects 8 and 9 (Local, small scale RE production, and focused RE storage and consumption) and under the Coastal thematic Action 2 (the Marina Energy Community).

Land use protection: A policy framework (micro-forestation, green spaces and trees in urban areas).

Interdependencies: where to start from?

As co-workshops develop solutions starting from the initial proposals by experts and municipality, and the Lemesos Commons reviews them from all stakeholders points of view, timing for building infrastructure, establishing the relevant policies, attracting the necessary finance and returning to the citizens for monitoring, evaluating and learning, present cyclic dependencies.

Implementation: Growing Spiral

The figures above present an example of upscaling the actions towards NZ in the city of Limassol. Systemic levers (e.g., Technology, education, governance, funding) are involved in the impact pathways towards zero GHG emissions, with socio-economic and environmental co-benefits. The example presented in Figure 2 is related to deep building retrofitting and is indicative of the process to be followed in the Transition, for non-scalable actions. To start, small projects (30 buildings) will be launched in combination with policy reforms (e.g., net zero building code), financial instruments (e.g., incentives, loans, bonds) and training (e.g., remedy, lack of professionals for deep retrofitting towards NZ, unreliable supply chains). These are the niches for shifting from the "old situation to the new". Small project implementation with be the foundation for larger-scale projects to achieve higher rates of building renovation that will support GHG emissions mitigation and neutrality.

# 1.4.5 Work Progress and Timing

In the Transition time is the critical resource. In its implementation credibility with respect to time is very important for stakeholders and citizens who are often expecting a better situation while enduring difficulties (for example while significant infrastructure projects are implemented).

Critical path methodology

To achieve NZ in the city of Limassol, about 30 actions will be implemented, each involving dozens of activities to be implemented by hundreds of projects, large and small. The Transition requires a complex project management scheme, with very strict timing to achieve NZ by 2030. Critical point identification is essential for sound management of the CCC (and chaos management! E.g., X curve). The chart provided gives an example of our approach to managing the work for Lemesos NZ. It presents the CCC work approach for identifying and managing critical points during project implementation.

Example: deep retrofitting requires technical projects (e.g., pilots), legislative revisions, professional training, and funding schemes, tailored to the citizens of Limassol. In addition, the projects are interrelated and interact with the other actions / objectives of the CCC (e.g., green infrastructure, tram line). Moreover, several projects of the CCC will be upscaled (e.g. retrofitting) while others will be linear (e.g., construction of the tram line).

An example of a critical point (in the renovation case) is identified at the point after the implementation of the pilots. Upscaling deep retrofitting of buildings in Limassol, which is key to NZ, is linked to the success of the pilot projects, updating current legislation, and creating a favorable financial setting for citizens to proceed with deep renovation. In addition, citizens' approval of such projects is required, which is linked to the success of the "Limassol Commons", our civic Transition institution. Large-scale building renovation in reduced time interacts with other construction projects (e.g., tram and green infrastructure), so, critical path identification is essential for Transition management at the macro and micro levels.

# Work Progress and Plan

NZC Mission EoI (January 2022)

Lemesos Municipality (L.M.) embarked on a transformative journey by expressing its keen interest in formalizing and integrating its commitment to sustainability and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Prior to this, the city had pursued sustainability through various studies and rather disconnected environmental protection policies, plans, and projects. This expression of interest marked a pivotal moment in channeling the city's economic development towards a more sustainable future.

Lemesos accepted in NZC Mission (April 2022)

By April 2022, L.M.'s application was accepted, setting in motion the city's focused efforts to enhance its Municipal Capacity Building, with a specific emphasis on climate resilience and the following results and plans.

Establishment and operation of the internal Transition Team (May 2022 - today)

The city established a Climate Transition Team from various municipal departments, the Mayor and city counselors, and the Cyprus Institute (CyI) as the city scientific advisor to lead and coordinate its climate sustainability activities. This team plays a crucial role in coordinating and guiding L.M. towards its climate resilience goals.

L.M. entered into a collaboration agreement with the Cyprus Institute (CyI), a significant step towards forging partnerships and leveraging scientific expertise in the pursuit of sustainability.

Engagement with Stakeholders and Citizens (June 2022 – today)

L.M. recognized the importance of involving stakeholders and citizens in the sustainability journey. Effective communication and meetings have been held to garner input, feedback, and support from the community.

Pilot Project Application (September-November 2022)

In the latter part of 2022, a pilot project application brought together various stakeholders, including the municipality, CyI, Cyprus University of Technology (CUT), ETEK, and Friends of the Earth (FoE). This collaborative effort aimed to develop a proposal that highlighted the essential components needed to establish the Climate Change Committee (CCC).

Formation of Thematic Teams and collaboration agreements (February 2023)
#

LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

In February 2023, thematic teams were formed, marking a critical step in the structured approach towards sustainability. These teams would focus on specific areas crucial for achieving sustainability goals.

Public thematic workshops were conducted, involving stakeholders and citizens. These workshops provided a platform for collaborative discussions and idea-sharing, further strengthening the city's sustainability framework.

City Advisor's Visit and Presentation to City Council (March 2023)

In March 2023, the City Advisor Project Week played a pivotal role in refining the city's sustainability strategies.

A week-long visit by the City Advisor provided valuable insights and expertise. It included discussions with the Mayor, city counselors, and Municipality staff, the thematic teams as well as online meetings with other Mission staff. Following this, a presentation was made to the City Council followed by a discussion to gain support and approval for the climate initiatives.

Central government support (April 2023)

In April 2023, a conference was held to garner support from Cyprus Republic leadership, including the President of Cyprus, who publicly declared his support for Lemesos Mission, followed up by a decision to include it as a separate chapter in the National Energy and Climate plan.

Success of the Lc3 pilot project – Bootcamp – Kickoff (April – September 2023)

During this time, the Lc3 proposal was deemed successful, signifying progress towards sustainable practices. The 'bootcamp' process was very useful for the whole project team.

The grant agreement was signed in July (official start of the project June 1) with an online kickoff in July,  $\sigma$  in-person kickoff in September.

Milano Summer School (June 2023)

Two members of the Transition team attended the Milano summer school, very useful for drawing up the CCC.

Commitments document and Action Plan version 1 (30 June 2023)

The first version of the Action Plan and commitments document were developed by the thematic teams in cooperation with Municipality staff, City political leadership, stakeholders and citizens through workhops.

Cyprus Network of NZC Cities: (July 2023)

L.M. established the Cyprus Network of Net-Zero Carbon (NZC) Cities, establishing its place within a broader sustainability network.
LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Open Workshops and Investment Plan: (July-August 2023)

In July 2023, open workshops engaged city council members, municipality employees, and stakeholders in discussions about the Action Plan. This collaborative effort paved the way for the development of an Investment Plan in August 2023, which involved thematic teams and the CCC coordination team.

CCC Adoption and Signing: September 2023

September 2023 marked a significant milestone as the city's mayor, city council, and central government formally adopted and signed the Climate Change Committee (CCC), cementing their commitment to sustainability.

The period from October 2023 to March 2024 an acceleration in Lc3's efforts will take place, including the expansion of the Transition Team and intensification of Municipal Capacity Building. LM Transition team with full-timers. This phase involves extensive public consultation through co-workshops, that will lead to the development of the second version of the CCC. Feedback from CCC v1 will be incorporated, and by March 15, 2024, the CCC v2 will be submitted.

This cycle of progress will be repeated in September 2024.

Next CCC versions

We plan to establish a CCC MEL mechanism which will:

(1) Create a detailed (civil-engineering project-like) plan
LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

(2) Record progress, delays, mistakes, and good practices
(3) Produce a minor CCC revision every September and a major revision every March (until March 2031 which will conclude the 2022 – 2030 Lemesos Climate Transition)

# 1.5 Barriers, Opportunities, Risk Analysis

# 1.5.1 Emission sources, solutions and barriers

Main sources of emissions in Lemesos, from our baseline (2018 emissions):

Buildings for cooling (scope 2)

The urban heat island requires artificial cooling for living and working spaces; the current straightforward way for this is individual space air conditioning (A/C), which uses fossil fuel produced electricity, exacerbating the problem into a vicious circle.

Mobility and transportation (scope 1)
Buildings for heating and other (scope 1 and 2)
Waste management (approx. 80% of MSW goes to the landfill).

# Basic solutions:

Reduce the urban island effect (reduce ambient city temperature by 3-4 degrees, utilizing open spaces, sea breeze, road and roof surfaces, shading and colors).
Smartly retrofit buildings.
Produce and ensure consumption of RE.
Reduce motorized mobility.
Electrify transportation with RE
Minimize the amount of MSW ending to the landfill (e.g., household shorting of organic)

Main barriers and corresponding solutions/opportunities:

# Internal barriers

The municipality itself (regulatory competence; human resources; organizational; attitude); and the competent national authorities in general who must become part of the solution -not of the problem, as they often are now.

$\rightarrow$  Municipal capacity building; regulatory sandbox; "Lemesos Mission 2030" organization
The current city plan.
The city was never designed /built for the currently and new expected temperatures; many of the mitigating factors half a century ago no longer apply (smaller density, more open areas, more green, less traffic, more paved space, demand for outdoors cooling). There are now fewer, more difficult, drastic, and expensive solutions, and Lc3 will pilot some. Moreover, under the current regulatory framework the City does not have sufficient jurisdiction; but even if
LIMASSOL2030

it did, social and economic forces make climate positive land use very difficult, since the value of land for "development" (i.e., more building) is very high and the consequent strong interests from various groups.

Social attitude (lack of collective culture/attitude/behavior); stakeholder knowledge, attitude and will; Myopic special interests; fear of the unknown; Comfort zone
→ Co-workshops; Lemesos commons (see Section 1.3.2)
See Section 4.2 second priority guiding principle.
Financial (myopic greed; fear of risk; distrust of long-term)
See Investment plan.
Human resources (Quality &amp; Quantity)
→ Educate and training programs; educate-at-scale.

# External barriers:

Cyprus being an island and the fact that a large part is under Turkish military occupation renders (a) supply chains unreliable and expensive and (b) international and EU electric grid interconnection very difficult, expensive and subject to difficult regional politics.
Time (changes of this magnitude in such a short time happen only in times of war)
→ Must create a feeling of emergency socially.
Invisibility of emissions and long-term catastrophic result.

No direct benefit of city-only emissions reduction, since under all scenarios Lemesos, located in the Eastern Med and Middle East, will be getting hotter due to climate change, more so than the global average (eg.  $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  global will be  $3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  regional, ref Zittis etal). An additional (social and psychological) challenge from such barriers is that it aggravates feelings of helplessness.

→ Need to tune the communications campaign: focus on heat and public health instead of GHG; on sea pollution instead of seagrass; on personal money savings instead of social energy savings); balance motivators (personal job opportunities; ...) and restrictive/prohibitive measures (parking; traffic; building property transfer) Also highlight adaptation to climate change. A microforest or the unification of green spaces will act towards cooling the city and allow people enjoy the city, even if there is a 3 degrees increase by 2050.

# 1.5.2 Opportunities

Opportunities are related to structural and other funds that are actively involved in several large projects in Cyprus (e.g., the building industry, RE, Shipping), the financial sector in the island which is a strong part of the national economy (deposits, investments), there are top ranked universities and research centres that include experts in all the thematic cpmponents that are related to the transition. The port and the coastal front of Lemesos are huge assets (nationally and internationally). The NZC mission and the EU regulations/strategies (eg Green Deal, Waste, One Health) favour the actions that are linked to the transition, many of which are national obligations towards the EU (e.g., applying the waste management directive). Another important opportunity lies in the establishment of Lemesos NZC 2030, Inc, which will support the municipality for the implementation of the actions related to NZ. Finally, the size of Cyprus is small in comparison to other EU countries (and could be comparable to a small district of Italy), which has the advantage of personal connections to important stakeholders.
LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

There will be also ample job and entrepreneurial opportunities by the Transition. The main challenge is that these are not by definition equally distributed, so extra care will be given to foresee and act early.

# 1.5.3 Risk analysis

The main implementation risk, integral to the central objective of the Mission is the overall time frame 7 years. Such huge changes task place in decades if not generations -except during wars or revolutions. The shorter the time available, the more innovation and risk are necessary, which means that the probability that they will be ineffective or unattractive is higher.

More specific implementation risks relate to

unreliable global supply chains, especially for an island.
Limited know-how, available personnel and regulatory competences inadequate.
The possibility of degeneration of co-workshops (from workshops to lectures, from co-design to voting) and the Limassol Commons (partisanship).

Social risks:

Cypriot society is particularly conservative.
A significant minority of the population (cf anti-vaccine movement) is not convinced by scientific arguments.
Failure in appeasing those hit by the Transition and especially providing opportunities for jew jobs and SMEs

Financial risks

Attracting sufficient capital in a period when several cities with greater credibility will be competing for capital for the same purposes.
The global economic situation, including EU inflation is a significant financial risk.

Political risks:

Climate mitigation/adaptation becoming a partisan issue.

Scientific risks

Carbon monitoring for a city like Lemesos municipality (small) is especially difficult given the lack of data.

# 1.6 Impact and KPI's

# 1.6.1 Impact pathways

The Transition will monitor, evaluate and learn from changes in three fields:
LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Social - psychological - human: understanding; shifting attitude.
Emissions: actual and potential.
Side effects: Balance positive and negative.

# Economic analysis:

a. Climate change - adaptation: apply the di lampedusa principle
b. from Fuel dependency to local resilience. Cyprus currently spends the largest amount of imports for energy. Closing the sink through which capital is flowing out of the local community for the import of fossil fuels, and other heavy transport dependent articles for which alternatives of equal standards are available.

The prevented capital drain, will be used as a threefold leverage: as a social lever (creating direct benefits for vulnerable households), a financial lever (to attract external capital upscaling climate action), a practical lever (e nabling project with a more complex business case - planting trees)

# 1.6.2 Key Performance Indicators

# KPIs management plan

For the NZ Lemesos 2030 Actions implementation, a KPI management plan will be followed. The plan is crucial for ensuring that the progress (or lack thereof, or regress) towards the strategic goals can be effectively tracked and measured. The principles of the approach for the KPIs plan are provided in the table below. Additionally, the philosophy for generating KPIs is provided below. Each of the Actions (see section B of the AP) includes indicators for managing activities and their related projects. The KPI management plan will not be static; it will evolve with transition's changing goals and priorities (and according to MEL). By following a structured plan, the mission could effectively measure, monitor, and manage KPIs to improve and learn from the process.

KPIs development and management plan

|  Steps | Comments  |
| --- | --- |
|  Clear Objectives | Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). (E.g., Electrify public transportation by 2031 to reduce GHG emissions from the transportations sector by 20%).  |
|  A KPI for each objective | Measure progress. (e.g., % of the buses electrified per year).  |
|  Targets | Indicate what success looks like (Targets and benchmarks). Challenging but realistic (e.g., 35% of buses are electric by 2025)  |
|  Data Collection and Sources | The data sources (accurate, reliable) for each KPI.  |
|  Frequency of Measurement | Some KPIs may need real-time monitoring, e.g., traffic in a pilot transportation project while others may be assessed on a monthly, quarterly, or even annual basis.  |
|  Data Analysis and Reporting Visual Representation MEL | A process for analyzing the collected data and generating reports accessible to relevant stakeholders. Data visualization tools/dashboards.  |
|  Thresholds and Alerts | Implement threshold values for KPIs (set up alert systems).  |

## KPIs for the transition

### Rational for KPIs development

KPIs involve those directly related to GHG emissions mitigation or avoidance which could be actual or potential from upscaling. For instance, a successful pilot project related to deep retrofitting, where GHG emissions mitigation is accurately determined (actual) could be upscaled and the emissions mitigation is estimated (potential). Crucial for the transition is to set a process (using KPIs) that evaluates in what degree mistakes are realized, understood, explained, and learned how to avoid. Since the transition is tightly linked to changing citizens' views and practices KPIs should involve the social (attitude shift) dimension and additionally focus on inequality ("no one left behind"). Economic and financial aspects should be incorporated and monitored, such as citizen participation; smart financial instruments; competitive funding; green Jobs created; unemployment reduction and/or avoidance.

The KPIs should be used for monitoring and evaluating implementation; the timing of implementation (actual vs. planned) is important; funds absorbed; scalability and transferability; project failed or stalled (and why).

In general, KPIs need to be employed to monitor the following two dimensions of the transition:

(a) whether what was planned is being implemented and
(b) if the impact from what has been implemented is according to what was expected in the Transition plan

## KPIs for different thematics of the transition

GHG Emissions (CO₂eq and individual GHGs)

Yearly baseline for previous year: emissions from sectors (Energy, Buildings, Transport, Waste, Port).

Yearly emissions reduction from each of the Actions proposed.

Energy

Monitor the national grid mix (change by 2030 to reduce the emission factor): % of diesel, natural gas, RE.

Compared to the national grid, how much better is the RES electric energy used in Lemesos.

Built Environment

Sq meters being deeply renovated and % use of energy in class A-B buildings.

Heat island effect reduction after NBS for urban regeneration.

In sections B-3.1 and B-3.2 there are numerous indicators that were developed by the thematic teams, for monitoring the proposed Actions/activities/projects. Some of them, could be employed as KPIs while additional KPIs could be developed, based on what is presented in the above paragraphs. In Table B-3.1. for instance, there are KPIs [e.g., Grid emissions factor (tCO2eq/MWh)] where target values are also provided (e.g., EF  $\rightarrow$  0.5 for 2025 and 0.285 for 2030). These will be capitalized for KPIs management and monitoring. Indicators metadata are also provided in B-3.2., following the SMART (Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) approach.

# 1.6.3 Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) is a crucial framework employed Lemesos Transition, to assess the effectiveness and impact of action portfolios, actions, projects, and initiatives. Briefly, it represents a systematic and iterative approach to gather data, track progress, and make informed decisions related to the NZC Lemesos mission. MEL will help the municipality, the stakeholders, the citizens to understand not only what is working well but also what needs improvement, facilitating evidence-based decision-making.

It encompasses a continuous cycle of data collection, analysis, and interpretation, allowing for the identification of successes and challenges while supporting the revisions of the CCC.

Moreover, MEL places a strong emphasis on learning from experiences (Lemesos Commons, Co-Workshops, storytelling), enabling all the actors to adapt and refine their strategies, ultimately enhancing their ability to achieve their goals/KPIs and contribute positively (not necessary successfully). MEL could be imagined as a compass, guiding Lemesos NZ journey toward effectiveness, efficiency, and impact.

# 1.7 Side effects and other issues

Reducing emissions of climate-warming pollutants (GHGs) (and consequent results such as lower ambient temperature) have many other co-benefits, many of those related to people's health. These health benefits have been widely described, and in fact the IPCC has stated that mitigation strategies, when properly implemented, can have significant beneficial impacts on public health. In Cyprus specifically, on-going preliminary studies are showing correlation of extreme temperatures with increased mortality in susceptible populations (65 y.o. and above), and this will most likely increase as the years progress and in a business as usual scenario.

Some of the most relevant benefits of GHGs reduction come from reductions in air pollution, however some climate-warming agents (such as ozone and black carbon) are also important air pollutants associated with negative health effects. Therefore, reductions in GHG emissions are often linked to reductions in these disease-causing air pollutants, which increase many pathologies such as cardiovascular diseases, allergies, asthma, lung or skin cancer and may even affect the mental development of children.

Various actions developed within the action plan of the Limassol CCC, especially from the transport and mobility, built environment as well as coastal and sea thematics, aim at reducing GHGs emission by increasing green public spaces, expand the pedestrian network, promote micromobility, combat the heat-island effect positively, and create a 15 minute city. These type of actions have a great positive impact on human health by increasing physical activity, fostering social contact, and providing opportunities to enjoy natural environments. These healthy behaviours have been reported to reduce mortality, but also mortality risk of serious diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular problems and depression.

The health co-benefits are particularly important as they can be also translated to productivity (gained or lost) of the active population, which in a city such as Limassol (important for trade, with industries etc) represents a high percentage of the total population.

Citizens and Stakeholder engagement: Co-workshops and the Lemesos Commons

Short description: Hundreds of participatory co-design solution workshops (see 1.3.4) will be conducted throughout the Transition with citizens (2023-30) and stakeholders on specific issues affecting them in order to design solutions that take into account all views. The Lemesos Commons will review projects proposed and comment before the City Council and NZ Lemesos 2030 Inc. start implementation.

The pilot Lemesos City Cooling Challenge Lc3

Short description: Already approved and started Mission Pilot project (2023-25) focusing on reducing cooling needs by dealing with Urban Heat Island effect; reducing energy needs for cooling buildings by 'smart' interventions; and reducing emissions by producing local RES electricity.

Transition to Green jobs and Green SMEs

Short description: The tremendous emerging job and business opportunities that the Transition will cause in the city will not automatically be available to people and SMEs negatively affected by it. Medium and long-term planning and implementation for education, training, skills and attitudes along with regulatory and financial provisions will ensure positive economic outlook for all.

Social innovation: "Let 100 flowers bloom."

Short description: 10 yearly projects x 30K€ x 3 years. Dozens of small bottom-up social innovation projects proposed by citizen groups, stakeholders such as schools, neighbourhoods etc will be designed with the help of L.M. and NZ L 2030 Inc., and implemented by the proposers with financial and managerial support from L.M. The purpose is (1) to test scalability and (2) to keep citizens active in supporting the Transition through what concerns them most.

Maturation of tough or risky projects:

A few projects present unique difficulties, risks or uncertainties. Including them in or excluding them from the Lemesos Transition plan is a decision that cannot be taken without a significant feasibility and detailed technical study that will reveal specific barriers, costs and assess timing and benefits.

# 5.2. Tram line (coastal)

Short description: Feasibility study. Lemesos coastal topography is ideal for a tram line crossing the city which would, additionally to an excellent public transportation means allow the large number of passenger cars from other cities reaching the city center for work to park-charge-n-ride. It would be a significant expense (order of 200M€) and requires an extensive technical and economic feasibility study.

Building stock: Near-zero energy buildings

# 5.3. Large scale building retrofitting (Stage 3)

Short description: Detailed technical study

Retrofitting buildings at a rate that will allow NZ from this sector presents difficulties that have not been overcome anywhere. Suitable work force, material supply chains and financing will fail us. A detailed study is needed if we are to accelerate and aim at a retrofitting rate more than  $4\%$  annually (deeper green color in the chart).

# 5.4. Large-scale RES storage and consumption

Short description: Preliminary technical study

Currently the bottleneck in RES is the national grid. For Lemesos to become NZ by 2030 a much larger percentage of RES must be produced and consumed. Storage and focused consumption (such as for cold iron at the port, energy communities, EV charging with favorable terms but unpopular timing are some of the solutions that the study will examine.

# 5.5 Sea as a Carbon Sink: Posidonia Oceanica

Short description: Preliminary technical study

Posidonia oceanica, an endemic seagrass in the Mediterranean Sea plays a significant role in carbon sequestration and sinking (blue carbon). Posidonia oceanica has the capacity to store vast amounts of carbon in the root system called 'matte' for centuries to millennia, a feature that sets it apart from several terrestrial ecosystems considered to be efficient in carbon storage. Posidonia oceanica seagrasses sequester  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  at a much faster rate than tropical forests and can store the carbon for much longer periods (Pergent-Martini et al., 2021). A study using high-resolution seismic reflection imaging estimates that the carbon stock stored in matte is  $15.6 \pm 2.2$  million t C_org (Monnier et al., 2021). The purpose of the study is tuantifying the precise amount of carbon sequestration and sinking by Posidonia oceanica which requires dealing with factors such as regional variability, site-specific conditions, and methodological limitations in measurements.

# 5.6 Non-solar local RES production

City micro-forests - NBS
Short description: Micro-forests (urban mini-forests or pocket parks) will be compact green spaces, meticulously designed and cultivated within the Lemesos urban landscape, to serve as vital ecological oases. Micro-forests not only enhance urban aesthetics but also provide ecosystem services (improve air quality by absorbing pollutants, C sequestration, mitigate the urban heat island effect, and support biodiversity).

Digital Twin and related (public, open) city for-climate repository
Short description: Expand and enrich the online integrated digital platform "Portal for hERItage buildingS") that aims to stimulate deeper city regeneration activities regarding energy retrofit of existing building stock to contribute to the need for climate resilience communities by contributing to overcoming the challenges of the building industry and the management of our built environment:
Deal with authorities lack of Data (that would enable them to have knowledge of change, in time); and Tools (that would allow them monitoring and visualising the built environment, a capacity that would empower better interpretation of the city's complexity).

Professionals lack of Data (due mostly to the lack of interdisciplinary know how, its higher cost and labour of production of these specialized type of data). Owners' lack of Incentives, guidance for renovation, appreciation for the cultural value of heritage.

## 14. Scale and Transfer: Greater Lemesos; Cyprus NZC network

Short description: Feasibility studies and communication. Lemesos has an open view towards collaboration with the Metropolitan area, and will share experiences, capacities and possible funding opportunities with a coalition of the willing, starting with the Cypriot cities that applied to the Mission (network already established), extending to the municipalities in Metropolitan Lemesos, and then to other Mediterranean coastal cities.

## 15. Emissions monitoring

Short description: Beyond just modelling, actual emissions monitoring at the level of a medium-size city is particularly challenging. Methodology: 1. Downscale the national emissions from the National Inventory Report to the city scale by taking into consideration the population and activities of Limassol. 2. When more precise data on the city of Limassol becomes available, such as building efficiency, energy consumption, and traffic counts, a bottom-up approach can be used to calculate the city's emissions and find efficient ways to reduce them. 3. utilize remote sensing methods as a better representation of urban metrics, and emission fluxes could be deployed for the case of the Limassol city towards the validation and correction of the compiled emission inventories, complementary to the use of other pollutants (e.g., CO) as proxy components for GHG spatialization. This methodology can be applied in the net-zero city emissions inventory as a validation method after the establishment of the baseline inventory

## 16. Smart green financial instruments

Short description: Design and promotion

Green smart financial instruments will be designed in collaboration with and perhaps launched by the end of Lc3 will cover longer-term financial viability along with L.M. services which can undertake some of the maintenance cost.

## 1.9 Annex II: Short presentations of the thematic area Actions

## 1.9.1 Energy

The energy sector is fundamental not only for the transition but for urban sustainability. The portfolio of actions includes the following:

Reduction of GHG emissions due to change in electricity production mix to 2030

This action is beyond the control of the municipality, but it is significant. Cyprus will undergo a rapid expansion of its PV installed base in the next few years (leading up to 2030) and replace HFO and diesel use in power generation with Natural Gas. This will significantly lower the emissions factor for scope 2 emissions and has cascading effects on all measures that rely on grid electricity.

Install a large-scale photovoltaics park and establish an energy community

Establish of energy community (Figure 5) within the municipality of Limassol by engaging various stakeholders and citizens. The energy community will consist of a large-scale PV park and energy storage technologies, aiming to satisfy the energy demand of end users and make considerable GHG savings.

# 3. Install a 200kWth Fresnel system to provide Industrial process heat

Fresnel systems utilise solar energy and can provide heat at low and mid temperatures. Therefore, they can become an alternative option for supplying clean energy to commercial and industrial facilities.

# 4. Renewables in residential buildings with behind-the-meter storage (with built environment)

Install photovoltaics at residential buildings in Limassol with behind-the-meter storage systems. This action will turn citizens into prosumers and reduce electricity consumption from the grid significantly. In addition, installation of storage units will further increase energy autonomy.
LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Install heat pumps at commercial and residential buildings (with built environment)

Heat pumps are the most efficient technology for thermal generation. They can be used to provide heating (including hot water) and cooling in buildings. These units can replace boilers or other conventional technologies and reduce carbon emissions significantly.

Centralised RES generation and long-term storage to satisfy increased demand from Mission actions.

This action proposes the installation of a hybrid RES system that consists of a large PV and wind park, coupled with Long-Term Energy Storage (LDES). The primary goal of this action is to satisfy the increased demand in electricity that arises from actions taken for Lemesos Mission, including elevated demand for EVs and heat pumps.

## 1.9.2 Built Environment

Limassol is a European Southern Coastal city with increasing tourism trends and a high carbon footprint. The building stock is responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, as many buildings are old and inefficient. Currently, no established measures are available to monitor the city's performance, and professional practice has only recently integrated environmental assessment schemes for promoting high-performance buildings. Moreover, construction companies, particularly small and medium enterprises, lack competence in high-performance building construction. In addition, there is a lack of local companies that can produce needed high-performance materials and components, resulting in a strong dependence on imports.

Furthermore, several open spaces of the city, car parks, bus stops, and pavements are planning and private development leftovers or neglected spaces, which result in unattractive, often unsafe, and uncomfortable, especially to cope with heat stress during the summer period, and as a result they tend to prevent social interaction.

Achieving carbon neutrality will require a significant reduction in GHG emissions from the building stock. In this regard, a deep renovation of the existing building stock is needed. It requires a structured integration of energy-efficient technologies, renewable energy sources, and behavioral change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainability. By employing a multi-faceted framework encompassing policy interventions, financial incentives, stakeholder engagement, and public awareness campaigns, this action aims to transform Limassol into a low-carbon city, setting an example for other coastal cities.

To successfully achieve this goal, it is also imperative to act as an urban regeneration by redeveloping, enhancing, and embellishing urban open spaces to promote a more extended use of outdoor spaces and walkability. Solar energy production and natural carbon offsetting through nature-based solutions have to be integrated into open areas to (a) improve microclimate and hence the outdoor thermal comfort perceived by citizens, (b) showcase small local networks of renewable energy production, and (c) improve aesthetics, walking/cycling conditions, by exploring how climate-aware design, energy efficiency, energy management as well as the integration of renewable energy generation in the existing urban fabric result to significant urban energy savings and GHG emissions reduction, through a whole new urban planning that will allow the city of Limassol to grow in a sustainable way.

Also, constructing new carbon-neutral buildings promotes climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. It incorporates energy and resource-efficient design principles, aiming to enhance occupant health, well-being, and productivity while avoiding carbon lock-in risk. Adopting sustainable technologies, improving infrastructure systems, and integrating innovative solutions lay the groundwork for a sustainable and low-carbon built environment, setting the stage for long-term sustainability and environmental impact reduction.

# 1.9.3 Mobility - Transportation

Mobility and transportation portfolio of actions involves projects that aim to the direct GHG emissions mitigation (e.g., electrification+RE), as well as targets to significant improvements to urban quality of life and public health protection, via reduction of traffic in Lemesos. The portfolio of actions includes:

Implementation of public transportation strategies
LIMASSOL2030
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
O

Development of an integrated public transport network (including infrastructure) with multiple modes of transportation, by optimizing the routes to improve efficiency and providing real-time passenger information and ticketing technology, while also establishing multimodal transportation hubs and promoting the implementation of bus prioritization measures.

Strategies enhancing micro-mobility modal split
Prepare an integrated network of bike lanes and paths for all types of cyclists that integrates micro-mobility solutions such as e-scooters and bike-sharing programs into the transportation network, while also expanding bike parking facilities at key locations throughout the city and collaborating with local businesses and organizations to offer incentives for cycling and micro-mobility use, such as discounts or rewards programs.

Development of comprehensive pedestrian network
Develop and implement a comprehensive pedestrian network with adequate infrastructure and facilities to ensure safe and convenient access throughout the Municipality, while also prioritizing pedestrian-oriented streetscape improvements, pedestrian-friendly paths and establishing pedestrian zones in key commercial and residential areas.

Establishment of vehicle electrification strategies
Advance the electrification of private vehicles by increasing Municipality's preparedness via the construction of charging stations in public spaces, commercial centers, and residential areas and implementing smart charging systems to manage peak energy demands using renewable energy sources, while also integrating charging infrastructure in urban planning and collaborate with private companies to install charging stations in their parking lots or garages, while also including the conversion of bus fleet to electric.

Strategies improving the efficiency of freight transportation
Encourage the use of low-emission vehicles for freight transport but mostly consolidating freight shipments to reduce the number of trips and provision of incentives to private companies to switch to sustainable freight transportation, whilst improving the efficiency of last-mile delivery (e.g., using cargo bikes, electric vans) and implementing a smart logistics system to optimize transport routes and reduce emissions at the Municipal level.

Optimization of transportation demand (TDM strategies)
Develop a comprehensive transportation demand management plan that implements traffic management strategies that aim to regulate (or restrict) vehicle-access, by disincentivizing private vehicle use through the introduction of parking management schemes, traffic calming measure, while also incentivizing the use of sustainable transportation modes (such as walking, cycling, and shared transportation modes) and developing compact, mixed-use neighborhoods that promote walking and cycling as primary modes of transportation.

Incorporation of smart technologies in sustainable transportation strategies
Implement actions that use smart technologies. For example, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to monitor traffic and adjust traffic signals, integrate traffic data with public transportation schedules to improve transit connections and uses ITS to optimize freight logistics and reduce emissions. Also, implement Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) by providing online trip planning tools that include public transportation, bike-sharing, car-sharing, and ride-sharing options, cooperative connected and automated mobility (CCAM) services, mobile payment systems for public transportation and parking and provision of on-demand ride-sharing services for commuters and people with disabilities in order to build a holistic cyber-physical system.

# 1.9.4 Waste

Sustainable municipal solid waste (MSW) management is a challenge for Lemesos municipality, and Cyprus. The country falls behind EU targets that are linked to circular economy. Despite the efforts to improve waste management, a large fraction of organic waste is still landfilled, resulting in increased GHG emissions. In addition, there are still many active dumping grounds which need restoration (and release toxic substances to air, soil and water). Lemesos municipality annual MSW production is estimated to 66539 tons (approx.  $11\%$  of the country), from which 54176 tons go to treatment facilities, with the major quantity possibly landfilled, despite the efforts for sustainable treatment (e.g., energy production by RPF - Refuse derived Paper and plastics densified Fuel). An estimated  $40\%$  (of 54176 tons) is the organic fraction, which is mainly landfilled. The GHG emissions that are associated to the collection and treatment of MSW are estimated at 49842 tCO2eq/year, mainly linked to landfill emissions (estimated by the life cycle of a landfill). There is potential to minimize the emissions (and related environmental impacts) by Action 1) Waste segregation (in house/in bussiness) to remove organic waste for energy and

fertilizer production and Action 2) Applying Zero waste production (circular economy) principles in Lemesos. These two actions however are linked to stakeholder and citizen engagement (e.g, incentives, education and training).

For the first action, the target is to separately collect organic waste (e.g., household, restaurants, bakeries) at the household and company levels and divert them in existing energy production facilities (e.g., anaerobic digestion and electricity generation), in proximity to Lemesos. Limassol and Pentakomo treatment plants use anaerobic digesters to process organic waste, generating biogas for energy production. This action will contribute to reducing the emission factor from the landfill, which is among the highest in the EU due to the high organic load. According to our estimations, separate collection of organic waste to produce energy and fertilizer leads to  $83\%$  reduction of the GHG emissions related to MSW management in Lemesos. Initials steps (feasibility study) could be also conducted for the design of a waste to energy facility in Lemesos, supporting the existing infrastructure and the national targets for waste management and GHG emissions reduction. The second action capitalizes the outcomes of Action 1, to go one step further to remove all the recyclable materials in the MSW (e.g., plastic, metals, textile, inert). Additional removal of recyclable (biodegradable) material could increase the reduction up to  $90\%$ . This will also lead to zeroing the amount of (biodegradable) waste that goes to the landfill. Beyond this, the potential to establish material reusing and recycling facilities in Lemesos will be examined, which supports circular economy and green jobs. As it is, PMD is collected, stored and exported to recycling factories in the EU (which increases GHG emissions due to shipping transportation) or burned (e.g., plastic, glass, metals) for electricity production (which has environmental impacts). Based on the implementation of the circular economy principles (e.g., avoid, reuse, reduce, recycle, "pay as you throw", household sorting) the municipality has the opportunity to educate residents about the benefits of waste separation and employ smart systems for monitoring. One option is to use RFID or barcode technology, where tags on waste bins record collection events and transmit data to a central database. This enables precise tracking and measurement, crucial for charging residents or businesses based on their waste production. The implementation of the 2 actions also contributes to green jobs creation, related to sustainable solid waste management. Co-benefits are related to human health, city aesthetics and environmental protection.

# 1.9.5 Coastal and Port

Coastal port cities such as Limassol, are particularly sensitive to  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions due to multiple cumulative pressures exerted by complex anthropogenic activities related to the urban centre and maritime operations.

The portfolio of actions proposed for this thematic address these environmental challenges through collective and systemic intervention to adapt to climate change, for the benefit of the city and to comply with the international environmental regulatory framework.

The proposals cover activities either on the coastal front, on land (urban coastal area), or purely maritime related activities (port and marina operations), including the marine ecosystem and its potential to function as a carbon sink of the city. Actions associated with adaptation to climatic change and energy consumption are to be associated closely to public information campaigns change management programmes aiming at shifting energy consuming public behaviour.

To summarise, the proposals cover the following:

The Cold Ironing initiative at Limassol Port provides a method for shore-side electrical power to docked ships, minimising the need for onboard diesel generators and thereby cutting emissions and improving air quality. Supported by various EU policies and offering financial incentives, the action promises significant environmental, economic, and employment benefits aligning with international sustainability goals;
Environmental adaptation of the complex "blue infrastructure" of the Limassol Marina, including infrastructure on the coastal front (buildings) and at Sea;
Use of technology to improve maritime surveillance and environmental monitoring to mitigate marine environmental risks and protect the marine ecosystem;
Utilize the capacity of seagrass meadows to capture and lock carbon;
Test and implement concepts such as the '15 minutes city' and the 'healthy neighbourhood', tailored to the very different cultural and climatic context of the city to develop costal resilient neighbourhoods; Explore ideas on the nature of a sustainable slow moving / activity based, / passive climatic design informed, linear coastal transport corridor;
Exploitation of wave energy for water desalination towards reduction of CO2 emissions from conventional desalination systems.

Collectively, the thematic proposals present a coherent and unified set of actions, aimed at protecting coastal communities and reducing the impacts of CO2 emissions on the marine environment and human health. Integrating the "Coastal and Maritime Zone" thematic proposals into the Limassol Municipality Climate Contract delivers a cohesive approach to achieve the 2030 objectives for a climate neutral and smart city, promoting sustainable development, coastal resilience and environmental protection and improving the quality of life of residents.

The development of all proposed actions of the coastal and sea thematic involved the active participation of all relevant stakeholders such as the Cyprus Ports Authority (CPA) and port terminal operators (private organizations), Electricity Authority of Cyprus (Cold Ironing), the management of Limassol Marina, relevant authorities for the coastal environment monitoring and protection and, of course, the citizens. This engagement is of vital importance and will therefore continue to exist and develop through workshops, focus groups meetings and the Blue Limassol Forum (https://www.limassol.org.cy/el/bluelimassolforum). The engagement of Limassol community stakeholders is also witnessed by the first holistic environmental risk assessment of Limassol coastal area (https://www.limassol.org.cy/en/blue-limassol-forum-2022-research).

## Smart Transformation – Horizontal Field of Action

Smart and Digital Transformation can play a significant role in carbon emission reduction by allowing ICT infrastructure modernization, reskilling employees and being remote ready, implementing automations and real-time data monitoring and analysis, as well as making informed decisions by using AI-insights. More specifically, the modernization of the ICT infrastructure and by replacing the existing electronic devices (such as laptops and PCs) with energy-efficient equipment can significantly reduce the carbon emissions of an enterprise, a governmental organization and/or a municipality. Moreover, as Microsoft report has recently shown the shift of operations to the cloud result in significant energy and carbon emission reduction potential compared to on-premises data-centres, which this can be up to 93% more energy-efficient and as high as 98% more carbon-efficient due to their extensive IT efficiency investments as well

as renewable energy. Google research also revealed that moving commonly used software applications to the cloud would decrease energy use by up to  $87\%$ . Cloud computing also enables home and remote work, reducing the need to commute and indirectly reducing transportation emissions.

Additionally, the incorporation of real-time monitoring and analysis of data, resources and device deployment management as well as the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence for automations and informed decision making, predictive maintenance and risk assessment may result in a more optimized energy usage, resources utilization, early identification of emission hotspots and carbon intensive activities. The ubiquitous smartphone devices may also empower citizens and communities by providing early warnings, real-time notifications and results on their energy usage and carbon footprint raising in this way awareness and encouraging behavioural change. Lastly by allowing a seamless integration to all municipality services and data will embrace trustworthiness and will attract private investors to develop more and new smart apps and deployments and consequently further enhance the smart transformation of

Limassol city.

# Work Process - combination of textual and visual elements

# 2.1. Work process

NZC Mission Eol (January 2022)

Lemesos Municipality (L.M.) embarked on a transformative journey by expressing its keen interest in formalizing and integrating its commitment to sustainability and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Prior to this, the city had pursued sustainability through various studies and rather disconnected environmental protection policies, plans, and projects. This expression of interest marked a pivotal moment in channeling the city's economic development towards a more sustainable future.

Lemesos accepted in NZC Mission (April 2022)

By April 2022, L.M.'s application was accepted, setting in motion the city's focused efforts to enhance its Municipal Capacity Building, with a specific emphasis on climate resilience and the following results and plans.

Establishment and operation of the internal Transition Team (May 2022 - today)

The city established a Climate Transition Team from various municipal departments, the Mayor and city counselors, and the Cyprus Institute (CyI) as the city scientific advisor to lead and coordinate its climate sustainability activities. This team plays a crucial role in coordinating and guiding L.M. towards its climate resilience goals.

L.M. entered into a collaboration agreement with the Cyprus Institute (CyI), a significant step towards forging partnerships and leveraging scientific expertise in the pursuit of sustainability.

Engagement with Stakeholders and Citizens (June 2022 - today)

L.M. recognized the importance of involving stakeholders and citizens in the sustainability journey. Effective communication and meetings have been held to garner input, feedback, and support from the community.

Pilot Project Application (September-November 2022)
#

LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

In the latter part of 2022, a pilot project application brought together various stakeholders, including the municipality, CyI, Cyprus University of Technology (CUT), ETEK, and Friends of the Earth (FoE). This collaborative effort aimed to develop a proposal that highlighted the essential components needed to establish the Climate Change Committee (CCC).

Formation of Thematic Teams and collaboration agreements (February 2023)

In February 2023, thematic teams were formed, marking a critical step in the structured approach towards sustainability. These teams would focus on specific areas crucial for achieving sustainability goals.

Public thematic workshops were conducted, involving stakeholders and citizens. These workshops provided a platform for collaborative discussions and idea-sharing, further strengthening the city's sustainability framework.

City Advisor's Visit and Presentation to City Council (March 2023)

In March 2023, the City Advisor Project Week played a pivotal role in refining the city's sustainability strategies.

A week-long visit by the City Advisor provided valuable insights and expertise. It included discussions with the Mayor, city counselors, and Municipality staff, the thematic teams as well as online meetings with other Mission staff. Following this, a presentation was made to the City Council followed by a discussion to gain support and approval for the climate initiatives.

Central government support (April 2023)

In April 2023, a conference was held to garner support from Cyprus Republic leadership, including the President of Cyprus, who publicly declared his support for Lemesos Mission, followed up by a decision to include it as a separate chapter in the National Energy and Climate plan.

Success of the Lc3 pilot project – Bootcamp – Kickoff (April – September 2023)

During this time, the Lc3 proposal was deemed successful, signifying progress towards sustainable practices. The 'bootcamp' process was very useful for the whole project team.

The grant agreement was signed in July (official start of the project June 1) with an online kickoff in July,  $\sigma$  in-person kickoff in September.

Milano Summer School (June 2023)

Two members of the Transition team attended the Milano summer school, very useful for drawing up the CCC.

The first version of the Action Plan and commitments document were developed by the thematic teams in cooperation with Municipality staff, City political leadership, stakeholders and citizens through workhops.

Cyprus Network of NZC Cities: (July 2023)

L.M. established the Cyprus Network of Net-Zero Carbon (NZC) Cities, establishing its place within a broader sustainability network. On July 6, 2023 the memorandum was signed by the Municipalities of Lemesos, Strovolos, Paphos, and Aradippou. The Network is open to participation of other cities; municipalities in the greater Lemesos area are of particular importance since most of the activities in the Transition action portfolios are naturally extended to them. The network will be a focused tool for testing and applying transferability.

Open Workshops and Investment Plan: (July-August 2023)

In July 2023, open workshops engaged city council members, municipality employees, and stakeholders in discussions about the Action Plan. This collaborative effort paved the way for the development of an Investment Plan in August 2023, which involved thematic teams and the CCC coordination team.

CCC Adoption and Signing: September 2023

September 2023 marked a significant milestone as the city's mayor, city council, and central government formally adopted and signed the Climate Change Committee (CCC), cementing their commitment to sustainability.

The period from October 2023 to March 2024 an acceleration in Lc3's efforts will take place, including the expansion of the Transition Team and intensification of Municipal Capacity Building. LM Transition team with full-timers. This phase involves extensive public consultation through co-workshops, that will lead to the development of the second version of the CCC. Feedback from CCC v1 will be incorporated, and by March 15, 2024, the CCC v2 will be submitted.

This cycle of progress will be repeated in September 2024.

Next CCC versions

We plan to establish a CCC MEL mechanism which will:

(1) Create a detailed (civil-engineering project-like) plan
(2) Record progress, delays, mistakes, and good practices
(3) Produce a minor CCC revision every September and a major revision every March (until March 2031 which will conclude the 2022 – 2030 Lemesos Climate Transition)

Additionally, we will follow the strategy presented in 2.2.2 (below) for updating the AP.

# 2.2. Action Plan development methodology

The first analysis of the current situation was done based on thematic areas of emission production. In addition to the standard ones (Energy, Built Environment, Transportation, and Waste) it was important for Lemesos to add the Port and the Coastal area $^{1}$ . This analysis initially undertaken by expert teams $^{2}$  started with discussions with the relevant stakeholders in special workshops and then in co-design workshops with the City Council, the Municipality Administration, and the public. It resulted in about 24 broad mitigation Actions presented in the CCC template tables that follow; they will be implemented via several hundred projects such as the LC $^{3}$  mission pilot, installation of electric cars charging stations, park (trans)formations and other microclimate interventions, participatory stakeholder co-design workshops, training for new green jobs, a variety of social innovation projects, a series of building deep retrofitting projects, an organic waste treatment factory, minimize solid waste that goes to the landfill (household shortening, pay as you throw), green energy communities, land and sea carbon absorption NBS, and a tram line. (A concrete list of projects for 2023-26 is in Appendix I.) The thematic teams worked in weekly coordination meetings (to avoid silo mentality) along with a CCC coordination team by L.M. and the Cyl with political supervision from the City Council, scientific from the Cy.I., and organizational from the L.M. Transition Team.

To translate Actions into prioritized implementation Projects we used the guiding principles (Section 2.3), focus areas (Section 2.4) and project selection criteria (Section 4.1). Most projects and many actions benefit from the expertise and considerations of more than one thematic area.

# 2.2.2 Strategy to update the Action Plan

The strategy below outlines the steps to review, revise, provide future iterations of the AP.

Review and Revise: Reflect initial action plan and identify areas that need adjustment. Consider changes in resources and/or priorities.

Prioritize Actions: Determine which actions are most critical to achieving AP objectives. Allocate resources, time, and effort accordingly.

Set New Milestones: Establish new, updated milestones that align with the revised action plan. Ensure these milestones are specific and have deadlines.

Communicate Changes: Inform all relevant stakeholders about the updated plan. Clearly articulate the reasons for changes and how they impact the overall strategy (MEL).

Monitor Progress: Implement a system for tracking progress towards goals. Regularly review performance against milestones and KPIs.

Adjust as Necessary: Make further updates and adjustments as new information or challenges arise. Adapt the plan to stay aligned with goals and objectives.

Flexibility: Open to new ideas, unexpected opportunities, or necessary course corrections.

Document Everything: Maintain clear records of the action plan, revisions, and progress. Documentation facilitates accountability and future reference.

Periodic Reviews: Schedule regular reviews (e.g., six months) of your the Action Plan, not just when issues arise. Monthly, quarterly, or annual assessments, depending on the nature of the goals (actions/activities/projects).

MEL: Continuously learn from experiences, whether they result in success or setbacks. This knowledge is applied to refine strategies for future planning.

Stay Committed, positive and resilient: Maintain a positive attitude and resilience in the face of setbacks. Focus on solutions rather than dwelling on problems.

# A-1.2: Emission factors applied

(please specify for primary energy type and GHG emission factor according to methodology used)
#

LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action

Plan

#

The GHG emission factors shown in the first column are expressed in CO2 equivalent and figures for all fuels were derived from our national energy legislation. Specifically, the emission factor used for electricity for Cyprus was taken from a JRC study and refers to the baseline year of 2009. The data sources used by our external consultant who produced the baseline emissions inventory do not disaggregate gasses, but provide figures in CO2eq. directly (and hence embody the warming potential of CH4, NOx etc.). Unfortunately at the moment we have no no way of disaggregating these numbers, and therefore columns have been left blank. For the moment no data is available regarding localised emissions factors and therefore these figures are national.

The emissions factor for electricity in the national grid which we expect to have in 2030 can be taken from the latest NECP of Cyprus that forecasts a system that has an emissions factor of 0.285 tCO2/MWh, please see below.

The specific electricity mix can be provided if needed, but indicatively it assumes converting all Fossil-based energy generation from diesel and HFU to Natural Gas, as well as very generous expansion of RES, especially PV. The transition also assumes the construction of an electricity interconnector between Greece, Cyprus and Israel that will allow deeper penetration of RES without the need for big amounts of storage. Not realising several changes (such as upgrading the grid, deploying storage, building the interconnector and not switching to NG) will have negative impact on this factor. Quantifying the risks at this point is difficult, as several factors are at play, but since the NECP is the official relevant strategy, we feel fairly confident that these changes will occur.

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

The BEI covers emissions from buildings, public lighting, industry, transport, waste, and AFOLU.

Scope 1 emissions refer to those generated within the boundaries of the city, scope 2 is comprised entirely from electricity as there is no district heating infrastructure in place, and scope 3 is the smallest, however it only accounts for one sector, waste. Scope 2 is the largest contributor in emissions for Lemesos at 55% of the total for 2018.

In terms of electricity consumption, the residential sector is the highest, with more than double the consumption compared to the second highest sector (trade). With national trends of urbanisation in mind and given that there is still undeveloped residential plots, this sector is expected to increase in consumption.

Emissions have reduced slightly from the baseline year (2018) until 2020, however this reduction is mainly in transport and can be attributed to the pandemic, thus it is expected to bounce back. Carbon sinks have remained stable in the past few years and offset only 0.1% of the annual emissions of the municipality. Green electricity (solar) to grid has a slight decrease in the past years, however this does not include self-consumption and residential net-metering. There is not clear data on how much this amount of produced electricity accounts to the total, yet the national trend is increasing.

Methodology: The baseline has been created using the actual electricity consumption within the boundaries of the municipality, divided in sectors of economic activity. Using national data on other sources of energy and with weighted averages, an estimation on the use of the remaining fuels has been made. In terms of waste, the municipality collects information on the weight of MSW produced each year. Based on information from both the municipality and national level, we are able to estimate the emissions produced from waste management. For calculating AFOLU emissions/sequestration, a combination of satellite imaging and municipal data on new building developments were used. The emissions factor for electricity is taken from JRC with data from 2009, Overall, the methodology used is a combination of JRC and UNFCCC guidelines and is an approximation, as neither local, nor national data is available for the capability of sequestration of local flora. Data on industry was collected as described above and also through discussions with local industry.

# A-2.2: Description &amp; assessment of policies

(describe and assess listed policies, strategies, regulations etc. to add detail)

Announced in December 2019, the "European Green Deal" is considered the cornerstone of the EU's climate policy, setting the ambitious target of and committing to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, by reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. This target has been reflected in the "European Climate Law", which sets the above goal into a legally binding target, while at the same time introducing an intermediate target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least  $55\%$  by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.

In principle, all follow-up European Climate-related policies and the corresponding ones adopted by the Republic of Cyprus, reflect upon and work in the direction set by the above. However, the Mission on which Limassol has embarked requires that the 2050 climate neutrality goal is accelerated by at least 20 years and in doing so, this requires that long term plans are implemented (fully or locally) by 2030. This means, among others, that by 2030:

the national electricity production will replace diesel with natural gas -which is still a fossil fuel, but with significantly lower emissions.
the national electric grid mix will include at least  $55\%$  RES
sufficient funds will be available to subsidize vehicle electrification and building energy retrofitting
regulations regarding energy communities, cold ironing in ports, energy building regulations will be passed in time and enforced.

To accelerate the transition while at the same time preparing for full implementation of the relevant policies, actions and measures, the Municipality of Limassol has requested for the introduction of a “regulatory sandbox” that will allow the city the necessary regulatory competence to fulfil the transition envisaged in this CCC. Delays and deficiencies in passing and implementing the necessary regulations as well as related imponderable external barriers (such as the effect of Turkey’s activities on the availability of Cypriot natural gas and the effect of international economic and political decisions on transboundary interconnection of the Cypriot electric grid) are significant risks beyond the control of the Municipality.

Residual emissions consist of those emissions which can't be reduced through climate action and are being offset. Residual emission may amount to a maximum of 20 % as stated by the Mission Info Kit.

Emissions reduction target percentage for "Other" sector is assumed to be the same as for the other 4 main sectors unless updated by city. Activities and commitments to reduce these emissions are documented in the Climate Neutrality Action Plan.

# A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers – textual elements

# Urban systems, city transformation and systemic barriers

Cities are complex environment, composing of many different systems (e.g., energy, transport, buildings) (see figure below). Urban transformation, under climate change, refers to the process of improving urban areas to enhance their livability, sustainability (e.g., change electricity production system, electrification of cars) and overall quality of life for residents. However, there can be various systemic barriers that hinder this transformation.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 8. City from a system perspective and examples of transformation towards NZ. Modified from: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102092

These barriers often arise from a combination of social, economic, political, and environmental factors. Some of these barriers (indicatively) are related to: Lack of Funding and Resources: Many cities struggle with limited financial resources and inadequate funding for urban development projects. This can impede efforts to invest in infrastructure, public services, and other initiatives necessary for transformation. Bureaucracy: Complex and lengthy bureaucratic processes can slow down urban development projects, leading to delays and increased costs. Political Challenges: Political instability, corruption, and a lack of political will can hinder urban transformation efforts. Elected officials may prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability. Inequality and Social Disparities: Socioeconomic disparities within urban populations can be a significant barrier to transformation. Ensuring that all

residents benefit from improvements is crucial, but it can be challenging to address deep-seated inequalities. Resistance to Change: Resistance from various stakeholders, such as residents, businesses, and property owners, can slow or block transformation efforts. People may be resistant to changes that affect their neighborhoods or livelihoods. Zoning and Land Use Regulations: Restrictive zoning and land use regulations can limit the flexibility and creativity needed for urban transformation. Simplifying and modernizing these regulations can encourage innovation.

# The case of Lemesos

Focusing on Lemesos Transition, besides what is above described, the following are also important to be considered as barriers:

) Reduced capacity of the municipality for the transition (human resources, city design, regulatory competence etc).
) Social attitude (citizens, stakeholders). Stakeholders' knowledge, attitude and will; Myopic special interests; fear of the unknown; Comfort zone.
) Financial (lack of public funds, investments, funding schemes tailored to the transition/climate change mitigation).
) Human resources (Quality and quantity).
) Geography (insular environment) and (Turkish) military occupation.
) Time for the transition (2024-2030; very short for vast systemic changes).
) Invisibility of the emissions (no direct benefit of city-only emissions reduction; projections are that Lemesos temperature will increase).

In relation to the above, Lemesos is missing data and digital systems (e.g. traffic model) in form that are not cumbersome to access and allow use for decision making. There are Gaps, such as social knowledge, understanding, interest and trust on topics relevant to the transition. The tradition of involvement into public affairs should be considered, procedures of cooperation among stakeholders and mentality of zero sum game. Regarding funding and public money there is the issue of social suspicion vs. accountability (transparency). There is lack of know how and experience related to huge projects implementation (and the break-down into smaller; independent but interconnected). This fact, in combination to the short time period (to 2030) is very challenging. In combination to the projects, there should be a concrete campaign against misinformation which yields mistrust. Additionally, Lemesos will change city boundaries (in 2024) due to a reform to reduce municipality entities in Cyprus. Plus, municipal elections.

Opportunities are related to structural and other funds that are actively involved in several large projects in Cyprus (e.g., the building industry), the financial sector in the island which is a strong part of the national economy (deposits, investments), there are top ranked universities and research centres that include experts in all the thematic cppponents that are related to the transition. The port and the coastal front of Lemesos are huge assets (nationally and internationally). The NZC mission and the EU regulations/strategies (eg Green Deal, Waste, One Health) favor the actions that are linked to the transition, many of which are national obligations towards the EU (e.g., applying the waste management directive). Another important opportunity lies in the establishment of Lemesos NZC 2030, Inc, which will support the municipality for the implementation of the actions related to NZ. Finally, the size of Cyprus is small in comparison to other EU countries (and could be comparable to a district), which has the advantage of personal connections to important stakeholders.

The participatory model (section A.3.3) considers all the above, to achieve the aims and objectives of the transition.

# A deeper (indicative) analysis - The example (complexity) of deep renovation of the building stock (Action 1 of the Build Env.)

The following are linked to the complexity related to systemic change for the action of deep renovation of the building stock:

The deep renovation of the building stock of Limassol at a rate compatible to achieve the NZC target requires huge quantities of building materials (e.g. insulations, membranes) and components (e.g. high-performance windows and doors, HVAC components, sensors, wires). The lack of an established local supply chain is a crucial barrier, resulting in a strong dependence on imports. Nevertheless, it constitutes an opportunity to set a national industrial plan to stimulate local industrial production and require the establishment of effective supply chain for the materials and components that won't be produced and/or assembled locally.
The deep renovation of existing buildings and the construction of carbon-neutral buildings require very skilled workforce. In particular SMEs do not typically have the required skills to install advances HVAC components, provide airtight envelopes, integrate multifunctional devices. This constitutes an opportunity to provide hand-on and theoretical training for upskilling and reskilling the construction workforce.
Professional practice in Cyprus is only recently integrating environmental assessment schemes for high-performance buildings. This requires a theoretical training and establishment of building monitoring/metering for commissioning purposes.
There is a lack of an established network of weather stations to monitor environmental parameter (mostly related to the thermal and air quality domains) in different areas of the city. It is an opportunity to model the city with mesoscale models and identify the most relevant spot where more severe conditions may happen.
In the last years, induced by the COVID19 pandemic and exacerbated by the Russian-Ukrainian war, we have assisted soaring prices, increasing interest rates, rising construction costs, and stagnant wages causing the rise of economic inequality.
The increase of the real estate prices in the center and coastal areas of the city are causing the displacement of local people to suburbs and more prereferal areas.
High regeneration projects are substantially changing the morphology, functions and identity of some areas of the city causing a loss of the original place character.
As in other cities of Cyprus, also in Limassol there are abandoned spaces and buildings, which will not be easily regenerated or renovated.

Overcoming the systemic barriers requires a coordinated effort involving government, private sector, and community stakeholders. It often involves comprehensive planning, policy reforms, and a commitment to inclusivity and sustainability in the urban development process. Additionally, addressing these challenges may require innovative financing mechanisms and the engagement of multiple levels of government and international partners. All these efforts to overcome the systemic barriers (and many more) are presented in the next section (A3.3.) and other parts of the AP for NZ Lemesos 2030 (e.g., B.1, Introduction).

# A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

Our participatory Transition design and Transition governance models have the following Instruments (one sentence description here; reference to more detailed elsewhere in the CCC). The following graphics depict our Stakeholder and Citizen Participation models:

Co-workshops, or participatory co-design solution workshops are long-term groups of people from a homogeneous shareholder or citizen group who meet and structured discuss, in person and online; they produce solutions on specific issues of their concern and competence (see Introduction Section 3.4).

The Lemesos Commons is the central holistic advisory body of the Transition; it expresses the integrated view of stakeholders and citizens on solutions designed by co-workshops; it consists of 25 randomly selected co-workshop 'graduates' rotate semi-annually (see Introduction Section 3.4).

The "Lemesos NZ Lemesos 2030, Inc." organization is the executive branch of the Transition; initially established by the L.M. it is a broad-base shareholder company with the L.M. and other authorities holding about 25% (none more than 10%), other institutional stakeholders about 20% (none more than 3%), individual business about 20% (none more than 2%) and individual citizens 35% (each up to .1%).

Regulatory sandbox is the L.M. competence to design, advance and apply regulations that will give it more flexibility, greater enforcing powers and accelerating capacity not only on issues directly affecting the NZ Transition but also on enabling ones (such as building regulations, education and training, supply chains, traffic and others) typically taken from EU directives before they become regulations or policies (that are already being applied in other cities) and their adoption in Cyprus will take a long time.

"Let 100 flowers bloom" is the central social innovation program of the Transition that includes a few hundred small (10-40K€, less than a year long) climate resilience projects with the objective of trying scalable ideas and the "hidden curriculum" of advancing Citizen and Stakeholder active involvement.

The organized Transition Arena consists of the coordinated operation and interaction of five Transition Teams: the L.M. Internal Transition Team, The Scientific Thematics Transition Team, The Social Transition Team, The Political (MEL) Transition Team, and the Implementation Transition Team.

The semi-annual Lemesos NZ Transition Conference, a public 2-day event bringing together Stakeholders and citizens giving space for reporting and accountability to each participating entity and giving the opportunity to L.M. to present the next version of the CCC.

The whole Transition process is coordinated in a decentralized way by the L.M. who advance principles, objectives and the master plan, but do not need to pre-approve details, so that they do not delay activities. (The idea is that the Transition cannot move like a Roman Legion; rather its coordination is that of a natural ecosystem allowing conflicting vews and healthy competition).

# 4 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B represents the core of the Action Plan, shaped by local authorities, local businesses and stakeholders, comprising of the most essential elements: scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, action portfolios and indicators for monitoring, evaluation and learning.

# 4.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Module B-1 "Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways" should list impact pathways, early and late outcomes and direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits) according to and adapted from the NZC Theory of Change and the AP Guidance

|  B-1.1.1: Impact Pathways Energy Systems  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Technology/Infrastructure  |   |
|  Early changes (1-2 years) | New Renewable Energy Systems (RES) capacity: Widespread adoption of various renewable energy technologies (PV and wind predominantly) have the largest impact on emissions as Lemesos is rapidly moving toward electrification of many end use sectors. New Behind-the-Meter Storage: New storage behind-the-meter will eliminate the risk of curtailment and allow deeper penetration of RES Conversion of traditional boilers with Heat Pumps: A significant proportion of city dwellings in Lemesos still relies on traditional oil-fired boilers for space and water heating. These will gradually be replaced by air-source heat pumps. Familiarity with solar thermal technologies: Industrial processes heat can be supplied by tailor-made solutions (like the Fresnel systems proposal in action 2). This will bring end users and installers one step closer to non-fossil-fuel based solutions for such applications.  |
|  Late outcomes (3-4 years) | Novel synergies between RES, storage, and the operators (DSO, TSO): Propagation of the solutions proposed will require the active engagement of the system operators (Distribution and Transmission system Operators). Centralized energy storage (Community, municipality): Centralized energy storage systems at the city level is a novelty for Cyprus, especially under new business models such as energy communities and a possible alternative DSO/producer model. Integration of large, centralized Long-Term Energy Storage (LDES): LDES is projected to be important for energy systems relying on RES. It complements battery storage, and its deployment in the city level is an important and necessary milestone.  |
LIMASSOL2030

#

|  Direct impacts (Emission reductions | Reduction of GHG emissions: All actions in the energy thematic lead to substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, both individually and combined. The largest drop comes from two main sources: Large-scale deployment of PV systems on rooftops coupled with battery storage, and the deployment of central, hybrid energy system combined with a central energy storage system. These actions are responsible for more than half of the emissions reduction of Lemesos in 2030.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Indirect impacts (co-benefits) | Health benefits (improved air quality): Switching to RES and storage and phasing out fossil fuels in scope 2 electricity generation and within the city limits when replacing oil and gas boilers, as well as diesel generators and oil burners in industrial settings brings about multiple (and well documented in literature) health benefits due to improved air quality and reduce particulate emissions (PM10 and PM2.5) and other harmful aerosols. Health improvements (vibration, noise, smell): In addition to air quality, clean energy technologies replace systems that are associated with elevated noise, vibration, and smell levels. System resilience (incl. grid services): The city energy systems proposed will add to the grid resilience and significantly decrease system-wide curtailment. Not only are they not a burden to the grid, but they also offer stability services by spreading out generation and minimizing the impact of faults. Energy security: The significant reduction in imported fossil fuels increases the self-reliance on indigenous energy sources. Reduced energy poverty: All actions in energy (but especially those that target distributed systems) can yield long-term cost savings for building owners and tenants and improved access to energy, resulting in a reduction of the energy poverty exposure and of the energy-poverty related mortality.  |
|  Governance/Policy  |   |
|  Early changes (1-2 years) | Regulatory framework for communities: The concept of energy communities is not yet applied in Cyprus, even though it's widespread in several locales, especially in Europe. Lemesos aims to be pioneering the concept's implementation in Cyprus with a community within its borders using the co-operative scheme, the regulatory framework for which is not yet finalised. The creation of the community will accelerate the maturity of this framework. New incentives: New incentives at the local/community level will need to be gradually implemented, in collaboration with national authorities. These should target areas such as energy communities, support for vulnerable households, the easy provision of BtM storage etc.  |
|  Late outcomes (3-4 years) | Integration in energy market: The energy community and/or the municipality itself as a DSO will be able to participate in the electricity market, reaping additional monetary benefits. Coordinated policy landscape between municipal and national authorities: The acceleration of actions at the city level will expeditate the convergence between regulations and policies at the national and municipal level.  |
|  Direct impacts (Emission reductions |   |

|  Indirect impacts (co-benefits) | Governance resource efficiency: Simplifying and expediting the permitting and approval processes for all energy projects. This can be achieved by creating dedicated review teams, implementing online application systems, and providing clear guidelines to ensure a smooth and efficient process. This in turn will reduce the demand for dedicated staff on these actions and increase processing speed and efficiency.

Opportunity for municipality to become a DSO/Provider: Generating and storing energy in centralised locations (not necessarily within the city boundaries, see action 6 description) will necessitate the city itself to become a DSO and producer to obtain the right to count the energy it produces as its own. This is a novel approach for Cyprus at any level.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Social innovation  |   |
|  Early changes (1-2 years) | New skills and capacities at prosumer level: The energy interventions proposed will turn energy consumers to energy prosumers – the first step towards assumption of ownership of production means.  |
|  Late outcomes (3-4 years) | Equity and inclusion in energy access: The later outcome focuses on ensuring social equity and inclusion in the energy transition of Lemesos. It emphasizes the engagement of marginalized groups, low-income communities, and vulnerable populations. By prioritizing their needs and perspectives the process will address social inequalities, energy poverty, and energy access.

Education and awareness campaigns: The actions will promote behavioural change among citizens by establishing education and awareness campaigns.

Behavioural shift: All the action will result in a degree of behavioural change, more so in those that include participatory action (energy community, small PVs and BtM storage) by shifting the mindset on what energy production, storage and use means.  |
|  Direct impacts (Emission reductions |   |
|  Indirect impacts (co-benefits) | Social cohesion: The actions will result in closer ties within the community where energy is treated as the valuable commodity it is.  |
|  Democracy/Participation  |   |
|  Early changes (1-2 years) | Consumer -> prosumer: The energy interventions proposed will turn energy consumers to energy prosumers – the first step towards assumption of ownership of production means.

Information Campaigns: The actions are proposing deep and rapid changes to the energy mix of the city. These will have to be communicated via targeted information campaigns.

Stakeholder engagement: The early changes of all actions involve engaging a wide range of stakeholders, including government agencies, policy makers and local authorities, building owners, construction firms, energy service companies, community organizations, engineers, technicians, installers, academics, researchers, and the public at large. First steps will be made to engage all these groups, to be fully developed at a later stage.  |

|  Late outcomes (3-4 years) | **Jointly owned means of production:** Actions that target local ownership (energy community, local RES, Fresnel) fundamentally shift the sense of ownership of production means from the central and remote to the local and own, resulting in elevated responsibility for operation, and optimisation of performance.
**Sense of inclusion:** Similarly, the city actions will instil a sense of inclusion for all citizens.

**Multi-stakeholder engagement:** The energy transition process involves engaging a wide range of stakeholders, including government agencies, policy makers and local authorities, building owners, construction firms, energy service companies, community organizations, engineers, technicians, installers, academics, researchers, and the public at large. This requires deep and careful multi-stakeholder engagement, ensuring that diverse perspectives, expertise, and resources are leveraged. This inclusive approach facilitates collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and collective decision-making for the deep changed prescribed in this document.
**Reduced energy poverty:** All actions in energy (but especially those that target distributed systems) can yield long-term cost savings for building owners and tenants and improved access to energy, resulting in a reduction of the energy poverty exposure and of the energy-poverty related mortality.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Direct impacts (Emission reductions |   |
|  Indirect impacts (co-benefits) | **Opportunity for energy trade among members, including P2P:** The energy community action will allow novel modalities of energy and financial exchange between members, including on Peer-to-Peer platforms.
**Local Job creation:** The actions will demand resources in technicians, planners, engineers and labourers among others at a very large scale. Most of these jobs will require a large degree of local sourcing, increasing the employment prospects (and demands) for Lemesos.  |
|  Finance/Funding  |   |
|  Early changes (1-2 years) | **New opportunities for private investors:** The sheer size of the actions proposed will mean a diverse mix of financing sources, the bulk of which will come from private sources, either private individuals or commercial entities.  |
|  Late outcomes (3-4 years) | **New ‘microfinancing’ schemes:** Financing schemes targeting small interventions at the local level will allow for faster adoption of energy solutions.
**Public-private partnerships:** Opportunity to establishing partnerships between public bodies and private investors or companies (e.g., ESCos) to finance projects with substantial upfront costs (such as systems under energy action 6).
**Green bonds:** Issuing green bonds to raise funds specifically for citizens requiring access to clean energy. These bonds attract socially and environmentally conscious investors and provide capital. The funds raised can be allocated to building owners or community managers through appropriate mechanisms.  |

Plan

#

|   | Currently, organic waste is landfilled resulting to high GHG emissions. Pilot projects aim in collecting 30% of the organic waste produced annually, to be scaled up to remove >90% of the organic fraction by 2030. Organic waste will be collected separately in selected areas of the city (e.g., 30 km zone) and will be transferred to existing facilities, where i twill be used for anaerobic digestion and electricity production. Technology integration at the neighbourhood level: Waste segregation at household level does not require special technology changes, but ratehr a re-organization of the collection system schedule at the city level. Currently, PMD and MSW are collected separately, but a need for a separate collection of the organic material will arise. Pilot projects for Zero Emission waste management: Pilot projects will start in selected areas of the city in order to establish MSW segregation. We plan to begin with separating organic waste and aim to maximize separate collection of recyclable materials. All this will be done in line with the principles of Circular Economy (and waste management).  |
| --- | --- |
|  Late outcomes (3-4 years) | Infrastructure upgrade: Following separate organic material collection, the target should be to maximize the removal of recyclable materials. Implementation of the « Pay as you throw » principle will be pivotal in achieving this goal. According to this principle, each household has an ID (barcode) related to their waste bin and the annual municipal household fee for waste management is not fixed (as it is right now) but depends on the amount of waste produced.  |
|  Direct impacts (Emission reductions) | Reduced GHG emissions: Implementation of this action will contribute to the reduction of the GHG emissions produced by landfilling the organic fraction of the MSW. Lemesos also has a great potential for removing of the recyclable fraction from the MSW. The action is in accordance with EU guidelines and directives for sustainable solid waste management (and many others related to sustainable environmental management).  |
|  Indirect impacts (co-benefits) | Reducing environmental pollution and producing renewable energy: Landfills contribute to environmental pollution, not only with GHG emissions, but also with the release of leachate and odours which are problematic for nearby communities. Sustainable MSW management will contribute to minimizing these issues and instead will be used to produce renewable energy from organic waste using anaerobic digestion. One of the added benefits from this, is that the emission factor from this source of energy is much lower than the one of current system used for electricity production in Cyprus.  |
|  Governance/Policy  |   |
|  Early changes (1-2 years) | Circular Economy: The principles of circular economy will be incorporated in existing policies related to waste management. This action is pivotal not only for Lemesos but for the entire country. Update of MSW policies for NZC: Review and update (municipal) policies related to MSW collection and handling (e.g., avoid landfilling, increase recycling, increase reusing). “Pay as you throw”: Design an action plan for the implementation of the “pay as you throw” principle, according to EU waste management guidelines and national law.  |

|  Late outcomes (3-4 years) | Policy for Zero Waste in Lemesos: There is an urgent need for a zero waste policy in Lemesos (and Cyprus) according to the EU Waste directives in order to minimize landfilled MSW. The NZC will support this transition. The Municipality plans to support other municipalities and smaller communities (e.g., villages) in Lemesos district, where the conditions of MSW treatments are much worse (e.g., existence of wastelands and open damp sites). Collaborative governance structures: Waste management is transdisciplinary and requires stakeholders' involvement and engagement. The mission supports collaboration towards MSW sustainable management based on platforms for ongoing dialogue, among stakeholders, collaborative governance enhances transparency, trust, and cooperation. Citizen involvement is also crucial (e.g., pay as you throw) in this operation and platforms such as the “Lemesos Commons” and e-platforms will facilitate a continuous dialogue platform among citizens, the municipality and other stakeholders. Sustainable urban planning: In line with other Mission Thematics (e.g., transportation, buildings, green infrastructure), Zero Waste is related to developing collaborative sustainable urban planning practices.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Direct impacts (Emission reductions) | Decreased rate of waste production: Applying zero waste approach (e.g., reuse, reduce, recycle) supports reduced waste production. This will result in reduced GHG emissions which are currently caused by the current and outdated MSW management system.  |
|  Indirect impacts (co-benefits) | Reduced pollution related to solid waste: On the long term, sustainable solid waste management supports several EU strategies related to human and environmental health (e.g., One Health; Soil; Biodiversity; Green Deal).  |

|  Late outcomes (3-4 years) | Multi-stakeholder engagement: Sustainable MSW management involves engaging a wide range of stakeholders, including government agencies, building owners, tenants, companies, industry, and community. The outcome is enhanced multi-stakeholder engagement, ensuring that diverse perspectives, expertise, and resources are leveraged to drive the circular economy agenda. This inclusive approach facilitates collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and collective decision-making. Community participation and empowerment: Emphasis is given to community participation and empowerment in circular economy related projects. Local residents are engaged in the decision-making process, by encouraging them to take an active role in shaping the waste reduction strategies. Participatory approaches, such as community meetings, workshops, and focus groups, enable community members to express their needs, priorities, and aspirations. This involvement instils a sense of ownership and empowers communities to drive sustainable change. Social equity and inclusion: This outcome is related to the engagement of marginalized groups, low-income communities, and vulnerable populations in circular economy projects and green job prospects. By prioritizing their needs and perspectives, sustainable MSW management has higher probability for success.  |
|  Direct impacts (Emission reductions) | Reduced waste (and related emissions): Multistakeholder approaches and community based solutions have higher prospects for success, which ultimately leads to waste reduction and GHG emissions mitigation.  |
|  Indirect impacts (co-benefits) | Sense of place/ aesthetics: Sustainable waste management with active involvement of citizens and stakeholders has positive impact on the cooperation and collaboration (bottom up) and city aesthetics (and brand name).

Cold Ironing Implementation in Limassol Port (CA_1: Cold Ironing in the Limassol Port)
LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

5

# Introduction

Cold ironing or the provision of shore-side electricity to ships for the Limassol Port is a transformative initiative with a significant impact on both the environment and the local community. It is the practice of providing electrical power to ships at berth as an alternative to using their onboard diesel generators and aims to reduce emissions, improve air quality, and create a sustainable future for the port and its surroundings.

# The legislative framework

The EU Directive 2014/94 which focuses on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure, includes provisions related to cold ironing, or shore-side electricity, for reducing emissions from ships at berth. The directive encourages member states to assess the potential for cold ironing in their ports, develop infrastructure accordingly, and sets requirements for the provision of shore-side electricity facilities, aiming to reduce the environmental impact in the maritime sector. In addition, fleet operators are obliged to provide information on their fuel consumption when entering a European port (European Union's Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) Regulation). Specifically, the MRV Regulation, requires ships of 5,000 gross tonnage or above to monitor and report their CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, and other relevant parameters for voyages to, from, and between European ports. Data collected is verified and reported annually to the European Commission. The MRV Regulation aims to enhance the transparency of greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime sector and facilitate the development of policies and measures to reduce emissions in line with the European Union's climate goals. As of 1 January 2023, requirements for EEXI (Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index) and CII (Carbon Intensity Indicator) certification have been implemented. This will allow shipowners to report their progress on emission reduction efforts and help fleet management measure the carbon emissions per unit of transportation activity and track and analyse the environmental impact of their fleet operations, and make informed decisions to implement strategies for carbon emissions reductions. European ports have offered various incentives to encourage ship operators to utilize cold ironing, including significant reductions in port dues, by implementing environmental schemes based on environmental indexes or certifications such as the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), Environmental Ship Index (ESI), Green Award (European Commission, 2017).

# The impact pathway

The main direct impact of cold ironing is a significant reduction in GHG emissions, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. This reduction in air pollution also has significant indirect effects, or co-benefits, such as a positive impact on the health and well-being of the local community. Implementation of cold ironing and provide the Limassol Port with the opportunity to become an example of an environmentally responsible maritime operation, setting a precedent for other ports in the region and beyond, and encouraging them to adopt similar practices. Implementation of this action also has significant economic implications, as the Limassol Port is likely to attract environmentally conscious shipping companies and cruise lines and has the potential to enhance its competitiveness, attracting more vessels, generating increased revenue, and boosting local economic growth by creating new employment opportunities in the sector (and their respective ripple effect) in other sectors.

# Impacts of cold-ironing implementation at the Limassol Port

Reduction of GHG emissions
Improved air quality
Improvement of health of the local community
Increased revenue for the port from increased traffic
Stimulation of economic growth in the local community.

# 2. Carbon Neutrality in Blue Infrastructure-The case of Limassol Marina (CA_2: Limassol Marina energy community)

Blue infrastructure within cities, consists of complex systems like marinas and ports, which facilitate different needs and stakeholders, at sea, onshore or both. The Limassol Marina in particular, includes a wide range of amenities and activities such as properties (apartments, villas), Yachting services (berthing facilities, technical services, etc), as well as a number of restaurants and shops making it a cosmopolitan destination.

The Limassol Marina includes a total of 650 berthing spots (largest number from all Marinas in Cyprus) and from 2013 onwards has been an increasingly popular quality destination for recreational yachting. In addition, and considering the entire marina which includes many shops, restaurants, bars and luxury properties, its bustling activity, and employment of hundreds have made it an economically favorable establishment.

The Limassol Marina is able to facilitate up to 9,000 people visiting the premises per week, with an area exclusively for yachting at just over 40,000m² (including 650 berths for yachts up to 110m). The entirety of the premises is substantially larger and includes 162 luxury apartments and 74 exclusive villas (with private berths or direct access to the beach), and many commercial shops and services ranging from dining, and shopping, to fitness.

Based on the quantitative part of the Blue Limassol Environmental Risk Assessment in 2021, the majority (94,1%) of yacht owners do not keep records of their vessel's fuel consumption, but the vast majority (71.4%) is willing to undertake actions that would make recreational yachting more environmentally sustainable.

The proposed action includes all the necessary steps for transforming the Limassol Marina to a carbon neutral enterprise with the following resulting positive impacts:

Reduce GHG emissions from various activities within the Limassol Marina to transform it to a carbon neutral infrastructure
Set an example for other blue infrastructures in the country and beyond
Set-up renewable energy sources to cover energy needs of the Marina
Augment sense of ownership among co-owners and citizen engagement in the matters of green energy production via the creation of an energy community
Ensure a sustainable, smart and eco-friendly future for the rapidly advancing nautical tourism sector

# 3. Mitigation of Risks to the Coastal Area through Technology Tools &amp; Integrated Data Management (CA_3: MERA)

The City of Limassol and its wider surroundings, stretch along a 30 km coastline, one of the largest in the world. Over hundreds of years, the coast and the sea provided the backbone of the citizens' environmental and socio-economic wellbeing. Today, the bay of Limassol faces unprecedented pressures from anthropogenic activities heavily concentrated on its shores. In total, 6 industrial sectors (Power Generation, Commercial Port Operations, Marinas and Yachting, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Coastal Construction and Sewage and Litter) comprise a complex system of interactive threats to coastal and sea pollution. Carbon neutrality for the City of Limassol is directly linked to the quality of its coastal waters, as the sea is simultaneously the main provider of

oxygen and the largest absorber of carbon dioxide emissions (carbon sink) and excess heat generated. Polluting incidences and their sources should, therefore, be quickly identified and evaluated to establish causes and define mitigating practices around them.

At the moment, this task is compromised by two major factors, namely excessive fragmentation of oversight among several local and governmental institutions (which prevents data sharing resulting in inefficiency, reduced accountability and lack of transparency) and insufficient use of technology. Limassol finds itself at a precarious position, given the increasing pressures and in view of newly emerged threats, such as the exploration of natural gas at its shores and the extent of the problem is assessed in a large-scale risk assessment study (Blue Limassol Environmental Risk Assessment, 2021: https://www.limassol.org.cy/en/blue-limassol-forum-2022-research). This study concluded that: a) incidents of marine pollution have increased over the last 5 years, b) the overwhelming number of polluting incidents across Cyprus take place in Limassol, c) only a small fraction of reported incidents is investigated and penalized, and d) the regulatory and monitoring process of Limassol coastal area is highly fragmented among different governmental and municipal bodies.

This project aims to providing a holistic framework of surveillance and risk assessment, in order to reduce, over time, the incidents of environmental pollution. Central to our idea, is the consolidation of available data from the fragmented current system of data collection centers and add real-time primary data from state-of-the-art surveillance (drones, unmanned sea vehicles, stationary underwater sensors). When the data has been collected and consolidated to an online platform, the project will proceed with analysis and visualization to extract risk assessment metrics, impact KPI's and designing an early warning system, should certain thresholds of measurable variables be exceeded.

# 4. Resilient Coastal Neighbourhoods (RECONE) CA_4:RECONE

RECONE, aims at emissions reduction through enhancing the sense of community and their responsiveness toward environmental issues, which are eroded fast by a rapid-changing economy of Limassol during the last two decades. The project will define and selectively measure, energy consumption/emission patterns and define resilience levels in terms of environmental, social, and economic challenges. The methodology will draw from well documented concepts such as the '15 minutes city' or the 'healthy neighbourhood', tailored to the very different cultural and climatic context of the eastern Mediterranean and Limassol specifically. Furthermore, RECONE will adjust the '15 minutes city' model to the specificities of a coastal neighbourhood and take advantage of the asset of the proximity to the seafront and the beach, a high value public amenity.

Central to approach will be to decarbonize the area, as well as to include both public and private parties, current initiatives and mechanisms to this effort. The project will focus on one of the seven costal neighbourhoods of Limassol to pilot the mapping of environmental character and impact and will deploy change management mechanisms, local economic regeneration interventions and catalyst environmental change projects all informed by inclusive participatory practices.

Urban regeneration programmes are inherently complex and multi-faceted - small or large with short- or long-term impact contributes toward a more effective use of space, key to addressing climate change. Types of actions interrelate in order to maximise the value of better management of emissions and longer-term sustainability of place - actions relating to changes of habits and attitudes need to be supported by enhancement of the city infrastructure and services as well as the environmental footprint of built space.

At present many of the actions proposed will contribute to the overall healthy neighbourhood and enable behavioural changes, individual preferences, consumption habits, lifestyles, which in parallel to the improvements of associated infrastructure will bring the city closer to the requirements of the European Green Deal and the New European Bauhaus initiative. Early Pilot projects aim at identifying which of aspects of neighbourhood lifestyle can be more effectively impacted through the introduction of technologies, attitudinal change, shift in the structure of the amenity base etc.

Cyprus unfortunately lacks data on a number of aspects of sustainability. Pilot projects will solve part of this problem as models can be generated and measurements for the specific area can be used to extrapolate to city, or even country-wide scale.

At the same, the city design pattern and urban development realities have alienated the urban fabric and even the coastal neighbourhoods from the coast, the seafront and the beach, a valuable amenity that could contribute much more to the quality of daily life. The actions proposed here will simultaneously make substantial changes to systems, attitudes and sense of community for long term healthy societies which can be applied to all neighbourhoods nationwide.

## Delivery Timeline

The timeline for the delivery of this initiative is defined to a 6-year plan, but the actions taken will have much longer impact. Mechanisms for built in self-sustainability of actions (such as engagement and training of the local community to instill a sense of ownership and ensure long-term viability) should also be a consideration while designing them. A preliminary timeline is shown below:

Assessment of Carbon Sinking Potential of Seagrass Meadows in the Limassol Bay (CA_5: Seagrass meadows in Limassol-carbon sinking and meadow restoration)

Seagrasses are key habitat forming species, creating meadows, which are biodiversity hotspots and home to a wide range of marine species. In the Mediterranean, these meadows cover a quarter of the seabed at depths up to  $40\mathrm{m}$ . However, in some areas of the Mediterranean this habitat is being lost at unprecedented rates. In the Levantine basin specifically, seagrass is present in Cyprus but is absent in coastal areas of neighbouring countries such as, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, the south-eastern coasts of Turkey and around the Nile delta in Egypt.

The seagrass species Posidonia oceanica, provides a variety of ecosystem services including carbon sequestration ('blue carbon'), water purification, nutrient cycling, habitat formation sustaining hundreds of species and provides support many recreational and economic activities like diving and fishing. Posidonia

oceanica meadows are the only "priority" marine habitat in European waters protected by the EU Habitat Directive (92/43/ECC), are used as an indicator for environmental status in the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, and are protected by the Common Fisheries Policy which prohibits the use of towed gears shallower than 50 m, and by several international conventions such as: the RAMSAR Convention, the Berne Convention and the Barcelona Convention.

Posidonia oceanica, an endemic seagrass in the Mediterranean Sea plays a significant role in carbon sequestration and sinking (blue carbon). Posidonia oceanica has the capacity to store vast amounts of carbon in the root system called 'matte' for centuries to millennia, a feature that sets it apart from several terrestrial ecosystems considered to be efficient in carbon storage. Posidonia oceanica seagrasses sequester CO₂ at a much faster rate than tropical forests and can store carbon for much longer periods (Pergent-Martini et al., 2021). A study using high-resolution seismic reflection imaging estimates that the carbon stock stored in matte is 15.6 ± 2.2 million t C_org (Monnier et al., 2021). However, the locked carbon can be slowly released back through decomposition if the seagrass meadow degrades and it is estimated that we lost about a third of the meadows in the last 50 years (Telesca et al., 2015).

Quantifying the precise amount of carbon sequestration and sinking by Posidonia oceanica can be challenging due to various factors such as regional variability, site-specific conditions, and methodological limitations in measurements. Estimates vary significantly depending on the specific location and condition of the seagrass meadows. Generally, the deeper, the lower the shoot density and the lower the carbon sequestration and fixation rates. It is estimated that the carbon fixation rates can be &gt;1 ton C ha⁻¹ and its sink capacity could account for more than &gt;1 million tons of C per year at Mediterranean level (Life Natura Blue Andalucia project).

Studies have estimated that the mean total carbon fixation per year varies between 33.5 and 426.6 g C m⁻², and the mean carbon sequestration (long-term sink in the matte), corresponding to the sheath and rhizome tissues, varies between 7.7 and 84.4 g C m⁻². A synthesis of measurements made throughout the Mediterranean Sea provided an estimate of the average annual carbon fixation and sequestration rate throughout the Mediterranean basin, with a total fixation rate of 1,302 t C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ and a sequestration rate of 278 t C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹. This annual carbon fixation can reach up to 14.4% of CO₂ emissions for large Mediterranean islands (Pergent-Martini et al., 2021).

Given their great potential for carbon fixation and sequestration, t is crucial that seagrasses across Limassol Bay are assessed further (current status/health, carbon fixation and sequestration rate), monitored, protected, and restored. As an important carbon sink for the city, they should also be considered in the modelling undertaken in the framework of the 100 cities in a next iteration of the Climate City Contract of Limassol.

In Limassol, P. oceanica forms a continuous belt parallel to the coastline at approximate depths of 8-25 m. There is evidence that the seagrass is declining since remnants of the root system (matte) is present up to 40-45 m depth and coastal developments and modifications have caused the extinction of this species in shallower waters. This activity aims to assess the sequestered carbon stock in the present meadows, their carbon absorption rates and to initiate a monitoring and restoration programme that will have direct and indirect benefits to the society and the environment.

# 6. Wave Energy Harnessing for Water Desalination (CA_6: Wave energy production)

## Action Description

One alternative towards decarbonisation is the exploitation of wave energy. Although not an off-the-shelf solution, the technology and expertise exist but need to be quantitively and otherwise examined. Wave energy, can contribute immensely if a commercial, economically viable, low electricity cost generation Wave Energy Converter (WEC) is deployed. Having 15-20 times more available energy per square metre than wind or solar, five times greater power flow intensity as well as being more persistent than wind power flow, justifies why wave energy has for many decades attracted inventors to harvest it by improvising various

#

devices and mechanisms. It is estimated by the World Energy Council that the exploitable energy potential is at 2 Terra Watts (TW). The global wave power available including open oceans however, is estimated to be of the order of 10 TW, figures well comparable with the world's present power consumption. It was as early as 1799 when the first patent for wave energy conversion system was made by the French Monsieur Girard and his son. Their invention aimed at exploiting mechanical energy directly in order to drive saws, mills pumps and other heavy machinery.

The objectives of this project consider a renewable energy system that harnesses towards Limassol's decarbonisation. Specifically, this conceptual idea focuses on water desalination and has the following specific objectives:

Exploit water waves near the coasts in order to

a. acquire data for the wave potential around Limassol coastal region
b. develop, based on environmental-impact assessment, projects promoting a renewable and cost-effective water-resource management towards decarbonization.
c. Carry out the required technical and economic for the optimum WEC penetration, impact and implementation.
d. Obtain the required licenses from responsible municipal/governmental departments/authorities.

Deploy an existing wave energy converter mechanism for off-shore and on-shore use based on integrated optimization of mechanical and hydrodynamic specifications, end-use purpose and environmental impact assessment issues. The WEC may be used for electricity generation and water desalination with countless uses.
Design and test pilot specimen in the sea water field and re-assess field optimization-based design for larger scale implementation.

The WEC will be able to handle extreme condition scenarios ranging from incident wave power levels originating from flat-seas to those levels generated from stormy weather conditions, constituting viable and reliable operation. Another advantage of the WEC is the low electricity generation cost that will add to the system's viability.

Certainly, wave energy technologies are still to a lesser or greater extent far from maturity. The potential for improvement of the techno-economical indicators of wave power conversion technologies is very large, while the survivability and the reliability of many devices, particularly for offshore operation, has still to be demonstrated.

Install heat pumps at commercial and residential buildings (with built environment)6. Centralised RES generation and long-term storage to satisfy increased demand from Mission actions. | 1. This action is beyond the control of the municipality, but it is significant. Cyprus will undergo a rapid expansion of its PV installed base in the next few years (leading up to 2030) and replace HFO and diesel use in power generation with Natural Gas. This will significantly lower the emissions factor for scope 2 emissions and has cascading effects on all measures that rely on grid electricity.2. Establish of energy community within the municipality of Limassol by engaging various stakeholders and citizens. The energy community will consist of a large-scale PV park and energy storage technologies, aiming to satisfy the energy demand of end users and make considerable GHG savings.3. Fresnel systems utilise solar energy and can provide heat at low and mid temperatures. Therefore, they can become an alternative option for supplying clean energy to commercial and industrial facilities.4. Install photovoltaics at residential buildings in Limassol with behind-the-meter storage systems. This action will turn citizens into prosumers and reduce electricity consumption from the grid significantly. In addition, installation of storage units will further increase energy autonomy.5. Heat pumps are considered to be the most efficient technology for thermal generation. They can be used to provide heating (including hot water) and cooling  |

This action proposes the installation of a hybrid RES system that consists of a large PV and wind park, coupled with Long-Term Energy Storage (LDES). The primary goal of this action is to satisfy the increased demand in electricity that arises from actions taken for Lemesos Mission, including elevated demand for EVs and heat pumps.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Built Environment | **Deep building renovation Actions**  |   |
|   |  Increasing the building refurbishment rate through a large-scale retrofitting program | The existing building stock is responsible for a substantial share of GHG emissions. Therefore, it is paramount to stimulate its deep renovation by establishing a large-scale retrofitting programme built on financial instruments designed to support urban rehabilitation and revitalisation. To achieve the NZC target, a yearly renovation rate of 35% is needed.  |
|   |  Providing NZC guidelines for deep building envelope refurbishment | Simplify design and deployment of deep renovation by providing prescriptive information and certified products identified to be suitable to reduce substantially building energy consumption and improve indoor thermal and visual comfort.  |
|   |  Making compulsory the installation of effective and movable external shadings | Protecting glazed surfaces from solar radiation is paramount in a cooling-dominate city like Limassol. Therefore, effective and adjustable external shading must be installed to protect all glazed surfaces. Reflective films could be adopted where external shading is not technically mountable. Still, care should be put into assessing the visual hazard caused to neighbour areas like streets, buildings, shops, and squares.  |
|   |  Banning oil boilers and replace with heat pumps | Ban oil boilers and provide incentives to install new high-efficiency heat pumps and enhance the insulation of heating/cooling piping.  |
|   |  Upgrading/replacing inefficient electromechanical systems | Legacy equipment in existing buildings is typically low performing. Upgrade/Replace electromechanical systems or subsystems to minimise generation and distribution losses, upgrade the smartness of the control subsystem and enhance heat emission. Installing ceiling fans in enclosed and transitional spaces has to be promoted because they are a cheap and effective solution to expand thermal comfort zone and repel mosquitos and flies.  |
|   |  Making compulsory the installation of individual energy accounting | According to European Directive 2012/27/UE, make monitoring and accounting systems mandatory in all building units.  |
|   |  Promoting behavioural change and people's awareness | Promoting behavioural change and awareness by educating building occupants on energy-saving practices with continuous communication and information about the achievement of the project. A specialized app could provide notifications to building users to inform of environmental conditions and alert on energy wasteful conditions  |

|   | Promoting building-integrated RES | While Cyprus has a large installed capacity of solar thermal collectors, the integration of PV panels on the building has to be pushed. This action opportunely implemented provides shading to buildings. Several actions are listed and described in the Energy Systems section.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Promoting building-integrated electricity storage | The objective is to increase the self-consumption of electricity from RES locally generated to reduce the energy withdrawals from the grid. This action provides the reduction of the needed power capacity, room for energy flexibility and contributes to a more robust energy system.  |
|   |  Integrating EV chargers in residential and office buildings | While implementing deep renovation, installing EV chargers implies limited additional costs if properly designed and executed. But it would contribute to creating a city-wide infrastructure necessary to support the shift from inter-combustion-engine vehicles to electric vehicles.  |
|   |  Completing installation of smart meters in all units (buildings, dwellings) | Cyprus is guilty of lagging in the installation of smart meters. The City of Limassol must accelerate to complete the full coverage of the installation of smart meters at the soonest. While installing the smart meter, a scalable, modular, interoperable digital platform for data acquisition must be implemented looking to the needs for a future open electricity market ready for local electricity exchange and flexibility bids. A city-wide digital platform is needed also to accommodate the needs for a future open electricity market ready for local electricity exchange and flexibility bids.  |
|   |  New carbon-neutral buildings Action  |   |
|   |  Stating the carbon neutrality target for new buildings | The achievement of carbon neutrality shall be set as a mandatory requirement for new constructions and building renovation with demolition and reconstruction in order to avoid any carbon lock-in mechanism.  |
|   |  Providing NZC guidelines for carbon-neutral buildings | Simplify design and deployment of new carbon-neutral buildings by providing prescriptive information and certified products identified to be suitable to reduce substantially building energy consumption, improve indoor thermal and visual comfort, and generate considerable renewable energy on site. Promote the re-naturalization interventions, also considering the integration of NBSs in the buildings as carbon sinks.  |
|   |  Developing and providing a standard calculation tool for the verification of building GHG emissions | The Limassol Municipality, supported by its scientific partners, should develop a standard calculation tool for the verification of the GHG emission of a building to enable professionals and constructors to verify and optimize their projects.  |

The needed re-naturalized green area, beyond the already existing one, can be achieved combining (shares that need to be set) permeable ground surfaces, semipermeable greenified surfaces, green roofs, green walls. This measure also contributes to increase urban resilience against flooding  |

|   |  **Urban regeneration**  |   |
|   |  **Studying city-wide climate-change adaptation strategies** | To take advantage of the city's coastal position at the feet of the Troodos mountains, a microclimate study of the city is needed to identify, describe and quantify the natural and anthropogenic phenomena that can be eighter threatening or beneficial to the urban microclimate. Also, it would be helpful to identify areas of the city particularly exposed to reach unbearable environmental conditions resulting in climate hotspots. This study could suggest both city-wide and local adaptation strategies.  |
|   |  **Creating a Breathable City** | It refers to introducing the concept of the Breathable city in the urban planning regulation and design practices that aims to:
Design buildings and structures preserving urban corridors to maximise airflow and facilitate the movement of sea breezes;
Preserve urban corridors aligned to prevailing winds;
Incorporate building setbacks and courtyards to create open spaces within urban corridors;
Narrowing the width of urban corridors to increase wind speed,
Implement a monitoring and evaluation system to assess the effectiveness of the measures taken via a specialized app or module
Avoid wind blockage.  |
|   |  **Establishing a city-wide monitoring network** | Instal a network of weather stations in several spots of the city to monitor environmental parameters affecting citizens' health and quality of life, for example, the thermal environment and air and noise pollution.  |
|   |  **Resurfacing urban horizontal surfaces to increase albedo** | The increased albedo of urban surfaces helps to reduce the amount of solar energy trapped in the city, mitigating the urban heat island and reducing the formation of ozone due to a photochemical reaction.
Replacement of the road asphalt with cool asphalt.
Replacement of dark pavements and paved areas of open spaces with light materials.
Ban dark finishing for rooftops and promote cool material, and NSB, like green roofs where possible  |
|   |  **Introducing urban shading systems** | During summer months, the utilisation of open spaces is strongly affected by the intense solar radiation coupled with high ambient temperatures. This affects walkability, cycling, and, in general, standing in outdoors.  |

|   |  | Urban shading systems protect citizens from direct solar radiation and can provide additional features like increasing reflection in the sky, generating renewable energy or acting as carbon sinks. Examples are: - Tents, canopies, rollers - PV panel - NBSs like plant covers or trees In some cases, prior to expert assessment, this action can be complemented by installing mists for reducing ambient temperature using evaporative cooling.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Enhancing green and blue infrastructures in the city | It refers to increasing vegetation and water elements to improve urban biodiversity and ecological balance. - Invigorate green spaces in urban areas, like parks, gardens, streets; map the temperature difference and pollution levels between green areas and built-up areas using digital means - Incorporate water elements like fountains, ponds, channels - Replace impervious surfaces with open soil.  |
|   |  Co-designing sustainable best practices | Any Action to be effective should be designed to meet the needs of the specified target group it tackles. This requires that the sustainable actions needed to achieve the NZC target are properly validated by citizens and other city stakeholders. In this regard, co-design of sustainable best practices is a must, and it has to involve all components of the local community in the planning and design processes.  |
|   |  Educational campaigns | These are fundamental to raise awareness about the importance of thermal comfort, pollution reduction, and sustainable practices in open urban space and engage and inform the community about the benefits of adopting environmentally friendly behaviours.  |
|   |  Creating beautiful and inclusive public spaces | While the NZC target is emissions oriented, the renovation of a city affects a large number of services, functions and activities provided or done in a city. The NZC mission is an unrepeatable opportunity to prepare Limassol to tackle the challenge of the future well beyond its ambitious emission target. Also, to stimulate citizens to a more emission-effective lifestyle, the city must be more beautiful and inclusive by incorporating public amenities, enhancing lighting and safety and integrating public art, following the New European Bauhaus initiative.  |
|   |  Encourage mixed-use planning | Mixed-use planning aims to encourage mixed-use development to create a diverse range of activities within open urban spaces. Incorporate residential, commercial, cultural, and recreational functions to promote a vibrant and dynamic atmosphere.  |
|   |  Support flexible and adaptable design of open spaces | Flexible and adaptable design of open spaces can accommodate a variety of uses and activities. Incorporate movable furniture, modular elements, and adaptable layouts to allow for different configurations and events  |

Strategies enhancing micro-mobility modal split
Development of comprehensive pedestrian network
Establishment of vehicle electrification strategies
Strategies improving the efficiency of freight transportation
Optimization of transportation demand (TDM strategies)
Incorporation of smart technologies in sustainable transportation strategies | 1. Development of an integrated public transport network (including infrastructure) with multiple modes of transportation, by optimizing the routes to improve efficiency and providing real-time passenger information and ticketing technology, while also establishing multimodal transportation hubs and promoting the implementation of bus prioritization measures.
Prepare an integrated network of bike lanes and paths for all types of cyclists that integrates micro-mobility solutions such as e-scooters and bike-sharing programs into the transportation network, while also expanding bike parking facilities at key locations throughout the city and collaborating with local businesses and organizations to offer incentives for cycling and micro-mobility use, such as discounts or rewards programs
Develop and implement a comprehensive pedestrian network with adequate infrastructure and facilities to ensure safe and convenient access throughout the Municipality, while also prioritizing pedestrian-oriented streetscape improvements, pedestrian-friendly paths and establishing pedestrian zones in key commercial and residential areas
Advance the electrification of private vehicles by increasing Municipality’s preparedness via the construction of charging stations in public spaces, commercial centers, and residential areas and implementing smart charging systems to manage peak energy demands using renewable energy sources, while also integrating charging infrastructure in urban planning and collaborate with private companies to install charging stations in their parking lots or garages, while also including the conversion of bus fleet to electric.
Encourage the use of low-emission vehicles for freight transport but mostly consolidating freight shipments to reduce the number of trips and provision of incentives to private companies to switch to sustainable freight transportation, whilst improving the efficiency of last-mile delivery (e.g., using cargo bikes, electric vans) and implementing a smart logistics system to optimize transport routes and reduce emissions at the Municipal level
Develop a comprehensive transportation demand management plan that implements traffic management strategies that aim to regulate (or restrict) vehicle-access, by disincentivizing private vehicle use through the introduction of parking management  |

Implement actions that use smart technologies. For example, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to monitor traffic and adjust traffic signals, integrate traffic data with public transportation schedules to improve transit connections and uses ITS to optimize freight logistics and reduce emissions. Also, implement Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) by providing online trip planning tools that include public transportation, bike-sharing, car-sharing, and ride-sharing options, cooperative connected and automated mobility (CCAM) services, mobile payment systems for public transportation and parking and provision of on-demand ride-sharing services for commuters and people with disabilities in order to build a holistic cyber-physical system.  |

|  Waste & circular economy | Waste segregation (in house/in bussiness) to remove organic waste for energy and fertilizer production | The action targets towards the effective implementation of EU waste directives in Lemesos. Currently, a large part of the MSW is landfilled and the high organic load yields high GHG emissions from the landfills (plus additional environmental and public health problems). The target is to separately collect organic waste (e.g., household, restaurants, bakeries) and divert them in existing energy production facilities (e.g., anaerobic digestion and electricity generation). This action will contribute to reducing the emission factor from the landfill, which is among the highest in the EU due to the high organic load. According to our estimations, separate collection of organic waste to produce energy and fertilizer leads to 80% reduction of the GHG emissions related to MSW management in Lemesos. Additional removal of recyclable material could increase the reduction up to 90%. Initials steps could be also conducted for the design of a waste to energy facility in Lemesos, supporting the national targets for waste management and GHG emissions reduction.  |
|   |  1.1. Quantify waste amounts and streams | During the first year (2024) a detailed survey for monitoring the amount of waste produced in Lemesos and more important the waste streams (e.g., paper, plastic, organic) will be implemented. This is the basis for designing an effective waste management system. The currently available data are considered outdated.  |
|   |  1.2 Reschedule waste collection and handling system | The waste collection system (infrastructure, machinery, people, collection routes etc) will be examined. The capacity to design a separate collection of the organic fraction will be evaluated. Currently, the municipality mainly collects mixed solid waste from residences and private buildings. Green dot collects separately PMD but the recyclable material collection rate is considered low for the municipality (est. <50%). The facility(-ies) for  |

|   |  | delivering the organic fraction for energy production (anaerobic digestion) will be determined. One possibility exists in Pentakomo (MSW treatment facility) and the other is to contact Anaerobic Digester owners in Cyprus, in proximity to the city of Lemesos.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  1.3. Pilot separate collection of organic waste in selected city areas | During the second year (2025) pilot projects will be launched for separate collection of organic material at the household and private company level. Most of the organic material comes from commercial activity (e.g., bakeries, restaurants, hotels). The organic waste will be also collected from green spaces. The organic fraction will be used for energy and organic fertilizer production.  |
|   |  1.4. Educate, train citizens in municipal solid waste segregation at the household or business levels | During the first two years (2024-2025) training (co-workshops and “Lemesos Commons”) will be employed to educate/train on aspects related to sustainable waste management. Focus will be on avoiding organic waste and then to separate handling of this resource. Small scale composting of green material and selected food waste (e.g., vegetables) will be demonstrated. This material could be used as soil amendment in micro-forests (see relevant activity – Green infrastructure).  |
|   |  1.5. Incentives for participating in pilots vs. “pay as you throw” | The citizens involved in the pilots will be benefited from reduced fee on waste collection and handling (payed annually to the municipality). However, the upscaling will involve the application of the “pay as you throw” and “polluters pay” principles. There will be interaction to activity 1.4 for training citizens and professionals and preparing them for the change. Codesign solutions will be also focus (participatory workshops; “Lemesos Commons”)  |
|   |  1.6. Evaluation and upscaling | The target is to remove organic material (90%) from the municipal solid waste by 2030, to drastically reduce the emissions related to landfills. Half of the MSW annual weight (approx. 25 ktons) is organic material. Removing this, also leads to reduced impacts due to landfill operation. The pilots will be used for upscaling, going from blocks to neighborhoods and the city. The upscaling will be the point where increased financial needs will be required (e.g., personnel, facilities, equipment) to support separate collection of the organic fraction. According to our estimations, separate collection of organic waste to produce energy and fertilizer leads to -80% reduction of the GHG emissions related to MSW management in Lemesos.  |
|   |  1.7. Monitoring GHG emissions | A monitoring system will be implemented to measure Landfill emissions (current and future), evaluate the anaerobic digester operation efficiency and related emissions, electricity production and its emission factor and the environmental benefits/costs. It will be linked to the city Waste Management system and digital twin. This will support scenario making and impact assessment of interventions towards zero emissions for waste.  |
|   |  1.8. Waste to energy facility | A feasibility study will be done to assess the potential of creating a waste to energy facility in Lemesos which could contain several components (e.g., anaerobic digester,  |

|   |  | Refuse derived paper and plastics densified Fuel (RPF) etc). The study will include the technical and economic aspects (e.g., investments, capacity). The facility could support circular economy plans at the national level.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Zero waste production (circular economy) in Lemesos | The action capitalizes the outcomes of Action 1, to go one step further to remove all the recyclable materials in the MSW (e.g., plastic, metals, textile, inert). This will lead to zeroing the amount of waste that goes to the landfills. It will follow a similar approach to action 1 (small projects and upscaling). Beyond this, the potential to establish material reusing and recycling facilities in Lemesos will be examined. As it is, PMD is collected, stored and exported to recycling factories in the EU (which increases GHG emissions due to shipping transportation).  |
|   |  2.1. “Pay as your throw – Polluters pay” | “Pay as you throw” and “polluters pay” are two key principles for waste management at the EU scale. To support waste production reduction, these approaches will be implemented. “Pay as you throw” pilots have been implemented in other Cypriot municipalities (e.g., Aglantzia) and lessons learned will be capitalized to run the model in Lemesos. Recent EU guidelines urge for its implementation towards waste reduction. Technically, each household or company waste bin will be related with an ID (e.g., barcode) and the amount of waste delivered weekly will be monitored. The payment for waste collection and treatment will be according to the amount of waste delivered. “Polluters pay” is tailored for the commercial or industrial level. Companies delivering bulk waste or hazardous waste will take over the costs for treatment. Pilot projects will kick off the implementation of these principles in Lemesos and upscaling will follow by 2030.  |
|   |  2.2. Desing a “circular economy” facility | The implementation of the actions and activities related to sustainable waste management will lead to a detailed inventory of the amounts produced for the various waste streams. Currently, recyclable material collection is low in Lemesos (and Cyprus) in comparison to other EU areas. In addition, recyclable material is not processed in Cyprus but transferred to other countries, where facilities exist. The Mission will start the process of designing a facility for recycling (e.g., plastic, paper). During the first 3 years (2024-2027) feasibility studies will be conducted, policy and funding instruments will be explored. This task contributes to the reduction of Scope 3 emissions (e.g., global transportation) but it is important towards circular economy and green jobs creation in Lemesos and Cyprus.  |
|   |  2.3. MEL for circular economy in Lemesos | Monitoring waste production, environmental benefits vs impacts, education and learning KPIs. This is essential for the implementation of actions and activities.  |
|  2.4. Networking and expertise transfer (national and international) | Networking with stakeholders (national and international) and experience transfer locally, nationally and internationally (training, story telling) will be implemented regarding the work on sustainable solid waste management.  |   |

Sinking Potential of Seagrass Meadows in the Limassol Bay
Wave Energy Harnessing for Water Desalination | 1. The Cold Ironing initiative at Limassol Port aims at electrical power supply from the shore to ships while they are docked. By replacing onboard diesel engine produced power with a more sustainable energy sources, the initiative seeks to drastically cut emissions, improve air quality, and pave the way for a greener future in maritime operations. The action is guided and aligned with several EU directives and regulations making it somewhat easier to push forward and with significant impact. Direct positive impacts are expected on the health and well-being of the local community, as well as on the overall environmental quality of the region. Furthermore, the project promotes sustainable development and the transition to a low-carbon economy.

This action focuses on the Limassol Marina ecosystem to transform it into a “carbon neutral cell” for the city of Limassol. Initiatives such as Renewable Energy Sources investments, electrical charges, building energy management systems etc. will be adopted to decarbonize the area. Synergistic approaches will be implemented to monitor emissions, use state-of-the-art technologies and achieve carbon neutrality, which will deliver social surplus and private benefit. The implementation of an “energy community” model with the involvement of all marina users will also be explored.

Focuses on developing and establishing an integrated digitalised surveillance, recording and processing marine pollution system as an integrated and holistic solution for the marine ecosystem, with the aid of technology (e.g., sensors, USV, e-platform), which will provide an early warning system when an environmental risk is identified and will be available to end-users.

Focuses on the development of a multi-faceted urban regeneration tool, aiming at emissions reduction through enhancing the sense of community and their responsiveness toward environmental issues, which are eroded fast by a rapid-changing economy of Limassol during the last two decades. The project will define and selectively measure, energy consumption/emission patterns and define resilience levels in terms of environmental, social, and economic challenges. The investigatory methodology will draw from well documented concepts such as the ‘15 minutes city’ or the ‘healthy neighbourhood’, tailored to the very different cultural and climatic context of the eastern Mediterranean.

The assessment of Carbon Sinking Potential of Seagrass Meadows in Limassol Bay action aims at assessing the sequestered carbon stock in the present meadows and to initiate a monitoring and restoration programme that will have direct and indirect benefits  |

|   |  | to the society and the environment. The seagrass species Posidonia oceanica, provides a variety of ecosystem services including carbon sequestration ('blue carbon'), water purification, nutrient cycling, habitat formation sustaining hundreds of species and it also supports many recreational and economic activities. The restoration and monitoring programme of one of the most important carbon sinks in Limassol Bay has impacts relevant to environmental assessment, new technologies adoption, policy reforms and social capital. 6. The Wave Energy Harnessing for Water Desalination project aims at reduction of CO2 emissions from conventional desalination systems and serve as a flagship project that can attract global visibility with promotional value for the city of Limassol. The project includes a feasibility study and technological implementation for optimum Wave Energy Converter (WEC) deployment and impact. Also, the deployment of a WEC for off-shore and on-shore use for water desalination, and possibly for electricity generation purposes, as well as the design and test of a pilot in the sea water and field optimisation-based design will pave the way for larger scale implementation. Environmental, economic and social benefits will be achieved, as well promotional value benefits for the mission and the city.  |

| --- | --- | --- |
|  Action outline | Action name | Energy Community  |
|   |  Action type | Infrastructure  |
|   |  Action description | This action will be implemented in the city of Limassol. A Renewable Energy Community will be formed following an initiative from the municipality to engage citizens and demonstrate the advantages of forming, joining, and operating an energy community. This community will follow the energy cooperative business model. Technically, the community will incorporate a renewables generation method coupled with energy storage and smart control of all loads. In this activity a PV park of 1 MW coupled with a 4h battery storage will be established at a dedicated plot of land, which will satisfy the electricity needs of approximately 500 residential units. This action will create the first energy community in Cyprus.
Beyond the stationary battery storage, the community will have smart meters at the point of consumption/production of every prosumer and will allow the energy exchange between electric vehicles and residential buildings. Particularly the vehicle-to-house (V2H) concept considers electric vehicles as storage units (batteries), which can offer energy to a building. This will allow for a better integration and utilization of renewables  |

A detailed business model will be drafted at a later stage, describing all related financial and operational aspects. The business model and the structure of the community needs to be decided by its members in a participatory manner, following the local legislative and regulatory framework. The most common business model for an energy community is the one of an energy cooperative, in which generation technologies belong to the community. In this model the energy community can install a “centralised” photovoltaics park, which will serve the needs of its members.  |

|   |  Action description | Fresnel systems utilise solar thermal energy and can provide heat at low and mid temperatures (in the 140-350°C range). They can therefore become an alternative option for supplying clean energy to commercial and industrial facilities by augmenting (or even replacing) process heat processes.
This action aims to promote the installation of 1MWth of Fresnel systems at industrial facilities to provide thermal energy. The advantage of thermal systems for such uses is the direct heat replacement (in some cases), the modularity and the ability to install them on existing roofs. In addition, the system can provide 2 hours of storage.  |

|   |  | Installation of residential photovoltaics in Cyprus is eligible under the scheme of net-metering or net-billing. Typically, residential units install 4 kW and are registered in the net-metering scheme. In addition, installation of storage units will further increase versatility of the system and reduction in possible curtailments, as well allow for arbitrage (when allowed).  |

| --- | --- | --- |
|  Action outline | Action name | Heat pumps  |
|   |  Action type | Infrastructure  |
|   |  Action description | Heat pumps are considered to be the most efficient technology for thermal generation. They can be used to provide heating (including hot water) and cooling in buildings. These units can replace boilers or other conventional technologies and reduce carbon emissions significantly. Heat pumps can be installed at new buildings or at existing buildings under renovation and replace older technologies. There are several types of heat pumps (e.g. air/air, air/water, water/water), each one having different characteristics and cost. Given the characteristics of Limassol, and the local needs, it is suggested that air/water heat pumps should be installed to directly replace heating systems based on fossil fuels. This action targets the installation of heat pumps at 1,500 buildings, out of which 500 will be commercial buildings all of them (old stock renovated) and 1,000 will be residential units, again all renovated. Data provided to the team show Limassol to posses 41,247 buildings of all types in 2018.  |

|   |  Comments on implementation | The procurement and installation of this amount of heat pumps would be a major challenge for several reasons, such as availability of materials and availability of technicians. Moreover, heat pumps have a significant high capital cost. Timeline: • 2024 – 2030: Installation of approximately 220 units each year, in addition to what's prescribed by the NECP. Scalability: • Minimum size: 30 kW • Minimum cost: €30k • Maximum size: 58 MW • Maximum cost: €58.6m Barriers The replacement of existing diesel burners with heat pumps in existing buildings is a challenge for blocks of flats who need a collective decision for such significant investments. Also, the availability of skilled technicians to carry out all these projects comes with question marks. There is also a question on the ability of the grid to absorb the extra demand, esp. at times with low RES generation such as evening hours and at winter time.  |
|  Impact & cost | Generated renewable energy (if applicable) | Heat pumps do not directly generate renewable energy but are efficient converters of ambient energy to either heating or cooling using electricity. In the scenario examined for this report they are estimated to generate 10,800 MWh of heating and 19,200 MWh of cooling each year. Despite the fact that replacing older stock of inefficient A/C split units in existing buildings will be a realistic method to reduce energy demand, this action focusses on replacement of fossil fuel-fired heating systems only.  |
|   |  Removed/substituted energy, volume or fuel type | It is estimated that the heating requirement will be lowered by around 25,200 MWh of energy.  |

|  B-2.2.6: Energy Systems_Action 6: Centralised RES generation and long-term storage to satisfy increased demand from Mission actions (EA_5: RES generation and long-term storage)  |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Action outline | Action name | Centralised RES generation and long-term storage  |
|   |  Action type | Infrastructure  |
|   |  Action description | This action will be implemented in the city of Limassol or in its approximate vicinity. The aim is to build a hybrid PV/Wind energy system with a total joint size of 45 MW that will be combined with energy storage. The size of the proposed system makes its construction within city limits unrealistic, so a suitable area should be found. The proposed system presents a supply curve that matches better with the demand in 2030 from the increased load that it targets, which is estimated as shown below: Demand from new EVs 27.32 MWh Demand from shared EVs 9.93 MWh Demand for electric buses 25.54 MWh Demand from new Heat Pumps 11.05 MWh Total 73.84 MWh Electrical private cars have a demand curve that tends to spike in the morning hours in case owners charge at their workplace, or in the evening hours when the arrive at home (typically in the 18:00 – 21:00 window, and for a duration of about 3 hours). Heat Pump demand also matches a similar pattern, especially in heating mode. The supply from a PV system therefore would not match very well, hence the proposal to couple it with a wind onshore power system that will complement the supply and reduce the need for energy storage. The storage system targeted in this action is a Long-Term Energy Storage solution (LDES, which typically serves loads for over 6h) that will effectively use energy generated during the day and deliver it to the load when needed. It is hence not designed to offer short term support to the grid that batteries would be best to do, but to shift the unused supply within a day for when needed. Several technologies for LDES exist, the prime proposal for this action is a battery that stores excess in a thermal medium (such as a molten salt) and reconverts heat to electricity using a Rankine cycle steam turbine. Such systems already exist in Cyprus at research sites (an example is at PROTEAS, around 20km from Limassol). Other options exist such as flow batteries or compressed air energy storage (CAES).  |

LIMSSOL2030

|   |  | Apart from the fact that the physical location of the proposed energy generation and storage will not be within city limits, the electricity it generates and delivers will be supplied to the centralised national grid. It is therefore impossible to count it against the Limassol targets unless there is an explicit agreement between the city and the Transmission System Operator. Such an agreement is unprecedent, but a possible model could be the one of energy communities (see action 2 above), where the whole city becomes and energy community assuming a separate legal status and deals with the rest of the grid as a singular entity.

In parallel, actions should be taken to influence the demand side in order to better match the supply wit demand. For example, the municipality might choose to deploy EV chargers along a street that will charge EVs using a very low tariff during time of production form the RES system, a little higher when it's supplied from storage, and very high when taking from the grid.

The complexity and need to optimise such a solution, matters of demand-side management, the issue of representing the city and a singular entity, as well as the engineering, siting and connection issues it presents should be the subject of a detailed feasibility study, along the lines of other such actions within the Action Plan (such as the tram).  |

|  | Comments on implementation | Implementing such a large-scale (for Limassol standards) project is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders. A critical aspect is the correct optimisation of the system to serve city needs, and effective deployment of demand-side management measures, and the legal representation of the city. Another critical aspect is the financing of the project, given that setting up an energy community will require access to financing mechanisms.

Additionally, several other technologies were considered but are not presented in detail for various reasons. The Following table presents a summary of those examined or considered as realistic options for Limassol:

|  Technology | Notes  |
| --- | --- |
|  Community district cooling | What it is:A central system that lowers the temperature of water that is then is directed through pipelines to centrally cool down the buildings connected to it.Reasons not to include it:A recent (2018) study4 commissioned by the Cyprus ministry of energy to assess the potential for heating and cooling district networks in ten different urban areas in Cyprus found that it made economic sense for only two of those, and only using non-renewable energy sources. These findings were corroborated in the latest NECP strategy document where district cooling was considered a non-viable solution.Other comments:The high upfront cost of either a centralised heat pump system or an absorption chiller is one of the reasons for non-inclusion, but also other barriers such as the roadworks required to lay the pipeline network.  |
|  Central Energy Storage system | What it is:A centralised energy storage system at city level would theoretically allow the local RES generation to be stored, stabilised, and returned to the local demand at times of no RES production.Reasons not to include it:Including energy storage under the energy community action proposal covers this usage case at a very large degree.Not possible to ascertain its savings potential without modelling, which is beyond the scope of this study.Other comments:A case can be made that different technology types may be more suitable to a city-wide storage project, other than batteries. Thermal storage is a prime candidate that is charged either by thermal sources (such as a CSP system) or by electricity from renewables, preferably curtailed generation.  |
|  Demand response measures across the municipality | What it is:Demand response refers to balancing the demand on power grids by encouraging customers to shift electricity demand to times when electricity is more plentiful or other demand is lower.  |
LIMASSOL2030

|   | Reasons not to include it: Demand response should essentially incentivise demand to shift to times of more RES generation that would address the curtailment of generation that the country is now facing. Assessing the emissions reduction potential of such measures is very hard without dynamic modelling of the energy system, something beyond the scope of this report. It is kept on the list of future actions in case a more in-depth analysis is required. Other comments: This is an effective measure only in the presence of smart meters in every building and the deployment of smart devices that would automatically adjust demand based on external signals (usually price of electricity). This deployment needs to happen quickly.  |

|   |  Action description | Deep building renovation refers to the comprehensive process of upgrading and refurbishing existing buildings to significantly improve their energy efficiency, sustainability, and overall performance. It involves a thorough assessment of the building's envelope, HVAC systems, insulation, lighting, electric appliances and other components to identify areas for improvement. Deep building renovation aims to reduce energy consumption, lower GHG emissions, enhance indoor comfort and extend the lifespan of existing buildings while aligning them with modern energy and sustainability standards. It contributes to the transition towards a greener and more sustainable built environment. This can be achieved by: Increasing the building refurbishment rate through a large-scale retrofitting programme Establishing a large-scale retrofitting programme built on financial instruments. For example:  |
LIMASSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

A tax relief consisting of a substantial deduction of the expenses incurred for implementing specific interventions aimed at achieving a very high level of energy efficiency.
The subsidised interventions can also include installing photovoltaic systems and infrastructure for recharging electric vehicles in buildings.

The target is to achieve a renovation rate of at least 3.5%.

The deep building envelope refurbishment shall consider:

Laying of high-performance thermal insulation externally on the roof and external walls. Insulation helps in reducing heat transfer through the building envelope, minimising the amount of heat entering the building during hot summer months or leaving the building in winter months. It is recommended a maximum thermal transmittance of:
External walls: ≤ 0.4 W/m²/K.
Roofs: ≤ 0.3 W/m²/K.
Ground floor slabs: ≤ 0.5 W/m²/K.

Applying cool roofing materials that have high solar reflectance and thermal emittance. Cool roofs reflect a huge portion of solar radiation, reducing heat transfer to the building and keeping the interior cooler. It is recommended
Solar reflectance: ≥ 65%.
While conventional roofs (with solar reflectance of 5-15%) can be 31-47°C hotter than the ambient temperature on any given day, it is expected that cool roofs will only have a surface temperature of 6-11°C higher than the ambient temperature.
Ban for dark roofs.

Replacing low-performing windows with low-emission and high-airtightness double-glazed windows. Promote the installation of smart glasses (spectrally selective, chromogenic and electrochromic glasses), which provide excellent daylight quality and control solar and thermal gains. These windows can reduce heat gain while still allowing natural light into the building. It is recommended that:
Thermal transmittance of window frame + glazing: ≤ 2.25 W/m²/K.
Set limits for window-to-wall ratio for exposure for building type.

Adding adjustable, external shading devices (blinds, shades, or awnings) on fenestration or add reflective film on windows where the external shading is not technically viable. These measures can significantly reduce solar heat gain and improve the energy efficiency of windows. Control of external shading devices could be managed by an app to optimize solar gain and daylight levels according to the season and needs

Promoting the use of phase-changing materials for amortise the solar and heat gains inside buildings and improve their indoor environmental quality.

Promote the use of nature-based solutions like green roof and green walls, which provide energy savings and surface temperature regulation, improved air quality, noise reduction, stormwater management, biodiversity and habitat creation, and enhanced aesthetics, beyond enabling urban agriculture and food production.

Foster natural ventilation by incorporating features such as operable windows, indoor vents, cross-ventilation strategies, or stack effect to facilitate the movement of fresh air and dissipate heat during cooler periods.

Upgrade/Replace electromechanical systems:
Ban oil boilers and replace low-performance air-conditioning systems with reversible high-performance heat pumps (action that implies a substantial enhancement of air quality in the urban environment), which significantly decrease building energy consumption and decrease peak electricity demand.
Replacement of low-performance circulator pumps with high-efficiency variable speed circulators which reduce energy consumption for distribution by up to 80%.
Insulate mandatory all external pipes of the distribution of heating and cooling systems.
Promote the installation of mechanical ventilation systems with proper filtering with high-efficiency double flow heat recovery unit for reducing dust contamination of indoor spaces and energy efficiency.
Minimum heat recovery efficiency: ≥ 80%.
Promote the installation of dehumidificators to reduce excess relative humidity for better thermal comfort and health.
Introduce energy management systems to implement intelligent energy management strategies that optimize the operation of HVAC systems, lighting, and other building systems based on occupancy patterns and environmental conditions for saving energy, enhancing comfort conditions and providing a healthy indoor environment. Leveraging IoT devices used for smart-up existing buildings, a specialized app could provide users the capacity to control their thermal environment and save energy while increasing personally perceived thermal comfort and productivity.
Deploy smart and intelligent technologies for an effective demand-side management of the buildings. Leveraging IoT devices used for smart-up existing buildings, a specialized app could provide users the capacity to control their thermal environment and save energy while increasing personally perceived thermal comfort and productivity.
Install RES systems to provide a share of renewable energy sources in primary energy consumption ≥ 20%.
Replace traditional incandescent or fluorescent lighting with energy-efficient alternatives such as LED (Light-Emitting Diode) lighting. LEDs consume significantly less energy, produce less heat, and have longer lifespans.
Install on a large-scale smart meter and conduct regular (automatized) energy audits to identify areas of energy loss, inefficiency, or fault. Monitor energy consumption through smart meters and use the data to make informed decisions regarding energy-saving measures. A specialized app for the Municipality and TSO/DSO officers implemented on the city digital twin would provide useful (almost) real-time data on energy uses and aggregated metrics/KPIs to performance evaluation
Study the feasibility of the installation of a district cooling network.

Promoting behavioural change and awareness by educating building occupants on energy-saving practices, such as:
Using natural ventilation when dust concentration is low.
Adjusting thermostat settings.
Turning off lights when not in use.
Using energy-efficient electrical appliances (estimated to reduce energy consumption in the order of 20%).
Not lower that class C (according to the new labelling system in force since 1st March 2021).

A specialized app could provide notifications to building users to inform of environmental conditions and alert on energy wasteful conditions

|   | Adopting ultra-high-efficiency standards for constructing new buildings, like the voluntary Passivhaus certification scheme. This requires: ·Laying of high-performance thermal insulation externally on the roof and external walls. It is recommended a maximum thermal transmittance of: ○ External walls: ≤ 0.2 W/m²/K (current nZEB requirement ≤ 0.4 W/m²/K). ○ Roofs: ≤ 0.15 W/m²/K (current nZEB requirement ≤ 0.4 W/m²/K). ○ Ground floor slabs: 0.5 W/m²/K (current nZEB requirement not specified). ·Applying cool roofing materials that have high solar reflectance and thermal emittance. It is recommended ○ Solar reflectance: ≥ 65%. ○ While conventional roofs (with solar reflectance of 5-15%) can be 31-47°C hotter than the ambient temperature on any given day, it is expected that cool roofs will only have a surface temperature of 6-11°C higher than the ambient temperature. ·Installing low-emission and high-airtightness double- or triple-glazed windows. Promote the installation of smart glasses (spectrally selective, chromogenic and electrochromic glasses). It is recommended that: ○ Thermal transmittance of window frame: ≤ 1.5 W/m²/K. ○ Thermal transmittance of glazing: ≤ 1.0 W/m²/K. ○ Set limits for window-to-wall ratio for exposure for building type. ·Adding adjustable, external shading devices (blinds, shades, or awnings) on fenestration or adding reflective film on windows where the external shading is not technically viable. Control of external shading devices could be managed by an app to optimize solar gain and daylight levels according to the season and needs ·Promoting the use of phase-changing materials to amortise the solar and heat gains inside buildings and improve their indoor environmental quality. ·Promote the use of nature-based solutions, like green roof and green walls, which provide energy savings and surface temperature regulation, improved air quality, noise reduction, stormwater management, biodiversity and habitat creation, and enhanced aesthetics, beyond enabling urban agriculture and food production. ·Foster natural ventilation by incorporating features such as operable windows, indoor vents, cross-ventilation strategies, or stack effect to facilitate the movement of fresh air and dissipate heat during cooler periods. Adopting high performance electromechanical systems ·Install mechanical ventilation systems with proper filtering with high-efficiency double flow heat recovery unit for reducing dust contamination of indoor spaces and energy efficiency. ○ Minimum heat recovery efficiency: ≥ 80%. ·Install RES systems to provide a yearly net zero energy balance. ·Install high-performance reversible heat pumps with meeting the targets of Tier II of ECODESIGN framework Directive (2009/125/EC). ·Insulate mandatory all external pipes of the distribution of heating and cooling systems. ·Install high-efficiency variable speed circulators which reduce energy consumption by up to 80%.  |

|  B-2.2.17: Waste Management and Circular Economy : Action 1_Waste segregation to remove organic waste for energy and fertilizer production (WA_1: Waste (organic) to energy)  |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Action outline | Action name | Waste segregation (in house/in bussiness) to remove organic waste for energy and fertilizer production  |
|   |  Action type | Infrastructure/awareness/education  |
|   |  Action description | The action targets towards the effective implementation of EU waste directives in Lemesos. Currently, a large part of the MSW is landfilled and the high organic load yields high GHG emissions from the landfills (plus additional environmental and public health problems). The target is to separately collect organic waste (e.g., household, restaurants, bakeries) and divert them in existing energy production facilities (e.g., anaerobic digestion and electricity generation). Limassol and Pentakomo treatment plants use anaerobic digesters to process organic waste, generating biogas for energy production. Diverting more organic waste to these digesters could increase biogas production, reducing environmental impact and contributing to the circular economy. The Limassol municipality could promote home composting among residents by providing education, resources, and possibly subsidized compost bins. This would decrease landfill waste and produce nutrient-rich compost for gardens and local green spaces. Lastly, the municipality could initiate a program for collecting used cooking oil, which can be recycled into biodiesel. This action will contribute to reducing the emission factor from the landfill, which is among the highest in the EU due to the high organic load. According to our estimations, separate collection of organic waste to produce energy and fertilizer leads to 80% reduction of the GHG emissions related to MSW management in Lemesos. Additional removal of recyclable material could increase the reduction up to 90%. Initials steps could be also conducted for the design of a waste to energy facility in Lemesos, supporting the national targets for waste management and GHG emissions reduction.  |
|  Reference to impact pathway | Field of action | Waste management  |
|   |  Systemic lever | Detailed description on B.1.1. Technology/Infrastructure: The utilization of anaerobic digesters in treatment plants to process organic waste and generate biogas is an example of applying technology for sustainable practices. Similarly, the infrastructure for collecting used cooking oil and transforming it into biodiesel falls into this category. The infrastructure for anaerobic digestion already exist to Pentakomo and Moni Waste Treatment Plants. Governance/Policy: The introduction of a program for separate collection of the organic waste (food, green) plus collecting used cooking oil and promoting home composting requires policy changes and oversight from the municipal government. Social Innovation: The idea of promoting home composting among residents, providing them with the necessary resources and education, is a form of social innovation that encourages sustainable practices at the household level. Learning and New Capabilities: By providing educational resources and workshops on home composting, the municipality fosters learning and the development of new capabilities among residents.  |

Partnerships with local businesses could be beneficial in enhancing the effectiveness and reach of these programs.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Impact & cost | Generated renewable energy (if applicable) | The organic fraction of the separated waste, which includes food and garden waste, could be directed towards an anaerobic digestion process. Anaerobic digestion involves breaking down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, leading to the production of biogas - a renewable energy source. This methane-rich biogas can then be captured and used for various purposes such as heating, electricity production, and even as a fuel for transportation. Therefore, by effectively implementing waste separation and management practices, the Limassol municipality not only promotes sustainable waste management but also contributes to renewable energy production, further enhancing its efforts towards becoming a carbon-neutral city.  |
|   |  Removed/substituted energy, volume or fuel type | According to available data on RE from organic waste in Cyprus (CYPRA-KEBE) 87.152 kWh are produced per ton of organic waste. Diverting 24779 tons/year of organic waste to produce RE will yield 2159 MWh of electricity.  |
|   |  GHG emissions reduction estimate (total) per emission source sector | As estimated based on the available data, 54176 tons per year mixed MSW go to the landfill. GHG (tCO2eq) = 43341 (54176 tons x 0.8 tons CO2eq/ton MSW) + 6501 (15% x 43341; emissions for collection and transportation) = 49842 Reducing by 90% the amount of organic waste that goes to the landfill results to -82.8% reduction in these emissions (41277 tons CO2eq).  |
|   |  Total costs and costs by CO2e unit | The Municipality estimates the costs for the equipment, materials and personnel to run the separate organic waste collection (plus renew of the old machinery, vehicles etc) to approx. 54 million euros (data available upon request). Accordingly, the cost for the GHG emissions mitigation is estimated to 1308 euros / ton CO2eq.  |

|   |  Action description | The action capitalizes the outcomes of Action 1, to go one step further to remove all the recyclable materials in the MSW (e.g., plastic, metals, textile, inert). This will lead to zeroing the amount of waste that goes to the landfills. It will follow a similar approach to action 1 (small projects and upscaling). Beyond this, the potential to establish material reusing and recycling facilities in Lemesos will be examined. As it is, PMD is collected, stored and exported to recycling factories in the EU (which increases GHG emissions due to shipping transportation). Based on the upcoming "Pay-as-You-Throw" scheme the municipality must educate residents about the benefits of waste separation and employ smart systems for monitoring. One  |

|   |  Action description | Phase A: Current status documentation – preliminary calculations – Data collectionConducting a feasibility study to document the conditions for the cold ironing study of the Limassol port involves a systematic examination of various factors. The study would typically assess the technical feasibility of implementing shore-side electricity infrastructure, considering aspects such as power supply availability, voltage requirements, and compatibility with existing ships. It would also evaluate the economic viability, including investment costs, operational expenses, and potential cost savings from reduced emissions. Environmental considerations, such as air quality improvements and greenhouse gas reductions, would be analyzed. In Phase A, a comprehensive examination of the port/ship interface will also be conducted. Additionally, stakeholder consultations, regulatory requirements, and potential challenges or constraints would be taken into account to provide a comprehensive analysis of the feasibility of cold ironing implementation in the Limassol port.Preliminary calculations will be based on:  |

|   |  | · The average consumption per vessel: An estimation of the average energy consumption per vessel during cold ironing will be determined based on historical data or industry standards. · The average residence time in port per vessel: The average duration that a vessel stays in the port (residence time) will be determined based on historical data or industry knowledge. · The energy requirement per vessel: The energy requirement per vessel can be calculated by considering the average consumption per vessel by the average residence time in port per vessel. Timeline for Phase A: M1-M6 Phase B: Quantifying Energy Consumption: Detailed Measurements and Analysis for Cold Ironing in the Port of Limassol Detailed Measurements: Actual measurements will be conducted to gather accurate data on the energy consumption of vessels during cold ironing in the port. Purpose of Measurements: The purpose of conducting actual measurements is to obtain accurate and reliable data on the energy consumption, including fuel usage, of vessels during cold ironing. Data Collection Process: The measurement process involves installing equipment where applicable, as well as post processing of other data retrieved by fleet operators (MRV) and the port. Air quality measurements will also be conducted. Data Analysis and Evaluation: The collected data on energy consumption will be analyzed and evaluated to gain insights into the energy consumption patterns of vessels during cold ironing. The purpose will be to deliver an energy balance of the port, whereas the boundaries will include the port and the fleet accommodated. This analysis can involve comparing fuel consumption across different vessels, assessing the impact of various operational factors on energy efficiency, calculating average fuel consumption rates, and identifying potential areas for improvement. Timeline for Phase B: M6-M18 Phase C: Energy Mix Analysis and Plan Development for Cold Ironing Phase C of the project focuses on the analysis of the measurements and the extraction of a plan based on different scenarios for the potential energy mix required to cover the needs in cold ironing at the Limassol port, towards carbon neutrality. The plan will consider the provisions of Directive 2014/94, which promotes the use of alternative fuels and renewable resources in the maritime sector. The emphasis will be on existing renewables, such as photovoltaic systems (PVs), and alternative fuels like hydrogen, which are both requested by the directive and suitable for the marine sector. The analysis will evaluate the energy consumption patterns obtained from the measurements, considering factors such as vessel types, average consumption rates, and residence times in the port. Different scenarios will be examined to determine the optimal energy mix that can meet the requirements of cold ironing while reducing emissions.  |

|   |  | As part of this Phase, an analytical technical documentation and cost estimation for the entire Onshore Power Supply (OPS) system, which will be included in the tender documents. Following the completion of the analytical electromechanical studies and estimation of the total capital and operational costs of the OPS, the subsequent step involves conducting a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) study, including a specific Social CBA to determine the social surplus resulting from the OPS implementation. Furthermore, Phase C will consider the needs for grid upgrade, including the potential requirement for substations. It will align with the 10-year plan of the Transmission System Operator (TSO) to ensure the energy infrastructure can accommodate the increased demand from cold ironing. Timeline for Phase C: M12-M24 Phase D: Final Policy Recommendation and Implementation Preparation Phase D focuses on the final policy recommendation report, which will provide suggestions for future steps in implementing the cold ironing plan at the Limassol port. The report will consolidate the findings from the measurements, analysis, and energy mix assessment conducted in earlier phases. The policy recommendation report will outline the proposed plan for cold ironing implementation, including the specific energy mix, infrastructure requirements, and necessary upgrades. It will also consider the procurement process for acquiring the required equipment and services, as well as studies needed for the successful implementation of the plan. As part of this phase, a conclusive remark will be included, which will outline the various options available for implementing Onshore Power Supply (OPS) in the Cypriot Port/s. These options will definitely include Public-Private Partnership (PPP), the Cyprus Ports Authority (CPA), or the involvement of port operators, among others. The report will provide comprehensive guidance, including core tendering specification on selected plans, for stakeholders involved in decision-making, including port authorities, regulatory bodies, and energy providers. It will serve as a roadmap for the transition to sustainable and energy-efficient cold ironing operations at the Limassol port, aligning with the goals of Directive 2014/94 and contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the maritime sector Timeline for Phase D: M18-M28 Phase E: Procurement & Implementation (Y3-5) ...  |

|   |  Action description | The significant environmental, yet economic impact of the Limassol Marina, either for the city of Limassol, or the state of Cyprus as a whole, as well as the importance and the variety of activities, which take place either at sea or on land, makes the marina of Limassol an important “energy ecosystem” that needs to be separately monitored to achieve ultimate carbon neutrality.
The marina ecosystem could become a “carbon neutral cell” within the city of Limassol, thus contributing to the major target, which is the City’s Carbon Neutrality. Moreover, as a “green cell”, Limassol Marina can  |

|   | become a “good practice” for similar infrastructure in Cyprus and abroad, while it will be the first carbon neutral marina complex in the Mediterranean Sea. The steps towards the ultimate target of transforming Limassol Marina into a “blue and green infrastructure” consist of the following actions: Phase A (Activities): • A.1 Measuring and monitoring the emissions: Develop a state-of-the-art methodology for measuring and monitoring the emissions that are emitted in Limassol Marina as an ecosystem. It includes analytical calculations regarding the energy consumed and the emissions emitted per main emission centre, i.e., residential part, yachting part (including land and sea activities), and commercial part. The outcome of the activity leads to the development of a Carbon Index particularly for CO2 emissions by setting the Index at level 100 for 2022 (ultimate goal is the carbon neutrality rate to reach 70%-80% by 2030, i.e., the index to become 20%). Limassol Marina is divided into five (5) business streams. Taking energy consumption in 2022 as year basis, the electricity consumption is as follows: - Marina: 3.387.177 KWh - Commercial part: 3.094.488 KWh - Residential part: 2.485.603 KWh - Car park: 356.169 KWh - Other: 1.016.870 KWh - Total (2022): 10.340.307 KWh The calculated CO2 emissions for the year basis 2022 (electricity to CO2 emissions factor is considered as 0,744 KgCO2e/kWh1) are as follows: - Marina: 2.520 tons CO2 - Commercial part: 2,302 tons CO2 - Residential part: 1.849 tons CO2 - Car park: 265 tons CO2 - Other: 757 tons CO2 - Total (2022): 7.693 tons CO2  |

Electricity Consumption in Limassol marina (2022 - 2030 in KWh)

In our model, the electricity consumption is assumed to grow  $10\%$  by 2030 due to planned developments and despite the foreseen energy saving measures. It is also considered that the general CO2 emissions level is decreased because the electricity to CO2 emissions factor is reduced due to the implementation of natural gas and renewables into the energy mixture and is forecasted to be 0,265 KgCO2e/kWh by the year 2030.

A.2 Calculating the energy supply / demand model and the emissions emitted (SOx, NOx, PM, CO₂) in Limassol Marina, segmented into the different categories of users (i.e., yachts, residential part and commercial part of the complex).
A.3 Conduct of CBA / SCBA: for the alternative energy sources to be identified as contributing to the carbon neutrality process for the Limassol Marina. Along with the private cost and benefit, the social cost and benefit (social surplus), will be calculated and delivered to the society.

The next graph, that concludes the rough estimation of the existing and anticipating emissions in 2030, is going to be further defined as a more analytical methodological tool. It will be developed to help the Marina Administration to better monitor and report the emissions on an annual basis.

#

|   |  | The proposed approach is definitely a synergetic approach and involves many contributors, i.e., researchers, scientists, direct and indirect beneficiaries, public and private organisations which join forces towards the global target of reducing / offsetting the emissions and achieving carbon neutrality in Limassol Marina. The proposed project refers firstly to the accurate studies that are needed in order for “carbon neutrality” to be achieved for Limassol Marina. Phase A covers all possible aspects of the project (Technical, Feasibility, Environmental, and Social), while Phase B regards the project implementation itself. The whole project can be characterized as follows: • Specific: refers to a tangible infrastructure. • Measurable: Current emissions levels and the respective reductions from the proposed technology will be measured and quantified. • Achievable: Carbon offsetting through RES can achieve carbon neutrality • Realistic and Relevant: compliance with EU Green Deal and Mission Cities • Timed: Technology proposed is already in use  |

|   |  Action type | Infrastructure  |
|   |  Action description | Phase A: Identification of Risk The bay of Limassol is surrounded by a number of industries and other anthropogenic activities that exert significant pressures and represent threats to sea and coast. These include Power Generation, Port Operations, Marinas, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Coastal Construction and Litter and Sewage, while gas exploration is expected to be introduced in the near future. Each of the 6 sections represent different threats that need to be identified and evaluated in terms of severity. At the same time, due to the high concentration of these industries their interactions are also significant and a holistic approach to risk assessment for complex systems must be employed. Phase B: Data Collection B.1: Acquisition of Secondary Data At the moment, several oversight and monitoring institutions collect data that are relevant to incident identification and pollution. Nevertheless, as these institutions operate independently, and with no established communication channels currently existing, the data remains highly fragmented and of limited  |

use to anyone. As such, the project seeks to collect and consolidate this data and establish a route to data acquisition and integration from each relevant institution.

# B.2: Generation of Primary, Real-time, Data

The significant lack of technology in the current practices of marine environmental surveillance in Limassol prevents the timely identification of polluting incidents and the identification of its source. As a result, the vast majority of incidents remain undetected and unpunished and the lack of information as to the source of the incident limits regulatory efforts to provide effective practices. In conjunction with parallel research projects the aim is to employ state of the art technology, including aerial drones, stationary underwater sensors and unmanned sea vehicles to collect real-time primary data and improve the capacity to detect and identify incidents.

# Phase C: Development of analytical Framework

# C1: Data Consolidation

Matching data from varied sources can be challenging due to differences in frequency, measurement units, missing observations, etc. In this step, all data sources will be consolidated to produce a "clean" database that is useable, error-free and expandable.

# C2: Risk Assessment Methodology

The quantification of risk requires a methodology that asserts the likelihood of risk and its impact, should the risk be realized. Such methodology is to be applied both at a sectoral as well as a holistic level. Furthermore, the risk assessment framework will provide measurable benchmarks that would trigger early warning signals should their threshold of safety be exceeded.

# C3: Citizens' wellbeing KPIs

As part of the continuous surveillance and monitoring of incidents, and the risk assessment methodology applied, a number of KPI's regarding the environmental and socio-economic wellbeing of citizens shall be established. These may include (but not be limited to):

Gross Domestic Product
Gross Value Added
Employment
Amount of shipping traffic
Oil pollution at coasts, illegal discharges

In particular, the Marine Environmental Risk Assessment Integrated Data Management system will migrate to UPD in the following stages: D1: Data Hosting and Data Integration Available Data identified in B1 and collected in B2 will be integrated and hosted on UPD. The MERA data will be matched with other relevant data as collected from other actions (i.e. energy). Data will become accessible to relevant stakeholder and channels for data augmentation and updating will be automated. D2: Statistical Analysis and Visualization Modules for descriptive statistical analysis and visualization of the data will be implemented in the UPD. This will provide a running “snapshot” of variables of interest to inform on the current state of the marine environment. Relevant users will access visualization tools through a dedicated dashboard. D3: KPI Monitoring D3 will periodically produce citizens’ wellbeing KPIs as those identified in C3. The frequency of the calculation of the KPIs will depend on the how often the data will be updated by primary and third-party data. The platform will highlight significant changes in KPIs and issue warnings should certain KPIs fall off pre-established thresholds. D4: Smart Apps and Intelligent Modules In D4 smart apps, powered by more advanced algorithms, including machine learning prediction models, will be deployed for purposes of risk assessment and prediction. Early warnings will be issued based on  |

|   |  Action description | The project focuses on the assessment of one of the seven (7) coastal neighbourhoods of the Municipality of Limassol to define their resilience level in terms of their specific environmental, social, and economic challenges and their ability to support the 15 minutes neighbourhood model. The 15 Minute Neighbourhood which supports the notion of the Healthy Neighbourhood involves policy actions that provide residents access to most, if not all, of their needs within a short walk or bike ride from their home. It's based upon four pillars: Proximity, Diversity, Density, Ubiquity where policies transform urban spaces into connected and self-sufficient (or 'complete') neighbourhoods reducing car use and encouraging active travel are central to delivering the vision. The overall aim of the 15 minuet City is to makes life more liveable for residents, by improving air quality and making neighbourhoods safer, quieter, more diverse, inclusive and economically vibrant. Additionally, the project aims to connect the coastal residential quarters to the sea, the coast and the beach in order to maximise the positive impact of this amenity and the degree of daily needs satisfaction within the 15 minutes radius.  |

In the short term, a change in attitude, behavioural patterns and a stronger sense of community aim to be achieved, through the education of residents in their part for working towards a CNC and more sustainable neighbourhood. Through co-design and participatory workshops residents will take their responsibilities toward energy consumption and emissions. Pilot programmes will introduce the value of behavioural change (walking - reducing electricity consumption etc) all of which are measurable with short timeframes. In turn outcomes will promote better health and wellbeing. Collaborative actions can signpost common goals, generate a sense of a new for Cyprus multicultural community  |

# Change Management Programs Directly Measurable:

B. Change of Travel patterns – Transport: Researchers found that trips on shared e-scooters over 2022 reduced carbon emissions by 15 – 42 grams of CO2e per kilometre. Assuming:

cars per thousand inhabitants and a total of 689,893,467 passenger Km (pKm) annually for a population of 107k (2020)

For 6500 inhabitants in quarter (Zakaki estimate) =&gt; 6.5/107x689,893,467 = 41,909,416 pKm

Anticipated reduction by 20% of Km travelled

=&gt;8,381,883 pKm reduced per year

Median of 15-42 = 28.5 grams of CO2e/pKm

=&gt; 8,381,883 pKm x 28.5gCO2e / 1^6 = 239 t CO2e reduction

C: Metering facilities: based on 2020 consumption levels, in years 1-2 of residents changing habits in the home, households would reduce emissions by 10%-20% within pilot programme participation (with the potential to be even higher) (364 -728 kWh per household per year) which will continue to reduce within years 3-6 and beyond as further actions are implemented. Assuming an average reduction of 546 kWh per household per year and the 2030 projected GHG emissions intensity of 230 g CO2e/kWh =&gt; 125.6 Kg CO2e/yr/household

For the PILOT and a total of 30 houses =&gt; 3.8 t CO2e/yr

If this is applied to a Whole Quarter with the below assumptions:

approximately 6,500 persons, with 2.6 persons per household =&gt; 2500 houses.

The total Quarter reduction in GHG would then be:

Kg CO2e/yr/household x 2500 = 314 t CO2e/yr

D: Participatory design for the design of private gardens This action will reduce temperature of the garden by 3 degrees, subsequently the internal temperature within the house will reduce and this needs to be translated into energy saving. Private garden design needs also to adapt to the seashore microclimatic conditions. In addition, people can spend an extra 2 hrs. on average per day in the garden again reducing the need for energy (Air-conditioning etc.) within the house.

Especially establish a functional relation of the neighbourhood with the sea, the coast and the beach. Community led design takes longer than conventional project and associated with a number of community actions valuable for consensus buildings and decision making, across often diverse community groups. Participatory design does not feature within the planning and/or design practice in Cyprus and neighbourhood regeneration programmes focus solely on the refurbishment of built space as scenery and less an active event loaded working part of a city as a life organism. This action assumes two urban regeneration projects defined and design through participation of local stakeholders 1. The generation of ‘centre’ for the community (probably in the form of a building /shelter of an existing structure with local cultural significance. It is also important to create a linkage of this centre with the sea, the coast and the beach as the essential elements of a coastal neighbourhood identity. 2. A project focusing on the reclamation of the neighbourhood’s waterfront – associated with improved access, added amenity, personalisation of fit out etc. The work associated with the facilitation and maturing of the projects is assumed at 5-10% of associated budgets (approx. 70-100,000 euros in total) Total budget: max 100,000 euros Budget are approximate and need further development. |

|   |  Action description | Posidonia oceanica meadows are significant carbon sinks. They are known as “Blue Carbon ecosystems” and are very important for mitigating climate change. Despite their importance they are disappearing quickly and degradation affects their capacity to sequester and accumulate carbon. The vast stocks of CO2 that accumulated over hundreds and thousands of years could be at risk of being released back to the atmosphere contributing to the total EU emissions. It is thus crucial to take actions to conserve, restore or enhance the carbon sequestration potential in these coastal ecosystems.  |

|   |  | The incorporation of Blue carbon programmes into climate change strategies still lacks knowledge on the extent of the capacity and variability of these ecosystems, the development of policy instruments such as carbon offsets, and the ability on how to best develop coastal environmental management frameworks at local and national scales. Our project aims to fill these gaps and consists of the following actions: A1. Identify main pressures and consultation with stakeholders; A2. Assessment of carbon stock in seagrass meadows of Limassol; A3. Assessment of health condition and carbon sinking rates in seagrass meadows; A4. Develop a monitoring plan using multiple permanent plots established at the lower and upper limits; A5. Pilot restoration of affected P. oceanica meadows; A6. Citizens engagement in monitoring and restoration activities; A7. Monitoring of restoration success; A8. Policy reforms (prerequisite); A9. Educational material and public awareness.  |

|   |  | The coasts should be regarded as a community that engages many parties and stakeholders ranging from social, recreational, business, and touristic activities. Wave energy, being the most abundant renewable energy source, can contribute immensely if a commercial, economically viable, low electricity cost generation Wave Energy Converter (WEC) is deployed. Having 15-20 times more available energy per square metre than wind or solar, five times greater power flow intensity as well as being more persistent than wind power flow, justifies why wave energy has for many decades attracted inventors to harvest it by improvising various devices and mechanisms. It is estimated by the world energy council that the exploitable energy potential is at 2 Terra Watts (TW). The global wave power available including open oceans, however, is estimated to be of the order of 10 TW, figures well comparable with the world's present power consumption. It was as early as 1799 when the first patent for wave energy conversion system was made by the French Monsieur Girard and his son. Their invention aimed at exploiting mechanical energy directly to drive saws, mills pumps and other heavy machinery. The objectives of this concept are about a renewable energy system that harnesses the wave energy and will help aid the way for a clean energy transition and decarbonisation for Limassol's coastal regions and Limassol in general. Solar energy is of course another renewable energy that can be exploited; however, wave energy is perhaps in more abundance and more practical to exploit along the coastline. Although the applications of the wave energy harnessing are numerous, this conceptual idea focuses on water desalination, not excluding other application that could be exploited during the early outcomes. The objectives are: 8. To exploit water waves near the coasts to: a. acquire data for the wave potential around Limassol coastal region. [°] b. develop, based on environmental-impact assessment, projects promoting a renewable and cost-effective water-resource management towards decarbonization. c. Carry out the required technical and economic for the optimum WEC penetration, impact, and implementation. d. Obtain the required licenses from responsible municipal/governmental departments/authorities. 2. To deploy an existing wave energy converter mechanism for off-shore and on-shore use, based on integrated optimization of mechanical and hydrodynamic specifications, end-use purpose, and environmental impact assessment issues. The WEC may be used for water desalination (aim of this action) or electricity generation with numerous uses. 3. Design and test pilot specimen in the sea water field and re-assess field optimization-based design for larger scale implementation. The WEC will be able to handle extreme condition scenarios ranging from incident wave power levels originating from flat seas to those levels generated from stormy weather conditions, constituting viable and reliable operation. Another advantage of the WEC is the low electricity generation cost that will add to the system's viability.  |

|   |  | Regarding the cost, we estimate the WEC pilot desalination system (6x100 metres) will be in the range mentioned further down in the table. The cost estimate includes: -Manufacturing Pilot Prototype (based on a Cyprus SME developed system), -Data Acquisition/Analysis/Reporting, -Design/Material Optimization, -Desalination Filter System/Pre-filtration, -Deployment Costs, Anchoring. Scaled Up (Group 1) System: The cost of the scaled-up system (Group 1), its cost and accurate impact will be evaluated during the testing and evaluation phase of the pilot system. Certainly, wave energy technologies are still to a lesser or greater extent far from maturity. The potential for improvement of the techno-economic indicators of wave power conversion technologies is very large, while the survivability and the reliability of many devices, particularly for offshore operation, has still to be demonstrated. [1] Using an annual data set from Zygi (3h time step) and SWEL's neutral displacement theory model which extrapolates data from previous EU testing campaigns the potential for a typical Cyprus climate has been projected (spreadsheet with data and model calculations is available if required). Considering the outputs of the system in the case study (assuming correctness of Zygi data and a 148,000 tonne per year output) we can conclude that; - The optimised wave energy converter system [WEC] suited to the climate we have in Limassol is suitable for contributing to the goals of the project; ○ This system would output water which with conventional desalination corresponds to circa 500 MWh / year. Assuming an electricity cost of 30c/kWh this is a 150,000 euro cost of electricity only using conventional desalination methods which produce emissions. ○ With the wave energy converter there would be near zero emissions. ○ This is for one system, more systems would have a larger positive impact. Jobs will be created. It will be the pioneer in this industry and will launch in Limassol brining huge media attention which we already have lined up (Reuters) The proposal will be verified and evaluated with the pilot test system and subsequently move on to scale up and optimize the system to bring the costs down even more and outputs up.  |

Almost 50 million cubic metres  $(\mathrm{m}^{3})$  of desalinated water were produced in 2021 in Cyprus Error! Reference source not found.. The energy consumed to generate  $1\mathrm{m}^3$  of desalinated water is 3.2 to 4 kWh depending on the desalination unit. The unit in LARNACA for example is capable to produce 58 thousand  $\mathrm{m}^3$  of desalinated water per day, 1.74 million  $\mathrm{m}^3$  per month, 5.568.000 kWh of consumed energy per month.

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

The AP strategy includes two pillars to offset residual emissions (20% of the baseline), which also maximize co-benefits for the city: 1) Carbon sinking in Seagrass meadows and 2) C sequestration in green infrastructure.

C sinking in seagrass meadows

Seagrasses are essential marine ecosystems that exist in Limassol but although they are endemic and protected by several regulations/conventions, they have been significantly impacted and are regressing. Seagrasses provide valuable services (provisioning, regulating and cultural) such as supporting fisheries and recreation, purifying the water and protecting coastlines from erosion. They represent perhaps the most important C sink (blue carbon) of Limassol. It is estimated that on average the annual carbon sequestration rate is between 278 t C ha $^{-1}$  yr $^{-1}$  and 1020.3 tCO $_2$  ha $^{-1}$  yr $^{-1}$ . This means that C sequestration by a 141.2 ha seagrass meadow can potentially cover the (20%) emissions gap, which highlights the great potential this ecosystem has to support the goals of the NZC mission. However, there is high uncertainty in this estimation and the AP foresees a separate action (CA_5: Seagrass meadows in Limassol-carbon sinking and meadow restoration) for seagrass meadows, which capitalizes on current and previous work on seagrass meadows mapping and conservation in Cyprus. Additionally, there are many co-benefits in the AP actions/activities/projects that are related to minimizing coastal and marine pollution which will in turn support seagrass conservation. For instance, improving green spaces (BA_3: Urban regeneration) favours control of water flow in the city, as water is captured in green spaces and infiltrates into the soil where pollutants (e.g., heavy metals, nutrients, persistent organic pollutants, pharmaceuticals) are contained (reducing runoff to the sea). In this way, marine pollution is controlled by "green buffer zones". Additionally, actions related to the port and marina (CA_1: Cold Ironing in the Limassol Port; CA_2: Limassol Marina energy community) also favour marine pollution mitigation. It should be stressed that seagrass meadows are essential for C storage in Limassol and Cyprus and their degradation and eventual loss will increase emissions and negatively affect biodiversity at the local and regional level.

C sequestration in green infrastructure

LIMSSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Carbon sequestration in Mediterranean green urban spaces can vary depending on several factors, including the types of plants and trees, their age, climate conditions, and maintenance practices. On average, mature trees in urban (temperate) areas can sequester carbon at a rate of about 45 tons C ha $^{-1}$  (of canopy cover) yr $^{-1}$  or 165.2 tons CO $_2$  ha $^{-1}$  yr $^{-1}$  (high uncertainty; this needs to be verified by monitoring). This estimate includes both aboveground and belowground carbon storage and it is approx. 5.5 times lower than that of seagrasses. Young trees sequester less carbon than mature ones. Proper maintenance and care of urban green spaces can also enhance their carbon sequestration potential. In Mediterranean climates, some species of trees and plants may be more efficient at sequestering carbon than others due to their adaptability to the local environment. Carbon is stored in existing green spaces of Lemesos, but the quantity is unknown, as well as in the organic matter of soil surfaces that have not yet been sealed. A rough estimation of canopy cover in the 350 (small) city parks is 6.2 ha, which leads to an estimated sequestration of 1020 tons of CO $_2$  /year. To cover the emissions gap from urban (matured) green spaces would require a canopy coverage equal to 872 ha (which is equal to increasing the current green spaces (canopy cover) x 140; practically impossible. The municipality has limited space for this, but the co-benefits of green infrastructure are key for sustainable city ecosystems and human health. Therefore, the AP (see Build Environment) foresees actions for enhancing green infrastructure (BA_3: Urban regeneration) at small and large scales. Some examples include the connection of green spaces and enhanced tree planting in the city (Limassol participates in a project involving planting 300,000 trees in the following couple of years) and the creation (and maintenance) of microforests, in all available (and new) city land. This will support microclimate improvement (e.g., CC adaptation) and storing C in the soil and plants (C sequestration).

# Strategy for GHG emission gap

In addition to the above, the strategy for the GHG emissions gap (overall) follows the philosophy of the approach described in the introduction of the AP. The key elements of the strategy are:

) Vision: Nature-based solutions tailored to Lemesos for GHG emissions mitigation, based on seagrass meadows and green urban spaces.
) Objectives: Maintain and enhance C storage in the city ecosystems
) Actions:

CA_5: Assessment of Carbon Sinking Potential of Seagrass Meadows in the Limassol Bay
BA_3: Urban regeneration (green spaces unification via green corridors + planting 300,000 trees)

) KPIs (besides those provided for the above actions): C sequestration potential tons  $\mathrm{Cha}^{-1}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$  in seagrass and green spaces.
) MEL: Monitoring, Evaluation, Learning (involvement of stakeholders; Lemesos Commons)
) Communication plan: Nature-Based Solutions will be a vehicle for disseminating the work related to the NZC mission and a unique Living Lab (seagrass) among the 100 cities of the mission. The actions have high replicability potential in coastal (and insural) Mediterranean areas.
) Integration with other actions: (especially coastal and marine; build environment; waste thematics).
) Continuous improvement: Based on MEL and stakeholder engagement (and based on the CCC APs).
) Financial/Funding: Due to innovation and scientific novelty there is great potential to attract funding from EU schemes (e.g., Horizon, Prima, LIFE) and RIF (e.g., Integrated / Infrastructure projects). These actions could also linked to emerging C markets (C credits and shipping; corporate social responsibility etc.).
) Timeline and milestones (indicative) (2023-2030) (see Figure).

|  Definition | PM concentration levels refer to the measurement of particulate matter in the air, specifically the concentration of particles suspended in the atmosphere. These particles can vary in size, composition, and origin, and they are categorized based on their diameter. PM concentration levels are typically expressed in micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m³) and are used to assess air quality and potential health risks associated with exposure to airborne particulates.
PM2.5: Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These fine particles are capable of penetrating deep into the respiratory system and can have adverse health effects when inhaled. Sources of PM2.5 include combustion processes (e.g., vehicle emissions, industrial activities), dust, and chemical reactions in the atmosphere.  |
|  Calculation | Air quality monitoring stations measure and report PM2.5 concentration levels
Air Sample Collection: Air samples are collected using specialized equipment, such as high-volume samplers or low-volume samplers with size-selective inlets designed to collect particles with diameters less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers. These samplers draw in air over a specified period.  |

|   | 2. Filter Collection: A filter (usually made of quartz or other suitable material) is used to capture the particulate matter present in the sampled air. The filter collects particles as the air passes through it.
Weighing the Filter: After the sampling period, the filter is carefully removed and weighed. This weight measurement includes both the mass of the filter itself and the mass of the collected particles.
Correction for Filter Blank: To get an accurate measurement of the particle mass, the weight of the blank filter (a clean, unused filter) is subtracted from the weight of the filter with collected particles. This correction accounts for any contamination or residue that may be present on the blank filter.
Calculation of PM2.5 Concentration: The PM2.5 concentration (in micrograms per cubic meter, μg/m³) is calculated using the following formula

| --- | --- |
|  Indicator Unit | °C UHImax  |
|  Definition | Magnitude of the UHI measured in °C  |
|  Calculation | 1) Data Collection: Obtain temperature data for both the urban area and the nearby rural area. Ideally, the data should cover the same time period, such as a day or a month, to ensure accurate comparisons.
) Choose Representative Locations: Select representative weather stations or measurement points within both the urban and rural areas. Ensure that the locations are relatively homogeneous and free from significant local influences.
) Calculate Temperature Difference: Subtract the average temperature of the rural area from the average temperature of the urban area to calculate the temperature difference.

Urban Heat Island Magnitude = Average Urban Temperature - Average Rural Temperature

To express the urban heat island magnitude as a percentage, divide the temperature difference by the average rural temperature and multiply by 100.

|  NZ LEMESOS 2030 INC is founded to support overcoming barriers related to the NZ actions implementation. These barriers linked among others to bureaucracy (e.g., policies and legislation must change for the implementation of the deep retrofitting action) and the reduced capacity of the Municipality (e.g., specialized staff) to deal with many of the AP topics. The interdisciplinary composition (municipality, stakeholders, citizens) of the new organization highly supports just transition based on science and technology and sound execution (management).

Ensures cooperation by all stakeholders 4. Early discovering of barriers and opposition; dealing with opposition at planning stage; no decision back and forth 5. Creates strong social and therefore political support for otherwise controversial decisions. 6. Helps in correct sequencing/timing of projects 7. Facilitates attracting human and financial resources 8. Increases transparency, accountability and just transition as well as appearance of them. The transition to net zero involves numerous decisions, policies, and measures, which can face opposition and delays. The mission of the NZ LEMESOS 2030 INC is to accelerate inclusive, democratic, and sustainable change, from addressing needs to fostering citizenship. The process involves co-workshops, close cooperation with “Lemesos Commons” and extensive communication and education activities. Long-term impact aims to empower stakeholders, while medium-term outcomes include increased discussion of climate issues and professional advancement.  |   |

Briefly, around 20 experienced co-workshop participants (see introduction for a detailed description of the “Lemesos Commons and the Co-workshops”), randomly selected from various stakeholder co-workshops, will form a heterogeneous stakeholder group, the Lemesos Commons, to review, harmonize, and integrate solutions developed from the homogeneous co-workshops. (Analyzing a problem first from one point of view by a homogeneous group and then from several points of view by a regrouped heterogeneous team is the well-known jigsaw method.) The reason for random selection is representativeness. Lemesos Commons members will commit their time for six months and then be replaced by other, also randomly selected, members from the same stakeholder group. (Each month 1/6th of Lemesos Commons members will be changed so that the change in membership is gradual.) The methodology for initial Lemesos Commons member preparation, physical sessions, synchronous and asynchronous online communication, progress monitoring, outcome evaluation, and transferring learning to the whole Transition arena is similar to those of the Co-workshops. An experienced member will act as the Lemesos Commons ‘Speaker’ for 6 months, representing the Commons to the Transition team, the City Council, and the broader society.  |   |

For the Transition, and related to governance interventions, there are three fundamental aspects: 1) just transition for all, 2) projects and activities that are based on science and technology and 3) sound execution. For the NZC mission, the "NZ LEMESOS 2030" organization is founded, as the executive branch of the Transition, initially established by the Lemesos Municipality (see Figure above). The municipality (as the political coordinator) is at the centre (see Figure below) but there are some other fundamental elements: 1) the NZ Lemesos 2030 INC, 2) the Co-design participatory workshops (co-workshops) and the Lemesos Commons and 3) the (stakeholders) Transition Arena. These, capitalizing also in the interaction among Lemesos and Cypriot municipalities and other Mission cities (4a,b) facilitates the successful implementation of the Transition projects (5).

) NZ LEMESOS 2030. INC is a broad-base shareholder company with Lemesos Municipality and other authorities holding about 25% (none more than 10%), other institutional stakeholders about 20% (none more than 3%), individual business about 20% (none more than 2%) and individual citizens 35% (each up to .1%). The organization accelerates projects execution (in comparison to the municipality current capacity). This is based on the fact that all views have been considered at the planning stage to avoid major obstacles. Barriers identification and dealing with opposition are key challenges towards the Transition. The organization increases transparency related to human and financial resources incorporation to the Transision. Equally important, the organization guarantees that political changes (e.g., change of the Mayor; see the example in Seville) will not severely impact the AP towards Transition.

) The co-workshops and the Lemesos Commons. Stakeholders and citizens engagement for co-design and co-implementation is fundamental. The Lemesos Climate Transition plan involves active stakeholder and public engagement through the Lemesos Commons. Co-workshops gather homogeneous groups to address climate issues, aiming to change attitudes. The Commons, comprising diverse participants, harmonizes solutions and proposes projects. The outcome of the Lemesos Commons will be transition-advancing detailed project proposals that are well thought-out, consider multiple stakeholder concerns, are based on scientific expertise, can be socially monitored, have broad support and deal positively with objections. These enable NZ LEMESOS 2030 to fulfill its role.

) The stakeholders Transition Arena involves the scientific force (Thematic groups), the municipality (internal) transition team, MEL processes (from various projects/initiatives), the involvement of stakeholders and citizens who are essential towards the achieving of Transition aims and objectives (e.g., Entrepreneurs, high social status citizens, influencers). The Arena, among others, creates strong social (and therefore political) support for controversial decisions and thus, helps in correct sequencing and timing of key projects and their upscaling (e.g., deep retrofitting, tram). In addition, the Arena could accelerate attracting human and financial resources.

The difference between 2 and 3 is that the Lemesos Commons (2) is more inclusive (no one left behind principle) and the Arena (3) is more selective (e.g., key scientists, institutions, citizens are more than welcomed to achieve projects objectives towards Transition). Both are needed. As an example, an individual truck driver can, by her/his participation in co-workshop and L. Commons have her/his view considered. A transportation professor can, by his/her participation in the Scientific thematic transition Team and the stakeholder arena have his/her view considered. They are not mutually exclusive by definition, but they will attract different people statistically and different discussions will take place in each one. The municipality will add the political coordination and advance them to NZC Λ 2030, Inc for execution. Moreover, even though stakeholders and citizens are involved as shareholders in the NCZ 2030 Inc., they are needed in the Arena and the Common : (a) NZC Λ 2030, Inc. is executive, it must act efficiently and effectively, not deliberate. The Arena and the Commons on the other hand are spaces for discussion, solution co-design, where bold proposals can be made without fear of risk. (b) NZC Λ 2030, Inc. may be economically just within the capitalist system, but is not socially just. (Not every family can afford 1000€ for a share in NZC Λ 2030 and not every SME is willing to invest 10K€ for 10 shares.) So the three lines (Commons, Arean and NZC Λ 2030, Inc) express three qualitatively different pillars for the Transition.

) (a,b) The involvement of local and Mission cities. Facilitates knowledge, skill and good practice transfer among cities. Scalability and transferability in both directions and stronger leverage towards central governments, the Mission and the EU. It strengthens collective wisdom (against a global problem) and allows activities to be assessed on their social, economic and climate merits.

) 1-4 lines (see Figure above) as briefly explained in this section facilitate the implementation, upscaling and MEL in hundreds of projects related to the transition, after the main principle that everything is well-thought, transparent, inclusive and by implementing as smoother changes as possible.

# C-1.2.a: Description of digitalization interventions – textual and visual elements

In order to effectively monitor and evaluate the results of the actions designed for the action plan, evaluate the indicators specified to measure the effects, improve the effectivity of all actions taken towards climate neutrality, and design others where needed an effective digital/smart system is needed.

This smart system is meant mainly to support and enrich the actions of the vertical thematics included in the action plan by incorporating real-time monitoring and data analysis, resources and device deployment management using Artificial Intelligence for automations and informed decision making, predictive maintenance and risk assessment may result in a more optimized energy usage, resources utilization, early identification of emission hotspots and carbon intensive activities.

In addition, we shall take advantage of the ubiquitous smartphone devices to empower citizens and communities by providing real-time notifications and results on their energy usage and carbon footprint raising in this way awareness and encouraging behavioural change. Lastly by allowing a seamless integration to all municipality services and data will embrace trustworthiness and will attract private investors to develop more and new smart apps and deployments and consequently further enhance the smart transformation of Limassol city.

Specifically, digital systems for enabling the Lemesos NZ Transition have the following functions:

Observations and measurements (with sensors, sampling and other)
Data collection, validation, and (pre)processing
Repository (open data) and the Lemesos Digital Twin
Modelling (e.g. transportation TDM ref TMA4, MERA ref CPA4)
The Lemesos Climate Decision support system
Querying, Visualization and Reporting

The actions which have been designed to support the smart transition and digital transformation of Limassol city are the following:

# 1. Urban Digital Platform (UDP)

Design and develop a multi-purpose, inter-operable, scalable and secure urban digital platform on top of a smart infrastructure that will enable the secure collection, storage and analysis of smart-city related big-data to be utilized by the municipality and government in planning, implementation and decision-making, by the industry sector for leveraging smart and green innovation solutions, and by academia and researchers for new research opportunities, innovations and collaborations. The implementation of this action requires the close collaboration and coordination with all thematic areas which have proposed actions for this Action Plan, in order to fulfill their needs with respect to the infrastructure in terms of hardware, data management, processing and analysis as well as the pre-specified smart apps.

The UDP will be composed of six (6) layers:
#

LIMSSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Smart Infrastructure Management System: will be responsible to manage the connectivity and network protocols required for the deployment of the necessary infrastructure, i.e., devices (e.g., sensors, cameras), to fulfill the individual actions of the vertical field of actions.

Smart Space: will be responsible for Storage, Management, Processing and Analysis of various data formats that will be acquired from the Smart Infrastructure and incorporates various data related technologies such as data cleaning, data engineering, load balancing and task scheduling in cases of distributed storage.

Security and Privacy: will offer a secure storage and communication of data, as well as access control and guarantees regarding the privacy preservation of the end-users. In particular, this layer will include access-control mechanisms, encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention methods, thread-intelligence analysis and backups. Data Governance (Policies, Procedures, Standards) based on GDPR, data quality standards, data retention policies, user consent mechanisms, privacy impact assessment, EU compliance and regulations.

Web portal: Design and development of the urban digital platform web portal that will act as an admin back-office and it will offer content management, KPIs monitoring, data visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs, and dashboards), data analytics, data interpretations, actuations and notifications to each vertical field of action as well as centrally to the Limassol municipality from the data that will be generated by the smart infrastructure of each vertical thematic action.

Citizens Smartphone application: Optimize the features and extend the existing Municipality of Limassol (Dimotis Lemesou) application and extend it with new features and services for raising awareness regarding the EU mission and the thematic areas, providing incentives and rewards to stakeholders for being engaged with the municipality activities as well as via gamification for recognition of usage, incorporating smart app extensions for real-time notification, participation and decision-making on municipality issues.
#

LIMSSOL2030

Climate Neutrality Action

Plan

#

Integration Middleware: design and develop a middleware following the design principles of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), which is a loosely coupled architecture that allows different systems and services to securely exchange and communicate public and privately held data and interoperable services through standardized interfaces, such as the Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces (Rest APIs). This will enable the seamless integration of third parties (existing systems and applications), such as the Dimotis Lemesou application and the Cyprus Smart City platform, and new systems and services into the platform, as well as reduce the complexity of integrating different systems. The Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms (MIMs) framework developed by the Open and Agile Smart Cities (OASC) will be also taken into consideration

Additionally, the UDP can be further extended to support digital twin functionalities as follows:

Limassol Digital Twin: Design and develop a virtual replica of the Limassol city by combining data that will be acquired from the smart infrastructure (e.g., sensors, devices, systems) and will be processed, stored and analyzed in the urban digital platform data space. The Limassol digital twin will offer the opportunity to city planners, citizens, local enterprises, academia, researchers and experts to create a real-time 3D model of the city for (i) visualizing the city's physical environment accurately and have a more intuitive understanding of its processes, infrastructures and constraints, (ii) receiving insights about the city's current state and take intuitive and instant decisions to dynamic changes, (iii) simulating different scenarios and predict future outcomes, and (iv) offering transparency to citizens and consequently empowering them to participate in decision-making processes as well as collaborate with the authorities and the industry sector. This action will be executed with the close collaboration of the vertical thematic areas based on their needs and requirements, if any and if they can realistically be aligned with the digital twin concept.

# 2. Smart Apps &amp; Intelligent Modules

Design and development of dedicated smart apps and digital solutions, to monitor and control specific activities, make data-based decisions and automate actions to optimize usage of energy, and predict needs. The smart apps are meant to extend the existing citizens app (Δημότης Λεμεσού) and allow users to enable them based on personal needs and preferences.

The specific smart apps will be developed to support the digitalization needs of all vertical fields of action (and emission producing sectors of Limassol). Examples of some applications which are thought can be found below:

Energy Systems: vehicle-to-grid optimization for optimal storage of the energy generated by EV chargers to vehicles.
Mobility &amp; Transport: optimal topology and network design for pedestrians,
Waste &amp; Circular Economy: optimize donations of perishable and non-perishable items to avoid landfilling of still useful and functional items
Coastal: pollution risk assessment for blue infrastructure management, including monitoring, risk assessment, prevention, and detection
Built Environment: optimize energy consumption by controlling thermal environment, and obtaining real time energy usage to evaluate performance and detect energy wasteful activities

# 3. Enhance the utilization of digital resources utilizing co-workshops

In order to take advantage of the full capacity of the digital resources to be developed by Limassol, these resources must reflect real-time situations, need to be user-friendly and consider the specific needs of various stakeholders, with different interests. For this purpose we plan to consult with stakeholders

(government, municipality, citizens, experts, academia, industry) to ensure just representation in the implementation of the Limassol digital solutions, as well as run targeted awareness campaigns, trainings and workshops to educate citizens, local enterprises and stakeholders about the benefits of the digitalization of Limassol.

More specifically in order to expand the utilization of the digital resources to be designed we will develop a strategy, which will include the following :

Targeted awareness campaigns, trainings and workshops to educate citizens, local enterprises and stakeholders about the benefits and functionalities of the urban digital platform and smart apps through various channels (e.g., social media, websites, community events, and local media.)
Encouraging and supporting local businesses, startups, and organizations to develop innovative apps that leverage the platform's capabilities by showcasing the value they add to residents' lives, as well as by promoting data sharing and providing open APIs for developers and entrepreneurs to integrate the platform's data and functionality into their own apps.
Incentives and rewards (such as discounts and special offers) or recognition programs (e.g., through gamification elements that promote engagement and usage) to encourage citizens and businesses to actively use the urban digital platform, the citizens app and the smart apps.
Promotion of success stories and use cases to inspire broader adoption through the implementation of pilot projects within the municipality boundaries that will demonstrate the benefits of utilizing the urban digital platform and real-life smart applications.
Establish a variety of channels for actively listening and collecting the user needs, feedback and preferences in order to address issues and incorporate enhancements on the urban digital platform, the citizens app and the smart apps.
Collaborations with the academia (e.g., universities, research centers and centers of excellence) for incorporating the urban digital platform and smart apps into their curricula and/or research projects.
Awareness campaigns for data handling practices, compliance with regulations, and measures taken to protect user privacy and sensitive information

|   | Ideas like “car-free roads” proposed by school pupils would go through a co-workshop to constructively deal with objections (from shop owners for instance), developed and tested for a short time, with open monitoring and learning. Both the social approach and the field intervention result would reach the Lemesos Commons to be upscaled or transformed -or rejected, in all cases adding to the collective constructive approach for the Lemesos Transition.Hundreds of such ideas will be collected and the ones with support will be turned into small-scale projects; grouping them into a bundle will facilitate their administration, communication promotion and multiply their impact.  |

# C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions – textual and visual elements

The systemic barriers for the NZC are presented in detail in the introduction (strategy presentation) of the AP. Briefly, there are barriers such as the citizens' apathy toward climate change and urban environmental quality – public health (Social attitude). Moreover, there is reduced competence (regulatory; human resources) for the municipality to act and the current city plan is not tailored to drive mitigation and adaptation to climate change. To overcome such barriers, initiatives such as "allowing 100 flowers to bloom" are important. Social innovation will be framed into a bundle project aiming to promote citizens and stakeholders-driven initiatives (e.g., see Table C2.1), in line with the Mission objectives. Ideas for such projects will be co-designed / co-developed (see LC3 co-workshops). The citizens by following this approach will receive support for materializing their ideas into upscalable (and, why not, profitable; see accelerator) projects, considering objections (Lemesos Commons). This activates citizens and stakeholders and unifies them in concrete climate actions. MEL and the entire process allow (via adult/VET education) the improvement of quantity and quality of human resources. Of course, social innovation would not solve all the issues related to NZC, but it is an important stepping stone. Additionally, projects and initiatives under the umbrella of the NZC Mission (such as LC3 and metaCCAZE) are also driving social innovation and supporting capacity building for the municipality, the citizens and the stakeholders.

External barriers are also taken into consideration; namely the lack of connection to the mainland which results in expensive supply chains for Cyprus, the short period for huge changes (2024-2030) and the fact that the emissions are not visible. This last is of great importance and highly relevant to social innovation and stakeholders' engagement. There is no direct benefit of city-only emissions reduction and even worse, Lemesos and the EMME region are considered hotspots for climate change (e.g.,  $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  global is  $3+$  regional). This enhances apathy ("I do not care") and the feeling of helplessness ("I cannot fix this, government should"). Nevertheless, the healthy human attitude against helplessness in times of crisis and the citizens engagement and social innovation components of the NZC missions should be strong and ambitious.
A key initiative (linked to governance plus social innovation; in combination to the “100 flowers”) for NZC is the “Lemesos Commons” (there is detailed description of its role in many parts of the AP and there is a separate preparatory project already running; we avoid repeating details here). The participatory co-workshops will foster stakeholder engagement (and social innovation) by filtering and preparing the pilots (e.g. “let 100 flowers bloom”) and most important the upscaling of projects to reduce GHG emissions, as well as “chaos” management (e.g. see “the X curve example during the transition pathway). It is importance to stress once again, the “no-one left behind” principle and the random selection of stakeholders (those who disagree are in the spotlight).

Moreover, there are many examples presented in Table C2.1 that supprort social innovation, in various scales (micro and macro).

From

Urban labs; multi-stakeholder engagement; SME accelerators for green economy; EIT Climate KIC intrernational projects and use cases to

citizens taking care of cleaning of our own areas; roads; coastal front and beach and

avoid the use of car and promote alternative no GHG emissions bicycle rides.

Micro and macro scale should go in combination. It is equaly important to engage a group of interested citizens, to discuss and argue with deniers, with attracting millions of euros for piloting and upscaling.

Finally (equally important), there is a need to tune the communication campaign (linked to stakeholder engagement and social innovation):

“focus on heat and public health instead of GHG”;

“on sea pollution instead of seagrass”;

“on personal money savings instead of social energy savings”;

“balance motivators (personal job opportunities; ...) and restrictive/prohibitive measures (parking; traffic; building property transfer)”.

Also highlight adaptation to climate change and nature based solutions at small and larger scale. A microforest or the unification of green spaces will act towards cooling the city and allow people enjoy the city, even if there is a 3 degrees increase by 2050.

Boosting social innovation (and engagement) is the number one component in zero emissions as well as improving the environmental and human health conditions, in Lemesos and beyond.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for further refining the Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract.

## 6.1 Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration – textual elements

The process of drafting a complete Lemesos CCC under a strict deadline has been instructive. The teams preparing it as well as Stakeholders contributing already have several improvements, issues for further clarification, stakeholder discussion, and other detailed changes to make to the September 2023 version submitted in the March 2024 version planned.

We consider the CCC as the structured repository of our Transition Plan with continuous modifications and public versions every 6 months, with a major update every March and a minor every September. A whole digital system will be built around it allowing Monitoring (both detailed technical and broader political and social), Evaluation (using the originally thought KPI’s and others that will emerge) and most significantly Learning (for those involved in implementation, for scaling and for transferring to other cities).

In the second half of October 2023, we shall produce in Greek (and English, for the large population of foreigners living in Lemesos) a layman’s version of the CCC, the “Lemesos Climate Transition Roadmap”, as a basis for extensive discussions with Stakeholders (who typically are ‘laymen’ regarding areas beyond their respective competences) and especially Citizens. These discussions will be held in the form of Co-workshops (Participatory solution co-design workshops) i.e., long-term discussion bodies. The results from these co-workshops with all Stakeholders and Citizens will be incorporated in the March 2024 edition of the Lemesos CCC.

Although the present CCC is the result of consultations between City decision makers and scientists with other Stakeholders and the public, few people have seen it as a whole and studied it in detail. The period October 2023 – March 2024 will be suitable for such a public interactive consultation. As it coincides with municipal elections campaigns (planned for May 26 or June 9) it is a good opportunity for active involvement and making the Lemesos Climate Transition and Mission participation a subject for broad consensus as it has been so far, rather than a polarizing one -although, of course, specific Transition issues will be. Furthermore, since the municipal elections will be held on the same day as the election for European Parliament, it will also be an opportunity for asking all European Parliament candidates not only to embrace the Lemesos CCC in abstract, but to have specific opinions and make specific promises for supporting the NZC Mission at EU level.

A particular issue to be dealt with in the March 2025 edition of the CCC is the potential inclusion in the Transition of the whole municipality area after the 2024 Cyprus municipal reform. The new L.M. will include an adjacent, currently independent, municipality (Mesa Geitonia) and an adjacent, also currently independent, community (Tserkezi). It is clear that the various Action Portfolios of the CCC could be extended to the new areas with different degrees of difficulty; this challenge will be a matter of study and discussion in 2024-25.

# 1 Introduction

Explain your city's motivation to join the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" and highlight your city's present commitments to climate action. You may also want to include the aims of this document.

# Your text

Limassol's Climate City Contract (CCC) is a living document, documenting the commitment of the city to reaching climate neutrality by 2030. As such, it is a constantly evolving document aligned with the broader policy framework at the EU, National and local (city). By this, it is ensured that the efforts will be not only complementary to those of other stakeholders, but also transferable to other cities the policies of which are driven by EU Strategies and directives.

Main drivers of all proposed actions are:

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015
The Paris Agreement, which is an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The EU Green Deal, which is a set of policies and regulations aimed at making the EU climate neutral by 2050.
The National Energy and Climate Plan which is looks into detail at the national targets up to 2030, and serves as a basis for an ambitious long-term strategy aiming towards the minimisation of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
Other National Strategies, Policies and Legislations mainly related to energy, transport, the built environment and waste management.

These policies are detailed in Module A-2 Table A-2.1 of the AP.

Using these policies as reference to all actions, we can ensure that our proposed actions are ambitious, relevant and achievable, while enabling the necessary political support at national and EU level.

The CCC objectives can only be achieved if supported by a broad coalition of stakeholders. In this direction, links at multiple levels of governance have been established already at the early stages of design, including all relevant stakeholders such as the city's local government, the national government, local business community, civil society organizations as well as citizens.

Examples of how the CCC creates links at multiple levels of governance:

We work with the national government to secure dedicated funding for actions related to the climate.
We partner with businesses to develop and implement climate-friendly solutions.
We engage with civil society organizations and citizens to raise awareness of climate change and to build support for climate action.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Articulate your 2030 climate neutrality ambition, as expressed and defined in your Cities Mission Expression of Interest (EoI). This should include your ambition and commitment to a 2030 horizon as a whole city, as well as describe any exclusion areas and summarise how these areas would be addressed beyond 2030. (A more detailed plan for exclusion areas should be included in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.) Your 2030 ambition should be supported at a minimum by a Council decision, and it is recommended that it is also supported by a wider stakeholder group. We also recommend you
LIMASSOL2030
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

to list other co-benefits you aim to achieve when working towards the climate neutrality goal, like well-being, health, equity, justice, financial savings.

## Your text

Lemesos Municipality's 2030 climate neutrality ambition is a visionary and comprehensive commitment to address the pressing challenges of climate change while fostering a sustainable and thriving community. This ambitious goal centers on achieving carbon neutrality within the municipality's jurisdiction by the year 2030. At its core, this initiative recognizes the urgency of mitigating climate change, it aligns with international efforts to limit global temperature rise and it encompasses a multifaceted approach with various key elements.

The municipality will undertake significant efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across sectors. This includes transitioning to clean and renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency in municipal operations and buildings, and promoting sustainable transportation solutions to reduce emissions from vehicles. It is committed to expanding and enhancing green spaces and urban forestry aiding in carbon sequestration. It is embracing circular economy principles, which aim to reduce waste generation and promote recycling and resource efficiency. Building collaborations with governmental agencies, nonprofits, and the private sector has been pooling resources, knowledge, and expertise in climate action.

Furthermore, the commitment to reach climate neutrality goes beyond mere environmental considerations; it also brings forth a multitude of co-benefits that significantly enhance the city across various dimensions. These co-benefits encompass social, economic, environmental, health, and governance aspects, all contributing to a more sustainable and prosperous future.

Governance Benefits:
a. Innovation: Lemesos' commitment to the Climate City Contract necessitates innovative policies and governance structures. This fosters an environment of continuous improvement and adaptability, positioning the city as a pioneer in sustainable urban development.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

This is the core section of the Commitments document that should summarise at least 3 or 4 systemic strategic priorities that need to be implemented for your city to become climate neutral by 2030. These should be meaningful changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in your city, like decarbonising the heating system in the city or generating 100% energy from renewables. The individual commitments between your city and other stakeholders should address these key priorities and contribute to reaching them. The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan should describe the all interventions, including those to reach your priorities as well as all further actions, in detail and describe how your city plans to implement them.

## Your text

In a world grappling with the urgent need to combat climate change, the city of Lemesos stands as a beacon of commitment and innovation. Lemesos, situated in Cyprus, has boldly declared its intention to achieve climate neutrality by the year 2030. This ambitious goal reflects not only the city's determination to curb greenhouse gas emissions but also its dedication to fostering sustainable development.

What distinguishes Lemesos' approach is its comprehensive strategy, which encompasses Technical, Social, and Governance interventions. These systemic priorities are pivotal in reducing emissions and laying the foundation for a sustainable, resilient future.

Achieving climate neutrality hinges on transforming Lemesos' technical infrastructure. Several key interventions form the backbone of this approach including the local production of energy, energy storage, urban regeneration, energy efficiency of buildings.

Taking a decisive step towards reducing its reliance on fossil fuels the city is embracing centralized energy production. In the CNAP it proposes harnessing the power of renewable sources such as solar to generate a substantial portion of its energy locally. This transition to cleaner energy sources not only reduces emissions but also enhances energy security and promotes local economic development. Additionally it proposes the creation of energy storage solutions that are essential to ensure a stable and resilient energy supply which will minimize waste and maximize the benefits of local renewable energy sources.

Beyond changing its energy production the city is proposes the implementation of policies and initiatives aimed at promoting responsible consumption. Circular economy models and sustainable transportation options are being encouraged, reducing unnecessary resource consumption and the associated emissions.

Lemesos is currently undertaking urban regeneration projects that have a dual impact. By redesigning urban spaces, increasing green areas, and creating pedestrian-friendly zones, the city aims to lower the need for energy-intensive cooling systems and promote eco-friendly transportation. This approach enhances both environmental sustainability and the quality of urban life.
LIMASSOL2030
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Smart solutions for building energy efficiency are a priority. The city is adopting innovative technologies to reduce energy consumption in buildings, with a specific focus on optimizing cooling systems and implementing intelligent building management. This not only lowers emissions but also contributes to economic efficiency.

The city has set its sights on electrifying various sectors, from transportation to industry, while ensuring that the electricity comes from renewable sources. This bold move is expected to significantly reduce emissions associated with fossil fuel combustion, promoting a cleaner and more sustainable future.

To address emissions from the transportation sector, Lemesos is investing heavily in public transportation infrastructure. By making public transit more accessible, efficient, and appealing, the city aims to reduce the reliance on personal vehicles. This transition holds the promise of lowering emissions and easing traffic congestion.

Implementing a comprehensive waste separation system, with a specific focus on organic waste, is a key component of Lemesos' strategy. Additionally, the city is exploring the production of biofuels from organic waste, thereby reducing landfill dependency and emissions.

One of Lemesos' most remarkable initiatives is the creation of a unique climate action model with high transferability value. Reducing emissions from maritime activities is a priority for Lemesos, and it is actively encouraging the use of cold ironing for ships in its port. Collaborating with stakeholders, the city is working to provide the necessary infrastructure and incentives for this eco-friendly approach. This initiative not only drives climate-neutral transitions within the city but also serves as a model for other Mediterranean cities in Cyprus. It fosters regional collaboration and knowledge sharing, amplifying the impact of climate initiatives.

In addition to technical advancements, Lemesos places great importance on social interventions to ensure a just and inclusive transition.

Collaboration and inclusivity are at the heart of Lemesos' approach. Co-workshops bring together a diverse array of stakeholders who participate in generating climate solutions. This inclusive approach ensures a broad range of perspectives and expertise, enriching the decision-making process.

The Lemesos Commons is a dynamic platform that integrates solutions generated through co-workshops. It ensures representativeness and a holistic perspective by randomly selecting participants from various sectors. This structure maintains continuity and produces detailed project proposals with broad support.

Recognizing that all individuals and entities within the city contribute to emissions, Lemesos conducts comprehensive stakeholder mapping. This includes citizens, community organizations, residents, and civil society, ensuring inclusivity in decision-making processes.

Lemesos takes a geographic and social focus, prioritizing a just transition. The city's approach goes beyond results and emphasizes participatory decision-making to ensure that climate actions benefit all segments of society.

A dedicated entity, the Lemesos NZ 2030 Organisation, is responsible for driving the city's climate goals. It provides strategic leadership and coordination of climate initiatives, ensuring a unified approach.

Recognizing the importance of institutional capacity, Lemesos invests in building the capacity of its municipal institutions. This empowers them to effectively implement climate strategies and policies.

Expert teams, both internal and external, collaborate to develop and execute climate action plans. This collaborative approach ensures alignment with best practices and a well-rounded perspective.

The Transition Arena serves as a platform for all stakeholders to come together. It facilitates dialogue, knowledge sharing, and collective decision-making, fostering a collaborative climate action ecosystem with continuous synchronous, asynchronous and repository online access to Information.
LIMASSOL2030
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Transparent and accessible information-sharing platforms ensure that stakeholders have up-to-date information on climate initiatives, promoting accountability and informed decision-making.

Establishing two yearly regular physical forums provide opportunities for face-to-face engagement and collaboration among stakeholders, further strengthening the sense of community and shared responsibility.

Lemesos' unwavering commitment to achieving climate neutrality by 2030 is underpinned by a holistic approach that encompasses technical, social, and governance interventions. These systemic strategic priorities, combined with individual commitments and the detailed planning outlined in the Lemesos CNAP 2030, will undoubtedly pave the way for a sustainable and resilient future.

# 4 Principles and process

Highlight the key principles that will guide your city as it implements its Climate City Contract, like accountability, transparency, or an open attitude to new approaches. The process should encompass principles like co-creation, innovation, multi-actor and citizen engagement, and should be systemic and demand-driven in nature. It should also be based on monitoring and joint learning. The Commitments Guidance document provides more specific guidance on how integrate these principles into your own process.

## Your text

### 4.1 Key principles

Our key principles are grouped in six axes (Figure CD 4.1): Sustainability, Geo-political, Scientific, Effective, Socioeconomic, and Participatory.

Under Axis I Sustainability the guiding principle is the UN Sustainable Development Goals and in particular SDG 13 (Climate Action), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). The litmus test is Just Transition: although it is obvious that the NetZero transition will have a large positive effect on the city, it is far from clear that this will be justly distributed; on the contrary several existing jobs and existing SMEs are in danger. (See the Introduction to the Action Plan, Section 1.2.3 Guiding Principles for Project Priorities for elaboration and examples.) Transparency increases participation and public trust and helps to self-restraint decision makers. Accountability is important for the large impact, both financial and physical, of decisions to be taken.

The Geo-political Axis II sets the broader context of the CCC: Policies, Laws, Directives and Regulations as well as social norms in the concentric circles of the EU/EC/NZ Cities Mission, the Republic of Cyprus, the living Lemesos City and the Lemesos Municipality define a context that must be adhered to while being reformed to serve the climate neutrality transition. A fundamental tool for this will be the Regulatory Sandboxes (see AP 1.4.3 – Three-year Plan (2023-2026) which increase the L.M. competence to design, advance and apply regulations that will give it more flexibility, greater enforcing powers and accelerating capacity on issues directly affecting the NZ Transition (e.g., building regulations, education and training, supply chains, traffic and others).

# Axis V includes action principles from the Socioeconomic context. Existing social attitudes toward climate change have been determined as a significant barrier to the Transition; shifting these attitudes along two directions (see Figure CD 4.2) from Needs to Citizenship and from adversarial to skillfully active are main goals of the CCC. The existing regulatory framework delineates -and constricts- our transition activities, including financial opportunities. Finally, we expect that sufficient human resources will be a significant bottleneck in the scaling up phase of the plan, especially regarding the built environment. For this, upscaling is foreseen as following the spiral growth process; beginning from a neighborhood portfolio of projects to reach a city scale transformation towards NZ (see "let 100 flowers bloom", the Social Innovation project, #4 in the 2023-26 plan, Introduction to the AP, Annex I).

We consider the Participatory Axis VI to be the most critical and at the same time the most innovative, so we describe the participatory solution co-design workshops and the Lemesos Commons in more detail here (For a fuller description see Sections 1.3.2, 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 of the Introduction to the Action Plan). Our Transition Arena consists of 5 transition teams: Internal Municipal, Scientific, Social, Political and Implementation. The Lemesos NZ 2030 Inc. is the central financing and implementation guiding organization, a multi-shareholder entity including citizens, SMEs, businesses, stakeholders, authorities and, of course, the Municipality.

# 4.2 Participation: Citizens, Marginalized Groups and Stakeholders

Active and impactful involvement of the Stakeholders and the Public.

Despite the general agreement about informing and involving all stakeholders and citizens in City Climate Transitions, specific methods, objectives and therefore results differ. The Lemesos Transition master plan includes two main instruments: Co-workshops and the Lemesos Commons. Their main objectives are (a) to achieve a shift in social attitude towards people becoming agents of change in the climate crisis (CNCD Appendix III) and (b) distilling collective wisdom for the Transition. This wisdom will materialize in the form of transition-advancing detailed project proposals that are well thought-out, consider multiple stakeholder concerns, are solidly grounded on science, can be socially monitored, have broad support, and deal positively and objectively with objections. The two main instruments are being build according to the pilot project  $\mathsf{LC}^3$  (Lemesos City Cooling Challenge; 2023-2025).

# 4.2.1 Co-workshops: Participatory co-design solution workshops

Co-workshop methodology (protocol) has been developed in the pilot project LC3. A co-workshop is a transition-long effort by a team of 15-20 people from a single group of stakeholders (AP Intro Section 1.3.3) and is in this respect only homogeneous. It is organized around one or more face-to-face 3-hour sessions and includes initial group selection and preparation, subsequent synchronous and asynchronous online communication, and long-term team building. It is guided by a Transition-trained facilitator whose role is to organize, listen, conduct the face-to-face sessions, monitor the progress, evaluate the outcome, and transfer the learning to the whole Transition arena. Each workshop has a central theme, a specific issue for consideration and solution design. The sessions are interactive with well-designed activities and a self-reflection ending in each. Experts may join parts of the physical or online interaction, especially at the beginning and for answering feasibility questions and transferring experience from beyond Lemesos. The evolving concrete outcome of co-workshops is their co-designed solutions developed. The main expected impact is the change of attitude of the participants towards Climate Change, the Municipality and their personal and collective capacity to become change agents. Both outcome and impact of co-workshops are open (may change) and long-term. Is it expected that co-workshop participation will evolve in time with some new members joining and old leaving.

Evidence for co-workshops already implemented, co-workshops planned, and the methodology designed and being used see CNCD Appendix III.
LIMASSOL2030
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

## 4.2.2 The Lemesos Commons: from solutions to projects

Around 20 experienced co-workshop participants, randomly selected from various stakeholder co-workshops, will form a heterogeneous stakeholder group, the Lemesos Commons, to review, harmonize, and integrate solutions developed from the homogeneous co-workshops. (Analysing a problem first from one point of view by a homogeneous group and then from several points of view by a regrouped heterogeneous team is the well-known jigsaw method.) The reason for random selection is representativeness. Lemesos Commons members will commit their time for six months and then be replaced by other, also randomly selected, members from the same stakeholder group. (Each month 1/6th of Lemesos Commons members will be changed so that the change in membership is gradual.) The methodology for initial Lemesos Commons member preparation, physical sessions, synchronous and asynchronous online communication, progress monitoring, outcome evaluation, and transferring learning to the whole Transition arena is similar to those of the Co-workshops. An experienced member will act as the Lemesos Commons 'Speaker' for 6 months, representing the Commons to the Transition team, the City Council, and the broader society. The outcome of the Lemesos Commons will be transition-advancing detailed project proposals that are well thought-out, consider multiple stakeholder concerns, are based on scientific expertise, can be socially monitored, have broad support and deal positively with objections. Its authority stems from its members' social recognition, their institutionalized participation in the governance/monitoring of Transition projects, participation in the City Transition team and the Lemesos NZC 2030 organization advisory board, but mainly it is their expert and referent authority that is important, so that although they have no formal veto power, their collective opinions will be respected.

## 4.2.3 Civic engagement: participation and challenges

Civic engagement is perhaps the major Transition action. Citizens are the main stakeholder and will be represented by random co-workshop "graduates" living/working in Lemesos, as economic actors (asset owners and users, professionals affected by or effecting the interventions), scientists and academics and political entities (government agencies and civil society). Co-design involves user engagement methods focused on collecting information from and empowering citizens to form a better understanding of their needs, through storytelling, workshops, and interactive design tools. The figure below (Fig. CD 4.3; from the pilot project LC³) presents the approach that to establish the "Limassol Commons" towards the implementation of pilot projects, their upscaling process and MEL. All this work will be accompanied by dissemination at several levels (local, national, international) and MEL.

There are three challenges related to citizen engagement. First is getting a representative, fair, inclusive distribution of citizen groups to participate in the workshops in physical presence (not online); for the successful implementation of this, a thorough stakeholder mapping process has been conducted (see Section 5 of this CD, CNCD Appendix III for a list of workshops). Second is conducting the workshops so that they are actually participative co-design and not "presentation - questions - vote". Third is keeping citizens engaged afterwards, in the Lemesos Commons and the interventions. The difficulty (and the pitfall) is not to select those already interested, active and concerned by the Climate Crisis, else whatever success the Transition may initially have will not be scalable.

Details matter a lot: preparing the methodology and materials for the co-workshops; selecting and training the workshop facilitators (including issues on climate and psychology); running an effective CoA campaign inviting citizens; dealing with climate deniers, political opponents of the city administration, narrow-minded interests etc.; utilizing the presence of journalists and educators; and keeping people actively engaged for a long period. But, if we do manage these, the collective narrative will actually be owned by the citizens of Lemesos.

Figure CD 4.3. The approach that to establish the "Limassol Commons"

# 4.2.4 Socially marginalized groups

The most significant cross-cutting issue for CoL NZC is inclusion and support of the vulnerable and marginalized in four overlapping main aspects specific to the Climate Transition (and not necessarily identical with the 'usual' concept of socially marginalized):

(a) Legally non-citizen members of the society i.e., both poor migrants and rich foreigners who are usually excluded from the basic democratic participation. (b) The large minority who does not trust authorities (anti-vaccine, climate-deniers, conspiracy theorists, et.al) and is in principle against all top-down activities. (c) Low-income, low education, and elderly people, who by necessity regard emissions concerns as luxury beyond their means, who may not afford their share of the intervention costs and who may not directly benefit from them ("just transition"). (d) People who are afraid or realize that their jobs and SMEs are at risk (e.g., petrol/diesel car technicians). (e) A small Muslim (Turkish Cypriot) community.

(For more details including targeted creation of green jobs and inclusive SME business opportunities, see in the Introduction of the AP Sections 1.2.3 Guiding principles for project priorities and 1.3.2 Geographic and Social Focus.)

All five together may well be more than half the population (taking into account that more affluent citizens tend to live in the suburbs); outreaching to them for active involvement will be extra difficult. The communication campaign will target these diverse groups with a different strategy and means. This includes a particular role for unexpected stakeholders such as the Church, football clubs, and others. It is therefore important to exclude from the Transition efforts ideological issues other than those directly connected to Climate Neutrality -so far, the Municipality has been able to have unanimous cross-party consensus regarding the NZ Mission.

The Transition approach promotes and enhances the recognition and sharing of such efforts, the way they transform our local environments, gender and intersectionality (gender, race, background, and class) issues are on the agenda throughout the Transition and build on community wishes and challenges that emerge. Gender is less of a concern: women (e.g., mothers of young children) tend to be more active in environmental issues; we have to be careful though that they are not assigned lesser roles.
LIMASSOL2030
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Age is a lever: we leverage the generation gap in understanding the risk of climate crisis and overcoming attitudes of helplessness, and selfishness.

The full just inclusive transition risks being beyond the scope of any specific project but is central for the Lemesos mission: short and medium-term benefits from, and problems by the road to NZ are not distributed equally or justly; it is easy for the urgency of the Climate Crisis to make us ignore this aspect. It is also important, especially for the scientists leading the effort, that it is not only the "objective" benefits and harms that have to be just; it is mainly the perception and understanding of benefits and harms.

Four specific points in the CCC evidence the results of our approach to include marginalized groups in the Action Plan development:

The geographic focus (Intro to the AP, Section 1.3.2 Geographic and Social Focus) specifically includes a marginalized area in the 2023-26 initial planning period.
The social focus (Intro to the AP, Section 1.3.2 Geographic and Social Focus) specifically includes the elderly and "The pushed-away and left-behind (those who must benefit most from the Transition; vulnerable: affected by change, through various reasons unable to adapt without support)".
The emphasis on early dealing with the risks of job loss and SMEs closing (Intro to the AP, Section 1.2.3, guiding principle number 2).
A specific activity for early green job planning and specific courses designed and implemented in the Lc3 Pilot Project.

A major cross-cutting issue is getting people beyond their comfort zones and institutions beyond their quarterly reporting. Citizen onboarding, i.e., how to activate social groups, how to make them care about and how to enable them to act.

For marginalized groups, we will also capitalize on the work being conducted by the municipality and is related to social support programs (ongoing and planned). Indicatively, some of these include 1) The Social Market of the Limassol Municipality which was established in 2011 and supports vulnerable groups of citizens, mainly based on financial criteria. Its operation is based on the work of volunteers and is further supported by various organizations of the city and voluntary associations. 2) The "Free Hands" program, which is a project aiming to provide social support to low-income families by making sure that teenagers are kept safe during the afternoon. This way, mothers are given an opportunity to seek for a job and support their families. 3) The "Social Work on the Road" community intervention program runs for more than 10 years and focuses on young people, in vulnerable communities (e.g., low income, immigrants). 4) The "Odysseus" counselling station, a NGO offering prevention against behavioural and substance abuse. The program targets the general population, such as children, teenagers, young people, teachers and vulnerable population groups.

## 4.2.5 Stakeholder Participation

The process for Stakeholder participation is the following:

a. Stakeholder Mapping. Starting from Stakeholder types (Government, Authorities, Institutions, Businesses in several transition-related subcategories, SMEs, NGOs) we have drawn a long list of organizations, persons, involvement, present and expected roles in the Transition Arena.
b. Initial informal contact. The small size of Cyprus typically allows easy informal contacts at all levels. These give us the opportunity to talk to key persons (Mayors of the Cypriot NZ Cities network, Mayors of Metropolitan Lemesos, top administrative and engineering management of Cyprus Electric Authority, the Lemesos Bishop, bankers including EIB, SME representatives, Port Authority, etc) to explain the Mission, exchange oral and written information, and organize the next steps.
c. Formal contact and meeting with Municipality officers (including the Mayor, city councilors, the Town clerk, and members of the Internal Transition Team.
d. Participation in solution co-design workshop(s)
e. Singing a memorandum of understanding
LIMASSOL2030
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

f. Participation in drawing up the CCC. Includes suggestions, reviewing, writing specific sections, co-workshops.
g. Participation in the Lemesos Commons
h. Participation in Transition Projects. Includes initial requirements analysis, specification, design, procurement, and execution.

Needless to point out that this is an open, indicative process with several iterations. Its main characteristic is its openness and although at the beginning we were actively searching for stakeholders to participate at this stage we have more interest than we can timely, effectively, and wisely handle.

Section 5 and CNCD Appendix II, III have a partial list of stakeholders currently involved at various stages.

## 4.2.6 The Iterative, Agile Process of CCC Development

The transition process began with the establishment of a high-level guiding vision providing a clear and inspiring direction for its sustainability and climate resilience efforts, inviting stakeholders and citizens to engage in discussions and co-design the plan's implementation.

An iterative agile development approach for the Action Plan (AP) development ensures more citizens and stakeholders are continually involved, and ongoing refinement and responsiveness to evolving needs and ideas, primarily based on MEL. Designing the Action Plan served as a catalyst for answering fundamental questions such as identifying barriers, recognizing opportunities, mapping stakeholders, and determining how to involve them effectively. This stage forced a comprehensive assessment of the sustainability landscape.

Thematic teams were established to address specific areas crucial for sustainability. These teams, in conjunction with public co-designed workshops, facilitated collaborative discussions and ideas-sharing. They played a pivotal role in shaping the Action Plan's content and direction. The present version of the Action Plan is described as the first complete version while emphasizing that it is not final or definitive, signaling a commitment to adaptability and openness to further refinement. The Action Plan serves as a foundation for discussions with the stakeholders and citizens and it represents a starting point for deliberation, refinement, and further engagement to shape the future updated versions.

In the period from October 2023 to March 2024, climate transition planning efforts in Lemesos will undergo a significant acceleration. This phase includes expanding the Transition Team and intensifying Municipal Capacity Building, with full-time staff dedicated to these efforts. The municipality will engage in extensive public consultation through co-workshops, leading to the development of the second version of the Climate City Contract (CCC). Feedback from CCC v1 will be incorporated into this updated version, and CCC v2 is scheduled for submission by March 15, 2024. This cycle of progress will be repeated in September 2024, emphasizing continuous improvement and adaptation in Lemesos' climate transition journey. Lemesos Municipality is dedicated to monitoring progress and fostering joint learning. This commitment is highlighted by its plan to establish a CCC Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) mechanism, which will provide a structured framework for assessing the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives, ensuring that the vision of an inclusive and sustainable Lemesos is realized. Given the strong political support for the vision, scientists are engaged to design specific actions for discussion. The city partnered with the Cyprus Institute (CyI) as its central scientific advisor and collaborates with three additional universities specializing in particular thematic areas. These institutions produced an initial version of action portfolios based on their expertise and gathered input through public workshops involving stakeholders and citizens. Co-creation is a core principle that resonates throughout Lemesos Municipality's engagement with stakeholders, citizens, and thematic teams. It recognizes that sustainable solutions require input from diverse stakeholders, including marginalized groups, and promotes collaboration to design and execute effective strategies that leave no one behind. In parallel, the Lemesos Municipality embarked on developing an Investment Plan for its climate neutrality goals. With the aid of financial advisors, the Action Plan was analyzed, the capital sources

identified, and the 2023 budget assessed. Stakeholder mapping and capacity assessments paved the way for the IP stakeholder communication. The relevant parties considered the municipality's capital stock, estimated capital needs, and addressed associated risks. They established a monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) framework for feedback.

The Investment Plan, divided into three sections, encompasses climate investment's current state, pathways to neutrality, and enabling conditions. This comprehensive strategy showcases the Municipality's commitment to mobilizing resources, participatory approaches, and stakeholder engagement in the fight against climate change effectively.

# 4.3 Governance

Broad citizen and stakeholder involvement does not stop at active participation in the AP development process; it is also important that they continue participating in the implementation process (see Figure CD 4.4). A significant risk in such long-term social reform processes is social opposition at mid-term which when reflected in changes in the political leadership lead to the curtailing or even abandonment of the endeavor. (Examples: the US pulling out of the Paris Agreement; the Sevilla city after the 2023 elections changing some of their climate commitments; the UK government during 2022-23 reducing their climate goals.) This is why the benefits of the process of Transition (not just its results) should be monotonically increasing for all (see Intro to the AP Section 1.2.3 for details.)

The Lemesos CCC plan ensures broad social participation in its governance through a multi-shareholder organization "NZ Lemesos 2030, Inc" that controls project procurement, finance, monitoring and acceptance.

Lemesos Municipality's sustainability journey is deeply rooted in a vision that encompasses a robust commitment to key principles guided by the creation of the Lemesos' Climate City Contract. These principles encompass accountability, transparency, an open attitude towards innovative approaches, co-creation, multi-actor and citizen engagement, systemic thinking, demand-driven initiatives, and a strong foundation in monitoring and joint learning.

The process begins with the establishment of a vision that serves as a guiding light throughout this journey, providing a clear and inspiring direction for its sustainability and climate resilience efforts, inviting stakeholders and citizens to engage in discussions and co-design the plan's implementation. This approach emphasizes the importance of aligning the plan with a clear and shared vision for sustainability. An iterative and agile development approach is employed throughout the Action Plan (AP) development process. As the AP is being developed, more citizens and stakeholders are continually involved, ensuring ongoing refinement and responsiveness to evolving needs and ideas.

Designing the ActionPlan served as a catalyst for answering fundamental questions such as identifying barriers, recognizing opportunities, defining stakeholders, and determining how to involve them effectively. This stage forced a comprehensive assessment of the sustainability landscape. Thematic teams were established to address specific areas crucial for sustainability. These teams, in conjunction with public co-designed workshops, facilitated collaborative discussions and idea-sharing. They played a pivotal role in shaping the Action Plan's content and direction.

The present version of the Action Plan is described as the first complete version. However, it is emphasized that it is not final or definitive, signaling a commitment to adaptability and openness to further refinement.

# Appendix III: Evidence for Stakeholder Engagement

Co-workshops: Participatory co-design solution workshops

Co-workshop methodology (protocol) has been developed in the pilot project LC3. A co-workshop is a transition-long effort by a team of 15-20 people from a single group of stakeholders (AP Intro Section 1.3.3) and is in this respect only homogeneous. It is organized around one or more face-to-face 3-hour sessions and includes initial group selection and preparation, subsequent synchronous and asynchronous online communication, and long-term team building. It is guided by a Transition-trained facilitator whose role is to organize, listen, conduct the face-to-face sessions, monitor the progress, evaluate the outcome, and transfer the learning to the whole Transition arena. Each workshop has a central theme, a specific issue for consideration and solution design. The sessions are interactive with well-designed activities and a self-reflection ending in each. Experts may join parts of the physical or online interaction, especially at the beginning and for answering feasibility questions and transferring experience from beyond Lemesos. The evolving concrete outcome of co-workshops is their co-designed solutions developed. The main expected impact is the change of attitude of the participants towards Climate Change, the Municipality and their personal and collective capacity to become change agents. Both outcome and impact of co-workshops are open (may change) and long-term. Is it expected that co-workshop participation will evolve in time with some new members joining and old leaving.

## 1st participatory co-design solution for the case of Anexartisias Street

### Description

The Municipality of Limassol has undertaken decisive actions to address its traffic challenges, notably considering the pedestrianization of Independence Avenue, the city's busiest street. Mayor Nikos Nicolaides, in an introductory speech, stressed the necessity of difficult yet essential measures to prevent passing the traffic problem to future generations. Public consultations, including workshops and a questionnaire with 1045 participants, were conducted. Results revealed citizen concerns about safety, accessibility, and a desire to reduce traffic and pollution. The workshops, led by architect and engineer Dr. Grigoris Kalnis, underscored the need to consider various effects, including economic, traffic-related, social, and environmental consequences. Independence Avenue's potential pedestrianization is seen as a pivotal step in reshaping the city's approach to mobility. Despite overall support for sustainable urban measures, some residents, particularly those in the affected area, expressed concerns about potential disruptions to their daily lives.

Pilot city project: Lemesos City Cooling Challenge (Lc3)

Description

The Lc3 (Lemesos City Cooling Challenge) project tests the systemic combination of three innovative pathways to accelerated decarbonization in a living lab environment. One is the overcoming attitudes and behaviors of apathy, helplessness, and myopic self-interest through broad stakeholder participation in co design/creation solution workshops extending deeply in the pilot activities governance so that the learning/reflexive cycle cuts through Project, Mission, City, and local Society.

The participatory (co-design workshops and Lemesos Commons in Governance), inclusive (multiple stakeholders: owners, professionals, scientists, civil society), uses multiple levers of change (technology, finance, CoL capacity building, regulatory transformation, social alliance building) setting the foundations of a systemic change in a real-world living lab).

The participatory co-design solution workshops (“co-workshops”), whose purpose is to develop sustainable solutions and whose hidden curriculum is to make their participants agents of change in the city. Several dozens of co-workshops will be run, each with about 20 participants from a homogeneous stakeholder group and a facilitator. A problem relevant to the stakeholder group is selected and presented and the group is assisted in collectively develop solutions, pinpointing challenges, and
proposing methods for overcoming them. In addition to the solutions co-developed, each co-workshop 'delivers' its 'graduates' who having been through such a process will become catalysts for change in their environment, promoting the spirit of "together for implementation" through support of the specific solutions co-developed, of the co-workshop methodology as the city-citizen interaction model and of the need and feasibility of climate action. Depending on the group and the time available, the maturity of solutions developed will vary. In some cases, the outcome will be "shaping the challenges" and "scouting and qualifying appropriate solutions" rather than solutions. For this we first develop the co-workshop methodology and the learning activities ('learning material') that will guide the process of co-developing the solutions for each type of workshop. Another important activity in WP1 is the establishment and operation of The Lemesos Commons. It has the form of a long-lasting co-workshop, with rotating heterogeneous participants from all stakeholder categories. (Forming a heterogeneous group from the members of previously consulted homogeneous groups is the classic "jigsaw" method for active participation in education. There is a plethora of other participatory digital planning tools that can support the whole process.) The Lemesos Commons is part of the project governance scheme where the solutions developed by the homogeneous co-workshops are deliberated and decided for the project team to implement.
