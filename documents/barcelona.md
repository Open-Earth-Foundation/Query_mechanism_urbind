# Barcelona City's Commitment to Climate Neutrality

## A solid and recognized track record in the fight against climate change

Barcelona has a long history in the field of climate change mitigation. Regarding mitigation, its origins date back to the Solar Thermal Ordinance and the Energy Improvement Plan of 2002. The most significant milestones were the Barcelona Energy, Climate Change and Air Quality Plan 2011-2020 and the Barcelona Environmental Ordinance (2011), which included the mitigation of climate change and adaptation to its effects as municipal policy objectives, regulating various topics, including solar generation, among others.

In 2015, during the COP21 in Paris, the City Council presented the Barcelona Climate Commitment (BCC), promoted by over a thousand companies, civic entities, schools, and institutions associated with the Barcelona+ Sustainable network, signatories of the Citizen Commitment for Sustainability 2012-2022. This declaration reaffirmed the municipal commitments made (Covenant of Mayors on Energy and Adaptation) and outlined Barcelona's roadmap. Three years later, the Municipal Council Plenary approved the Climate Plan 2018-2030, co-produced by hundreds of city organizations, which reinforced existing climate measures and incorporated many others. The Plan received the Covenant of Mayors award for the best initiative from a major city.

In 2019, the Climate Emergency Board was established, with representatives from over two hundred organizations participating in its working groups. This process led to the Climate Emergency Declaration (January 2020), which mandated increasing ambition, specifying, accelerating, and strengthening actions already outlined in the Climate Plan, adding new ones, and urging other competent authorities to address the climate emergency. Seven model changes were identified (urban planning, mobility and infrastructure, energy, economy, consumption and waste, food, culture, and education), along with the eighteen action lines of the Climate Plan, shaping the 2030 Climate Emergency Action Plan (CEAP), published in November 2021.

Furthermore, Barcelona has been an active and even pioneering participant in various climate cooperation initiatives and city networks. In November 2021, with the Mayor of Barcelona serving as the European Vice-President of the global Steering Committee of the C40 network, the city joined the "Cities Race to Zero," a commitment to reduce global carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and acquire only zero-emission buses from 2025 onwards. Barcelona also adhered to the "C40 - Fossil Fuel Free Streets" commitment to create a fossil fuel-free zone in the city.

Faced with the climate challenge and other complex urban issues, Barcelona has distinguished itself by its commitment to seeking solutions through scientific knowledge and technological and social innovations, in collaboration with its citizens and multiple stakeholders. Its policies to promote and guide the "smart city" model, with a focus on generating public value, are widely recognized. The Smart City World
Congress in Barcelona, probably the world's leading event on this topic, is a result of this commitment.

In this context, we view the European Mission "100 Smart and Climate-Neutral Cities by 2030" as an innovative public policy instrument that offers Barcelona the opportunity to increase its level of commitment and enhance its climate action, while also serving as a catalyst and example for other cities and regions in the decarbonisation effort.

# 2030 Goal: Achieving Climate Neutrality

Law 7/2021, of May 20, on climate change and energy transition, includes among its minimum objectives for 2030 a reduction of emissions for the entire Spanish economy by at least 23% compared to the year 1990. Likewise, Catalonia's Climate Change Law 17/2017 establishes that every five years, the Government of Catalonia must present to the Catalan Parliament a proposal for greenhouse gas emission reduction objectives, taking into account the reduction goals set by the European Union and the burden-sharing among member states. Catalonia's current objective is to reduce emissions by 51% compared to those of 2005 (27% compared to 1990).

At the local level, commitments to reduce emissions have been encouraged through cooperation initiatives among cities (such as the Local Covenant of Mayors on Climate and Energy), often leading in terms of time and ambition compared to state actions. In the specific case of the city of Barcelona, in November 2015, the Barcelona Climate Commitment set a goal for the city to reduce 40% of its per capita GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2005. In 2021, following the agreements made in the Climate Emergency Declaration, Barcelona committed in the 2030 Climate Emergency Action Plan (CEAP) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 compared to 1992¹ and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

Barcelona's participation in the European Mission 100 Smart and Climate-Neutral Cities by 2030 in 2023 requires an upward adjustment of mitigation objectives, providing greater intensity to policies and greater speed to energy and climate transitions. Thus, the Barcelona City Council commits to working with the city's administrations, the business community, and social stakeholders, using all available means to achieve the city's neutrality in greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2030. The intention is to achieve an 80% reduction in these emissions compared to what would be expected in a continuity scenario, without climate policies (Business as Usual, BAU) in 2030 (3.87 million MT of CO2 equivalent), which differs very little of those registered in 2019 (3.82 million). To make such an ambitious goal achievable, we must ensure that it is understood and embraced by citizens and finds support and cooperation from the European, Spanish, and Catalan governments.

Barcelona's commitment focuses on emissions generated in key sectors for the city's functioning, which are also major sources of GHG emissions:

¹ Despite European and state legislation referring to reductions compared to the year 1990, in Barcelona, year 1992 has been chosen as reference because it is the first year for which a complete emissions inventory is available.
To achieve a drastic reduction in emissions, transformation levers will be pushed to the maximum in all of these sectors, always acting with climate justice criteria.

For the Mission purposes, emissions generated by clearly supramunicipal infrastructure will be excluded from the calculation, because they are subject to specific regulations and must comply with European, national, and regional emission reduction standards. Specifically, this refers to the Port of Barcelona and the Josep Tarradellas International Airport, located in the municipality of El Prat de Llobregat. However, the Barcelona City Council commits, within the framework of the Mission, to promote the electrification of these sectors and the reduction of their emissions.

Regarding emissions generated by electricity production, it is assumed that, in accordance with the commitments of the Spanish and Catalan governments, Barcelona will have a predominantly renewable energy mix by 2030 (with a potential contribution from the city of Barcelona of around 1,080 MWp). In this scenario, emissions generation will significantly decrease. The incorporation of renewable energies must continue to grow rapidly in the 2030-2040 decade, in large part to compensate for the gradual closure of nuclear power plants.

Residual emissions expected for 2030 will be offset, on one hand, by increasing the city's green infrastructure (Nature Plan2030). On the other hand, through a significant reduction in level 3 emissions embedded in construction and consumer products. To achieve this, Municipal policies will be developed in the areas of food (Healthy and Sustainable Food Strategy 2030), waste prevention and reduction (Zero Waste Plan), and building construction and renovation. The widespread use of sustainable materials like sustainable sourced wood in construction activities will also increase the city's built environment's carbon sequestration capacity. Together, these measures form a comprehensive circular economy strategy that will intensify from 2024 onward.

## Priorities and strategic interventions to advance towards climate neutrality

Reaching the Mission's objectives will require a genuine systemic change, capable of combining disruptive innovations in various sectors with a significant and structural reduction in energy demand and consumption. The strategy will be structured around the five sectors we have identified as crucial for Barcelona's functioning and decarbonisation.

## Transportation Sector

Expand public transportation infrastructure and services, improving the reliability, competitiveness, and capacity of the basic and proximity bus network, collaborating with the Government of Catalonia to increase interurban bus services and create bus lanes on access roads to the city, completing the tram network, enhancing the metro system, improving surface public transportation interchange areas, intermodal stations, and regional and metropolitan bus terminals and promoting in front of the competent administration the necessary investments in suburban and regional rail transportation to achieve a significant improvement in regional rail public
transportation quality.

Transform the urban fabric with sustainable mobility criteria, improving accessibility and comfort for pedestrians (wider sidewalks, vertical mobility - escalators and elevators-, pedestrian priority streets), and provide safe and high-quality cycling infrastructure, as well as park &amp; ride areas, in collaboration with other authorities.
Change the rules of the mobility game through measures such as low-emission zones, the prioritization of road networks, the extension of regulated parking throughout the city for all motorized vehicles, the introduction of fees on the goods distribution activity of large online sales platforms, and the consideration of complementary measures like congestion pricing.
Upgrade public transportation vehicle fleets with low-carbon technologies, moving towards zero-emission vehicles: municipal vehicle fleets (including waste collection vehicles), buses and coaches, taxis.
Promote electric vehicles (cars, vans, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, machinery, etc.) in the private sector through the expansion of charging infrastructure and tax incentives for acquisition, charging, and parking.
Implement the 2030 Urban Freight Distribution Strategy (UFD), facilitating the creation of off-street distribution and collection spaces (pickup points and urban freight distribution centres), promoting the greening of UFD fleets (including cycle logistics), and applying a fee on the distribution activity of major e-commerce platforms.
Encourage the reduction of forced work-related mobility through sustainable mobility strategies and plans for organizations and businesses that normalize practices such as telecommuting and teleconferencing.

## Building Sector

Advance in the knowledge of new construction systems and solutions to enhance heat protection and passive heating and cooling of buildings, as well as the cost-benefit balance (economic, social, and environmental) of different construction and renovation options. This includes, among other things, energy monitoring of residential buildings, spaces dedicated to the tertiary sector (commerce, hotels, etc.), and public facilities.
Promote changes in the sector's rules by introducing new technical specifications regarding thermal comfort standards in residential buildings, a regulatory framework for heating/cooling in the tertiary sector, and an ordinance to encourage productive roofs in new construction, extensive renovation, and changes in building use.
Foster through communication, information and training, the necessary mindset change among all stakeholders (developers, builders, technicians, users, etc.) in both the residential and tertiary sectors regarding design, construction, usage, maintenance, and renovation of buildings. This involves promoting a positive attitude towards new building methods, materials, and
decarbonisation-supportive technologies, as well as a culture of energy savings and maintenance. In this regard, enhance energy advisory points, turning them into comprehensive climate advisory points, and encourage property owners' organization, with the support of property managers, to overcome the collective action dilemma in horizontally-owned buildings.

Increase incentives for building renovation by private entities through reducing and simplifying associated procedures, mechanisms to facilitate private project financing, and an appropriate offering of subsidies and tax incentives, always incorporating climate justice criteria.
Promote innovation through project competitions and challenges focused on finding efficient construction solutions specifically adapted to the Mediterranean climate.
Encourage the replacement of heating and hot water systems that use combustion systems with equipment operating on renewable energies (solar thermal, geothermal) or highly efficient electric equipment (heat pumps and aerothermal systems). In this regard, support regulatory and market changes that accelerate the transition and prevent the commercialization and installation of new heating and hot water systems that rely on combustion mechanisms.
Encourage, through incentives, communication, and information, the replacement of household appliances and lighting elements with high energy efficiency models.

## Energy Sector

Increase public infrastructure for energy generation and efficient energy use, accelerating the implementation of renewable generation in municipal buildings (educational, cultural, sports facilities, etc.) and in public spaces (through pergolas as well as pavements and road infrastructure); creating green roofs and facades on municipal buildings and promoting the development of productive roofs (with vegetation, solar panels, cisterns, and/or reflective surfaces) through agreements with the private sector; developing and consolidating existing district heating and cooling networks and promoting new ones.
Enhance incentives for private entities to install renewable energy sources, through specific regulations (mentioned in the previous paragraph), streamlining associated procedures, mechanisms to attract private financing for such projects, and a suitable offering of subsidies and tax incentives.
Encourage the establishment of energy communities that include not only residential buildings but also tertiary and industrial facilities and spaces.

## Waste Sector

Promote locally sourced products, second-hand trade, exchange markets, bulk distribution, and the consumption of products and supplies derived from waste
valorization. Using for this purpose spaces such as repair workshops, libraries of things, and specific events.

Implement environmental measures at festivals, fairs, conferences, and other public events, making the use of reusable cups and tableware mandatory.
Deploy individualized collection systems for household and commercial waste throughout the city and mechanisms that incentivize participation in selective waste collection.
Enact regulatory changes to enable the implementation of new extended producer responsibility (EPR) systems and promote the establishment of deposit, return, and refund (DRR) systems.
Reach voluntary agreements with the private sector to establish best practices in reducing packaging, single-use plastics, and more. Provide guidance to companies to facilitate the planning and implementation of these measures.
Optimize transportation routes to reduce travel and emissions generated in waste collection

## Green infrastructure and water Sectors

Significantly increase the city's green space, applying the criteria of the Green and Biodiversity Charter in green area and urban tree projects, prioritizing areas with the most deficits. Promote urban green corridors, especially the Ciutadella-Collserola corridor, create ephemeral or seasonal gardens (ten per year, one per district), restore the Rec Comtal (irrigation canal), and beyond the municipal boundaries, re-naturalize the riverbeds of the Llobregat and Besòs rivers.
Expand green infrastructure in buildings encouraging the incorporation of plants on roofs, facades, and interior spaces of all types of buildings, both private and public, to contribute to their energy efficiency.
Promote tree and forest management with a climate change perspective. Prioritize tree species based on their resilience to extreme climatic conditions and their capacity to provide ecosystem services, including carbon capture. Furthermore, prevention and firefighting services will focus on protecting the most vulnerable areas in mountain neighbourhoods.
Ensure that urban planning legislation and supra-municipal planning instruments, such as the Metropolitan Urban Planning Master Plan and the Collserola Natural Park Plan, regulate and manage the territory with a climate change perspective, promoting the creation of green corridors and reserved space for groundwater infiltration, the protection of areas at risk from climate events, and the metropolitan-scale agricultural uses.
Generate knowledge and innovations applied to water management in a context of structural scarcity to improve efficiency and create alternative supply systems (reclaimed water, rainwater harvesting, use of greywater,
desalination, etc.), prioritizing those with low impact in terms of energy expenditure and emissions generation

# Cobenefits: decarbonizing the city to gain quality of life

The direct economic benefits of the Mission will be highly relevant in the medium and long term, but the complete return on investment, leading to a clearly positive financial balance, only becomes possible when considering the substantial co-benefits, both, social, economic, and environmental, associated with decarbonisation.

Co-benefits are evident in all sectors: in transportation (reduced air pollution from NOx and particles, resulting in decreased respiratory ailments and deaths from pollution; less noise, leading to reduced psycho-emotional and health-related issues and an improved quality of life; reduced congestion, allowing for vital time savings; improved physical fitness and overall health due to increased active transportation), in the building sector (increased comfort for occupants of renovated buildings; reduced health problems resulting from poor energy conditions in homes -mold due to humidity, colds and pneumonia in winter, heat-related discomfort and poor sleep due to high temperatures in summer; reduced energy poverty; decreased fire risk from the use of braziers and stoves in economically disadvantaged homes; generation of local jobs in building rehabilitation), in the energy sector (reduced dependence on imported fossil fuels and increased energy sovereignty; decentralization and democratization of energy infrastructure, with greater consumer participation; creation of direct local jobs in the installation and maintenance of photovoltaic systems and other renewable energy sources; promotion of innovation through the development and installation of new renewable energy sources such as marine and small-scale wind energy), and in the waste management sector (resource and energy savings through the extension of product lifecycles and material recovery through recycling; reduced requirements associated with waste management -transportation, space occupation, treatment energy, and incineration emissions-; creation of local jobs related to the circular economy).

Other co-benefits are associated with the transformation of the urban model. The expansion of public spaces available for social interaction, play, or contemplation also improves social cohesion and quality of life. The incorporation of more vegetation into the city also enhances biodiversity and air quality, in addition to reducing the urban heat island effect. In summary, the expected co-benefits will contribute to creating a much healthier urban environment with new economic opportunities and a higher quality of life, as well as playing an essential role in adapting the city to climate change and achieving a just energy transition.

# Principles of the climate neutrality strategy

Barcelona's strategy is based on 12 principles, of which four are goal guiding, while the remaining eight point to the methodological approaches and working methods that will be used to achieve the goals of the Climate City Contract of Barcelona (CCCB).

# Comprehensive Approach to Sustainable Development

The CCCB is approached with an integrated perspective on sustainable development, in line with the United Nations' 2030 Agenda. Therefore, social and economic factors will be carefully considered when designing decarbonisation actions and assessing their impacts. In the social dimension, the priority is to ensure the health and wellbeing of the population, with special consideration for the most vulnerable individuals and the preservation of social cohesion. Critical objectives include guaranteeing the supply of water and energy and ensuring access to basic services and infrastructure. Regarding the economy, the repercussions on various sectors of activity will be taken into account to implement, when necessary, actions that reduce potential damage and facilitate the adaptation to change. Moreover, a proactive approach will be adopted to identify and harness all economic opportunities arising from decarbonisation. In this context, training will also be strengthened in sectors such as energy retrofitting, installation and maintenance of solar panels, sustainable food, or electric mobility. Barcelona already has a Roadmap for the 2030 sustainability economy that includes all these aspects. It commits to accompanying companies in the transformation of their business models, through the application of innovative solutions and the training and development of new professional skills and profiles.

# Comprehensive Approach to Climate Change

Policies to mitigate global warming cannot disregard the need for adaptation to climate change, which is inexorable and, to a large extent, already present in the city. For this reason, the CCCB prioritizes approaches and measures that allow simultaneous and synergistic progress in both mitigating climate change and adapting to it. This approach promotes the well-being of the population during the climate transition and
better balances current needs with those of future generations. Nature-based solutions, such as increasing green spaces, are particularly useful in this regard. Additionally, the CCCB expands its focus to cover, at least in part, Scope 3 emissions (those that are generated outside the city to produce products consumed or used within the city). This is because a city that is emissions-neutral for Scope 1 and 2 but has high Scope 3 emissions is not sustainable on a global scale.

## Local and Global Climate Justice

The Mission is a commitment to intergenerational climate justice. The CCCB also seeks a socially equitable distribution of the costs and benefits, in the short, medium, and long term, generated by the decarbonisation process. The goal is to ensure that the shift to more sustainable practices for the planet does not come at the expense of the opportunities and quality of life of certain individuals and social groups. This involves eliminating energy poverty in households, thus ensuring that no one lives exposed to temperatures that are incompatible with health. Furthermore, the technological and social innovations being adopted, such as electric mobility or renewable energy self-consumption, must also be accessible to vulnerable households. Applied globally, the principle of climate justice entails a commitment that climate neutrality will not be achieved through the export of emissions, as well as the obligation to cooperate with cities in the Global South, seeking a model of fair and sustainable development.

## Democratic Planning: Transparency and Participation

The CCCB must ensure access to climate information for the entire population, including information about the impacts of climate change (such as pollution episodes, extreme heat, droughts, or torrential rains) and information related to mitigation and adaptation policies (cost, outcomes, impacts). It will be essential to regularly update and report on the progress of greenhouse gas emissions. All relevant information will be published on the corresponding section of the municipal website, as well as in the statistics and open data sections.

The CCCB also embraces a participatory approach, aiming to engage and hold all sectors of the city co-responsible. To develop this approach, the extensive participation toolkit already available will be used, and collaborative decarbonisation projects (mini-missions) will be worked on. The Citizen Council for Sustainability will play a key role as a permanent space for coordination and collective learning, supplemented by other participatory mechanisms and processes, such as participatory budgets or climate assemblies. The digital platform Decidim enables the articulation of participatory processes at all levels, offering a versatile space for participation by associations and individual citizens, while also fostering a productive hybridization between online and in-person participation.

Furthermore, autonomous citizen action will be supported, expressed through the creation of energy communities or other mechanisms that can empower individuals in the climate transition. In this vein, the City Council will consolidate its policy of providing financial assistance to climate projects initiated by civil society, favouring collaboration between organizations and alignment with the CCCB agreements. To fully harness this potential, clear, accessible, and up-to-date information will be provided about grant programs and, in general, about all proposals requiring active
participation from the private sector and/or the associative sector. Municipal communication platforms will be used to showcase the commitments, actions, and best practices of various stakeholders.

## Cross-Cutting Design and Management

The City Council will have a dedicated team to drive and implement the CCCB, and internal coordination mechanisms will be established to ensure the communication of advances and the follow-up of binding sectorial strategic plans. To achieve this, it is essential to establish a joined-up coordination and monitoring committee composed of representatives from all municipal departments and from all entities within the so-called Municipal Group (the Council plus its autonomous bodies and the municipal owned companies) whose participation is deemed relevant.

Simultaneously, an internal training plan will be developed, with specific training activities for positions directly involved in climate action, as well as informative and awareness sessions designed for the entire municipal workforce. Systematizing the use of climate information among municipal technicians is crucial, enabling the tools that allow effective sharing of new knowledge and equipping individuals to use it (through necessary training, such as in GIS, for example). Another focus area will be the impacts of climate change on the continuity of essential city services and infrastructure.

Through the CEAP and the reinforced commitments of the CCCB, the City Council will undertake a robust and sustained long-term action, reinforcing its commitment to decarbonisation and significantly contributing to accelerating the demand for low or zero-carbon technologies, thus promoting the local productive sector dedicated to retrofitting, electrification, and renewable energy installation.

## Proximity

Consistent with the principle of participation, the CCCB will promote a proximity-focused approach to climate action. To help operationalize this principle, each district will have a dedicated technician and municipal equipment as a reference point for sustainability and climate change.

The contribution of each district and neighbourhood to greenhouse gas emissions generation will be assessed, and how climate change specifically affects them will be analysed. The participation of the local social fabric will be strengthened through neighbourhood councils and other mechanisms in defining urban, green, and mobility proposals to mitigate the effects of climate change. The creation of citizen networks and neighbourhood-scale climate action groups will also be encouraged through the instruments of the Neighbourhoods Plan and the Nature Plan. Special efforts will be made to ensure the participation of vulnerable individuals in these spaces and processes of participation.

## Knowledge and Innovation

The accelerated transition to a climate-neutral economic and social model will require systematic and continuous improvements in the operation of the administration and in how urban challenges are addressed. Therefore, the CCCB will work from a public
policy perspective that is open to experimentation and innovation. Barcelona's scientific and technological ecosystem has the potential to meet the needs of Barcelona's climate transition and even generate cutting-edge European and global knowledge on the subject.

The Barcelona Science Plan and other innovation promotion programs will be used to increase basic and applied research on climate change and climate policies. Participation in Horizon program projects, such as RESCUE (on how climate change will affect Barcelona), LOCALISED (on the generation of decarbonisation models and scenarios adapted to cities), and SUN4ALL (on expanding local renewable energy generation in vulnerable environments), also plays an important role in this area.

## Communication and Education for Cultural Change

The CCCB will promote an ambitious and innovative communication strategy in line with the consideration of climate neutrality as a city objective. In this regard, the Energy and Climate Change Interpretation Centre at the city level will be strengthened, along with information and discussions on climate emergency and future models in cultural programming, as well as the inclusion of climate themes in major city events and neighbourhood festivals. Existing programs that support schools, organizations, and businesses as spaces for awareness and climate action will also be enhanced.

All of these actions are part of the Plan Let's Change for the Climate (strategy for the culture of sustainability), approved by the Government Commission on February 2, 2023. This plan aims to promote changes in the prevailing culture and help develop and disseminate a new culture of sustainability that intensifies climate action in the city.

In this context, mechanisms such as nudges will also be studied and applied. Nudges involve making small changes in the design of incentives that encourage citizens to act in a certain way without prohibiting any options, through correcting cognitive biases, and recognizing the influence of the context on behaviour.

## Proactive and Exemplary Municipal Action

The CCCB will only be credible if the City Council acts consistently and serves as an example in the decarbonisation of its buildings, vehicles, and practices in general. The Program for a Carbon-Neutral City Council will bring together, enhance, and accelerate on-going efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across all areas of municipal administration. This involves collecting projects and sharing experiences, identifying barriers to decarbonisation in each sector, and working, with support from the Program, to overcome them.

## Metropolitan Approach and Multi-Level Cooperation

The CCCB is aligned with the Metropolitan Strategic Plan of Barcelona 2030. This plan, the first designed within the framework of the 'city of 5 million' configured by the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona, is structured around eight missions, one of which relates to the environmental and climate emergency ('To mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure a healthy habitat based on a just transition in the energy
model and sustainable resource management'). It commits to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the metropolitan region by 45% by the year 2030.

Building on this common framework, efforts are underway to establish the necessary external coordination and communication mechanisms among administrations (especially the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, the Barcelona Provincial Council, and the Government of Catalonia) to create synergies and facilitate the achievement of the goals of the CCCB.

## Cooperation between Cities and advocacy for localism

The CCCB will be developed in close collaboration with the European cities participating in the Mission, especially those in Spain, through CitiEs and the Spanish platform of the Mission. The aim is to exchange best practices and undertake joint projects that allow for greater and faster progress in the different Mission areas.

Efforts will also be made to cooperate with cities in the metropolitan area of Barcelona and in Catalonia, with the intention of assisting in the decarbonisation of the region. On the international front, participation in organizations and city networks like Eurocities, C40, or the Covenant of Mayors for Climate will be strengthened.

Beyond the willingness to collaborate, networking with other cities is aimed at establishing strong advocacy action to achieve regulatory and public policy changes at the European, Spanish, and Catalan levels, as deemed necessary to accomplish the Mission.

Furthermore, international cooperation in the context of climate justice will continue to be promoted, both through projects developed by NGOs and through direct city-to-city cooperation, with a focus on the Mediterranean region. In this context, efforts will also be made to generate knowledge about the impact of the climate crisis on global inequalities, migration movements (climate refugees), and human rights.

## Accountability and Evaluation

Methodologies and tools that allow for the calculation, at a reasonable cost, of both the effort and the impacts of the actions undertaken within the framework of the climate agreement will be adopted. The tracking indicators of the CCCB will form the basis of annual monitoring reports, as well as evaluation work that may be agreed upon. At the municipal level, one of the most relevant measures will be the implementation of the climate assessment of the municipal budget, with the aim of linking public expenditure to the established objectives and quantifying its effects in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reduction, as well as the identification of potential emission gaps that need to be addressed. The activity reports of sectorial and territorial management units will also include a section dedicated to climate action.

## The anticipated process for completing, implementing, and reviewing the City Climate Agreement

The Commitment to Barcelona's climate neutrality is implemented through its annexes (the Action Plan, the Investment Plan, and the Support of Local Actors), which together
form the Climate Agreement of the City of Barcelona. In line with the Mission's philosophy, the annexes are conceived as open documents that will be refined and updated through an iterative process of review, adjustment, and expansion as deemed necessary, while always keeping the objectives outlined in this Commitment in focus.

The mandate arising from the municipal elections held on May 28, 2023, offers an opportunity to develop the CCCB in perfect alignment with the action plan and investment plan of the City Council, seeking the collaboration of the political groups present in the Municipal Plenary.

The first step will be the development, between November 2023 and April 2024, of a Government Measure for Climate Neutrality 2030. This measure will define the objectives, management responsibilities and necessary resources to guide the mission in the 2024-2027 period. Simultaneously, the Municipal Action Plan and the Municipal Investment Plan for 2024-2027 will be developed, allowing for the participation of the public and the refinement of specific actions and financial allocations for the CCCB.

During the fall of 2023, systematic efforts will be made to gather support and commitments for the Mission, prioritizing the participation of over 2,000 organizations (NGOs, business and labour agents, schools, etc.) that make up the Barcelona +Sustainable Network, as part of the renewal process of the Commitment to a Sustainable Barcelona. The obtained support, all with specific commitments from each organization, will complete Annex 3 of the CCCB. Support from metropolitan political institutions and Catalonia will also be formalized.

Upon completing all these processes, the first review and update of the CCCB will take place in September 2024, providing the annexes with a higher level of solidity and specificity.

This first review will also consider, logically, the orientation of climate policies of the new Government of Spain and, specially, the new European Commission, resulting from the European Parliament elections scheduled for June 6-9, 2024. We hope that both institutions will reaffirm and expand their support for the Mission and everything it entails.

From that point on, considering the municipal mandate cycle, we tentatively anticipate a second review in the fall of 2026 (prior to the municipal elections of 2027) and a third in the fall of 2028 (feedback and alignment with the Municipal Action Plan 2028-2031), along with a final assessment during the first half of 2031.

# Annex 1: Climate Action Plan for the city of Barcelona

Introduction

City Context

The City of Barcelona has an area of 101.7 square kilometers and a population of 1.66 million (as of January 1, 2023), which represents a population density of 13,327 inhabitants per square kilometer. Considering the floating population (students and other non-registered inhabitants), the real population was estimated in 2020 at 1,783,556 people (751,378 households). Barcelona's economy is based on services, which represent more than 90% of the employed population. The industry has lost relevance in recent decades, largely because it has moved to other areas of the increasingly extensive metropolitan region of Barcelona.

The City of Barcelona enjoys a certain degree of autonomy for the government of its public interests, recognised and regulated by the Spanish Constitution and the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia. Local autonomy reached its peak in the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century, with the approval of the Barcelona Municipal Charter (1998, which granted new powers), the Law on Measures for the Modernisation of Local Government (2003, which recognised the specificity of large cities), and the new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (2006). This evolution was truncated with the Law for the Rationalisation and Sustainability of Local Administration (2013), which reformed the Law on the Bases of Local Government, limiting or suppressing municipal competences (such as the provision of heating) and increasing ex ante control over local administration, thus making it more difficult to create new services and service activities. One of the most significant changes is the suppression of Article 28, which allowed municipalities to complement the action of other administrations in policy fields such as the protection of the environment. This possibility still exists, but it depends on the sectoral legislation of the State or the Autonomous Community.

The City of Barcelona, however, has a Municipal Charter with the status of a law (1/2006, of 13 March, which regulates the Special Regime of the municipality of Barcelona), which offers its municipal government greater scope for action. The Charter (Art. 42) enshrines environmental policy as a duty, which includes, among other aspects, the "promotion of the use of non-polluting vehicles as opposed to those that may produce some kind of pollution", as well as the "use of renewable energies in all its installations and will promote their application to the municipality's housing and industries". It also enshrines the "general principle of municipal finance that activities or goods that produce pollution or any other type of nuisance should be taxed more heavily than those that are harmless". Article 102 of the Charter makes explicit the "commitment to a sustainable city" and lists the contents of "policies aimed at preserving, restoring and improving the urban and natural environment". The aim is to "ensure good water and air quality; adequate noise levels, in accordance with international recommendations; the quality of urban space; the maintenance and promotion of public health; the minimisation, reuse, selective collection, recycling and treatment of municipal waste; the saving and efficient and effective use of energy; the efficient management of natural resources, as well as the defence and protection of animals".

There is a pending reform of the Municipal Charter to make the fight against climate change a top-level objective. Even though, the current distribution of powers already allows the Barcelona City Council to have a significant impact in three areas: Urbanism (which includes urban planning and the conservation/rehabilitation of

Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona
Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona

buildings), the urban environment, in the broad sense, and mobility (which includes the regulation of mobility and the provision of public transport). To this we must add the provision of basic services, such as water (considering the whole cycle) and waste collection and management. Barcelona's Environmental Protection Ordinance (1999) regulates the different elements of the environment that fall under local competence, in accordance with current legislation.

On the other hand, Barcelona is the head of a metropolitan area whose first ring (36 municipalities, 636 km2, 3.3 million inhabitants) enjoys since 2010 institutional status, through the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, which manages, by delegation of the municipalities that make it up, metropolitan public transport (bus and metro network), water supply, waste management and urban/territorial planning.

The regulation and management of public transport beyond the AMB (suburban networks, buses and the tram service) is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya, through the Metropolitan Transport Authority (ATM). The same applies to the territorial planning of the metropolitan region.

The regulation of energy and climate issues cascades down from the broad guidelines set by the European Union, applied in basic state legislation and developed by the autonomous regions in the areas in which they have competencies. The process is neither linear nor free of conflict. In the last two years, budgetary and legislative agreements have been reached that have made it possible to align the agendas of the different administrative levels, within the framework of the European Green Deal and the Next Generation EU Funds. The regulatory framework is now fairly favourable to decarbonisation, but with some key elements still to be completed.

With regard to the political context, it should be noted that in the 2019-2023 term of office the municipal government was formed by a coalition of two parties, Barcelona en Comú, which held the office of Mayor, and the Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSC-PSOE). It has been a minority coalition government, which was obliged to reach an agreement with at least one opposition group in order to be able to approve the budget and all major measures. During these years, the Covid19 pandemic and the need for the city's recovery, also supported by the opportunity of the Next Generation EU Funds, favoured the generation of broad consensus on the major objectives of the moment, including the fight against climate change. However, there were also notable disagreements on the implementation of concrete measures, especially those related to mobility.

The May 2023 elections confirmed the high level of political fragmentation. In the first plenary session of the new City Council, PSC candidate Jaume Collboni was elected mayor and formed a minority government.

# Barcelona and the climate change

In its Sixth Assessment Report (2022), the IPCC confirmed that the models predict with a high level of consistency that the Mediterranean basin will experience an above-average increase in temperatures, as well as a reduction in rainfall and a gradual rise of the sea level. Given the fragility of Mediterranean ecosystems and the density of its human settlements, this area of the planet is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Among the negative effects expected, and already evident in many cases, are extreme summer temperatures (increased by the heat island effect), reduced water availability, increased flooding, receding beaches, poorer air quality, more forest fires and loss of biodiversity.

In the specific case of the city of Barcelona, climatological data show a gradual increase in the average temperature in the city since the 1980s, and the change seems to have accelerated in the last 2-3 years. The summers of 2022 and 2023 have brought heatwaves of unprecedented intensity. August 23rd 2023 was the hottest day in Barcelona since existing temperature records. At the Fabra Observatory (located in the Collserola mountain range, at an altitude of 415 metres), the average temperature was 34.1°C, with a minimum of 29.4°C, also a record high, and a maximum of 39°C. There has been a proliferation of so-called "torrid" nights, with minimum temperatures above 25°C, a phenomenon that has arrived much earlier than predicted in previous studies.

Average annual temperature recorded by the Fabra Observatory in Barcelona.

Between September 2022 and August 2023 the same observatory recorded the lowest annual amount of precipitation of its 110 years old registers (319 l/m²). The accumulated water deficit since autumn 2020 has jeopardised not only agricultural, but also industrial and domestic water supply. Significantly, these three years of drought were preceded by the Gloria storm, which caused severe damage to the city's infrastructure and beaches.

Climate change is already having a negative impact on the city's living conditions, and the magnitude of future impacts will depend directly on the intensity of global warming. Faced with this situation, Barcelona affirms its commitment to the collective struggle to stabilise the climate and to improve the city's capacity to adapt to climate change, prioritising people's health and quality of life.

The European research project RESCCUE ("Resilience to cope with climate change in urban areas") has studied two possible climate change scenarios (among the various scenarios defined by the IPCC): the committed scenario (RCP4.5) and the passive scenario (RCP8.5). The "committed" scenario assumes that the emission reduction targets of the 2015 Paris agreement are achieved on time and on budget. In this case, GHG concentrations would be higher than they are today by the end of the century, but the increase would slow down from 2030 onwards, so that the maximum increase in global temperature would be limited to 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius.

In contrast, the "passive" scenario assumes that the targets set in Paris will not be met, which will mean that GHG concentrations at the end of the century will be much higher than they are today and the increase in global temperature will be well over 2 degrees Celsius. The Foundation for Climate Research (FIC) has carried out simulations of ten global climate models for the Barcelona region, and the results are an increase in average temperatures of 1.7°C by the end of the 21st century in the committed scenario and up to 4.5°C in the passive scenario.

This Climate Action Plan takes up the challenge of achieving climate neutrality in Barcelona by 2030, assuming a starting point that is far from optimal:

In the mobility sector, the means of transport considered as 'eco-mobility' (survey question: self-declared preferred means of transport) combined have recovered to pre-pandemic levels and even improved by one point. Public transport use, which fell by 6 points during the pandemic, stood at 36.2% in the first months of 2023, less than one point below the 2019 figures. Private motorised transport (cars and motorbikes) had an opposite trajectory, falling from 18.7% in 2020 to 16.3% in 2023. The sum of people who mainly use bicycles and e-scooters equals motorbikes (7.7%), while 11.5% declare themselves as mainly walkers/pedestrians. It is interesting to note the strong increase in eco-mobility in the younger age groups (18-44 years), which more than offsets the decrease observed in the 45+ age group. This evolution could be partly related to concerns about sustainability, partly to the growing residential mobility and job insecurity, especially among the

Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona
Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona

young population, as less stability means less money and incentives to buy a car. In any case, there seems to be clear generation gap in this issue. On the negative side, we have a very low share of electromobility, although it is making a strong start. In 2022, 6.3% of a representative sample of the population claimed to own an electric vehicle, almost doubling the figure obtained in 2021.

Beyond the problem of GHG emissions, which is global, Barcelona has a local problem of poor air quality, mainly due to the very high density of motor vehicles present in its urban fabric. A report by the Barcelona Public Health Agency estimates that in the period 2018-2019 the city suffered 1,900 premature deaths as a result of this problem, while in the period 2019-2020, which includes the COVID19 confinement and mobility reduction phase, the figure fell to 1,200. Noise pollution, traffic noise, also has negative impacts on emotional and psychological health. It can lead to sleep disorders and cardiovascular diseases. A recent report by the Barcelona Public Health Agency found that 57% of Barcelona's population is exposed to noise levels above those already considered negative for health by the WHO, and 27% is exposed to levels well above this threshold.

In the building sector, the starting situation is less promising. Of the total number of buildings in the city, categories D and E account for 58.2% of the certifications and categories F and G for 36.4%. Only 5.2% correspond to efficient categories (B and C) and 0.2% to the very efficient A category. In the case of new buildings, of which there are very few (the city is almost completely built up), 38.3% are rated D and E, 45.8% B and C and only 15.8% A¹. According to the EMA 2022, only around 60% of dwellings have adequate window and door insulation. There is still a long way to go in terms of energy efficiency. With regard to the decarbonisation of heating, the EMA notes a slight increase in the availability of heat pumps, but they account for just over 22% of installed heating systems; considering, moreover, that around 15% of Barcelona's inhabitants do not have a heating system and over 40% do not have air conditioning.

Fuel poverty has risen sharply in recent years, in parallel with the increase in energy prices and the cost of living in general. In 2020, 13.4% of the population said they could not keep their home at the right temperature in the cold months². The problem is increasing and is also becoming more pressing in the warmer months, with the normalisation of daytime and night-time extreme temperatures that are detrimental to health.

Renewable energy generation, both at regional and local level, is very underdeveloped. The city produces on its territory and from renewable sources just over 1% of the energy it consumes. In 2022, 5% of Barcelona's inhabitants had solar energy in their homes (EMA 2022). On the other hand, the electricity supply depends to a large extent on nuclear energy from plants with only a few years of service lifetime left, which makes it even more urgent to massively expand renewable electricity generation capacities.
In waste management, despite slight progress in recent years, it is proving very difficult to increase the recycling rate of municipal waste beyond 40%. There is also a long way to go in the field of prevention/reduction and reuse.

Green infrastructure has grown clearly and consistently in recent years, although the potential for growth is highly conditioned by the small size and high population density of the municipality.

Finally, with regard to water, it has been possible to consolidate guidelines for efficiency and savings in water consumption that are very useful -although perhaps not sufficient- for dealing with situations of structural drought, as well as for reducing emissions linked to water treatment and management.

Work process

Considering the starting point, the path to achieving climate neutrality by 2030 involves an increasing ambition and putting in place the precise mechanisms and instruments to decarbonise the city's economy in a few years. This is a major city challenge, which will require disruptive innovations in different sectors and a rethinking of production and consumption patterns, including values and lifestyles, in terms of sustainability.

The city of Barcelona has been committed to Local Agenda 21 from the outset and has been developing policies to promote a sustainable development model for more than 30 years. In 2002 the first Citizens' Commitment to Sustainability (2002-2012) was approved, which was renewed and extended 10 years later (2012-2022). At the end of 2020, the City Council adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda as guiding principles of its development strategy, providing quantifiable targets adapted to the city and committing to annually assessing the city's performance in relation to the SDGs.

In the more specific area of the fight against climate change, since the first Covenant of Mayors for Energy (2008) Barcelona has been present in all European and global initiatives led by city governments, including the Pact for Adaptation (2014), the Paris Declaration of Commitment of Cities to Combat Climate Change (2015) and the Global Climate and Energy Pact of 2017.

In terms of public policies, the first energy-related policies adopted were the Solar Thermal Ordinance (1999), the Energy Improvement Plan (2002) and the Solar Photovoltaic Ordinance, included in the Environmental Ordinance which in May 2011 which compiled the regulation of municipal action in this field. Another milestone was the Energy, Climate Change and Air Quality Plan 2011-2020, which included an Energy Saving and Improvement Plan for municipal buildings. In 2015, the adoption of the Barcelona Climate Commitment, following in the wake of the Paris Agreement, led to the drafting of the Climate Plan 2018-2030, awarded by the Covenant of Mayors, which reinforced existing climate measures and incorporated many others. Subsequently, the Declaration of Climate Emergency of January 2020 increased the level of demand for the measures envisaged, which led to the merger of the two documents into the Climate Emergency Action Plan 2030 (CEAP), published in November 2021.

To draw up the CEAP, several participative face-to-face sessions were held in 2017, with 119 participants and more than a hundred proposals for action received through the digital platform Decidim.Barcelona. To draw up the Declaration a Climate

Emergency Committee was aset up, made up of more than 300 people representing more than 200 organisations, who met in four face-to-face working sessions. In addition, the digital platform Decidim was made available to the process.

In parallel, over the last few years, various government measures and strategic plans have been developed, related to the achievement of climate objectives pursuing a new, greener, more equitable, more efficient and healthier city model:

Bicycle strategy (2015)
Creation of energy advising and basic supply guarantee points (2016)

The Action Plan for the Barcelona City Climate Agreement (CCC) is based on the CEAP, complemented by contributions from more recent strategies and plans. As we

have pointed out, stakeholder and citizen participation was very present in the CEAP and in almost all planning processes.

The implementation of the Action Plan and of the whole Climate City Contract (CCC) will be based on 12 principles, of which four are of a substantive, goal-oriented nature, while the remaining eight refer to methodological approaches and ways of working that will be used to achieve the objectives of the Agreement.

| Substantive principles                                                                   | Operating principles                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1. Comprehensive approach to sustainable development: environmental, social and economic | 5. Cross-cutting design and management |

Proximity
Knowledge and innovation |
| 2. Comprehensive approach to tackling climate change: mitigation and adaptation; Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions | 8. Communication and training for cultural change
Proactive and exemplary municipal action
Metropolitan approach and multi-level cooperation |
| 3. Local and global climate justice | 11. City-to-city cooperation and municipal action |
| 4. Democratic planning: transparency and participation | 2. Accountability and evaluation |

The adoption of the CCC will be a very important incentive to put climate action at the top of the political agenda in the term 2023-2027.

The first step will be the elaboration, between November 2023 and April 2024, of a Government Measure (GM) for Climate Neutrality 2030, which will delimit the objectives, management responsibilities and resources necessary to carry out the mission in the period 2024-2027. At the same time, the Municipal Action Plan and the Municipal Investment Plan 2024-2027 will be drawn up, with citizen participation, which will make it possible to fine-tune the specific actions and economic allocations of the CCC, seeking agreement and collaboration at all times with the political groups present in the Municipal Plenary.

At the conclusion of all these processes, the first review and update of the CCC will take place in September 2024, which will make the Action Plan more precise and robust.

A-1.6: Description and assessment of the Baseline GHG Inventory

Barcelona's energy consumption grew by 3.9% between 1992 and 2017, although it has been declining since its peak in 2005. In contrast, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which also peaked in 2005, have decreased by 28% since 1992. In terms of energy intensity, which relates energy consumption to the generation of goods and services, Barcelona moved from 261.6 Wh/€ in 1999 to 175.3 Wh/€ in 2019. This means that the city has been able to consume less energy per euro generated, and the trend seems to be structural. However, there are still major inefficiencies in the city's energy system. Thus, to satisfy the 15,321 GWh of final energy that Barcelona

consumed in 2019, 27,164 GWh of primary energy were needed, which implies a loss of 45% of it in the generation and transport processes.

Barcelona's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2019, considering Catalonia's electricity mix, were 3,557,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2-e), 2.7 tonnes per inhabitant. The city's largest energy-consuming sectors were the commercial and services sectors, closely followed by the domestic and transport sectors, and at a greater distance by industry and other sectors. If we look at GHG emissions, the order changes: transport becomes the largest emitter, with a contribution of 27%, followed by building (20.7%) and services (21.4%).

Of the city's total final energy consumption in 2019, 50.3% came from fossil fuels, 44.9% from nuclear plants and only 4.8% from renewable sources (according to the Catalan energy mix). By energy format, in 2019 Barcelona consumed 45.5% electricity, 31.7% natural gas, 21.8% automotive fuel and 1.0% liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). With regard to the origin of electricity, 55.1% of the electricity consumed came from nuclear energy (which is why Barcelona's electricity mix has a low emissivity) and only 17.1% came from renewable sources. Finally, it should be noted that 357.65 GWh were generated in 2019 from the use of local renewable and residual energies, including the incineration of solid urban waste at the Sant Adrià de Besòs plant (54%) and solar thermal (15%).

In 2020, due to the Covid19 pandemic, there was a forced confinement of the population for weeks, as well as a sharp drop in economic activity recorded by GDP. As a result, CO2-e emissions fell very significantly, by almost one million MT, of which more than 200,000 MT in transport, 100,000 MT in buildings and 600,000 MT in electricity generation.

In 2021, GHG emissions grew again, but the level reached was still well below the 2019 level, despite the lifting of most pandemic restrictions and the rapid recovery of economic activity. The data for that year and the advanced data for 2022 point to a structural reduction in emissions in transport and even more in electricity generation.

A-2.2: Description and evaluation of policies

Law 16/2017 on climate change in Catalonia basically pursues five objectives. Firstly, to ensure that Catalonia reduces both greenhouse gas emissions and vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, favouring the transition towards a model that is neutral in greenhouse gas emissions and, at the same time, transforming the model of production and access to natural and energy resources. Secondly, to reinforce and expand the strategies and plans that have been developed in recent years in the field of climate change. Thirdly, to promote and guarantee the coordination of all sectoral planning instruments related to climate change and the coordination of all Catalan public administrations, as well as to encourage the participation of citizens, social agents and economic agents. Fourthly, to become a leading country in the research

and application of new technologies that contribute to mitigation, and also to reducing Catalonia's energy dependence on external energy resources, decarbonisation and denuclearisation. Finally, to make Catalonia's role visible in the world, both in cooperation projects and in participation in global forums for debate on climate change.

By means of Decree Law 24/2021, on accelerating the deployment of distributed and shared renewable energies:

Priority is given to projects where the proximity of electricity production to consumption centres is taken into account.
The participation of local actors in the production and distribution of electricity is encouraged, prioritising cooperative, community, citizen and self-production projects.
The applicable criteria for land use are specified, with special emphasis on the planning of agricultural land use, favouring the compatibility of agricultural activity with the production of renewable energies, ensuring the conservation of biodiversity, land use planning and sustainable development of the rural environment.

It also incorporates administrative simplification measures for self-consumption installations.

The MTA's 2021-2030 Infrastructure Master Plan for Collective Public Transport envisages almost 72 km of new rail network (Metro, FGC and tram), 7 new additional stations and more than 450,000 new users. One example would be the completion of L9 and the connection of the Trams along Diagonal. In the case of Cercanías, almost 75 km of new suburban rail network, 4 new stations and more than 175,000 new users. In Public Road Transport, the forecast is for more than 60 km of new bus lanes, 280 km of BRCat network and more than 40 km of bicycle network. The decarbonisation of transport is promoted through 287 lines with more efficient nighttime charging, 257 lines with opportunity mode, and with actions that go in the line of facilitating access to PT, such as shuttle car parks.

The Llobregat Delta Strategy is the strategic planning instrument that the City Councils of Barcelona, El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat have agreed with the public operators in the area to achieve a more sustainable paradigm for the economic platform of the Llobregat delta, a new management model in which the promotion of economic activity to generate inclusive employment goes hand in hand with the reduction of the environmental grievances suffered by the delta and the reduction of all the externalities produced by industrial establishments and mobility.

The environmental sustainability objectives linked to decarbonisation are as follows: Mitigate the externalities of economic activities, optimise energy consumption and

increase the degree of energy self-sufficiency of companies; reduce energy consumption and the externalities of generated and attracted mobility; progressively arrange the spatial distribution of activities on the platform with sustainability criteria and expand the provision of green areas and open spaces in the area.

The Metropolitan Strategy for the Besòs area formulates a strategy for public intervention in the metropolitan environment of the Besòs River and defines a set of actions that contribute to social cohesion and to the economic and territorial dynamisation of the urban system structured by the final stretch of the river. The area is made up of the municipalities of Badalona, Montcada i Reixac, Sant Adrià de Besòs, Santa Coloma de Gramenet and the neighbourhoods of Barcelona adjacent to the river Besòs: Vallbona, Trinitat Vella, Baró de Viver and Bon Pastor. This territory has a total surface area of almost $60~\mathrm{km}^2$ and a population of around 450,000 inhabitants. The plan commits to the refurbishment of more than 600 buildings in the different neighbourhoods to improve energy efficiency, conservation and accessibility with various actions co-financed with Next Generation EU funds.

The Barcelona Agenda 2030 (2020) has a strategy based on three main lines:

The 2030 Agenda in the City Council, which is specified in the following measures:
Adapting the 2030 Agenda to the local reality of Barcelona
Aligning the City Council's planning with Agenda 2030
Monitoring the implementation of the 2030 Agenda
Innovating to ensure that the 2030 Agenda is achieved
To give specific impetus to the 2030 Agenda within the City Council.

The 2030 Agenda in the city, which will include the following measures:
Development of a communication plan for Agenda 2030
Elaboration of a plan for municipal involvement in the 2030 Agenda
Promotion of participatory processes by the citizenry
Creation of a round table for the promotion of the 2030 Agenda in Barcelona
Promotion of a certificate of compliance with the 2030 Agenda for municipal suppliers.

Barcelona 2030 international, which will be implemented through the following measures:
Creation of a working group of cities for the promotion of the evaluation of the 2030 Agenda
Leading the local implementation of the 2030 Agenda in multilateral organisations
Aligning the city's major international events with the 2030 Agenda

Attracting international events linked to the 2030 Agenda to Barcelona
International promotion of compliance with the Agenda in public-private partnership contracts

Barcelona's Integrated Territorial Strategy (ITS) should become a key planning instrument for the city towards 2030. It seeks to build a city of the future that is innovative, smart, competitive, green, inclusive and feminist, improving the quality of life of its citizens and fostering their sustainable development and resilience. The ITS is conceived as an articulated and participatory city response to the challenges of the future, promoting transformations that add value to the current challenges of ecological transition, digital transformation and social cohesion in Europe. In this sense, the period 2021-2027 brings a paradigm shift in sustainable urban development, given the priority needed for an accelerated contribution to climate change mitigation as well as to the Sustainable Development Goals. Cities, and in particular large European cities, must be a key driver of change to achieve these goals. Barcelona takes up these challenges and builds a strategy based on sectoral planning, coordination and collaboration between different areas and sectors, with the aim of addressing the city's challenges in a holistic and sustainable way. The ETI is structured around 3 objectives, 18 strategic axes, 60 strategic lines and 538 strategic actions to overcome the challenges that have been identified as fundamental for the city, with a view to 2030.

The municipal waste prevention strategy, Barcelona Zero Waste, is based on three priority elements linked to prevention: shared responsibility in the management of waste by citizens (the best waste is that which is not generated); reuse; and the improvement of selective collection, as well as its quality, and, specifically, of organic matter in a preferential manner. Along the same lines, the Barcelona Zero Waste concept is working to develop an economy that closes the cycles of everything we produce and does not generate waste. In this way, green points, exchange markets, the organic fraction and conscious and responsible consumption, as well as the promotion of public awareness of their proper use, favour the circular economy, as they facilitate the recycling and reuse of the maximum number of waste fractions. The strategy is set out in the Zero Waste Plan 2021-2027.

A key element in this area is the new waste collection management contract. A very important political commitment has been made to the electrification of the fleet. A lot of points were awarded in the tendering process in this respect. The fact is that the number of electric vehicles has increased from 20% to 66%. Seventy-five per cent of the cleaning vehicles are electric and 44 per cent of the collection vehicles, which are much heavier. In fact, before the implementation of the new contract there were only 3 electric collection vehicles in Catalonia, and now Barcelona will have 78.

Biodiesel will only be used for those vehicles without an operational alternative (from 39% to 7%). This means less noise, less air pollution and, logically, less CO2 emissions.

"This is not a drill" is the slogan of the Declaration of Climate Emergency (2020), approved by Barcelona City Council on 15 January 2020. This institutional declaration is accompanied by a package of more than one hundred proposals with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% in 10 years compared to 1992, which would mean, in absolute figures, a reduction of 2 million tonnes of CO2. To achieve this goal, the city council will allocate 563 million euros in different areas such as urban model, mobility and infrastructures, energy, economic model, consumption and waste, cultural and educational model, food, water and health and wellbeing. The declaration was drawn up on the basis of the work done with the city's Climate Plan and includes more than a hundred actions that will be developed within the framework of the Climate Emergency Action Plan 2030.

The Roadmap for the Economy for Sustainability in Barcelona 2030 outlines a strategy that proposes how to promote a sustainable economy in all sectors of activity in the city. The roadmap identifies six strategic sectors as drivers of the green, blue and circular economy and key to the decarbonisation of the economy: industry, tourism, construction and infrastructure, mobility and transport, energy and trade, consumption and food. The municipal commitment seeks to transform towards a more sustainable production model, identify employment opportunities, support companies and promote new business models.

Barcelona's Electric Mobility Strategy 2018-2024 aims to progressively increase the private electric vehicle fleet to 24,000 electric cars by 2024, to increase the municipal electric fleet to 80% and to have 100 electric-powered buses by 2024, when it is expected that non-electric taxis will no longer be approved. The measures to achieve these figures focus on expanding the vehicle charging infrastructure; promoting benefits for parking, the use of preferential roads or recharging, and continuing to work to offer subsidies for alternative energy vehicles and more road tax rebates. With regard to goods vehicles, the use of electric mobility will be promoted with the construction of specific charging points and financial incentives, and the mobility of conventional vehicles in the city will be limited.

Barcelona Bicycle Strategy (2015). The Barcelona Urban Mobility Plan (PMU) 2013-2018 sets out a series of measures aimed at giving greater prominence to cycling. The PMU aims to increase cycling by 67% compared to 2011. The City Council's aim is for 95% of citizens to have at least one cycle lane within 300 metres of their homes and to have 308 km of cycle lanes by 2018.

The Barcelona 2030 Healthy and Sustainable Food Strategy represents a commitment to transform the city's food system and make it more sustainable for the benefit of

1
Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona

citizens, the territory and the planet. It is an initiative agreed with the different agents in the food chain and one of the fruits of the city's becoming the world capital of sustainable food in 2021. It consists of 9 main objectives, 54 lines of work and 265 concrete and coordinated actions with the different actors in the food system. It also includes 11 goals to be achieved by 2030, such as doubling the consumption of local and organic products, reducing food wastage by 50%, changing school canteen menus with healthy eating criteria and reducing the percentage of obesity in the city. Its 9 objectives are:

Increase the production, sale and consumption of seasonal, local, organic, sustainably fished and animal welfare food, as well as distribution in shorter, fairer and more balanced chains.
Protect, recover and promote spaces for urban and peri-urban agriculture.
Promote healthy and sustainable food for all people.
Increase the resilience of the food system and ensure the right to healthy and sustainable food.
Prevent food losses and wastage.
Combating the climate emergency and the extinction crisis.
Promote a cultural and educational shift towards sustainable food.
Promote fair relations within the food chain.
Coordinate and mobilise actors in the food system to implement concrete and measurable actions linked to existing strategies.

The Nature Plan 2030 consists of a ten-year strategy, structured in three axes and two cross-cutting areas and a total of twenty actions and one hundred projects, with a first Action Programme 2021-2025, under which ten priority projects, also called tractor projects, will be implemented. They involve an increase of 18.6 hectares of green spaces. The 2050 vision of the Plan is that of a city with a functional and ecological green infrastructure; an equitable, accessible green space, connected to the urban fabric and the metropolitan green network, to maximise social and environmental services, especially those related to health and adaptation to climate change.

The Urban Mobility Plan 2019-2024 foresees more than 300 specific measures for:

Guarantee the right to mobility.
Ensure the health and safety of people.
Contribute to the recovery of economic and commercial activity.
Combat the climate crisis and improve air quality.

The aim is to achieve safer, more sustainable, healthier, more equitable and more efficient/smart mobility. To this end, the aim is to reduce the use of private vehicles

(reducing their modal share from 26% to 18.5%) and to promote walking, public transport, cycling and car sharing, prioritising renewable energies in all cases.

Superilla (superblock) Barcelona is a global and comprehensive intervention strategy to regenerate and transform the city based on the following objectives: Social Justice, Fight against Climate Emergency, Habitability, Productive Urban Fabrics and Memory and Landscape. It incorporates actions for the transformation of public space, the improvement of neighbourhoods, the reactivation of economic fabrics and the promotion of sustainable mobility.

The Barcelona Urban Regeneration Programme aims to achieve urban development that transcends the usual considerations of integral rehabilitation (improvements in habitability, accessibility and energy efficiency) by providing specific solutions to promote inclusion, efficient use of resources, mitigation and adaptation to climate change and resilience. Five objectives are defined: Improving the quality of the urban environment; Favouring an efficient use of resources; Ensuring social cohesion and well-being; Promoting functional and social diversity; Strengthening integration and territorial balance.

The Neighbourhood Plan is a comprehensive and cross-cutting plan, structured in six areas, one of which, Environmental Sustainability and Climate Emergency, includes actions that specifically aim to reduce the effects of climate impact on the most vulnerable neighbourhoods and population. The main objective of the Neighbourhood Plan is to empower neighbours to organise themselves and establish objectives and actions to improve collective life in the neighbourhood, promoting social innovation practices and citizen action with the clear objective of improving and strengthening the social capital of the neighbourhoods.

The Barcelona Right to Housing Plan 2016-2025 aims to guarantee the social function of housing and to advance in the construction of a public service in this area. This plan is structured in four strategic lines of action:

Preventing and addressing the housing emergency
Ensuring the proper use of housing
Expanding the number of affordable flats
Rehabilitate the existing park

Having a residential stock in good condition is essential to guarantee the quality of life of all the city's residents. In Barcelona, refurbishing, improving and updating the residential stock is the way to achieve this, while guaranteeing the quality and safety of the architectural heritage; initiating the energy transition, favouring efficiency, savings and the generation of renewable energies; and reversing inequalities by improving habitability and access to basic services.

The Barcelona Tree Master Plan 2017-2037 places emphasis on rethinking the criteria and processes of intervention, with the aim of applying more sustainable and efficient management and maintenance to improve the living conditions of Barcelona's trees in order to maximise the services and functions that healthy trees provide to the city and to people's wellbeing. The 5 priority objectives of the plan are:

To have a forest that is a true green infrastructure and that achieves the maximum endowment and connectivity with the environment (urban and natural).
To obtain the maximum environmental, social and economic services from trees.
To have a biodiverse, well-maintained, protected, safe, secure and identity-enhancing tree stock through the most efficient and sustainable management possible.
To have adapted, resilient trees that can be a tool for adapting to global change.
To achieve a good coexistence between citizens and trees and to advance in the value that society places on trees.

The plan also sets the following challenges for 2037:

Increase tree cover in the city by 5 %, reaching 30 % of the urban area covered by trees.
Ensure that, within the urban fabric, 40% of tree species are adapted to global change, instead of the current 30%.
Achieve a biodiverse tree heritage where no single tree species within the urban fabric accounts for more than 15% of the total.
To make available to the public all the information on the characteristics and services of each of the trees in the urban fabric, through interactive technologies that facilitate public knowledge and collaboration.
To ensure that children in all primary schools in Barcelona identify and appreciate the trees in their neighbourhood.

The Let's Change for Climate 2030 Plan aims to promote changes in the dominant culture and help develop and spread a new culture of sustainability that will intensify climate action in the city of Barcelona. The main objectives pursued by the plan are:

Significantly increase social awareness of the global crisis and the need for new values and lifestyles to address and reverse it.
Increase the critical mass of actors and people in the city committed to a culture of sustainability and climate emergency.
Promote sustainable and decarbonised lifestyles in households and a more conscious and direct relationship with nature.
Impregnate the culture and art that is programmed in the city with ideas and content on the socio-environmental and climate crisis.

Consolidate centres of reference in which opportunities for change and alternative spaces where social transformation in favour of sustainability can take shape are visualised.
Promote and amplify the work of the "allied" agents of the Barcelona + Sustainable network, strengthening the capacity of educators and facilitators of cultural change.
Consolidate education for sustainability and climate action in all the city's educational centres.
Increase the visibility of the climate emergency on the municipal agenda (political, media, cultural, educational), ensuring coherence between sustainability and climate policies and cultural and educational policies.

The Climate Emergency Action Plan 2030 is the main climate action planning document. This action plan is the result of combining the Climate Plan, approved in 2018, and the Climate Emergency Declaration of 15 January 2020. The strategic axes on which the Climate Emergency Action Plan is based are the following:

Mitigation. Actions are promoted to encourage savings, increase energy efficiency and the refurbishment of buildings and to achieve more renewable and local energy production. A commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 and 100% by 2050 compared to 1992 values is established as the main strategic objective.
Adaptation. Barcelona City Council, together with the Meteorological Service of Catalonia and Barcelona Regional, has carried out several studies to find out how climate change will affect the territory of Barcelona.
Climate Justice. Citizens and the most vulnerable groups are at the heart of the city's climate policies.
Promoting citizen action. Promote citizen action through the Barcelona Climate Commitment and other co-creation projects.

It is also characterised by the fact that it encompasses all sectors and is structured into five areas of action and eighteen lines of action. The areas of action correspond to the main axes on which the plan aims to have a direct and cross-cutting impact:

Health and well-being
Energy saving and generation
Urban and mobility model
Economy and consumption
Climate culture

The Clima Plan + Networking 2022-2027 develops the climate grants programme. These subsidies seek to encourage projects that promote the fight against the

5
Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona

climate crisis and proposals for solutions to achieve the objectives set out in the Climate Emergency Action Plan, promoting citizen involvement and supporting collective actions, especially the most innovative and transformative initiatives. The objectives pursued by the programme are:

Facilitate the development of transformative projects from the city's entities.
Empower organisations in the actions they develop in the city in the face of global challenges.
Strengthen the social fabric of environmental organisations that develop projects in the city.
To make visible proposals for change being carried out in the city to address the climate emergency.
Promote initiatives that involve citizens who are not mobilised around the climate emergency.

# Neutrality target 2030 and emissions gap

As stated in the Commitment document, the Barcelona City Council aims to achieve the city's neutrality in Scope 1 and 2 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 2030. The intention is to achieve an 80% reduction in these emissions compared to what would be expected in a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario in 2030 (3.87 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent), which differs very little from those recorded in 2019 (3.82 million)⁴.

We note that the current regulatory framework and policies serve as a basis for the decarbonisation of Barcelona, but with them the level of decarbonisation foreseen for 2030 reaches only 60% of the BAU scenario. Therefore, despite their very recent approval, rules, plans and policies should be reformulated and complemented in some aspects, in such a way that the level of ambition of the Mission and a credible and bankable set of instruments for decarbonisation, including both incentives and obligations for the various actors, are reflected.

⁴ For the purposes of the Mission, emissions generated by infrastructures with a clearly supramunicipal scope, such as the Port of Barcelona and Josep Tarradellas El Prat Airport, which are subject to specific regulations and which, in terms of emissions reduction, must comply with the stipulations of European, state and autonomous community regulations, will be excluded from the calculation. With regard to emissions generated by electricity production, it is assumed that, in accordance with the commitments of the Spanish and Catalan governments, by 2030 Barcelona will have an electricity mix made up mainly of renewable energies (with a contribution from the city of Barcelona of around 1,080 MWp). In this scenario, the generation of emissions will be considerably reduced.

EIT Urban Mobility is an initiative of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) aimed at improving the quality of life in urban environments with innovative mobility solutions. Co-financed with up to 400 million euros (2020-2026) by the EIT, it aims to foster collaboration between companies, universities, research centres and cities through transnational innovation and knowledge communities. Barcelona City Council led the consortium’s candidacy and coordinated the constitution of the Knowledge Innovation Community (KIC). EIT Urban Mobility currently has more than 60 international partners and its headquarters in Barcelona employs around 100 people.

A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers

# SYSTEMIC BARRIERS AFFECTING THE MISSION AS A WHOLE

## Policy and governance

Institutional fragmentation. Between the local level (Barcelona City Council) and the central level (Spanish Government), there are three administrative levels: metropolitan, provincial and autonomous (in the case of Madrid there is only one). This generates inefficiency and hinders the deployment of public policies. This situation comes partly from the fact that the territorial organisation of the State is based on two overlapping and precariously integrated models, the centralist and the federalizing one. The Constitutional Court's 2010 ruling on the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia confirmed the validity of this duality.

Increasing political polarisation in democratic states around the world. Viewing political adversaries as enemies obviously hinders the adoption of broad-based agreements based on shared diagnoses of societal and global problems. Polarisation can be even more intense in the face of new problems, such as climate change, which are associated with a high level of uncertainty in both diagnoses and policy responses.

The complexity of the party system in Barcelona, which is structured around two major axes of division (the traditional left-right axis, with all its derivatives, and positioning in the face of national conflict). The existence of a greater number of parties with municipal representation can attenuate polarisation, but on the contrary increases political fragmentation, which in turn can make it more difficult to achieve the broad and stable support needed to tackle long-term policies.

The hierarchical structuring of public institutions, based on the logic of sectoral specialisation. Climate change mitigation is an objective that affects many sectors and therefore requires a cross-sectoral approach. Despite the rhetorical support they often receive, projects of a cross-cutting nature are often not accepted and face multiple operational difficulties.

Difficulties in establishing public-private partnerships capable of preserving the city's general interest. The legal framework offers limited options, and taking advantage of them requires non-dogmatic political leadership and technical staff (economists, engineers, lawyers, etc.) with the capacity to develop

Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona
Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona

reasonable, effective and transparent frameworks for collaboration with the private sector.

The inertia and rigidity of administrative activity. Barcelona City Council has an organisational culture in which professional excellence and proactivity in the face of change stand out. However, it is a very large institution, which moves at cruising speed, and therefore needs time to take on board and digest the changes. Assuming the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 means rethinking the very basics -rules, procedures, project design- to minimise emissions generation and to facilitate as much as possible all those actions that drive decarbonisation. Logically preserving the principles of legal certainty and economic efficiency, but adapted to the imperative of climate neutrality. This is not easy, as it implies a strong change of mentality and a recomposition of status and power within organisations. Another dimension of the problem is the regulatory obstacles to incorporating young talent and new professional profiles that will be increasingly necessary to renew the organisation and address the challenge of climate neutrality.

Economic⁶

Legislation that is not very favourable to the climate-neutral economy. Thanks to the European Commission's action, in application of the New Green Deal programme, very significant progress has been made in recent years in regulating key areas for decarbonisation. However, very important reforms of the Fit for 55 Package (such as the energy rating of buildings) have not yet been approved, and the worst thing is that national and regional governments are taking a long time to transpose them into their legal framework and policies. In the case of Spain, for example, there is a structural delay in building a tax system that incentivises low-emission economic activities.
The high cost of low or zero emission technologies. For many actors, they can be prohibitively expensive.
Related to this is the large need for upfront investment. Achieving the decarbonisation of the city in such a short period of time implies concentrating a large volume of public and private investment on this objective, to the detriment of other objectives which, without being as essential or as effective in the long term, need to be tackled in the short and medium term, such as access to housing, education, mobility, etc. This poses major dilemmas for

⁶ The financial barriers are set out in more detail in Annex 2 (Climate Investment Plan).

Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona
Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona

public institutions, companies and households, especially in cases where there is already a high level of debt.

The insufficient financing of the administrations. The Barcelona City Council has a rather good financing system, but this is not the case for most metropolitan municipalities, nor is it the case for the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, which is responsible for a substantial part of the investments needed to achieve decarbonisation. The Next Generation funds have been a lifeline for many institutions, but they have their limits, both quantitative and temporal.

The logic of finite resources and the struggle for the municipal budget. No matter how healthy an institution is, there is always a dynamic of competition for budget resources, between departments and between projects. Despite their multiple benefits decarbonisation projects, dmust compete with many other projects of the mandate (facilities, infrastructures, etc.) which, although less necessary, can generate positive impacts more quickly and clearly and thus swing social and political support in their favour. It is difficult for municipal areas that do not have climate neutrality as part of their mission to prioritise investments to decarbonise their operational activity.

The precarious competitiveness of companies. Barcelona's economic structure is based on small and medium-sized companies - known as PIMES - which can be highly successful, but which have more limited financial and organisational muscle when it comes to undertaking the structural transformations necessary to decarbonise activity.

The economic difficulties of households. In our society there is a growing inequality in the distribution of income and even more so in the distribution of accumulated wealth. In 2020 36.3% of households had difficulty making ends meet. In these conditions, the ability to borrow, or even to buy on a daily basis on a "low-emissions" basis is severely limited, although it is also true that low-income households generate far fewer emissions. For upper-middle-income households that can already consider such investments, incentives are essential.

The limited impact of public subsidies. The administration grants aid for households to invest in decarbonisation (bonuses, subsidies), but there are things that make access difficult, such as lack of awareness of their existence, the difficulty of the procedures and the delay in payments. Some subsidies arrive after a very long wait. All this needs to be improved and other types of incentives need to be considered to generate a quantum leap in household climate investments.

6
Technological

Failure to upgrade infrastructure (electric, mobility, etc.) and helpdesk at the pace necessary to properly integrate new technologies and switch to low or zero emission operation.
Lack of low or zero-emission substitute technologies that guarantee the performance of conventional technologies (e.g. in vehicles and large machinery). Market developments will have to be awaited.
The difficulty of measuring emissions at an optimal level of disaggregation for monitoring.
Difficulties in standardising innovation purchase in public procurement.

Sociocultural

Climate denialism. In its harsh version, this phenomenon is part of a more general movement that questions the legitimacy of the scientific approach to reality. Symptomatic of this is the decline of scientific culture in certain sectors of society, despite increasing levels of formal education. We saw this clearly during the Covid pandemic19. Under these conditions it is very difficult to maintain a public dialogue based on data and rational argumentation.
Climate relativism, which does not deny the existence of the climate emergency, but questions its urgency and prevalence in relation to other problems. In this sense, the results of the latest _Municipal Services Survey_, conducted among 6,000 people between January and April 2023, are revealing. Only 4% of the surveyed population considered "pollution and environment" (a category that includes, among others, all the answers referring to climate) as the most serious problem of the city (and 2.5% when the question referred to the most serious personal problem). As for the main demand made of the City Council, only 1.4% referred to "reducing pollution/improving the environment" (3.3% to "increasing/improving green spaces"). This demand is strongest among young people, but the graph (blue line) shows a noticeable drop from the peak of 4% in 2019, at the height of Fridays for Future.
The difficulty of seeing the positive impacts of mitigation at the local level. Even the most well-meaning people may wonder whether it is appropriate to devote large short-term efforts to local mitigation when the emissions problem is global and long-term.

Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona
Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona

The impossibility (more legal than technological) of measuring emissions at the individual level, which makes it difficult to control and punish freeriders and, consequently, to build social trust around the collective project of climate neutrality.

The decline of social movements potentially more willing to fight for decarbonisation, such as the environmental or neighbourhood movements. These are fundamental to push for change by incorporating a social sense to it, which looks after the general interest. Currently, many organisations are finding it difficult to maintain their social base and ensure generational renewal. It seems that civic participation in neighbourhood organisations is not recovering after the pandemic. According to the Municipal Services Survey, participation it fell from 14% to 10% between 2019 and 2023, with large generational and neighbourhood differences.

# SECTORAL BARRIERS

## Mobility and transport

In this sector we can distinguish two main types of barriers, 1. to the shift towards more sustainable modes of transport and 2. to the electrification of motorised transport.

In the first case we can find:

Barriers to the growth of active travel (walking and cycling): These may be infrastructural and urban (lack of pavements and/or safe routes for cyclists), physical (a functional disability or poor health, phenomena associated with an ageing population) or psychosocial (fear of injury or accident, or of being shouted at, in the case of cyclists). Barcelona starts from a very good position in terms of pedestrian accessibility and cycling infrastructure, but with some room for improvement.

Barriers to the use of public transport: Lack of an adequate offer to meet mobility needs, perception of insufficient quality in certain means of transport or excessive prices. In the case of Barcelona, once again, the initial situation is very satisfactory, especially in terms of mobility in the urban continuum of the Barcelona plain. However, there is still much room for improvement in the supply and quality of public transport connecting the city with the metropolitan region, especially in terms of suburban trains.

Barriers to the normalisation of new means of transport, such as low-emission individual means of transport (scooters and similar), or the shared use of

Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona
Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona

individual means of transport (cars and motorbikes): There are cultural barriers, frequent in the incorporation of new social practices, and regulatory barriers, due to the complexity of locating new actors in a public space subject to a high level of occupation.

In the case of electric mobility we have:

Barriers to the acquisition and use of electric vehicles: The clearly higher cost compared to vehicles with internal combustion engines, which makes them unaffordable; the amortisation of vehicles already purchased or the existence of contracts that prevent early renewal; the high battery recharging time, especially for vehicles that are in service 24 hours a day; the uncertainties of this new technology (lifespan of batteries, recycling of vehicles); the operational difficulties arising from the different autonomy and/or technical performance of vehicles; the difficulties for companies to respond to large orders within a reasonable timeframe, which has a negative impact on procurement processes (especially in the case of leasing); the limited availability of maintenance services nearby; the limited availability of charging infrastructures (also applicable to hydrogen vehicles).

Barriers to the creation of new charging infrastructures (electric and hydrogen): The difficulty of adding new infrastructure to a public space that is highly stressed by competing uses; related to this, the long time needed to agree on locations and do the tendering to build recharging points; the multiple limitations of building car parks, both private and public, to accommodate recharging points (space, energy capacity, fire safety), the overcoming of which involves making costly investments.

## Buildings and heating

The low financial viability of energy retrofitting, even in the long term. The city's mild winter climate means that the investment cannot be recouped by reducing energy costs. However, the co-benefits of increased thermal comfort - both in winter and summer - and reduced noise impacts mean better health, better quality of life and a revaluation of real estate.

The residential building structure, based on large condominium buildings. Such an investment requires agreement among the owners, which may be impossible or at least increases the time and complexity of the process.

9
Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona

The atomisation of real estate ownership. In order to launch a large-scale "wave of renovation", a large number of small and medium-sized owners have to be convinced. On the other hand, the population living in rented accommodation, more than 40% and growing, cannot consider this type of action.
Barriers to low-carbon construction: Limited supply of electric construction machinery (especially large machinery); insufficient infrastructure to connect machinery or batteries to construction machinery; difficulty in reusing materials.

# Energy

The unfavourable legal framework for renewable energy in electricity pricing.
The lack of an adequate legal framework for independent renewable energy.
The structure of building and real estate ownership (see above), which makes it difficult to approve investments to install renewable energy.
The complexity of the regulation of uses and transfers of use of the roofs of public buildings.

# Waste

The regulatory and fiscal context (municipal and supra-municipal).
The citizens' consumption habits.
The citizens' perception of re-use.
Companies' design and production criteria.
Companies' perception of prevention.

# Nature-based solutions

The lack of free surface area in the municipality, which results in a strong competition for the use of space, both on the ground and on the roofs of buildings. It is difficult to find space to expand or densify the green infrastructure.
The impact of climate change on green infrastructure: Prolonged droughts and more intense and frequent heat waves.

A-3.3: Participatory model for climate neutrality in the city

Barcelona's participatory model is based on the conviction that achieving climate neutrality will require the involvement of all people and all stakeholders, both public and private.

The Citizens' Council for Sustainability is the city's consultative and sectoral participation body, and represents the different groups in the Network through an elective process. The Council is organised through plenary sessions, meetings of the permanent commission and also has specific working groups. One of these is the Climate Emergency Committee, which aims to define specific measures to be developed to effectively address the climate emergency and is also the space where the City Council reports on the progress made and the fulfilment of the commitments made.

The Barcelona + Sustainable Network was created in 2002, within the framework of the Agenda 21, and is currently made up of almost 2,000 citizen organisations, business and commercial organisations, educational centres, universities, professional associations, trade unions and administrations. Each organisation joins the Barcelona + Sostenible network by signing the Citizen Commitment to Sustainability and contributes to the transformation of the city with its own action plans. B+S members promote sustainability measures in their organisations, share good practices and develop projects with the other members of the network. In view of the maturity acquired by this network in recent years, the opportunity arises to incorporate the sociocracy approach to governance, which aims to make the co-responsibility of the agents effective on the basis of shared decision-making, encouraging the active participation and contribution of all its members. Collaborative networked action drives transformations, generates learning, allows what works to be scaled up, inspires the rest of the citizenry and has an impact on the improvement of public policies.

The Let's Change for Climate 2030 Plan will help to realise this transformation. Based on the Theory of Change, the Plan defines for each type of stakeholder what actions and partnerships can facilitate their co-responsibility and how they can be involved in drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions and becoming more resilient.

The following are the planned co-creation actions, designed to co-responsibilise the social and economic fabric of the city in dealing with the climate emergency, in accordance with the objectives of the Mission:

Update the Citizens' Commitment to Sustainability. In 2024, the Citizens' Commitment will be updated and the opportunity will be taken to incorporate carbon neutrality targets for 2030 in line with the Mission. Therefore, B+S Network organisations that strengthen their commitment by joining this Alliance will directly commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the renewal of this commitment is intended to refocus the way of working with the member organisations, through the proposal to carry out collaborative projects (or minimisations).

Define Collaborative projects. These are projects with a specific common quantitative objective. Each organisation, from its field of work and area of expertise, contributes to their achievement. The first of the collaborative challenges to be worked on from 2024 with the B+S Network will be Decarbonisation: reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% in 2030 (considering scope 1 and 2). To this end, the entities that wish to join will have to propose specific actions that contribute to achieving this common objective along one of the following lines: replacing the use of fossil fuels, generation with renewables or energy savings. For example, a restaurant can focus its activity on being more efficient in the kitchen; a courier company on replacing combustion vehicles; an educational centre on working with students on the carbon footprint and its reduction. The first session to define these network projects (Fem Xarxing) will be held on 29 September 2023.

Consolidate the Climate Emergency Bureau. It will be convened to present the city's new Mission-related objectives and propose improvements to the CCC. Also to encourage them to co-create the shared decarbonisation projects (the aforementioned collaborative projects).

Create a specific decarbonisation modality in the Climate Grants. Since 2018, the City Council has offered a line of grants for climate action projects. It started with an endowment of 200,000 euros per year and has been increasing to 1,000,000 euros per year achieved in 2023. In the next edition (2024) a specific modality will be created to financially support non-profit entities that present initiatives aimed at innovation and effective transformation for decarbonisation. These projects can have a duration of up to 24 months; current expenses and investment costs will be subsidised up to 80% of the total cost of the project for each of the concepts, with a maximum total amount of 80,000 euros.

Convene an edition of participatory budgets focused on the climate emergency. Participatory budgets are a participatory process through which Barcelona's residents can present, define, prioritise, vote and, ultimately, choose investment projects that Barcelona City Council will implement in each district. The first edition was launched on 3 February 2020, with 30 million euros available from the

Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona
Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona

municipal budget. In the next edition, planned for the current term of office (2023-2027), it is planned to focus on the theme of climate emergency, reinforcing both issues of emissions reduction and adaptation to climate change and improving urban resilience. Priority will be given to actions to improve the sustainability of mobility through traffic calming, improving accessibility and promoting mobility on foot and by bicycle; actions to improve waste prevention and management; increasing the area and quality of green spaces in the city; actions to improve the resilience of the most vulnerable neighbourhoods and populations, etc.

Respond to the demands of the 1st Citizens' Climate Assembly and call for a new edition. In 2022-2023, the first Citizens' Climate Assembly was held in Barcelona (the first Spanish city to do so), made up of 100 people selected at random and representative of the city. The issues that the Assembly worked on, at the proposal of its members, were Energy, Consumption and waste, and Mobility. As a result, the Assembly members made 34 proposals for action. It is expected that, before the end of 2023, the municipal government will give a response on their acceptance and implementation. A second edition of the Assembly, specifically dedicated to decarbonisation, is also planned for the current municipal mandate.

Participate in the H2020 Localised project: The aim of Localised (European H2020 project) is to create effective and user-friendly digital tools, based on sophisticated analytical models, to design scenarios and itineraries for decarbonisation at city scale, consistent with the objectives set by Europe in 2030 and 2050. In the framework of the project, a participatory activity on emergency/climate policies aimed at vulnerable populations is planned for 2024.

Carrying out the Climate Emergency Marathon. Since 2018, this awareness-raising campaign has been carried out in February each year, in which around 40 municipal buildings and facilities (sports and educational centres, office buildings, etc.) participate on a voluntary basis, carrying out measures to save water and energy and adapt to climate change. The staff and users of the buildings think together and implement actions to reduce consumption without investment, only with changes in behaviour or management. The Marathon is expected to achieve a 10% reduction in GHG emissions during the four weeks of the campaign. The economic savings generated through energy savings have been used each year to promote projects of different types.

Carry out a new edition of the Load yourself with Energy programme. This is a set of activities (aimed at citizens in general, and especially at vulnerable groups and individuals), which are offered to facilities and organised groups that wish to add them to their programme. The main objective is to transmit the concept of energy transition and to train people for action, through workshops, specialised talks and

3
Climate City Contract. City of Barcelona

participatory dynamics. With this training, participants learn, for example, methods to reduce their domestic energy consumption.

Strengthen the Sustainable Schools Programme. Within the framework of the B+S Network there is a specific programme for schools. Several projects related to decarbonisation will be carried out in the coming years, such as:

a. "We act for the climate" educational programme, an educational proposal to empower schools, providing them with a diagnostic tool to explore their carbon footprint and their degree of adaptation to the impacts of the climate emergency. It offers resources, its own spaces for exchange and specialised advice. A dozen schools are expected to participate, with an impact on 2,000 pupils.

b. Young people for the climate emergency programme, which aims to bring science closer to students, based on a research process on some aspect related to the climate emergency, accompanied by a team of scientists specialised in this subject. The next edition will focus on issues related to decarbonisation (food, electronic footprint, etc.).

c. Other specific educational programmes related to decarbonisation: apart from the programmes described above, there are others focused on Mobility (we transform mobility), Food (eat sensibly), waste (sustainable packaging; waste prevention; school mobile green point) and green (vegetable garden and composting; we discover nature).

Develop specific actions with citizens at neighbourhood level. Barcelona has a network of environmental education facilities distributed throughout the city's 10 districts and made up of 17 centres. During 2025, a shared cycle will be organised with all the decarbonisation facilities; in other words, a common framework of priority work will be defined, with a calendar of events, provision of educational resources aimed at the general public and families, dissemination and communication of activities, etc.

Consolidate the Group of Experts for the Climate Emergency. Barcelona has this consultative body made up of 17 people from different scientific disciplines and of a peer-to-peer nature. Its aim is to advise the government, analyse policies, transfer knowledge and promote collaboration between academia and civil society. During 2024, it will debate and make proposals on the territorial implementation of renewable energies at regional level.

Hold Climate Science Days. Every two years, debates will be organised in which local scientists will present the latest climate research carried out in Barcelona.

4
Facilitate and accelerate voluntary projects of companies, entities and administrations focused on the reduction of disposable plastics. Within the framework of the Zero Plastic Table, a working group of the Citizens' Council for Sustainability, actions will be carried out to reduce disposable plastic products. During 2024, the number of organisations adhering to this programme will be increased, their actions will be supported, networking will be facilitated and visibility will be given to the transformative initiatives carried out. These organisations will be granted a 10% reduction in the public price of waste collection.

• The division of heights between pavement and roadway is eliminated, and a single platform is created to favour the social use of the street.
• Pedestrians have priority. Cars will only be allowed to drive at 10 kilometres per hour.
• The asphalt will disappear and granite and concrete slabs will be used on all axes.
• Green space will be multiplied tenfold. We will go from the current streets, which dedicate 1% of the space to green, to streets with an average of 12%.
• 438 new trees will be planted. The streets will have a rich subsoil.
• There will be almost a thousand new items of furniture (benches, chairs, tables, playground equipment) and new lighting.
• A commitment to local commerce. Loading and unloading will be allowed at specific times. |

• The development of the PMU 2024 uses a continuous monitoring and evaluation system to determine the results of the actions, possible deviations and to report on the achievement of the management objectives. The methodology of the monitoring plan consists of identifying a system of quantity and quality indicators that provide the necessary information to determine the degree of evolution and compliance of the different actions. Every year and through the Mobility Observatory, an assessment is made of the monitoring indicators and compliance with the objectives of the PMU 2024. (See pages 443 to 449 of the PMU 2024). |

• Studying the improvement of coach management
• Integrating tourism demand into mobility management and planning
• Improving taxi management and service in the city
• Ensuring accessibility to public transport
• Managing public transport in a gender- and age-inclusive way
• Review the public transport fare system

It should be noted that these actions are perfectly aligned with actions 10.1, 10.4, 10.8, 10.13, 10.14, 10.16, 10.31, 10.32 and 10.33 of the CEAP 2030.

On the other hand, the Strategic Plan of Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona, SA (TMB) 2025 is decisive for the development of the programme, as the competent administration and owner of the Bus and Metro infrastructure:

Strategic Metro lines
• Improve and increase the supply of metro services.
• Renew and expand the railway rolling stock with criteria of sustainability, energy efficiency and digital transformation.
• Adapt, improve and extend railway infrastructure and systems for adequate service provision, maintenance efficiency, energy efficiency and sustainability.
• Promote new service, operation and maintenance models that maximise the quality and safety of the Metro service and intermodality.

Strategic lines Bus
• Improve and increase the Bus service.
• Renew and expand the bus fleet with criteria of sustainability, energy efficiency and digital transformation.
• Adapt and improve infrastructures and systems for the adequate provision of the bus service, maintenance efficiency, energy efficiency and sustainability. |

On a metropolitan scale, the Metropolitan Urban Mobility Plan (PMMU) 2019-2024 is the document that sets out the sustainable mobility strategy for people and goods in the Barcelona metropolitan area (36 municipalities with a total of 3,260,268 inhabitants). In general terms, the PMMU sets criteria and guidelines for the development of the sustainable urban mobility plans (PMUS) of the metropolitan municipalities, so that local strategies are compatible with a metropolitan-wide strategy. Thus, the Plan includes proposals that affect other administrations and, therefore, it is configured as a multi-level plan. In other words, the achievement of the challenges of metropolitan mobility requires the contribution of the agents and of all the administrations with competences.

The PMMU basically dedicates 2 of its 6 strategic axes to public transport, with the following lines of action:

AXIS A. Urban Model and Metropolitan Mobility Networks
A.1. Mobility in urban planning
A.2. Basic road network at the service of the metropolitan mobility system
A.3. Metropolitan connectivity for active mobility
A.4. Infrastructures to consolidate metropolitan public transport
A.5. Metropolitan system of modal interchange nodes
A.6. Infrastructures to organise freight transport
AXIS C. Inclusive, efficient and quality public transport
C.12. Improving bus and rail services in the metropolitan area
C.13. More sustainable and efficient public transport fleets and facilities
C.14. Public transport for everyone
C.15. Homogenisation of the image and information of mobility services
C.16. Socio-environmentally sensitive fare system
C.17. Attractive and competitive metropolitan taxi
C.18. Cycling on public transport

| The approximate cost of the actions planned in the PMMU 2019-2024 - irrespective of the actor bearing the cost - is estimated at 10,276 million euros. Spending on infrastructure is the highest (8,922 million euros) and accounts for 86.8% of the total. The remaining measures (1,354 million euros), management, maintenance and operation, represent 13.2% of the Plan's cost. Of the 10,276 million euros that would be required to implement the PMMU measures over six |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

-

| | years, the AMB would have to assume 3.8% (389.19 million euros). The rest of the expenditure has to be borne mainly by the metropolitan councils, the Generalitat de Catalunya and the General State Administration. The AMB's contribution is more notable in other measures (370 million euros) than in infrastructures (19 million euros).

Because of its major impact on mobility in the city of Barcelona, it is worth highlighting the importance of the Infrastructure Master Plan (Pdl) 2021-2030. This is the main planning instrument for public transport infrastructure in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (which includes 12 Catalan counties with 5.6 million inhabitants, 73.81% of the Catalan population). The Pdl includes proposals for the extension and improvement of the infrastructure network, together with the more general Mobility Master Plan for the Barcelona Metropolitan Integrated Mobility System.

The 9 main objectives of the POI are:
) Increase the modal share of collective public transport.
) Ensure greater economic and social efficiency in public investment in the metropolitan transport system.
) Maximise the integration of public transport systems.
) To contribute to improving people's health and reducing accidents.
) Achieve an inclusive transport system that incorporates gender and social equity policies.
) To reduce emissions of pollutants (NO2 and PM10), GHGs and the noise impact of the collective public transport system.
) Minimise energy consumption, energy intensity and the use of oil-based fuels.
) Minimise the impact on the territorial matrix and ecological functionality.
) Other environmental objectives.

In addition, the Pdl takes the form of a set of investments by the regional government and the State in two phases:
Phase A corresponds to 42 actions considered priorities and planned for the period 2021-2030. The Pdl foresees an investment for the period 2021-2030 of €8,403.8 million, €5,059.2 million from the Generalitat de Catalunya and the remaining €3,344.6 million from the State.
Phase B would correspond to 24 actions considered as non-priority and to be implemented beyond 2030.

The investment projects are grouped into 5 programmes:
) Extension of the network (AX) |

| | Comments on implementation | The development of the PMU 2024 uses a continuous monitoring and evaluation system to determine the results of the actions, possible deviations and to report on the achievement of the management objectives. The methodology of the monitoring plan consists of identifying a system of quantity and quality indicators that provide the necessary information to determine the degree of evolution and compliance of the different actions. Every year and through the Mobility Observatory, an assessment is made of the monitoring indicators and compliance with the objectives of the PMU 2024. (See pages 443 to 449 of the PMU 2024).

The metropolitan PMMU also has a system of evaluation and monitoring indicators for its strategic objectives (see PMMU 2024). |

**Action 10.2:** Study the implementation of complementary measures to reduce the environmental impact of private motorised transport, e.g. parking management, urban transformation, toxicity tolls, etc.
**Action 10.7:** Extend the parking and regulated parking strategy to the whole city. Review the criteria applied, in all areas of the city, to all motorised vehicles, including motorbikes and goods, and agree with metropolitan councils and the AMB on the application of coherent policies.
**Action 10.9:** Traffic calming in the city in general to increase road safety and promote a friendly environment with lower energy consumption and emissions. Prioritise the road network, so that the vast majority of streets have a speed limit of less than 30 km/h.
**Action 10.10:** Create park & ride areas, in collaboration with other administrations.
**Action 10.11:** Deploy the low emission zone, monitor the planned phases and implement necessary adjustments.
**Action 10.17:** Promote electric vehicles (vans, cars, motorbikes, bicycles, machinery, etc.) with the creation of new charging infrastructure, with tax rebates on purchase, charging and parking, the implementation of electric delivery and taxi services, etc.
**Action 10.20:** Diversify fuels and electric vehicles in captive vehicle fleets.
**Action 10.26:** Electrify and diversify municipal vehicle fleets (including waste).

Cooperation and collaboration on a metropolitan scale is paramount for the development of this programme. Therefore, the **Metropolitan Urban Mobility Plan 2019-2024** foresees:
• Line of action A.2: Basic road network at the service of the metropolitan mobility system
• Action Line B.7: Urban liveability and low-emission zones
• Line of action B.10 Parking and road pricing model

| | Comments on implementation | • Barcelona's Electric Mobility Strategy has a very comprehensive scorecard for its monitoring.
• The Climate Emergency Action Plan (CEAP) foresees 15% of electric vehicles circulating in Barcelona by 2030.
• 20% reduction in private motorised transport mobility by 2030 (CEAP)
• The Catalan Climate Change Law foresees that new registrations of electric vehicles will reach 30% of the total by 2025.

On the other hand, the development of the Urban Mobility Plan 2024 requires a continuous monitoring and evaluation system to determine the results of the actions, possible deviations, and to report on the achievement of the management objectives. The methodology of the monitoring plan consists of identifying a system of quantity and quality indicators that provide the necessary information to determine the degree of evolution and compliance of the different actions. Every year and through the Mobility Observatory, an assessment is made of the monitoring indicators and compliance with the objectives of the PMU 2024. (See pages 443 to 449 of the PMU 2024). |

| | Description of the action | The Government’s Climate Neutrality Action 2030 will include and specify the main lines of this programme. However, pending its approval and specification, the Barcelona Renewable 2030 Programme can be taken as a basis for the description of this Mission Programme, since it includes a large part of the actions aimed at the energy refurbishment of buildings in the private and tertiary sectors. In relation to the actions referring to the refurbishment of municipal buildings, it should be noted that these will be included in the Programme for a Carbon Neutral City Council (in preparation).

The Barcelona Renewable 2030 Programme, aligned with the State Plan for Recovery, Transformation and Resilience, represents a unique opportunity to give continuity to and strengthen policies and programmes related to energy rehabilitation and urban regeneration that are already being implemented in Barcelona and to promote new disruptive projects. In terms of energy rehabilitation, the following strategic lines of action should be highlighted:
LAE 1 - Energy rehabilitation of buildings: residential building stock, public buildings and facilities. It will develop the following programmes:
Housing rehabilitation programme in neighbourhood communities.
Public Rental Housing Rehabilitation Programme (IMHAB).
Programme for the energy-efficient refurbishment and change of use to subsidised housing of heritage public buildings (Via Laietana Courthouse and the former La Escocesa factory).
High Complexity Farms (FAC)
Inhabits Carmel
Rehabilitation of existing residential buildings and generation of new housing in the fronts to be consolidated and industrial buildings of 22@.
Rehabilitation of the 3 Chimeneas complex for the generation of renewable energy (photovoltaic panels).LAE 5 - Define funding mechanisms
Channel soft public financing offered by the ICO, IDEA, ICF, EIB, etc. with the guarantee of MITMA, MITECO, Generalitat, etc. to private housing associations.
Expansion of the Barcelona Sustainable Energy Facility (a public-private investment fund already in operation for the implementation of photovoltaic energy in the city's buildings).
Creation of a second public-private investment fund for the energy refurbishment of existing buildings, as well as the creation of new affordable housing, acting primarily on the fronts to consolidate 22@. |

It is also worth highlighting the actions of the CEAP 2030 planned in this area:

Action 1.2: Put in place the necessary mechanisms to increase the weight of public aid with an energy, environmental and social justice focus, within the public policy to promote refurbishment, in order to reach 10,000 homes/year with aid (subsidies or credits) in energy refurbishment, paying special attention to the most vulnerable households and promoting passive and traditional solutions.

Action 1.7: Create accompanying figures to provide advice on the rehabilitation actions to be carried out depending on the type of action and the characteristics of the building where action is being taken (head rehabilitators).

Action 4.5: Analyse how long it will take for new, more environmentally responsible systems to become competitive with traditional systems and what the cost-benefit balance will be in economic, social and environmental terms.

Action 4.6: Study construction systems and solutions adapted to Barcelona to promote heat protection and passive cooling of buildings, and complement existing building regulations by establishing technical prescriptions and local regulations. Incorporate criteria for the protection of buildings against climatic events (such as windstorms).

Action 4.7: Develop a building energy ordinance to ensure that new or comprehensively refurbished buildings in the city have minimum energy demand and maximum generation.

| In addition, the Strategic Plan for Energy Improvement and Sustainability in Barcelona’s educational buildings, promoted by the Barcelona Education Consortium, includes energy refurbishment, the application of energy-saving and efficiency measures - such as cross-ventilation - and the generation and consumption of renewable energy. |

|     | efficiency • Energy renovation of 20% of buildings over 40 years old by 2030. • Reduce CO2 emissions associated with DHW, heating and cooling consumption by 50% (1.9 Mtonnes of CO2). • Generate some 500,000 MWh/year with local renewable energies (500% increase in local generation). • To reduce CO2 emissions by 203,500 tonnes through local and renewable energy generation (mainly solar). • Reduce CO2 emissions by 41,000 Tn by energy rehabilitation of housing. • Reduce the energy demand of rehabilitated dwellings by 40%. • Reduce electricity consumption by 29.48%. • Reduce domestic drinking water consumption by up to 100 litres per day per inhabitant. (2) Improving citizens' living conditions and reducing urban inequality It is currently estimated that there are 134,567 homes in the city in need of refurbishment, which represents 19.7% of the total housing stock. The Plan seeks to increase the habitability of Barcelona's homes and neighbourhoods through: • Energy refurbish some 94,000 dwellings by 2030, at a rate of approximately 1,000 buildings and 10,400 dwellings refurbished per year. • Reduction of the energy demand of the refurbished fleet by 30-40%. • Improve the living conditions of some 27,500 people per year who benefit from rehabilitation. • Improve the conditions of access to and permanence in housing, increasing the stock of subsidised rental housing (in 2019 it represents 1.6% of the total) through: rehabilitation of heritage buildings, public purchase of housing and buildings, construction of housing in maritime containers (APROP) and generation of new housing in the fronts to be consolidated and industrial buildings to be reconverted in 22@. • To better respond to the demand for subsidised housing, which currently stands at 42,941 registered units, as well as to meet the residential needs of the ageing population and reduce households in fuel poverty. • Address the structural causes of the failure to rehabilitate and maintain buildings properly: rehabilitation of 100 buildings/year through the High Complexity Dwellings programme. • Sustainable redevelopment of 180 ha in the city |

|                   | Estimated GHG emission reductions (total)    | A specific calculation of the potential emission reduction of this programme is not yet available. For the building sector programmes as a whole, the Mission's target implies a 76% reduction in emissions (584 thousand MT) compared to the BAU 2030 scenario. The buildings sector's target is a reduction of 76%. • Residential. A four-fold increase in the current target of the CEAP, from 20% to 80% of residential buildings older than 40 years being energy refurbished. This will mean refurbishing an average of 38,000 buildings each year, a rate 10 times faster than has been achieved so far. It also envisages the renovation of household appliances to low-emission models. • Tertiary sector (commerce and services). Doubling the CEAP forecasts, from 22% to 44% of the sector's emissions reduction, through LED lighting, equipment renewal, refurbishment to add insulation, monitoring and sensorisation, etc. As well as increased awareness of energy use, also applicable to the residential sector. |
|                   | Total costs and costs per unit of CO2eq      | A first estimate of the cost of the planned package of measures in the buildings sector suggests the need for an additional investment of 8.155 billion euros (Cash Basis) up to 2030, of which 450 million euros will be provided by the City Council. In turn, these measures will result in operating cost savings of 4,624 million (Present Present Value) until 2050, as well as co-benefits of 251 million.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Incorporate criteria for the protection of buildings against climatic events (such as windstorms). - Action 4.7: Develop a building energy ordinance to ensure that new or comprehensively refurbished buildings in the city have minimum energy demand and maximum generation. - Action 4.9: Develop and consolidate the existing heating and cooling networks in the city and define and promote a new network in the Sagrera area. The Barcelona Renewable 2030 Programme is developing a line of action in innovation in this field: • LAE 4 - Promote a city innovation ecosystem for fostering the economy for sustainability with the participation of established companies, startups and research centres/universities. - Instruments for intermediation in sustainability research at the Diagonal Besós UPC Campus. - Incentives for entrepreneurship and innovation. - Talent development and employment promotion. - Reuse and recycling of demolition materials. The last point of the Barcelona Renewable 2030 Programme refers to the reduction of Scope 3 emissions in the construction sector. It is a strategy that has yet to be developed, but which will work on the life cycle of buildings and the massive incorporation in construction of materials that can function as carbon sinks, especially wood. We plan to work on innovation projects with leading scientific and technological partners, such as the Institute of Construction Technologies of Catalonia (ITEC) and the Institute of Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC). The latter has presented the Timbered Path project (Horizon), with participation of the BIT Habitat Foundation, in which Barcelona will provide a demonstration of a wooden-structured building increase.

The initial project, with a planned investment of 21 million euros, proposes the deployment of a centralised air-conditioning network with maximum energy efficiency, taking advantage of the phreatic water of the Besòs River and solar energy. The new network, with an agreement with ADIF, will cover the Sagrera intermodal station, the entire Sagrera tertiary area and also the Prim urban development sector. The aim is to provide energy coverage for a total of 920,000 m2 and, in the future, in the new urban fabric with neighbourhood and productive uses planned for the site of the former Mercedes-Benz factory. The new plant will reduce annual CO2 emissions by the equivalent of taking 19,160 vehicles off the road and save 53,000 MWh/year in electricity consumption. Once the initial project has been configured, the dossier will be prepared for this heating and cooling network to be implemented, operated and maintained in a public-private partnership format. The urban heating and cooling networks are part of the city's commitment to energy efficiency. They are efficient systems for producing heat and cold using renewable or residual resources that represent 30% energy savings compared to conventional individual systems such as boilers or air conditioners. In addition, they represent advantages in terms of space and noise. In the case of the future network in La Sagrera, the production of heat and cold is foreseen by means of high-efficiency heat pumps using groundwater from the Besòs and solar energy. 85% of the energy needed for heating, cooling and domestic hot water can be self-generated from renewable energies and without impact on the environment. At the same time, Barcelona City Council is also planning a centralised heating and cooling installation in the La Model area, with a planned investment of 6.3 million euros. The project is part of the project to transform the former penitentiary centre into a large centre of facilities and green space on the left side of the Eixample. It is a centralised energy generation and distribution system to provide cooling and heating with maximum efficiency and joint operation. The project will be developed in phases and this new network will mean a saving of 560 MWh/year in electricity consumption and a reduction of 140 Tn/year in CO2 emissions. To meet the needs, a combined geothermal and aerothermal production system has been designed. Both systems would work in parallel and the thermal energy generated by the two heat pumps would be stored in tanks located in the machine room attached to the building. These technical spaces are expected to feed the entire network and generate the energy necessary to cover all the energy demands of the La |

The third plant of the Districlima network in Poblenou and the new high-efficiency cooling plant of Econergies will consolidate and develop the Districlima and Ecoenergies Networks with the use of renewable or residual resources. These heating and cooling networks will reduce more than 50,000 tonnes of CO2 per year, equivalent to taking approximately 87,000 vehicles off the road. |

(4) Building governance between the different public and private actors in the metropolitan area. At the legal level, the objective of the Plan is to establish a closer and more dynamic framework of cooperation than the current one (the already effective Observatory of Rehabilitation of BCN OBRA) with the private entities that make up the value chain of the private rehabilitation sector, as well as a more agile system of relations with neighbourhood associations that improves the impact of public promotion of the private rehabilitation of housing and buildings. In the same way, "Barcelona Renovable" wants to advance in the line already opened by MES Barcelona for the creation of public-private investment funds dedicated primarily to the rehabilitation of existing buildings and secondarily to the generation of new affordable housing in the consolidated city. At the economic level, the Plan aims to channel the soft public financing offered by the ICO, IDEA, ICF, EIB, etc. to private residents' associations, with the guarantee of MITMA, MITECO, Generalitat, etc. (5) Position Barcelona as a benchmark for urban regeneration and rehabilitation and energy efficiency in the Mediterranean. Barcelona Renovable' seeks to promote Barcelona as a test bed for a new phase of renovation as a public policy, as an economic sector, as a source of employment and as an industrial activity. The combination of increased public spending in the form of non-refundable subsidies and soft financing, the development of industrial alliances between public companies (demand for industrialised building and housing renovation solutions) and private companies (suppliers of industrialised products and solutions), the union of public and private capital around investment vehicles such as the photovoltaic MES Barcelona and its subsequent evolution towards the renovation of existing |

Digital platform and one-stop shop. It is foreseen that the Office, with a legal, physical and digital implementation and with delegated competences and assigned staff, will bring together and coordinate both administrative bodies and private agents involved in the processes of rehabilitation and urban regeneration of the city. The office aims to ensure the management of the Plan and the efficient and effective channelling of the planned European recovery funds, mobilising private capital through public-private partnerships, and serving as a central point of information, management and processing of the programmes.
Digitalisation of processes: The aim is to facilitate the procedures, reviews and processes of rehabilitation projects entirely digitally, to know at all times where "your file" is and to simplify and speed up monitoring.
Digitalisation of agents: The objective is to generate a virtual meeting space between agents, establishing contact between supply and demand on the network, specifically between communities of neighbours, owners, neighbours, companies that can facilitate rehabilitation, micro-enterprises, guilds, start-ups and property administrators.
Digitise solutions and cases: The objective is to digitise good practices, solutions and case studies and generate a repository of useful information to make better projects, solve problems more agile and overcome obstacles.
Active dissemination and capturing latent demand: The objective is to diversify the channels to reach the demand and actively approach it, adapting the communication strategy by combining general and specific media, targeting different neighbourhoods and situations. The aim is to ensure that the whole city is informed, to seek out and activate the objective demand. To achieve this, an active |

dissemination campaign could be planned through different channels and communication strategies.
Collaboration with stakeholders: Identify key informants and collaborating agents in the work with neighbourhood communities, owners, neighbours and companies that can facilitate refurbishment. Coordination with the PAEs, considering them as key informants in the detection of energy needs, especially in dwellings with vulnerable households. Professional agents in the sector (professional associations and associations of professionals) can be more actively involved in the development and use of tools and programmes through agreements or other formulas.
Transparency, clarity and rationalisation: Transmitting information in a clear manner and simplifying procedures to facilitate decision-making and offer greater confidence and security to homeowners' associations in the promotion of refurbishment projects.

It is also worth highlighting the actions of the CEAP 2030 planned in this area:
Action 4.1: Study and establish technical prescriptions with regard to the new thermal comfort standards to be achieved locally in Barcelona, and work to achieve a change in the mentality of both developers and users of buildings.
Action 4.2: Develop a regulatory framework for the use of heating/air-conditioning in the commercial and service sector, to avoid energy waste and for social awareness, by regulating, among others, the use of outdoor cookers and the locking and automation of external doors.
Action 4.3: Generate communication and dissemination actions to promote energy savings in buildings.
Action 4.4: Energy monitoring of buildings, housing and public facilities to facilitate knowledge of consumption and the implementation of energy improvements (on a continuous basis).
Action 4.8: Ensure efficient energy management of municipal services associated with the water cycle and waste collection and management, and optimise energy management and supplies for public lighting and municipal buildings and facilities (including nursery and primary schools), to achieve 10% savings in electricity consumption in buildings.

|             | Description of the action    | Although the specific actions referring to municipal buildings will be included in the Programme for a Carbon Neutral City Council (in preparation), it should be noted that the ultimate objective of this Programme is to achieve the transition to a sustainable energy model based on the consumption of 100% renewable energy by municipal buildings, maximising self-consumption. |

Barcelona Energia, the Barcelona metropolitan area's public utility company that supplies electricity to Barcelona City Council's municipal buildings and facilities, plays an essential role in achieving this goal. Its aim is to promote a new, more sustainable energy model based on efficiency, renewable energy generation and citizen participation. Barcelona Energia, managed by TERSA, sells 100% renewable energy, guaranteeing citizens a service of proximity and transparency.
For its part, TERSA carries out the integral management |

| | | of the Photovoltaic Solar Energy Installations (IESFV) of municipal buildings and facilities in the city of Barcelona and the metropolitan area.

It is also worth highlighting the actions of the CEAP 2030 planned in this area:
Action 2.1: Promote and prioritise the self-production of energy from renewable sources and make it accessible also to vulnerable households.
Action 2.3: Deploy the municipal energy operator to promote the production of renewable energies in the municipality and facilitate the implementation in both public and private spaces.
Action 2.4: Create a municipal energy trading company to serve all citizens. In existence since 2019
Action 5.1: Develop ten green roofs and façades on municipal buildings to set an example and promote, through agreements with the private sector, the development of fifty productive roofs on buildings, including green, energy, cistern or reflective roofs by means of grants, subsidies, competitions and other mechanisms. Publicity actions will be carried out to publicise them.
Action 9.1: Accelerate the implementation of renewable generation in municipal buildings (bressol schools, cultural and sports facilities, etc.) and in public spaces by adding 6 MWp of photovoltaic generation to the municipal park by 2025.
Action 9.2: Evaluate the incorporation of generation in other elements of public space, such as paving of squares, roads, etc. |

| Impacts and costs | Renewable energy generated (if applicable) | To achieve near-complete decarbonisation of electricity supply will require a massive expansion of renewable energy generation capacities, both inside and outside the city. In terms of local generation, the forecast is to multiply the CEAP forecasts by 1.8 times, to reach 1,080 MWp of installed solar photovoltaic capacity in the city. Barcelona's 2030 Agenda sets the goals of achieving 6.5% or more of the energy consumed being locally produced renewable energy (1.18% in 2020) and 50% or more of the electricity consumed being of renewable origin (20.2% in 2020). |

This Government Action should serve as an impulse and go beyond the actions aimed at achieving the objectives set out in the CEAP 2030 in terms of renewable energy generation in non-municipal buildings, as detailed below: |

Action 2.1: Promote and prioritise the self-production of energy from renewable sources and make it accessible also to vulnerable households.
Action 5.2: Fill the city's rooftops with solar installations, offering facilities for implementation (reinterpretation of regulations and streamlining of procedures) and promoting economic incentives such as subsidies, tax rebates (IBI, ICIO, IAE) or other financing mechanisms, in order to incorporate 10 MWp of photovoltaic energy and 7 MW of solar thermal energy in private residential and tertiary buildings by 2025.
Action 5.3: Launch a process to ensure that large urban spaces (industrial roofs, large tertiary buildings and pergolas or structures in industrial and logistic environments) have up to 25 MWp of photovoltaic energy deployed by 2025.
Action 10.25: Implement renewable generation systems in the port of Barcelona (42 MWp by 2030) and at Barcelona airport, on the roofs of buildings and with pergolas in car parks (40 MWp by 2030). |

|     | Description of the action | The Comprehensive Lighting Renovation Plan 2018-2020 is a strategic project that aims to increase safety, energy efficiency and intelligent management, compliance with current regulations and better health and environmental quality for citizens. This plan is complemented by the improvement actions framed within the contract for the conservation and maintenance of the city's public lighting, which year after year, according to the needs detected, complements this comprehensive renovation plan. |

These improvements provide the city with more light sensation, not just more light but better light distribution due to the application of the latest lighting technologies; they also provide more uniformity of light by avoiding the sensation of light spots and thus improving the clarity of the route; they incorporate maximum energy efficiency and functional optimisation by incorporating regulation and control systems. Therefore, more light is being provided, with more control and a greater sense of safety for citizens.

The city of Barcelona has more than 146,000 lighting points, a patchwork of unevenly distributed lighting, the result of isolated urban planning and maintenance renovations that have given rise to a disparity of criteria, models and results.

The municipal services are working to generate a nighttime image of the city that seeks a balance between functional and aesthetic order, incorporating new lighting technology, such as LED technology, but also management elements such as regulation, the possibility of remote control and, in general, new technological solutions that enable progress towards a smart city, both in streets, avenues and squares and in the lighting of buildings or singular elements.

The effort to optimise the energy management of public lighting must continue to be updated and adapted to technological improvements as they occur. In this regard, it is worth noting the importance of the Plan for a Carbon Neutral City Council, which is currently being drawn up. This Plan will focus on energy optimisation and improved management of lighting in municipal buildings and facilities. |

• More acoustic comfort thanks to the electrification of the fleet and soundproofed equipment to reduce service noise levels.
• The new waste collection vehicles also incorporate new technological elements that allow better monitoring and control of the entire process. Therefore, more and better information will be available to be able to make decisions and optimise the service in each territory.
• Safety improvements must also be taken into account. The fleet of vehicles incorporates a technological driving assistance system.

| In the short term (2025), this programme should also promote the optimisation of transport routes in order to reduce the number of people travelling by road. (action 14.6 CEAP) and in the long term (2030) Ensure energy efficient management of municipal services associated with waste collection and management (action 4.8 CEAP) |

|     | drinking water, optimising it and replacing it with alternative water resources. The plan identifies the existing water resources and their possible uses in accordance with their characteristics (chemical and biological), sizes up the potential demand and foresees the city infrastructures necessary for their use. The plan provides a global map of alternative resources to drinking water in Barcelona and gives visibility to the water network throughout the city. It also guarantees synergies between the different municipal and private operators involved in the city to improve supplies. Furthermore, PLARHAB is much more than a set of techniques that serve to obtain more resources or save water. The PLARHAB is aligned with the City of Barcelona's Climate Plan 2018-2030 and is coherent and consistent with the four fundamental principles of good water management: - Sustainability, with the maintenance of healthy ecosystems that provide safe and healthy water supplies. - Prioritisation of local resources with local management. - Efficiency, obtaining water at the best possible cost and with the best technologies that offer tangible environmental benefits. - Active stakeholder participation, with bottom-up planning to give legitimacy to the measures taken. The PLARHAB is developed in six lines of action, which promote the use of: • Line 1. Groundwater: Analyse the state and operation of existing facilities, define the improvement actions necessary to provide service to users in optimum conditions and plan actions to extend the groundwater network to meet the demands for alternative water resources for urban services and public facilities in the city. • Line 2. Reclaimed water: Analyse the feasibility of using reclaimed water and promote its use for uses that can be covered by this resource. • Line 3. Grey water: Promote the use of grey water in new buildings and equipment to save drinking water. • Line 4. Roof rainwater: Promote the use of roof rainwater for irrigation of green spaces linked to buildings and other compatible uses. • Line 5. Rainwater from headwaters: Promote the use of rainwater generated at the headwaters of the Collserola torrent basins as a complementary resource. • Line 6. Rainwater in the public space through SUDS: Promote the management and treatment at source of |

| | Comments on implementation | Goals 2030 Pla Climate:
To bring domestic drinking water consumption below 100 litres/inhabitant/day.
Bring urban water consumption below 150 litres/inhabitant/day.
Reduce the consumption of mains water by municipal services by 10 Hm3 per year: below 4.48 million m3 of water consumed in 2030.

The PLARHAB estimates that the current municipal consumption of drinking water that could be replaced by alternative water resources (AWR) is about 3.6 hm3/year. Taking into account the consumption currently served with groundwater, and the expected consumption of planned municipal services and facilities, the total potential demand for RHA will be 5.69 hm3/year. In the event that 100% of the potential municipal demand is covered with RHA, the sustainability index of the water consumption of the City Council would reach 73.66% (calculated according |

| | | to current consumption). Thus, the weight of municipal drinking water consumption in relation to the city's total consumption would drop from 6% to around 2.4% (assuming that drinking water consumption in the rest of the city remains stable).

The actions defined in the PLARHAB will allow an increase in groundwater consumption of 1.5 hm3/year related to current consumption. This will be translated into savings in drinking water. In this scenario, the sustainability index of municipal services would double from the current 16.36% to 35.12%.

| The CEAP 2030 refers in relation to water by expressing the need to guarantee the efficient energy management of municipal services associated with the water cycle and waste collection and management, and to optimise energy management and supplies of public lighting and municipal buildings and facilities (including nursery and primary schools), to achieve a saving of 10% of electricity consumption in the buildings involved.

• Line 2: The estimated budget for the new reclaimed water system for the Prat Vermell - Can Batlló Marina is €6 million.
• Line 3: The application of greywater systems is considered feasible mainly for new buildings or complete renovations because of the need to install a separate network. In the case of existing buildings, the installation is costly, whereas during the construction of the building, the added cost can be considered marginal. The investment and maintenance costs per dwelling depend on the number of dwellings in the building. As far as the amortisation is concerned, it is considered feasible in buildings of 16 dwellings or more, where the |

|             | Type of action               | Despite the fact that the city's industrial activity is responsible for 8.13% of the city's GHG emissions (2019), it is one of the key sectors for accompanying companies in the transformation of the city's production model as a whole towards a more sustainable and competitive one. Thus, the modernisation and decarbonisation of industries by adapting the business structure to a more sustainable model, ensuring more environmentally friendly production cycles in order to optimise resources, either by extending the life cycle of products or by converting waste into raw material for a next use, will be one of the most important focuses of action in the coming years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|             | Description of the action    | The Barcelona Green Deal is the urban and economic agenda to make, over the next ten years, a more competitive, sustainable and equitable city, adapted to challenges such as the ecological and digital transitions, which have been accelerated by the pandemic. In the field of green reindustrialisation, the main measures and strategic development areas are: • The area where the Besós river and the ring road intersect will become a strategic space in the coming years to include green economy activities such as renewable energies, proximity logistics or industry 4.0, etc. • At the other end of the city, Montjuïc will become a hub for innovation, sport and technology. At the same time, an urban planning modification will seek to improve the area's relationship with the rest of the city and reinforce its true character as an urban park, taking advantage of both the transformation of the Ronda del Litoral, between the Zona Franca and the Carbonera, and the Fira area. • The spaces occupied by the Fira will also be reformulated, to introduce new uses that bring more added value to the neighbourhoods nearby; the Zona |

|     |     | Franca, the city's great productive land asset, and the Marina, which is the great reserve of residential land and could accommodate up to 28,000 more inhabitants. The development of the economic strategy envisaged in the Barcelona Green Deal is reflected in the Roadmap of the economy for sustainability in Barcelona 2030, which involves a commitment to facilitate the ecological transition through support for economic sectors in order to generate innovative solutions and take advantage of new business opportunities. The actions envisaged in this roadmap in the industrial sphere are as follows: • 01. Acquisition of warehouses in Bon Pastor and promotion of tractor projects: Purchase of an industrial building in the Bon Pastor area to make the space available and attract and develop tractor projects linked to the promotion of the circular and sustainable economy and Industry 4.0, thus improving the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises in the city's economic and business ecosystem. • 02. Circular Economy Programme for industrial companies: Action that accompanies industrial companies in the Besòs Axis in the transition towards a circular economy. Thus, solutions are identified, in the field of both the production process and the business model, to improve efficiency in the use of resources and to respond to the sustainable challenges that arise. The accompaniment is carried out by experts who will help to analyse the situation of the company, as well as to define solutions and projects to implement. • 03. Responsible Business Programme: Programme that aims to promote and facilitate the integration of social responsibility into the business strategy of participating companies, based on an action plan that incorporates this perspective in all areas of the company to promote a balance between economic, environmental and social requirements. • 04. Innofood Programme: Programme to support the creation of innovative companies that improve any part of the food sector value chain to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, reduce food waste and preserve biodiversity. Thus, it involves management and business plan training on food sustainability or distribution issues. There are also sectoral sessions, networking with entrepreneurial experiences and personalised support for the participating projects. • 05. Foodback food recovery centre: Mercabarna sets up the Foodback food recovery centre, a new |

system for managing organic vegetable matter outside the marketing circuit, with the aim of providing a second life for surplus fruit and vegetables. Located in Mercabarna, it is a key facility in the new organic matter management system, where 100% of the recovered product is distributed and technological innovation projects are promoted for greater use.

6.  Renovation and digitalisation of the Green Point: Project to renovate and digitalise the specialised collection centre (green point) at Mercabarna to consolidate waste access control and the consolidation of the vegetable by-product management circuit. The aim is to position the new green point as a reference centre for retailers where they can deposit their waste, both organic matter and packaging, quickly and effortlessly.
7.  Barcelona Zero Plastic Commitment: Commitment presented by the Zero Plastic Table with the aim of reducing single-use plastic. This document sets out the actions and projects that will enable progress to be made towards a more sustainable model of society that is committed to the future.
8.  Waste management in municipal markets: selective waste collection, separating paper, cardboard, glass, packaging, organic waste and rejects into different containers. Thus, the aim is to apply mechanisms to select and reduce the volume of waste, reuse products and efficiently recycle the waste generated in the municipal markets of the city of Barcelona.
9.  Implementation of packaging pools in wholesale markets: Action for the implementation of packaging pools in wholesale markets to be able to control the circulation of reusable packaging used in commercial transactions and facilitate their reuse. The new packaging recovery system for the fruit and vegetable sector is planned for 2022, and the packaging pool for the fish sector for 2023.
10. Collection and recycling of white and grey line waste Collaboration agreement between Barcelona Activa and Andròmines, a social insertion association dedicated to transport, establishing a collection and recycling service for white and grey line waste in the city of Barcelona. This initiative enables the collection of waste electrical and electronic equipment, as well as waste derived from ICTs.
11. Agreement for the reuse of IT equipment with the eReuse Network Collaboration agreement between the Municipal Institute of Information Technology and the Pangea association, to

establish a circuit for the exchange, refurbishment and reuse of IT equipment between 2018 and 2022. The eReuse Network is responsible, among other actions, for the reuse of equipment to be given to families in vulnerable situations and social spaces.

12. RevESStim Programme Action framed within the Sustainable Textile Plan and the Pact for Circular Fashion, which aims to boost the city's sustainable textile sector by strengthening the socio-entrepreneurship of the companies and organisations that operate, as well as the entrepreneurial projects that are being initiated. It offers training and specialised advice, promoting the dynamisation of different groups of agents, detecting common needs and objectives, and fostering the network with initiatives and the exchange of experiences in the sector.
13. Barcelona Fashion Forward Action framed within the Pact for Circular Fashion, whose objective is to support designers, designers and emerging fashion brands in the optimisation of processes and methods. It incorporates methodologies that take into account the sustainable sphere to improve their professionalisation, and in the areas of marketing, communication and digitalisation through training sessions, personalised accompaniment and financing services.
14. Fashion Sustainable Challenge Annual themed ideas competition for students of fashion and other creative disciplines from all over the world. It is based on the development of projects adapted to the specific and changing theme of each edition, although the backbone of the competition focuses on circular and sustainable fashion. This action is part of the Pact for Circular Fashion, which is committed to transforming the textile sector in Catalonia towards a circular economy.

Finally, it should be noted that this detailed action plan in the industrial field must be accompanied by the development of the actions envisaged in the CEAP 2030 and designed to have a direct impact on the decarbonisation of the economy of Barcelona and its Metropolitan Area.

In this regard, the involvement of the General State Administration and the Port of Barcelona will be required, on the one hand, to work towards a taxation system with a strong environmental focus on ships in the Port of Barcelona and the aeronautical sector (action 10.24). Likewise, and in collaboration with the Government of the Generalitat de Catalunya and the Metropolitan Government, the CEAP 2030 establishes the need to promote voluntary agreements by large

The ecological transition, the green infrastructure and its metabolic relations, as well as the impact of the city and its infrastructures on the climate change scenario. And finally, the habitability and competitiveness of the spaces where we live and work, access to housing and green spaces and facilities, the quality of public space, and the quality of the environments of the productive fabric. This model is specified in ten objectives that guide the normative determinations of the PDUM: - 1. Strengthen metropolitan solidarity. - 2. Strengthening the metropolitan capital. - 3. Naturalise the territory by enhancing the values of the biophysical matrix. - 4. Improve the efficiency of urban metabolism and minimise environmental impacts. - 5. Articulate the territory on the basis of a polycentric structure. - 6. Promote active and sustainable mobility by rethinking metropolitan infrastructures. - 7. Promote social cohesion through housing, public space, facilities and public transport. - 8. Rehabilitate and recycle urban fabric. - 9. Increasing urban complexity and liveability. - 10. Boost the competitiveness and sustainability of the metropolitan economy. These objectives are aligned with the following actions of the CEAP 2030: - Action 6.1: Influence higher planning instruments, such as the Urban Master Plan and urban planning legislation to incorporate urban planning determinations. - Action 6.2: Adapt existing urban planning regulations necessary to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation goals - Action 6.3: Introduce the climate emergency vector into strategic metropolitan transformations. - Action 7.3: Incorporate climate change criteria into the Special Plan for the Protection of the Natural Environment and Landscape of the Serra de Collserola Natural Park. - Action 10.5: Scale up and accelerate the Superblocks programme. Transform 15 km of streets into green axes by 2024. |

Furthermore, both the Strategy for Social Inclusion and Reduction of Inequalities 2017-2027 and the Gender Justice Plan 2021-2025 actively contribute to reinforcing the concept of climate justice in their specific groups. |
| Description of the action | • One of the four strategic axes of the ECCP is Climate Justice: |

We work to reduce energy poverty and provide fair access to energy for all, with special attention to the most vulnerable groups, through combined policies of access to self-generation facilities, improvements in housing conditions, energy advice and in the best conditions of quality, sustainability and costs. We also work for equity, food security and to promote new lifestyles linked to new forms of consumption, such as, for example, the circular economy.

• The Gender Justice Plan 2021-2025 foresees the following objectives in its "Area 32 Ecology and Sustainability":
Improve knowledge on the relationship between gender and climate change, in order to know the specific impact that the climate crisis has on women in Barcelona (studies, indicators...) and to be able to define actions to respond to it.
Incorporate a gender perspective in municipal action plans and programmes to address the climate emergency and thus move towards ecofeminist city policies.
Promote parity and encourage women's and girls' leadership in climate action in the city.

• The Strategy for Social Inclusion and Reduction of Inequalities 2017-2027 foresees within its "Action Line 5: Reduce territorial social inequalities", the development of "Objective 5.4: Ensure equitable and sustainable mobility for all and combat climate change and its effects, ensuring environmental justice criteria". |

|             | Type of action                                    | This cross-cutting action programme will revolve around the promotion of economic sectors linked to decarbonisation, fostering the creation of business clusters and especially promoting social and solidarity economy enterprises, on the one hand, as well as around training and promoting employment in renewable energies and the circular economy. These objectives are widely included in some of the actions envisaged in the CEAP, and therefore the necessary instruments and resources should be generated to maximise their potential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|             | Description of the action                         | The actions of the CEAP 2030 related to the sustainability economy are: - Action 1.5: Promote green jobs in economic sectors linked to climate change (energy rehabilitation, installation and maintenance of solar panels, sustainable food or electric mobility). Give the Labora project an environmental vision. - Action 12.2: Define a green, blue and circular economy strategy. Promote clusters of companies in the renewable energy and circular economy sector in the city, for example, in the Besòs axis. - Action 12.4: Establish training and employment programmes in the circular economy, through Barcelona Activa. - Action 12.6: Adapt Barcelona Activa to promote the green and local economy. The Climate Neutral Adaptations and Economic Opportunities Programme will be closely aligned with the Roadmap for the Economy for Sustainability in Barcelona 2030, which is a commitment to facilitate the ecological transition through support for economic sectors in order to generate innovative solutions and |

The proposal focuses on six key sectors to accompany companies in transforming the city's production model as a whole towards a more sustainable and competitive one:
Industry
Tourism
Construction and infrastructure
Mobility and transport
Energy
Trade, consumption and food
The objectives of the roadmap are as follows:
• Accompanying companies in the transformation towards a more sustainable production model.
• Encourage and accelerate the generation of new entrepreneurial initiatives and new innovative business models.
• Facilitating the city's small economy to take advantage of new business opportunities.
• Identify new employment and career development opportunities.
• Tackle and lift bureaucratic, administrative and cultural barriers that represent obstacles to the drive for a transformative and more sustainable economy.
• To position Barcelona as a city of international reference in the transformation of the economic and productive fabric, thus fostering the creation of jobs and facilitating the ecological transition.
The Healthy and Sustainable Food Strategy 2030 will also be relevant in this area. |

|     | Description of the action | The Government's Measure to promote urban innovation in Barcelona structures and legitimises the instruments available to Barcelona City Council to accelerate and promote the change to a digital, green and inclusive future. The main objectives are: • Objective 1: Promote a change in the innovative culture of the Administration • Objective 2: Re-engaging innovation with the city and its people • Objective 3: Structuring methodologies and articulating new instruments to boost innovation • Objective 4: To promote the city as a natural space for experimentation. This objective includes action 4.3 Creation and implementation of the Innovation Laboratory. In support of the achievement of the objectives of this MoG, we find the Barcelona Innovation Coast (BIC), an initiative of the Barcelona City Council that was created with the aim of promoting innovation and consolidating the city as the innovation capital of southern Europe. It is a public-private platform that brings together the city's main innovative agents. The BIC allows the creation of networks that facilitate the transfer of knowledge, synergies and the development of innovative projects in the city. More specifically, the BIC is expected to contribute to the promotion of projects for the improvement and decarbonisation of public transport and coordinates the participation of Barcelona City Council in the Enel Innovation Energy Hub, which helps start-ups in the energy sector to scale their sustainable solutions, from the reduction of greenhouse gases to the impact of electricity infrastructures on the environment or energy storage systems. The aim is that these start-ups can become part of the group of suppliers of the electricity company Enel-Endesa. For its part, the Barcelona Science Plan 2020-2023 articulates science and university policy in the metropolitan area with the aim of turning the city into a European capital of research and innovation. This plan is a commitment to knowledge and innovative solutions, a strategy in favour of quality of life, ageing, mobility and the environment, among others, which is articulated in four areas: Barcelona, a city of science in Europe; research to address the challenges facing the city; scientific culture for the public and with the public; and science, art, innovation and society.

The necessary reforms and internal modernisation of the organisation must also be undertaken in order to achieve the city's decarbonisation objectives set out in the Mission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|                                                    | Description of the action    | This programme is expected to be presented during 2024. In order to achieve carbon neutrality of the municipal activity itself by 2030, the following areas will be addressed in depth: Buildings; Fleets (own and subcontracted) and travel; Street services (lighting, traffic lights, fountains, escalators and lifts); Works (project drafting and execution); Events (cultural and sporting); Food services, catering and vending; Other services and supplies (cleaning and waste collection, cloud services, etc.). To this end, the necessary procedures will be established for the periodic quantification of GHG emissions, which are currently not included in the emissions inventory (mainly emissions incorporated in non-energy supplies); actions to reduce emissions will be promoted through improvements in the management and contracting of works, supplies and services and also in the change of habits and collaboration with suppliers to extend these measures beyond the actions and contracting of the City Council itself. |

| | | Plan, proposed by the Sustainable Public Procurement Commission, consolidates and updates the existing catalogue of social, environmental and innovation measures. Of particular relevance in the environmental field is the Guide to environmental public procurement, since the introduction of environmental criteria in municipal public procurement is one of the key instruments to promote continuous improvement processes to increase efficiency in the consumption of natural and economic resources and reduce the environmental impact associated with municipal activity. Likewise, environmental public procurement should serve to promote a better supply of products and services that make a more efficient use of resources and promote eco-innovation and environmental management in companies. This Guide will be updated as the annual plans for sustainable public procurement objectives are approved.

|             | Description of the action                    | Cooperation at metropolitan level is particularly relevant, as some of the key policies for decarbonisation (public transport, waste management, water provision) are managed by the public entity Barcelona Metropolitan Area. Metropolitan Commitment 2030 is the strategic plan for the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (PEMB2030). The plan aims to promote a new model of prosperity, based on knowledge and innovation, which reduces social and territorial inequalities and positions the region as one of the leading metropolises in the fight against climate change. The definition of missions makes it possible to focus on strategic aspects and to involve a wide range of actors, as well as to promote new ways of doing things. In this case, they are a guide to promote and coordinate innovative responses at the scale of the Barcelona metropolitan region, where there is no government institution with this territorial scope. Thus, the missions define strategic and interrelated objectives. In this sense, the challenge of this mission is to mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure a healthy habitat based on a just transition in the energy model and the sustainable management of resources.one of the eight missions of the Plan refers to "environmental and climate emergency". Its objective for 2030 is to achieve a 45% reduction in greenhouse |

Different actors of the quintuple helix - public administration, academia, private sector, citizens and the media - of the Barcelona metropolitan region were part of the design of the mission and will be part of its implementation. Another mission is the Sustainable and Safe Mobility Mission. Its challenge is to improve the connectivity and efficiency of everyday travel. The objective for 2030 is to achieve a 10% shift in the modal distribution of journeys in the Barcelona metropolitan region in favour of eco-mobility. For its part, the Barcelona Provincial Administration (Diputació de Barcelona) has a Climate Plan, which aims to achieve energy self-sufficiency and climate neutrality by 2030 in relation to its infrastructures and activity, with zero direct greenhouse gas emissions. This Plan can inspire the decarbonisation of the 311 municipalities of the Barcelona province and facilitate the channelling of the necessary financial resources. It also provides support for the drafting of sustainable energy and climate action plans for the municipalities that are members of the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. At the regional level, and in relation to multilevel coordination, the Catalan Law 16/2017, of 1 August, on climate change, whose aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and favour the transition towards an emission-neutral economy, is of vital importance (it establishes a commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 40% by 2030, 65% by 2040 and 100% by 2050 with respect to 1990 values). One of the five aims pursued by the Law to achieve this objective is to promote and guarantee the coordination of all Catalan public administrations, and to encourage the participation of citizens, social agents and economic agents. It is also worth noting, for the purposes of multi-level administrative coordination, the role played by the Advisory Council for Sustainable Development in Catalonia (CADS) as a strategic advisory body to the Government of the Generalitat of Catalonia in the field of sustainability, a task it carries out through the consultation and participation of experts and civil society. A relevant role in municipal cooperation is also played by the Network of cities and towns towards sustainability (currently comprising 320 local authorities) at metropolitan level and in Catalonia. The Network is a platform for cooperation and exchange where municipalities find a suitable framework to discuss concerns, needs and experiences and to promote and |

Finally, and in the context of metropolitan cooperation, the CEAP 2030 has the following two actions: - Action 6.3: Introduce the climate emergency vector in strategic metropolitan transformations, such as the Glòries Park, Avinguda Meridiana, Sagrera Park and the waterfront. - Action 16.13: Promote the creation of citizen co-responsibility networks and climate action groups at neighbourhood level. |

|             | Description of the action               | In the international sphere, it is worth highlighting the cooperation developed by Barcelona City Council within the framework of the Master Plan for Cooperation for Global Justice 2023-2026. Objective 1 "Environmental Justice" of this plan foresees: |

1.1 Improve urban metabolism (urban environmental quality, public policy and management, public health, mobility, water and energy management).
1.2. Contribute to increasing urban resilience and climate change adaptation.
1.3. Reducing the ecological footprint (carbon footprint, consumption patterns, biodiversity loss, supply and waste management, large infrastructures).
1.4. Promote the energy sovereignty of the people.
1.5. Promote people's food sovereignty.
1.6. Promote overall health.
1.7. Promote the rights of nature and other species. In the same vein, targets 13.1 and 13.b of the Barcelona 2030 Agenda refer explicitly to international cooperation on climate change policies
In the Euro-Mediterranean area, cooperation between cities is particularly relevant in the context of global challenges: after the Arctic, the Mediterranean is the area of the world most impacted by climate change. Med-Cités brings together 73 local authorities from the shores of the entire Mediterranean basin and is responsible for promoting sustainable urban development in the region.
The Climate Leadership Group, known as the C40, is a group of cities working together on a global scale to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere and adapt to climate change.
At the European level, Eurocities brings together more than 200 cities to cooperate, among many others, in specific areas such as sustainable mobility, pollution reduction and localisation of global challenges such as |

For its part, the CitiEs Platform, whose members include the 7 cities present in this Mission, is the Spanish platform that offers a comprehensive and collaborative proposal to address and overcome the challenges of sustainability in cities within the framework of the European Union Missions. It offers a series of services that seek to strengthen the capacities of cities and reinforce multi-stakeholder and multi-level collaboration.

Internally, it should be noted that the City Council's International Relations Plan incorporates the action of "Supporting advocacy initiatives that reinforce Barcelona's commitment against climate change, and that seek international recognition of local governments in the ecological transition".

It should also be noted that from 2023 Barcelona City Council will participate in the Euro-med Community for Green Living areas' Institutional Dialogue (EUCLID), a knowledge transfer network on urban policies and projects related to the promotion of cities as "Green living areas" (energy efficiency, renewable energy communities, sustainable urban transport, water and waste management and the development of urban agriculture, among others).

Finally, it should be noted that the promotion of city-to-city cooperation is also reflected in several actions of the CEAP 2030, such as:
Action 17.2: Generate more active social involvement in raising awareness of the effects of climate change on the most vulnerable countries and societies, and carry out education and awareness campaigns on Barcelona's ecological debt.
Action 17.3: Define a comprehensive strategy to reduce Barcelona's ecological debt, prioritising actions with the greatest impact on third parties.
Action 17.4: Generate more knowledge on the impact of the climate crisis on global inequalities, migratory movements (climate refugees) and human rights.
Action 17.5. Promote city-to-city cooperation on climate justice, both in the call for grants and in direct city-to-city cooperation. |

The approach that will characterise the prioritisation of the contexts in which to intervene is urban and municipalist, so that the priority is the resolution of urban problems through a regional approach. The city of Barcelona will collaborate in particular with specific cities to achieve a deeper understanding and provide more tailored solutions. Specifically, the following geographical priorities are identified:
The Mediterranean and the Middle East. Priority cities will be Amman, Saida, Sarajevo, Tetouan, Tangiers, Tunis, towns in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and cities that may become, at some point, a staging point for a humanitarian crisis.
Sub-Saharan Africa. The priority cities will be Maputo and Dakar.
Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. The priority city will be Havana
South America. Priority cities will be Cali, Medellin and other cities in Colombia involved in the peace process. |

# B-2.3: Summary of residual emissions strategy

Barcelona's commitment to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 80% by 2030 means that 0.77 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent will still be generated by 2030, around 0.5 tonnes per inhabitant.

The city's strategy with regard to the expected residual emissions involves, first and foremost, compensation through the expansion of carbon sinks. Considering the size and population density of the city of Barcelona, this mechanism has a very limited scope in terms of CO2 capture. However, we propose its use, for two reasons: First of all, because it generates significant co-benefits in terms of environmental quality and quality of urban life, and secondly, because of its exemplary value for other cities and territories with greater potential to use this lever.

Specifically, the actions envisaged to develop carbon sinks are:

Programme to boost urban green infrastructure, developed extensively in the Nature 2030 Plan, and technically guided by the Green and Biodiversity Charter and the catalogue of tree species. The main goals are to increase public green space by 121 hectares and to regulate the effective protection of private green space.
2030 urban agriculture programme. Barcelona has more than 500 urban gardens, which, in addition to capturing carbon, generate economic and social value.

Blue carbon" programme, promoting marine carbon sinks (Posidonia) on the coast of Barcelona (Garraf and Maresme). This is the only action programme that goes well beyond the municipal area. It will be promoted in conjunction with the AMB, the Diputació de Barcelona (DIBA), the Generalitat de Catalunya and the coastal municipalities.

Barcelona's residual emissions strategy also includes effective action to reduce Scope 3 emissions (over and above what is already planned in the area of waste, with the "Waste 0" programme).

Programme to promote sustainable food (promotion of Km0 and organic products, promotion of the sustainable planetary diet, etc.), which is covered by the Sustainable Food Strategy 2030 and the Roadmap for the sustainability economy in Barcelona 2030.
Scope 3 emissions reduction programme in the construction sector (industrialised construction, standardisation of the use of nearby certified wood, etc.), partially included in the Renewable Barcelona 2030 Plan.

Carbon sequestration is the third leg of this strategy, but it is currently underdeveloped.

Since 2022 there has been a working commission on the subject, promoted by the BIT Habitat Foundation. Made up of more than a dozen members, academic and business experts and institutional representatives, this commission promotes joint work with industry and the academic and research communities to share knowledge and co-design instruments to ambitiously achieve the following objectives:

Identify all local entities with knowledge and experience in CO2 capture.
Share knowledge, projects and initiatives on CO2 capture that are being carried out in Barcelona.
Identify possible alliances between existing projects or programmes and establish collaboration mechanisms and define those that can be instruments of innovation.

MODULE C-3: Equity portfolio financing (Economic Case)

The Material Economics model has been used to calculate the direct and indirect costs and benefits that form the basis of the City Climate Agreement.

The following table and those in Annex 2 (Modules B-1, B-2 and B-3) estimate the costs (figures in brackets) and benefits attributable to the different policy areas, considering also the expected emission reductions in each of them. It is important to bear in mind that the model works with additional costs derived from the effort to decarbonise the different areas of activity. In other words, when estimating the cost of acquiring an electric vehicle, it does not compute the full cost, but only the differential cost with respect to the acquisition of a vehicle with a combustion engine. From a theoretical perspective this seems straightforward, but is very difficult to apply in current planning practices.

For this and other reasons, related to the ingrained planning culture in the Barcelona City Council and the strongly participatory approach followed in the planning of climate policies, the fit between the logic of the cost calculation model and the contents of the CEAP 2030 has not been easy. However, both parts have worked with the will to reach an optimal fit. The results have been refined in successive iterations until almost all of the planned actions have been incorporated and quantified. We trust that in the coming weeks or months the availability of better data and the evolution of the model itself will provide us with complete and accurate results. These will be incorporated in the first evaluation&amp;revision of the CCC.

# Annex 3: Membership of organisations

We have the endorsement and support of the Spanish Government, addressed to all Spanish cities that are part of the Mission.

The coincidence of the elaboration of the CCC with the process of the municipal elections and the renewal of the members and leadership of the Citizens' Council for Sustainability has made it necessary to delay the collection of support until the autumn months of 2023. Rather than including just a few scattered endorsements we have opted to wait for a systematic collection of endorsements and commitments to the Mission using this model will take place during the autumn of 2023.

Support will be requested directly from the 1,538 organisations (NGOs, business and trade union agents, schools, etc.), plus 3,500 traders and professionals, that make up the Barcelona + Sustainable Network, within the framework of the renewal of the Commitment to Sustainable Barcelona.

The search for support will be extended to new actors, such as emerging companies, international organisations with a presence in the city, etc. The support of metropolitan and Catalan political institutions will also be formalised. The endorsements obtained, all with concrete commitments from each organisation, will complete Annex 3 of the CCC.

# Supporting statement of National Government for the climate neutrality of Spanish Mission Cities

I hereby place on record the Spanish Government's commitment to support the climate city contracts presented by the cities, which were selected by the European Commission on 28 April 2022 to participate in the European Cities Mission: Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, Valencia, Zaragoza, Valladolid and Vitoria-Gasteiz.

This support contributes to the ecological and energy transformation of cities and to a greater climate and social resilience, which is materialised in the Spanish State's framework of competences, among others, in the following aspects:

The impulse of a regulatory framework aligned with the systemic innovation and public-private collaboration required by the European Mission of Cities. In this context, it highlights:

- The Spanish Urban Agenda, approved in February 2019, which highlights the need to achieve sustainability in urban development policies. It is constituted as a working method and a process for all the actors involved in cities that aspire to an equitable, fair and sustainable development from the different fields of action. This strategy is developed around 30 specific objectives and 291 action lines, which includes all villages and cities regardless of size and population, and it addresses economic, social and environmental sustainability.

- Law 7/2021, of 20 May, on climate change and energy transition. This institutional framework guarantees, through its various measures, the coordination of sectoral policies, ensures coherence between them and synergies to achieve the objective of climate neutrality, and increases our capacity to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.
  ↑

The work commitment on the regulatory developments of the Law is clear. Due to the implications for the European Mission Cities, the following stand out: (i) in the energy field, work is being done to establish a framework to deploy energy efficiency in industries and buildings, and renewable energies as vectors towards decarbonisation, (ii) in terms of emission-free mobility, the mandate for cities to adopt sustainable urban mobility plans with mitigation measures, such as low-emission zones, is included, iii) in the area of green procurement, we are working to establish measures to integrate the fight against climate change in public procurement procedures, such as the inclusion of emission reduction and carbon footprint criteria specifically aimed at the fight against climate change as specific technical requirements in procurement specifications.

The launch of the Multi-stakeholder Collaboration Platform for the Climate Neutrality of Spanish Cities (citiES 2030), a tool created ad hoc and already in operation to facilitate the implementation of the Cities Mission.

With the implementation of this platform, the Government of Spain not only fulfils one of the initial activities of the Mission, but also becomes a reference for the other countries and cities in the programme.

This platform is a multi-stakeholder innovation and collaboration infrastructure to support and accelerate the transformation of Spanish cities towards climate neutrality.

The platform's main beneficiaries are city councils of Spanish cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants or provincial capitals that want to achieve full or partial climate neutrality by 2030, as well as cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants that want to initiate this process.

The platform offers cities a range of services, including:

- Training, learning and skills enhancement
  ↑

- The support for the development of local systemic innovation platforms for the design of transformative project portfolios;
- The assistance in drafting and monitoring climate city contracts and the design of roadmaps in a multi-stakeholder environment;
- The connection with related processes in other European cities; the incubation of multi-city projects; the citizen participation and activation;
- The assistance to cities to structure transformation financing schemes, involving financial actors;
- The strategic communication.

The Platform's governance is multi-stakeholder and multi-level, with the aim of facilitating, ordering and guaranteeing directionality and stability in these collaborations. In this way, it relies on the participation of the actors of the quintuple helix:

- The public sector (administrations and public agencies).
- The private sector (companies, financial sector, urban infrastructure sector and professional associations).
- The academia (universities and research centres).
- The civil society (NGOs and neighbourhood associations).
- The media.

The support to mobilisation of green investments. A good example is the deployment of the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan through the mobilisation of an unprecedented volume of investment that prioritises not only mitigating the effects of the crisis, but also the transformation of our country towards a sustainable and inclusive economy.

The Recovery Plan recognises the fundamental role of cities in economic and social transformation, due to their capacity to generate short-term activity with a pull effect on industry and key sectors, and their importance in terms of the climate emergency. Thus, it includes initiatives aimed at essential aspects for the climate neutrality of cities, such as:

- The improvement of sustainable mobility, with the promotion of electric and fuel cell vehicles and the extension of recharging infrastructures, through the different MOVES programmes.
- The promotion of the renovation of urban residential environments, housing, buildings and neighbourhoods, with the priority objective of decreasing energy consumption and promoting decarbonisation in the household stock.
- The development of energy communities that promote social innovation and citizen participation in renewables, energy efficiency and electric mobility, thereby contributing to fair and inclusive decarbonisation in urban areas.
- The promotion of self-consumption for the energy use of urban roofs and decks, storage behind the meter and renewable HVAC in homes.
- The development of transformative strategies and initiatives for urban renaturalisation, helping to increase green infrastructure and biodiversity in Spanish cities and favouring Nature-Based Solutions to respond to their socio-environmental challenges.
- The support for the implementation of waste regulation, in collaboration with the autonomous communities and cities, with investments in
  5

digitalisation for environmental management, through the Recovery Plan.

- The deployment of calls for grants to municipalities and local entities for the implementation of low-emission zones in cities and the sustainable and digital transformation of urban transport.

The monitoring of the progress of the seven cities through the information processed in the citiES 2030 Platform, with the aim of integrating the urban transformation roadmap into the country's decarbonisation process.

As part of the iterative process of the European Cities Mission, the Spanish Government will participate in the monitoring and updating of the commitments made in the climate neutrality agreements of the cities of Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza, supporting the recognition and dissemination of the progress achieved.
