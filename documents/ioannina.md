Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

The Municipality of Ioannina, is an interestingly bio-diverse city in Epirus region in northwestern Greece. With a population of about 130.000 people, it combines lush nature with mountains, water bulks and breathtaking green landscapes with intense human activity due to its social life and production units namely a University, local and major businesses, a unique local silversmiths' workshop network, agricultural and poultry farming units.

Although it seems quite a challenge, it is exactly this unique and complex profile that has led to this city willingly having putt itself forward in investing in a greener future and adjusting itself to a more climate neutral lifestyle. The effort towards climate neutrality for the city of Ioannina began several years ago. In 2016, when the mayor signed the letter to the Covenant of Mayors, setting an optimistic target of reducing emissions by 2023, and of course, committing to climate neutrality by 2050. Since then, the authorities, along with experts and qualified professionals of this area, have not only started deploying sustainable development and environmental conservation but also invest in monitoring, data collection and changing the mentality of the locals so that they make sure positive results will be permanent. Today, as a proud participant in the European Mission "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", the Municipality of Ioannina stands at the forefront of a transformative journey towards having achieved climate neutrality by 2030 through programmes and initiatives that encourage green practices and sustainability on every single sector of the life of a city. Thus, since April 2022 when the city of Ioannina was selected to join the European Commission's Mission Cities to become one of the 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030, the Municipal Authority under the late Mayor Moses Elisaf was activated, simply to do the obvious thing: continue the collaboration with the proposals team and ensure its further expansion to create the Transition Team too.

However, the urgency of the global climate crisis and the directives of the European Green Deal have accentuated the need for a more aggressive and targeted approach. This Action Plan addresses this very gap, offering a comprehensive strategy that not only aligns with our local policy imperatives but also resonates with global climate goals. Having this in mind, the municipality in question, being the most urbanized and populous one in Epirus as approximately  $\frac{1}{4}$  of its total population lives there, has started taking steps through interventions in public buildings, the city's infrastructure, encouraging businesses and citizens' initiatives for a greener lifestyle and plans to invest further in every possible way in saving energy, reducing waste and CO2 emissions and making the best out of the abundant local nature while preserving it.

This very approach is iterative, ensuring adaptability to emerging challenges and opportunities while maintaining a clear vision. In the report, the positive results achieved so far are presented in detail and through specific valid data. Based on that and the high expertise of the working groups involved, the next steps and plans are presented so that the city can continue this hard but well worthy journey towards making itself a model city for its green practices and the sustainable potential.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

# 1 Introduction

The introduction should outline the local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and describe the gap it is addressing in broad terms.

# Introduction - textual element

# Introduction

The Municipality of Ioannina, as a proud participant in the European Mission “100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030”, stands at the forefront of a transformative journey towards having achieved climate neutrality by 2030. This Action Plan is a testament to our commitment, describing in detail the strategic roadmap that bridges the gap between our current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory and the ambitious 2030 climate neutrality target.

Ioannina's local policy landscape has been progressively evolving, with a keen focus on sustainable development and environmental conservation. However, the urgency caused by the global climate crisis and the directives of the European Green Deal have accentuated the need for a more proactive and targeted approach. This Action Plan addresses this very gap, offering a comprehensive strategy that not only aligns with our local policy imperatives but also resonates with global climate objectives.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Drawing inspiration from the European Environment Agency's urban environment mapping and assessment, we've adopted the innovative Climate Neutrality Zones (CNZs) methodology. This approach allows us to segment our territory into distinct zones, each with its unique environmental characteristics and challenges. By doing so, we can tailor our strategies to the specific needs of

each zone, ensuring maximum effectiveness of our pursuit of climate neutrality.

Furthermore, the establishment of Climate Neutrality Offices (CNOs) and the Climate Neutrality Observatory signifies our dedication to systematic monitoring, coordination, and implementation of our climate action plans. With the invaluable support of the Technical Chamber of Greece (TEE) and its vast engineering expertise, we are poised to roll out comprehensive climate action initiatives in sync with the European Green Deal's objectives.

This Action Plan is not just a document; it's a reflection of our collective will, our shared vision, and our unwavering commitment to a sustainable future. By leveraging innovative methodologies, fostering stakeholder collaboration, citizens engagement and ensuring transparent communication, we aim to set a benchmark for other cities to emulate our effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The effort towards climate neutrality for the city of Ioannina began several years ago. In 2016, the mayor signed the letter to the Covenant of Mayors, setting an optimistic target of reducing emissions by  $40\%$  by 2023, and of course, committing to climate neutrality by 2050. As we can all observe, according to the recent emissions inventory of the steps taken in 2019 (as presented in section 3.1), the reduction is evident, already approaching  $30\%$ , thus demonstrating the city's commitment to climate neutrality.

the Greek alphabet with zone A including the warmest - and zone D the coldest areas. The prefectures of the Greek territory by climate zone are presented in the Table below:

Table 4: Prefectures of Greek territory by climate zone

|  Climatic Zone | Prefectures  |
| --- | --- |
|  Zone A | Heraklion, Chania, Rethymnon, Lasithi, Cyclades, Dodecanese, Samos, Messinia, Laconia, Argolis, Zakynthos, Kefalonia, Ithaca  |
|  Zone B | Corinthia, Ilia, Achaia, Aetoloakarnania, Fthiotida, Phocida, Biotia, Attica, Evia, Magnesia, Sporades, Lesbos, Chios, Corfu, Lefkada, Thesprotia, Preveza, Arta  |
|  Zone C | Arcadia, Evrytania, Ioannina, Larissa, Karditsa, Trikala, Pieria, Imathia, Pella, Thessaloniki, Kilkis, Halkidiki, Serres, Kavala, Drama, Thassos, Samothraki, Xanthi, Rodopi, Evros  |
|  Zone D | Grevena, Kozani, Kastoria, Florina  |

The criteria for categorizing the climate zones apart from the heating degree days were the average temperature per month, the speed and direction of the winds, the level of humidity as well as the level of rainfall in the area. It should be noted that in each prefecture the areas situated in an altitude higher than that of 500 meters are included in the next colder climate zone than the one to which they belong.

The prefecture of Ioannina belongs to climate zone C meaning that the climate is continental and humid. The climate conditions are affected by the relief of the ground, which explains why low temperatures prevail in the mountains during the winter. The area is characterized by intense and regular rainfall, which actually makes it one of the most rainy areas in Greece.

The climate is one of the most important factors affecting the environment and the activities of organizations. The regional atmospheric level of precipitation, combined with the temperature fluctuations throughout the year, are key factors on which the physicochemical processes in the water-soil-flora-fauna system depend.

The geomorphological diversity of Epirus creates a corresponding variation in the climatic conditions. Thus on the coasts of the Ionian sea the climate is mediterranean, while towards the interior, where the Ioannina basin is also located, the climate is continental with heavy rainfall, low temperatures in winter and high temperatures in summer. The average annual rainfall for the period 1951-2004 has been recorded as  $1079.5\mathrm{mm}$  by the Ioannina station of the National Weather Service (N.W.S) and for the period 1967-2004 as  $1082.6\mathrm{mm}$  from the weather station of THE Ministry of Agriculture in Katsika The distribution of rainfall is approximately  $70\%$  during the winter period (October - March) and  $30\%$  in summer (April - September). The maximum monthly value is recorded in November and the minimum one in August. The average monthly air temperature is  $-4.9^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  at a minimum in January while in July the maximum temperature mounts to  $-25.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The absolute minimum temperatures are usually recorded in January  $(-13.0^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  and the maximum ones in July  $(42.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . The average annual temperature is  $-14.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and the average monthly relative humidity -shows a smooth variation with a maximum percentage of  $81\%$  (December) and a minimum of  $51\%$  (July). The average annual relative humidity is  $67\%$  (Institute of Geological and Mining Research (I.G.M.R.) 2010).

For the needs of this study, the data for the years 2007-2014 have been drawn from the station in the position of Anatoli which is on an altitude of  $475\mathrm{m}$ . The station in question is placed in soil. Height of heat/humidity sensors: 2 m. Anemometer height: 5 m.

The tables below, present data regarding temperature, rainfall and wind measurements of the National Meteorological Service, for the Ioannina station (National Meteorological Service - N.M.S.). The information they provide - are extremely useful for understanding the general state of the natural

As it has been already mentioned, the Municipality of Ioannina, which actually constitutes the basin of Ioannina, divides the prefecture into two single parts the northern and southern districts of it and therefore, combines Central European and Mediterranean geographical, climatic and ecological elements, meaning that this very region combines the warm and mild Mediterranean climate elements with the rainy and harsh Central European climate. Heavy rains are observed in winter and storms in summer. In the past, snowfall was intense with snow covering the ground even for several days, but in recent years this phenomenon has changed due to the frequent sunshine.

## Proposal to become to become climate-neutral and smart city by 2030

In 2022, during the tenure of the late Mayor Moses Elisaf, who was a professor of Medical Pathology at the University of Ioannina and known for his optimistic and innovative approaches for the city's well-being, the Municipality's Financial Decisions Committee (Οικονομική Επιτροπή Δήμου Ιωαννιτών) took the optimistic decision to participate in the European Commission's invitation for the 100 European cities aspiring to become climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030. This nomination aspires to serve as a beacon for all the others, setting as an example that all European cities can follow.

The latest Mayor teamed up a group of experienced collaborators with the aim of drafting a proposal that will be addressed to the European Commission and the Net Zero Cities organization, so to present the broader plans along with the framework that the Municipality has already developed (Sustainable Energy Management Plan, Local Waste Management Plan, Sustainable Development Plan, Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan). The proposal team is organized through official collaboration with the School of Architecture at the Polytechnic Department of the University of Patras, led by two renowned professors G. Panetsos and I. Aisopos. Other distinguished members of the team are -the law attorney Kostas Karatsolis, the experienced doctoral researcher on the impact of Climate Change on cities, Angelos Chasiotis, companies ABB S.A. and POLYECO S.A., and further collaborators.

The proposal team is supported by the Municipality through the special advisor to the mayor for environmental issues, Katerina Vini.

Entrepreneurship

Promoting citizens active involvement in the development of Sustainable Travel Plans in MED cities (as a partner/follower)

The project promotes a new model for the development of SUMPs based on participatory design utilizing - social media and IT applications for data collection. The goal for these data is to contribute to the design of policies focusing on the citizens and the satisfaction of their needs. The central philosophy of the MOTIVATE project is citizens to raise their voice, cooperate with the competent bodies, and make their cities sustainable.

LOCAL Fiscal Policies for GREEN Energy Mainstreaming - Local4green (as a case study)

The Municipality has joined the project as an associated partner to receive technical assistance from EGTC Efxini Poli (Network Of European Cities For Sustainable Development) to develop local fiscal policies that will promote RES within municipality. The Assistance will set a number of fiscal policies that can be implemented locally.

Furthermore, it is important to state, that –already before this proposal, the Municipality of Ioannina has joined specific initiatives relevant to climate change mitigation/GHG emissions reduction:

Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (as a Demonstrator City)

The Municipality of Ioannina has entered the CoM in 2015, signing the letter of Commitment with specific targets:

Reduction of CO2 emissions by at least 40% by 2030.
Increased resilience by adapting to the impacts of climate change.

So far, the Municipality has monitored emissions and used CoMs tools to achieve these targets

In June 2018, the city hosted the launch of the Greek National Coalition for Digital Skills and Jobs, which became the 20th national coalition of this kind within the European Union. The city of Ioannina and the region of Epirus aim to increase the digital skills of their residents for increased employment and improvement of the region's tourism sector.

International Urban Cooperation programme (IUC) (2016-2020) (as a replicator city)
IURC will lead and develop a form of decentralised international urban and regional cooperation whose main axes of activity would be two-fold: sustainable urban development and innovation in key partner countries and regions in line with the external dimension of 'Europe 2020'. Based on capitalisation of results and lessons learned in the previous phase, the new program optimizes the added-value of international cooperation, transforming IURC into a Global Network of reference for urban innovation

URBACT (as a replicator city)
URBACT's mission is to enable cities to work together and develop integrated solutions to common urban challenges, through networking, learning from others' experiences, drawing inspiration and identifying good practices to improve urban policies. The URBACT III program is organized around four main objectives:
Capacity for policy delivery, policy design, policy implementation, building and sharing knowledge.

After joining the Mission we succeeded in joining the call HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02 of the program with the acronym CLIMABOROUGH, joining the call HORIZON-MISS-2021 HORIZON-MISS-2 program with the acronym ELABORATOR, as well as the inclusion of the project with the acronym "MOBILITIES" and the title "New Mobility solutions for climate neutrality in EU cities", in the framework of the program-3-HORIZ20 -CIT -01 and in the selection HORIZON-MISS-2023-CIT-01-01.

In addition to the above, the city's efforts have been participating in European Mobility week of 2021 (https://ioannina.gr/εκδηλώσεις-για-την-ευρωπαϊκή-εβδομάδι/) and 2022 (https://2030.ioannina.gr/?p=786, https://2030.ioannina.gr/?p=762, https://2030.ioannina.gr/?p=769)

The initiatives and actions in the areas of Sustainable Urban Mobility brought the reward for the Municipality of Ioannina. The Municipality was awarded in the context of the Urban Mobility Days 2022 conference, of the European initiative CIVITAS, which was held in Brno, Czech Republic (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uKoFLi8pika4EeMwgZMvltqC7Inq-kvZ/view?pli=1). This year the Urban Mobility Days coincided with the European Mobility Week. Therefore, in the context of the Conference and during a special ceremony organized on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the CIVITAS Awards, the Municipality of Ioannina was awarded the "CIVITAS Transformation Award", which recognizes and rewards the city that implements an integrated set of mobility measures with aiming to become a smarter and more sustainable place for everyone. (https://2030.ioannina.gr/?p=780))

Upon the decision of the Municipality's Decisions Committee to submit the proposal, the - Mayor commits, through the following letter, to the city's vision of becoming climate-neutral and smart by 2023.

Our main target is for our city to reach climate neutrality by obtaining Net-zero GHG emissions. To fill that gap, we, the Municipality, the Task Team, the Local Society, will take actions on every possible field, focusing on Stationary Energy and Transport, envisioning a city pedestrianized center -, with citizens using more bicycles than cars, and electric cars replacing gas cars. Those actions will be developed through extensive cooperation among the Municipality – Academic Institutions and the locals, that are all already in force, to Co-create our future Climate Neutral and smart City

We see our will to become one of the 100 climate-neutral and smart European Cities by 2030 as a great opportunity for the City of Ioannina and for Greece in general. Amid climate crisis, we also face a serious risk of energy poverty. Thus, the City's Municipality, cooperating with the citizens and local stakeholders, aspires that Ioannina will pioneer in the process of neutralizing GHG emissions and climate mitigation, and in the radical transformation of mentality as well.

The Municipality of Ioannina is in mid-level of ripeness to reduce overall GHG emissions by 2030, as several plans (e.g. the Sustainable Energy Action Plan, Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, Sustainable Urban Development Strategy, Waste management plan and cross-sectoral Smart City plan) have been developed in the last 3 years, and all of them fall within the implementation period. For sure, participation in the "Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy" and "100 Intelligent Cities Challenge/Digital Cities Challenge" initiatives offer primary tools for our main target, as several measures are now being taken for reducing CO2 emissions. Yet, the vision of Ioannina city is to scale up.

To reach the target of climate neutrality by 2030, the municipality has decided to change the current organization chart and create a new administrative unit, focusing on climate neutrality planning and monitoring. Furthermore, the unit will be responsible for coordinating a Task Force of experts, offer guidance under the supervision of the Mayor, and monitor the project results. The factors who developed this proposal will also be part of the Task Force -

Proposal related large companies as ABB S.A., TERNA S.A and POLYECO S.A., Ministry of Environment and Energy.

Major academic institutions, such as:

Department of Architecture - University of Patras
Laboratory of Sustainable Mobility - National Technical University of Athens
Laboratory of Climatology - National and Kapodistrian University of Athens
Local stakeholders, as VIKOS S.A. and Local courier companies
local society, thought their involvement on consultations and questionnaires

The citizens and inhabitants of Ioannina will help its transformation to a climate neutral and smart city.

One of our targets is to update the collected data, create a tool for monitoring and reporting, evaluate the current situation and propose policies/actions for updating the existing plans. In close cooperation with the new unit, the Team will create an overall new monitoring system to keep track on GHG emissions and climate mitigation, using also tools developed by several EU projects that Municipality has taken part, or will take part. This new system will also be disseminated over other Municipalities that share the goal of climate neutrality.

Along with our primary target, we evaluate the cooperation of the civil society in the co-creation of a climate neutral future of great importance. The start has already been made, through workshops, living labs and public questionnaires, accessible to all. The local society, scientific and commercial associations, public institutions and private stakeholders have embraced the Municipality's vision by actively engaging and massively participating in such actions.

# Letter from the Mayor of Ioannina for the announcement of the candidacy of the municipality for the 100 climate neutral cities until 2030

The Municipality of Ioannina decided to respond to the challenge of the European Commission and to submit a candidacy file for the pilot program "100 energy neutral and smart cities".

We have all decided together, city stakeholders, city's political parties, neighboring municipalities, citizens, along with the Central Administration, that we must radically change our mentality, our planning strategies, our decision-making processes.

In this context, within the last months:

We organized public events and workshops aimed at the participation and information of all citizens;
We gained valuable knowledge and experiences from the participation of worthy scientists and academics;
We contacted the competent Ministries, we were informed, we provided information;
We exchanged views and experiences with other Greek and European cities;
We decided that we will do our best to change our city for the benefit of the next generations.

Cities, due to the rapid urbanization of the past decades, are posed at the center of attention for mitigating and adapting to climate change. The right to clean and affordable energy is among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and should therefore be guaranteed to every European citizen. The right of the future generations of Ioannina to enjoy a sustainable city is the basis of our decision and our vision.

Through the effort and the possible participation in the program, we aim for the city of Ioannina to incorporate experiences, funding opportunities and practices to enhance sustainable urban mobility, save energy in buildings, mitigate climate change, but also to improve the living standard of all of us.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

In our city, as a result of collective effort, we won massive support, resulting to the citizen's and stakeholders consent and co-decision to proceed with the submission of the proposal. We know that the road is difficult, demanding and requires joint action, majorities and participation of all parties involved.

I, the Mayor of the city of Ioannina, having in my hands the joint will for change of the citizens, I personally declare my unwavering willingness to serve the goal of the program, as a debt to the next generation of our city.

Finally, it is of paramount importance to highlight citizens' and local stakeholders' engagement in climate change mitigation /GHG emissions reduction policies.

Partnerships with other cities is essential for the success of the mission. Municipality is already member of Covenant of Mayors Initiative among others, but this is not enough. We have ensured the cooperation with 2 Greek Cities Networks, to gather all lessons learnt and best practices within Greek cities, and also communicate projects progress and results to the same target. This support essential, as every city and municipality share the same target, even not for 2030, but for 2050. Furthermore, we have ensured cooperation and support with Cities from EU counties, that share the same vision and could also contribute with their policies development as a joint team. More information about the partnership with other cities could be found on proposal's site: https://2030.ioannina.gr/?page_id=559

Finally, as the citizens' engagement is considered the most important step towards climate neutrality, the Team alongside the Municipality, had organized multiple actions to gather citizens views on climate neutrality at the  $1^{\text{st}}$  stage, that of Proposal Submission,.

These initiatives started with a consultation with citizens in the form of an online questionnaire consisting of both general questions on climate neutrality and action-oriented questions.

The answers to this survey can be seen in Annex I, whereas in the following chart one can see the responses on the need to take action on climate neutrality - which appears to be unanimously agreed.

What is your opinion on climate change? Do we need to act immediately to deal with it?

# 2 Work Process

This section should list the working steps carried out, for example along the NZC Climate Transition Map, or related steps planned as well as outline timeline and milestones for future iterations for the continuous development of the Action Plan.

# Work Process - combination of textual and visual elements

Journey of the Municipality of Ioannina'- towards having achieved climate neutrality by 2030 is mapped out using the NZC Climate Transition Map, which provides a structured framework for our actions. Our approach is iterative, ensuring adaptability to emerging challenges and opportunities while maintaining a clear vision.

From the very day that the city of Ioannina was selected to join the European Commission's Mission Cities programme to become one of the 100 climate neutral and smart cities by 2030 (April 2022), the Municipal Authority under the late Mayor Moses Elisaf was mobilised, simply acting on the obvious: continuing the cooperation with the Proposal Team and ensuring its further expansion to create the Transition Team. The Transition Team was essentially tasked with organizing and structuring a more precise plan for climate neutrality by 2030, amplifying the City's already significant efforts. Team's primary objective was to increase active citizen involvement, initially by providing them with the necessary information and mobilising them to help shape the plan that the city will follow.

The structure of the Transition Team, as it was formed, is as follows:

## Workshops and seminars

During the development of the plans (Action - Investment - Commitment plans), the transition team and other collaborating entities conducted various workshops and seminars aimed at encouraging the achievement of climate neutrality. The objectives of these actions were to inform citizens therefore foster the necessary culture for climate neutrality as well as to co-create views and actions for the common goal by 2030.

The most significant of these are presented below:

## A. Workshops 'Designing Together for Bicycles'

Specifically, three workshops were conducted by members of the transition team, T. Vlastos (renowned Greek Professor Emeritus of Topography at the National Technical University of Athens for the development of bicycle usage culture) and M. Siti (a well-known researcher in Topography at the National Technical University of Athens specializing in bicycle lane planning in cities).

## A.1: 1st Bicycle Workshop:

In the workshop, the Municipality, the study group and the citizens discussed the basic concepts related to the design for the bicycle as well as the future actions.

NTUA Professor Emeritus, Urban Planner - Transportation Specialist T. Vlastos emphasized the participation of citizens in planning for the bicycle use. "Using the bicycle will make the city more humane and a lot friendlier. The bicycle is the means that guarantees the best utilization of space. Today the car has taken over everything and the point is to create space for both pedestrians and cyclists," said Mr. Vlastos, emphasizing that very well-organized steps must be taken for the city to meet its climate neutrality commitments. (https://2030.ioannina.gr/?p=726)

## A.2: 2nd Workshop in conjunction with the European Mobility Week 2023:

On 9/19, the 2nd Workshop followed with the topic "Planning together for the bicycle" - "What are the problems of cycling in Ioannina? Discussion of what could be done". In the workshop, which is the second consultation

process for the integration of the bicycle in the life of the city, the study group presented the policies to strengthen the presence of the bicycle, taking into account basic planning elements and the peculiarities of the road network of the city of Ioannina. This was followed by a presentation of proposals on the designing of cycle paths around the city, strengthening the existing network.

https://2030.ioannina.gr/?p=747,

https://2030.ioannina.gr/?p=775

# A.3: 3rd Workshop:

In the 3rd Workshop, the Municipality, the study group, a representative of the Ministry of Environment and Energy, representatives of Entities and citizens discussed the proposed final bicycle infrastructure network in the city of Ioannina, the priorities for its implementation, as well as the policies to raise awareness and activate residents in relation to the bicycle. Basic principles of the network for the bicycle are the connection of important activities of the city, the activation of predetermined pedestrian paths from the urban planning regime in force, the reinforcement of the sidewalk network, the reduction of the speed limit, etc.

https://2030.ioannina.gr/?p=819,

https://2030.ioannina.gr/?p=822

The 'Designing Together for Bicycles' workshops aimed to create a masterplan for the development of a bicycle network in the city of Ioannina. There have been three co-design meetings with the public, city stakeholders, and experts. Initially, the participation and awareness methodology for integrating bicycles into the city's daily life were presented, so the public was familiarized with common policies for increasing bicycle usage. Then, through presentations, public exercises, and discussions, the topic of how to incorporate bicycles into the city of Ioannina was raised and analysed in depth.

During the public exercises, participants designed desired routes, connections, points of interest, and various specific elements on maps. This was followed by dialectical discussions.

In subsequent workshops, measurements of the city's network dimensions were presented, focusing on axes that could potentially accommodate bicycle infrastructure. An analysis of survey questionnaires aimed at identifying problems and difficulties related to the everyday use of bicycles by citizens was also conducted. The questionnaires sought to gather public opinions on specific interventions, and approximately 400 people responded.

Finally, an extensive preliminary proposal for a strategy to integrate bicycles int Ioannina was presented in another workshop. The proposal clarified distinct policies for a) reclaiming space from cars, b) coexistence of bicycles with automobiles, and c) granting access privileges to bicycles. The proposal was based on protecting the city center and interrupting traffic flows within it, creating areas/zones of mild traffic, etc. It included proposals for organizing major road axes, connecting the existing bicycle network, and rectifying current network shortcomings. Special emphasis was put on iconic routes and the lakeside front in terms of providing space for pedestrians and cyclists. Additionally, proposals were made for serving the city center with small public transport vehicles on two circular routes, bicycle-taxi vehicles, and an emphasis on the importance of switching to cargo bikes for deliveries.

Among other activities, the public exercises involved rating and prioritizing interventions on maps, followed by dialectical discussions.

# QUESTIONNAIRE - conducted during the workshops - parallel survey

A survey through a questionnaire was conducted with the aim of identifying problems and difficulties faced by citizens regarding bicycles, while simultaneously seeking public opinions on specific interventions. Approximately 400 individuals responded.

In the assessment of issues (why I don't cycle in Ioannina),  $84\%$  responded that there are no bike lanes and special lanes to ride a bicycle,  $68\%$  mentioned that drivers do not pay attention to cyclists,

Vision of Sustainable Urban Development: The Municipality of Ioannina has set it's the vision for the Sustainable Urban Development Strategy (SUDS). The aim is Ioannina to become a hub of innovation for all European cities, developing a repository of best practices from successful innovative projects and full-scale investments with the main goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2030, through greenhouse gas emissions reduction and by focusing also on energy efficiency in all sectors such as transportation, urban and regional planning, and building infrastructure.'

Furthermore, due to the rich natural environment, the connection between the nature and the city of Ioannina is multifaceted and robust, constituting a valuable heritage for future climate neutrality initiatives. Nature-based solutions (NbS) can effectively address a variety of societal challenges, such as climate change, contributing in this way to sustainable development, creating business opportunities, and restoring ecosystems, all while fostering increased participatory decision-making, in conjunction with a polycentric system of local governance.

In addition, the Sustainable Urban Development plan was put into consultation with citizens and institutions through the consultation platform of the Municipality (https://2030.ioannina.gr/?p=990)

As the Municipality of Ioannina progresses with the implementation of the Action Plan, it is essential to recognize that the journey towards climate neutrality is dynamic. The challenges and opportunities we face will evolve, and so must our strategies.

Review and Feedback Mechanism: At the end of each year, a comprehensive review will be conducted to assess the progress of each thematic axis. This review will gather feedback from stakeholders, CNOs, and the public to understand the successes and areas of improvement.
Data-Driven Decision Making: The Climate Neutrality Observatory, along with the electronic platforms, will continuously collect and analyze data. This data will guide the refinement of strategies and the introduction of new initiatives.
Stakeholder Engagement: Regular workshops and consultation sessions will be organized to ensure that the voices of all stakeholders are heard. Their insights will be invaluable in refining the Action Plan.
Pilot Projects: Based on emerging technologies and best practices globally, pilot projects will be introduced in specific CNZs. Successful pilots will then be scaled across the municipality.
Annual Updates: The Action Plan will undergo annual updates to incorporate the findings from the reviews, data analysis, and stakeholder feedback. These updates will ensure that the plan remains relevant and effective.
Long-Term Vision: While the current Action Plan outlines strategies up to 2030, a long-term vision extending to 2050 will be developed. This vision will set ambitious goals beyond 2030 and outline the roadmap to achieve them.

Through committing to regular reviews, stakeholder engagement, and data-driven refinements, the Municipality of Ioannina ensures that the Action Plan remains a living document, adaptable to the changing landscape of climate action and sustainability.

Vision of the Late Mayor: The late Mayor's vision was to transform Ioannina into a beacon of sustainability and resilience. His commitment to the environment and the well-being of the citizens has been the driving force behind our ambitious goals. Today, the Mayor Mr. Pappageorgiou continues to uphold and champion this vision.

# A-1.2: Emission factors applied

The emission factors provided below have been derived from the Municipal Emission Reduction Plans in accordance with the IPCC 2006 methodology. They serve as coefficients within the equations utilized for the computation of greenhouse gas emissions stemming from various sources such as Diesel, Gasoline, Electricity, and more. These equations have been excerpted from the Municipal Emission Reduction Plans Guide, which was issued for Local Government Organizations. They are specifically designed to facilitate the conversion of energy source consumption into greenhouse gas emissions, encompassing CO2, CH4, and N2O, measured in tons. To facilitate cross-gas comparisons, these emissions are standardized as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). This standardization relies on the utilization of specific factors known as Global Warming Potentials (GWPs), which quantify each gas's heat-trapping potential relative to carbon dioxide.

The Municipal Emission Reduction Plans Guide was developed in compliance with Article 16 of the National Climate Law (4936/2022) and officially published in the Government Gazette with reference number 4145/23.07.2023.

For calculation in t or MWh of primary energy

The Municipality of Ioannina contains within its boundaries 720.685 trees. Using the equation:
$$AR_{BW} = T_{MP} \times ADR_2 \times C_w \times 44/12$$
where,
$AR_{BW}$: total removal of CO2 from the atmosphere due to the creation of new woody biomass from trees within the specified time period, in tons of CO2
$T_{MP}$: number of trees in a park or green space that are in the mature growth phase
$ADR_2$: annual growth rate of woody biomass (trunk, branches, roots) of a tree species (i) that is in the mature growth phase, in dry tons of woody biomass per tree. Estimated 0,01695
$C_w$: carbon content of woody biomass: 0.475 tons of carbon per dry ton of biomass [average value that covers most common tree species, both hardwood and softwood]  |   |   |

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

For the calculation of emissions in each sector, data was sourced from the Municipal Authority or the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT). The equations used for this purpose were derived from the Municipal Emission Reduction Plans Guide, which has been posted on the website of the Ministry of

Environment, Energy, and Climate Change of Greece. The methodology designed for quantifying greenhouse gas emissions and developing Municipal Emission Reduction Plans was based on the following standards:

ISO 14064-1:2018 Greenhouse gases - Part 1: Specification with guidance at the organization level for quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals
Greenhouse Gas Protocol, WRI: Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories, GPC: An Accounting and Reporting Standard for Cities Version 1.1.
Guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for national greenhouse gas inventories.

## Buildings Sector

Based on Table A-1.1, it is observed that the highest energy consumption in the building sector is attributed to household oil heating (177,809.05 MWh). This is followed by electricity consumption (108,045 MWh) and the use of firewood/pellets (72,163.28 MWh) in households. Conversely, energy consumption for municipal buildings is significantly lower in comparison to private ones. For instance, oil consumption for municipal buildings totals 956.82 MWh, schools consume 3,127.37 MWh, while electricity consumption is 8,358.03 MWh. This notable difference arises from the fact that private buildings outnumber municipal ones, resulting in higher energy consumption.

From the above data, it is evident that the highest energy consumption arises from the combustion of oil for heating, as well as the use of electricity for heating and lighting. This is quite logical since the Municipality of Ioannina is situated at a high altitude, and during the winter, temperatures drop below 0 degrees Celsius. Consequently, more energy is required for heating.

All of the above information is consolidated in Figure 27, which illustrates the percentage of energy consumption by subcategory within the building sector. This visualization makes the differences in energy consumption for each subcategory readily apparent.

## Transport Sector

Based on Table A-1.1, it can be observed that the highest energy consumption is attributed to the fuel consumption by the residents' vehicles in the Municipality of Ioannina (410,218.364 MWh). This is followed by fuel consumption by vehicles for the transportation of In &amp; Out Boundary emissions (146,728.32 MWh). Energy consumption for all other subcategories (Public Vehicles, City Bus, etc.) is comparatively much lower than the aforementioned.

From the above data, it is evident that the highest energy consumption is attributed to the mobility of vehicles used by the residents of the Municipality of Ioannina. This implies that there is a significantly larger number of these vehicles compared to other sectors, resulting in a higher fuel consumption for their operation.

All of the above information is consolidated in Figure 28, which illustrates the percentage of energy consumption by subcategory within the transport sector. This visualization makes the differences in energy consumption for each subcategory readily apparent.

## Waste

Based on Table A-1.1, the highest energy consumption occurs during the process of solid waste decomposition at the Landfill (33,495 MWh). It's important to note that this process doesn't require energy consumption from external sources; it's a natural process. Energy consumption from the

City of Ioannina, Greece
IOANNINA 2030
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
C

combustion of motor diesel for waste transport within the municipality amounted to 265.83 MWh, while outside the municipal boundaries, it was 12.65 MWh.

All of the above information is consolidated in Figure 29, which illustrates the percentage of energy consumption by subcategory within the waste sector. This visualization makes the differences in energy consumption for each subcategory readily apparent.

## Water

Based on Table A-1.1, the highest energy consumption is attributed to the use of electricity (25,575.75 MWh). Following this is the consumption of energy from the use of heating oil (628 MWh). This is primarily because electricity consumption includes energy for pumping drinking water.

All of the above information is consolidated in Figure 30, which illustrates the percentage of energy consumption by subcategory within the water sector. This visualization makes the differences in energy consumption for each subcategory readily apparent.

## IPPU

According to Table A-1.1, the highest energy consumption is attributed to the use of CNG in the production process (1,688.20 MWh). Following this are the energy consumption from Diesel (501.50 MWh) and LPG (0.98 MWh).

All of the above information is consolidated in Figure 31, which illustrates the percentage of energy consumption by subcategory within the IPPU sector. This visualization makes the differences in energy consumption for each subcategory readily apparent.

## AFOLU

According to Table A-1.1, it is evident that energy consumption from Diesel in Agriculture is 3,264.54 MWh, while in Animal Husbandry, it is 39.10 MWh. The difference arises from the fact that the Municipality of Ioannina has more cultivable agricultural land, which requires energy for production processes, compared to its livestock units.

All of the above information is consolidated in Figure 31, which illustrates the percentage of energy consumption by subcategory within the AFOLU sector. This visualization makes the differences in energy consumption for each subcategory readily apparent.

## EMISSIONS AND SCOPE

The Figure 33 presented above illustrates the contribution of each sector to the total equivalent of CO2 emissions. The analysis reveals that the buildings' sector accounts for the highest emissions. The sector of transportations follows closely. The water sector has a relatively smaller impact, while the Agricultural, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU) sector has the lowest contribution. Additionally, the waste sector presents a noteworthy contribution, whereas the Industrial Process and Product Use sector (IPPU) demonstrates a comparatively smaller impact.

According to the CO2 equivalent emissions diagram for SCOPE 1 (Figure 34), it can be observed that the majority of emissions arise from fuel consumption for transportation. Emissions due to fuel usage for heating municipal buildings follow, while the greenhouse emissions from waste disposal present the smallest impact. The emissions that stem from fuel consumption in the agricultural, industrial and water sectors are remarkably smaller, in comparison to the transportation and buildings sectors.

City of Ioannina, Greece
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Through the SCOPE 2 diagram (Figure 35), which illustrates the emission of CO2 equivalent resulting from electricity consumption by households, municipal buildings, and municipal lighting, it becomes clear that households are responsible for emitting the highest quantity of greenhouse gases. This observation is reasonable considering that households necessitate electricity for various purposes such as heating, cooling, cooking, among others, unlike municipal buildings.

As for the SCOPE 3 diagram (Figure 36), which pertains to CO2 equivalent emissions from the transportation and disposal of waste outside the Municipality's boundaries, the emissions from waste disposal at the Elliniko landfill are much higher than the emissions from the waste transportation to this one.

From all the above, it is evident that the majority of CO2 equivalent tons emitted into the atmosphere originate from fuel and electricity consumption of buildings sector. The second highest emission factor is transportation. These findings serve as a guiding principle for the creation of the Action Plan, as it is necessary to identify ways to reduce emissions. Proposed measures may include the procurement of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, the utilisation of heat pumps and solar energy for building heating, as well as the use of renewable energy sources for electricity generation.

In Figure 37, we can distinguish the main differences in CO2 emissions between the years 2014 and 2019. Initially, it is evident that there is reduction in the total emissions, with a note that emission data from the WASTE sector for the year 2014 is not available. Particularly remarkable is the reduction in emissions in the Buildings sector, specifically in the subsector of Heating via Diesel. Additionally, the decrease in emissions by private buildings, particularly in the subsectors of electricity consumption and heating from oil consumption, is also worth to point out. Finally, the decrease in emissions in the Transportation sector, especially in emissions from fuel consumption in private vehicles, is also evident.

Residual emissions consist of those emissions which can't be reduced through climate action and are being offset. Residual emission may amount to a maximum of 20 % as stated by the Mission Info Kit.
Baseline reduction target = Baseline emissions – residual emissions.
Emission reductions planned for in existing action planning and strategies should be quantified per sector.
Emissions gap = Baseline emission reduction target – Emissions reduction in existing strategies.

The baseline emissions values in Table A-2.3 diverge from those in Table A-1.4, which details GHG emissions by source sectors. This discrepancy arises due to the inclusion of tree absorptions within the Municipality of Ioannina, thereby showcasing reduced sector-specific emissions in Table A-2.3. The methodology for computing these absorptions and achieving an overall emissions reduction is elucidated in Table A-1.5.

## A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers – textual elements

Several systems detailed in Table A-3.1 face barriers concerning their alignment with climate neutrality policies and initiatives.

### Public Buildings, Private Buildings

The building sector, in general, stands as one of the leading contributors to GHG emissions. However, in the Municipality of Ioannina, both public and private buildings face several barriers when it comes to initiatives aimed at reducing GHG emissions.

Energy Inefficiency: The majority of buildings constructed before 2000 lack modern insulation, cooling and heating system technologies (most of them basis to diesel consumption for heating), leading to significant energy losses and a pressing need for extensive retrofitting.
Budget Constraints: Limited funds for retrofitting and upgrading public and private buildings to be more energy-efficient.
Lack of Sustainable Construction Practices: The private sector resist adopting sustainable building practices due to perceived high costs and a lack of incentives.

### (Urban) Forest areas, Lake Pamvotida, Mining Zones

The area of Ioannina exhibits diverse natural and anthropogenic landscapes, including peri-urban forests, Lake Pamvotida, mining zones, and quarries, due to its unique geomorphology and topology. Consequently, multiple interdisciplinary entities, both formal and informal (private/public, citizen-led initiatives, organizations, associations), are involved, potentially causing delays in various processes such as licensing and interventions. Nonetheless, the strategic plan aims to address this by promoting action transparency, raising citizen awareness, and fostering commitments between the Municipality of Ioannina and various governmental and non-governmental bodies.

### Mobility and Transportations

The replacement of the current vehicles with electric ones, is a process that has been partially adapted at a national and local level. This happens because:

Electric vehicles are very expensive
There is no infrastructure facilities for vehicle charging
There is no parking spaces for vehicle charging

Furthermore, some other barriers, that the Municipality of Ioannina confronts, are:

Inefficient Public Transportation: An inefficient public transportation system can discourage the use of sustainable transportation modes.

#

Lack of Cycling Infrastructure: Inadequate cycling infrastructure can hinder the adoption of cycling as a low-emission transportation option.

## Water Supply and Sewage network

The primary barriers within the Water Supply and Sewage network include:

Energy-Intensive Water and Wastewater Treatment: The energy-intensive processes involved in water and wastewater treatment significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.
Water Leakages in the Internal and External Networks: Ioannina City's water network experiences substantial water leakages, estimated at nearly 60%. This wasted water not only hampers the city's needs but also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, primarily due to the energy-intensive nature of water supply and treatment.

## Renewable Energy

Regulatory and Administrative Challenges: Cumbersome permitting processes, bureaucratic red tape, and unclear regulations can hinder the efficient installation of renewable energy systems. Ambiguous or outdated regulations may lead to delays and uncertainty for investors and project developers.
Lack of Incentives: Inadequate financial incentives, subsidies, or tax breaks for renewable energy projects can deter potential investors. The absence of attractive financial support mechanisms may slow down the adoption of renewable energy technologies.
Limited Access to Financing: Difficulty in accessing affordable financing options can be a significant barrier. High interest rates, lack of specialized lending products, and uncertainty about returns on investment can discourage individuals and businesses from pursuing renewable energy projects.
Grid Connection Challenges: Connecting renewable energy systems to the grid can be complicated due to technical constraints or outdated infrastructure. Limited grid capacity can restrict the integration of variable renewable sources like solar and wind energy.

## Funds

The primary obstacle hindering the Municipality of Ioannina from achieving GHG emission reduction and climate neutrality is the insufficient availability of funds. As outlined in Section 4.2 of Module B-2, numerous actions have been thoroughly examined and are awaiting financial support for implementation. The key barriers arising from funding limitations include:

Insufficient internal capital and revenue resources for investing in sustainability projects.
Reliance on external sources of funding.
Limited financial support from the private sector.

## Municipal Waste and waste collection network

Municipal Waste and waste collection network barriers for climate neutrality are the bellow:

City of Ioannina, Greece
IDANNINA 2030
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
C

Municipal Waste: There is no detailed record on the amount of each type of recyclable materials
Biowaste: Absence of a strategy for the placement of brown bins and of a general strategy for bio-waste on a regional and national level
Other types of waste: Collective Systems for Alternative Management of several types of waste have not been established
Food waste: There is no organised action for the prevention of food waste and the redistribution of surplus food

## Administrative Structure

The existing Administrative Structure in the Municipality of Ioannina is described in PD No. 36710/10334 (Government Gazette B' 2138/2011) "Approval of the Internal Service Organization (O.E.Y.) of the Municipality of Ioannina, Ioannina Prefecture" decision of the Secretary General of the Decentralized Administration of Epirus - Western Macedonia. There is also an Environment and Urban Planning Directorate which includes the Environment and Energy Department.

### Administrative barriers:
No environmental integration across all policy and governance areas
Fragmentation
Climate dimension not included in overall policy design
Lack of horizontal and vertical climate governance at municipal level

## Circular Economy

The development of the circular economy, is quite a challenge for the Region of Epirus, but also for the Municipality of Ioannina as the largest city of Epirus, keeping in mind that this very sector in addition to the positive impact on the environment, natural resources and climate change, is expected to have a positive impact on labour market, entrepreneurship and sustainable development. It must be noted that the rate of utilisation of the possibilities of the circular economy, both at regional and national level, is low.

### Sector of Silversmiths

There is a great opportunity in the silversmithing businesses to adopt the circular economy model, as it is a traditional profession of the city

### Agrifood residues and by-products / Circular production models / Industrial symbiosis

There is no organised activity in these sectors, but there are opportunities in investing in them

## Municipal and Municipal Company Officials

A pivotal barrier to climate neutrality policies lies in the Municipality's capacity and the expertise of its staff, which are essential for effectively planning and executing present and future actions. Some reasons why this happens are:

Resource Constraints: Limited financial and human resources within the Municipality can make it difficult to allocate the necessary funds and personnel for staff training and capacity building in the context of climate neutrality policies.

City of Ioannina, Greece
Iloannina 2030

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Lack of Specialized Knowledge: Climate neutrality policies often require specialized knowledge in areas such as renewable energy, emissions reduction, and sustainable practices. Without this expertise, staff may struggle to plan and implement effective initiatives.
Resistance to Change: Existing practices and organizational culture within the Municipality may resist changes needed to align with climate neutrality goals, making it challenging to adapt and implement new policies effectively.
Limited Training Opportunities: Inadequate access to training and educational resources on climate-related topics can hinder staff development. Without access to relevant training, employees may lack the skills and knowledge needed to contribute effectively to climate initiatives.

# Green Public Procurement

The Municipality of Ioannina has set a primary objective to integrate Green Public Procurement (GPP) into its procedures, yet several barriers stand in the way of achieving this goal. The key obstacles include:

Complex Regulations
Budget Constraints
Capacity and Expertise of Municipal Officers
Monitoring and Enforcement of Supplier Compliance with GPP Requirements

# From Barriers to Opportunities:

Many of the previously mentioned barriers can actually be viewed as opportunities for the municipality. As further detailed in the text, a significant portion of the actions already implemented or proposed directly addresses these barriers. The municipality consistently seeks out new opportunities in its pursuit of achieving climate neutrality.

# A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

Figure 45: Energy Systems field of action

Ioannina – given its mountainous and lakeside profile – is a biodiversity hotspot that needs protection and conservation. The main urban complex of the city is constantly expanding in the suburbia which leads to land consumption, further energy consumption and a clear increase in transportation needs. This expansion has its origins in the model of suburban life which began with the generalized use of cars. This expansion is apparent in the metropolitan area of Ioannina, with low density suburbs and a clear inversion in the topology of the local landscape.

Ioannina metropolitan area aims to invest in the compact city model on its way to climate neutrality as a key pillar of its urban development. The physical structure of the city (mountains and lake) along with the current infrastructure (i.e. airport) can literally set the boundaries of this development.

The city's strategic masterplan, drafted back in 2009 although never institutionally approved, had clear boundaries and was setting the preferable traffic circulation model (see below). This model demonstrates the limits of urban development through the alignment of all physical and anthropogenic infrastructure, where gray polygons define the proposed housing and commercial areas.

Figure 47. the proposed traffic circulation model in the metropolitan area (PII, 2009)

On its way to climate neutrality, Ioannina has set precise actions that are in line with the above compact city strategy towards a more efficient and sustainable use of both the city itself and the surrounding territory. Various actions in the fields of 'BUILT ENVIRONMENT' and 'MOBILITY &amp; TRANSPORT' support the increase of the pedestrian catchment zones both in the CC and the city's neighborhoods and suburbs (i.e. Anatoli, Katsikas etc.), while others regulate urban planning, define new monumental nodes within the vicinity of the CC etc. Through this set of actions the compact city model can be identified as the basis of urban development in a way that can be adjusted to the Greek reality, with all identified bureaucratic strangleholds that is.

The Municipality of Ioannina, driven by its strategy to reduce GHG emissions, unnecessary energy consumption, and associated costs, has designed and initiated a specific set of actions with the aim of upgrading essential and energy-intensive infrastructures. Thus, within the field of actions of Energy Systems, it engages in actions that primarily focus on the systemic lever of Technology and Infrastructure. By harnessing new technologies, it intends to upgrade the water supply and sewage infrastructures of the city in this particular domain. These actions encompass the enhancement of water system monitoring and the smart and ecological management of sludge generated by the sewage treatment plant. Notably, this field of action also includes the creation and installation of new photovoltaic stations.

These specific actions are devised to bring about the following early changes and outcomes:

Incentives from the municipality for energy savings from businesses

The Municipality recognizes the importance of encouraging local businesses to actively pursue energy-saving initiatives. As an initial objective, there's a plan to reduce the energy consumption of businesses operating within the municipality by  $10\%$ . To start this effort, the Municipality intends to launch a comprehensive campaign focused on energy conservation.

To entice businesses to actively engage in this energy-saving effort, a set of incentives will be introduced. For instance, companies that successfully meet the  $10\%$  energy reduction target will be awarded a special certificate by the Municipality. This certificate serves as a tangible recognition of their environmentally responsible practices.

The monitoring and supervision of this energy-saving initiative will be a crucial aspect of its success. To achieve this, the Municipality will request annual electricity consumption invoices from the relevant services of each business. These invoices will then undergo a rigorous examination to determine whether the set energy reduction goal has been met. This process ensures accountability and helps businesses stay on track with their energy-saving commitments, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly community.

# Actions to inform users of municipal buildings to improve behavior and optimal use of electromechanical equipment

The behavior of individuals who frequent use municipal buildings plays a pivotal role in achieving substantial reductions in energy consumption and ensuring the efficient utilization of heating, cooling systems, and electronic devices within these facilities. Consequently, it is highly advisable to implement a multifaceted approach aimed at promoting energy-conscious behavior among permanent users of such energy-intensive municipal buildings.

One crucial facet of this strategy involves conducting targeted information activities tailored to the needs and routines of the individuals who regularly occupy these municipal structures. The primary objective of these initiatives is to instill an energy-conscious mindset among the building occupants. By educating them about the importance of responsible energy usage, it becomes possible to minimize energy wastage, particularly in the context of air conditioning, heating, and the operation of various electronic equipment within the premises. In essence, these information activities aim to empower occupants to take proactive steps in reducing their energy consumption, contributing to cost savings for both the municipality and the environment.

Simultaneously, it is recommended to launch a comprehensive information campaign that extends its reach beyond municipal building users to encompass all residents of the community. The overarching goal of this campaign is to foster an energy-saving ethos that permeates daily life, especially within the confines of individual households. By raising awareness about the broader implications of energy conservation, residents can be encouraged to adopt sustainable practices within their homes, thereby collectively reducing the community's overall energy footprint.

This community-wide energy-saving spirit entails a shift in mindset, encouraging residents to make conscious choices in their daily routines, such as optimizing heating and cooling systems, turning off lights and electronic devices when not in use, and being mindful of energy-efficient practices in their homes. By engaging the entire community in this endeavor, the campaign seeks to create a culture of energy-conscious living that extends well beyond municipal buildings, ultimately leading to significant energy savings, reduced environmental impact, and enhanced quality of life for all residents.

In summary, the proposal advocates for a multifaceted approach to promote energy-conscious behavior among users of municipal buildings and the broader community. Through tailored information activities for building occupants and a comprehensive awareness campaign for all residents, the aim is to cultivate a sustainable, energy-saving mindset that not only optimizes energy usage within municipal facilities but also extends to homes and daily life. This holistic approach represents a proactive step toward achieving significant energy efficiency gains, cost savings, and environmental benefits for the entire community.

An essential aspect of addressing environmental concerns, especially in the context of prevention and mitigation, goes beyond just upgrading municipal buildings. It involves conducting a range of awareness-raising initiatives, with a particular focus on educational efforts targeting students. This approach recognizes the critical role that informed and environmentally conscious youth can play in shaping a sustainable future.

To achieve this, it is proposed to establish dedicated groups or teams that will engage with students to educate them about the benefits of energy conservation and sustainable development more broadly. These educational activities aim to instill a deep understanding of the significance of sustainable practices and environmental literacy from an early age. The Municipality recognizes the profound importance of continually educating students about climate change and its multifaceted impact on the environment.

Awareness programs designed for students may include a variety of engaging activities and events. These could involve informative sessions, workshops, and presentations that elucidate the positive outcomes of energy-saving measures and sustainable development. By imparting this knowledge to students, they can develop a strong sense of responsibility towards environmental preservation and sustainable living.

Moreover, these awareness initiatives might encompass creative elements, such as contests and online campaigns conducted via social networks. These interactive platforms can help to engage students and the wider community in meaningful discussions about sustainability, fostering a sense of shared responsibility. Additionally, meetings featuring team-based games and challenges can be organized to emphasize the tangible benefits of sustainable practices in a fun and engaging manner.

It's worth noting that these awareness-raising actions may not yield immediate direct financial benefits that can be considered economically sustainable. However, they can be financially supported through national and European funding programs, in addition to the Municipality's own resources. These initiatives can generate indirect benefits that are difficult to quantify but are nonetheless immensely valuable. For instance, increased environmental awareness among young children can lead to more responsible behavior and choices throughout their lives, potentially contributing to long-term energy and resource conservation, reduced environmental harm, and improved overall quality of life for the community.

In conclusion, the proposal underscores the importance of education and awareness-raising, especially among students, as a critical component of a comprehensive strategy to address climate change and promote sustainable development. By investing in these initiatives, the Municipality aims to empower the younger generation with knowledge and values that will guide them towards more sustainable lifestyles and choices, ultimately benefiting both the community and the environment in the long run. While the direct financial returns may be challenging to measure, the potential positive impacts on future generations are immeasurable and invaluable.

Activities will include the deployment of key resources, the establishment of essential infrastructure, and the initial engagement of stakeholders. Concurrently, a preliminary assessment of progress will be conducted to gauge the early outcomes and ensure that the proposed initiatives align with the defined objectives. This stage lays the foundation for the comprehensive transformation towards climate neutrality and sets the trajectory for subsequent milestones.

Mid-Term Review (2026): Two years into the implementation of the Action Plan, the Municipality of Ioannina will undertake a comprehensive mid-term review. This critical juncture serves as a checkpoint to evaluate the progress made towards achieving climate neutrality. During the Mid-Term Review in 2026, a meticulous examination of the results achieved thus far will take place. This includes a thorough analysis of both quantitative data and qualitative feedback from all the actions and initiatives that implemented in that period.

Preparation for Final Phase (2028): The year 2028 serves as a period of intense preparation for the Final Review in 2030. During this time, the Municipality will work diligently to finalize any outstanding projects, assess the performance of ongoing initiatives, and address any unforeseen challenges that may have arisen. In essence, this phase will serve as the bridge between the Action Plan's implementation and the comprehensive review in 2030. It is essential to ensure that all elements of the plan are executed effectively and that the Municipality remains on track to achieve its climate neutrality goals.

# Needs for Further Improvement:

Participatory model or platform: Stakeholder engagement and collaboration stand at the forefront of our efforts to attain climate neutrality in the Municipality of Ioannina. Currently, discussions among various stakeholders are actively underway to determine the most effective and inclusive participatory model or platform. The goal is to establish a robust framework that not only embraces the diversity of perspectives and expertise within our community but also fosters a sense of shared responsibility in addressing climate change.

These discussions encompass a wide array of stakeholders, including local government officials, community leaders, environmental organizations, businesses, academic institutions, and concerned citizens. Each stakeholder group brings unique insights, resources, and strengths to the table, making this a truly comprehensive endeavor.

The process of selecting the primary participatory model or platform is a dynamic one, where ideas are exchanged, and proposals are carefully considered. It is expected that substantial progress in this regard will be achieved during the first half of 2024, marking a pivotal moment in our journey towards climate neutrality.

The chosen participatory model or platform will serve as the cornerstone of our climate action strategy, enabling us to harness collective wisdom, mobilize resources, and implement initiatives that resonate with the values and aspirations of our community. Through this

collaborative approach, we aim to forge a resilient path toward climate neutrality, ensuring a sustainable and prosperous future for the Municipality of Ioannina.

**Data Integration**: The approach to data integration is multi-faceted. We recognize that the landscape of climate-related data is dynamic and constantly evolving. Therefore, we have established robust mechanisms to source, evaluate, and integrate new data seamlessly into our Action Plan. This approach guarantees that our strategies and actions remain aligned with the most accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information available.

Furthermore, the data integration process is characterized by transparency and accountability. We maintain open lines of communication with relevant stakeholders, data providers, and experts to facilitate a constant exchange of knowledge. This collaborative effort not only enriches our dataset but also fosters a culture of data-driven decision-making.

**Stakeholder Engagement Enhancement**: At its core, our approach to enhancing stakeholder engagement is rooted in inclusivity, transparency, and responsiveness. We are committed to creating a platform where every voice is not only heard but also valued. Feedback, insights, and perspectives from our diverse stakeholders serve as invaluable resources that guide and shape our climate action strategies.

We acknowledge that the landscape of climate action is multifaceted, with a myriad of complex challenges and opportunities. Therefore, we are continually refining our engagement processes to ensure that we not only invite but actively seek the input of our stakeholders. This involves developing innovative methods of engagement, harnessing digital technologies, and conducting regular consultations, surveys, and public forums.

Monitoring and Verification: By closely monitoring progress, we can promptly identify areas where adjustments or improvements are needed. This adaptive management approach ensures that our efforts remain aligned with our goals and deliver the intended results.

It provides the necessary validation for the anticipated benefits of our actions. Through transparent and verifiable data, we can demonstrate the positive impact of our climate initiatives. This not only builds trust within our community and among our partners but also allows us to celebrate and communicate our achievements effectively.

Regulatory Considerations: Our approach hinges on a thorough understanding of the legal landscape surrounding our initiatives. We will conduct comprehensive assessments to identify any potential regulatory hurdles or constraints that may arise during the implementation of our climate actions. These assessments will encompass a wide spectrum of legal factors, including zoning laws, building codes, environmental regulations, and heritage preservation mandates.

By proactively addressing regulatory considerations, we ensure that our actions align seamlessly with the existing legal framework. This proactive stance not only minimizes delays and complications but also upholds the integrity of our initiatives.

Capacity Building: Our commitment extends to regular and tailored training sessions, designed to empower municipal staff and stakeholders with the knowledge and skills necessary for effective participation in our initiatives. These training programs will be carefully curated to address the specific needs and challenges associated with each climate action.

These training sessions will encompass a wide range of topics, including the latest developments in sustainable technologies, climate policy, and best practices for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Qualitative Indicators: As part of our forward strategy, we will be developing qualitative indicators. These indicators will encompass various aspects such as the number of electric vehicles in our municipality, the size of our workforce, and more. These indicators will serve as essential monitoring tools to gauge the progress of our initiatives, aligning with the actions we have proposed in our plan.

Monitoring Team: In the upcoming phases, a pivotal stride will be the formation of a dedicated monitoring team within the Municipality of Ioannina. This team will be entrusted with a primary mission: to meticulously oversee and evaluate the advancement of both quantitative and qualitative indicators.

Climate Change Unit: One of the imminent milestones in our journey towards climate neutrality is the establishment of a dedicated Climate Change Unit, operating directly under the office of the Mayor. This specialized unit is envisioned to play a pivotal role in bolstering the municipality's efforts in designing and executing comprehensive programs, strategic plans, and targeted interventions across various sectors of action aimed at achieving climate neutrality.

Indicators Deliverables: There is an ongoing process to deliberate and define key indicator deliverables. It is estimated that process will end in the early months of 2024.

In subsequent iterations of the Climate City Contract, these needs will be at the forefront. The City of Ioannina is committed to learning, adapting, and refining its strategies to ensure the successful realization of its climate neutrality goals.

Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030
# INTRODUCTION

Ioannina aim to become a Climate-Neutral and Smart City by 2030. A revolution in transportation and a shift towards sustainable and zero - emission mobility is the key to achieving this goal. This revolution demands systemic, deep and structural changes in the transport sector and will be coproduced with citizens and stakeholders. This action plan builds on existing plans, strategies, collaborations and commitments (SUMP, cycle network workshops, VAA strategy etc.). It focuses on emissions for which the city of Ioannina is directly responsible and partly on emissions that it is responsible for beyond its borders.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

# PURPOSE

Transportation and mobility sector focuses on making mobility climate neutral. The roadmap has previously explored the path towards achieving it. This action plan breaks down the strategy into 15 different actions and projects and identifies the scale, the impact pathway, the implementation and the involved stakeholders.

B-2.1: Description of action portfolios - textual or visual

|  Fields of action | Portfolio description  |
| --- | --- |
|  Mobility & transport | List of actions
Descriptions  |
|  1. Walking and cycling: a push towards a real sustainable modal shift | The action aims to increase active mobility infrastructure and boost walking and cycling as commuting modes. Increase of pedestrian streets in the CC and the neighborhoods, increase of the city's sidewalks in major roads, cycle lanes and traffic calmed streets shall be at the core of the city's new image. Reducing car travel by 20% will be achieved through investing in new active mobility infrastructure and policies, tightening car policies and freedoms etc.

This action includes various projects, both common regeneration infrastructure and soft/ hard policy measures. The key aim is to create a car-free downtown and vivid neighborhoods that limit car-presence and pollution. Cyclist- and pedestrian- friendly streets and complementary infrastructure and policies promoting active mobility will act as the drivers in changing mobility habits.  |
|  2. Greening the bus fleet and strengthening the public transport role | The action includes the upgrade of the current bus fleet with cleaner (electric, hydrogen etc) vehicles and the upgrade of the overall service level of the public transport. On-demand transportation services, new bus circulation plans, mini-bus services for the CC. KTEL of Ioannina (sole public transport operator) is the key stakeholder to apply the needed changes in accordance to the city's needs.

This action includes sub-projects- as thoroughly examined and approved through Ioannina's Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) - such as the re-routing of bus lines with three (3) core axis and eight (8) routes serving the dense CC and the surrounding urban areas. It also includes the fleet replacement with a local scheme for buses and EV chargers for fast charging in the city.

A landmark project that is also adopted is the development of a new Cable car service linking disconnected areas.  |
|  3. Low to zero emission zones: Thorough and JUST transition for pilot zones | This action sets out the key steps to gradually apply a LEZ/ ZEZ scheme in three pilot zones in the city. The city center, the island and the university campus take the lead and by 2025 present replicable results to the rest of the city. By 2028 and 2030 more and more areas apply restrictions related to GHG emissions and car-circulation. Emphasis is given on policies to ensure a just transition, while also develop a medium-term plan to ban diesel vehicles and all ICE vehicles in the city. The suggested UVAR schemes are in accordance with the overall SUMP strategy for a car-free downtown and green- University Campus, while also focuses on altering the norms in the high and middle-density districts of the city.  |
B-2.1: Description of action portfolios - textual or visual

|  Fields of action | Portfolio description  |
| --- | --- |
|  Mobility & transport | List of actions
Descriptions  |
|  4. Less cars- cleaner cars | This action is at the core of urban mobility strategy and aims to assist the overall urban redevelopment by limiting car presence and boosting e-mobility with a comprehensive and extended EV chargers’ network. The action takes into account the ‘avoid-shift-improve’ approach and deploys a new policy paradigm for the city. This network goes along with incentivizing private car users to minimize the use of conventional cars/ motorcycles and/ or replace their vehicles with cleaner ones that fully or partially run on electricity, such as battery electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.

Moreover the action deals with the replacement of city-owned fossil fuel vehicles fleet with green vehicles and other policies and practices that limit internal combustion engine vehicles’ circulation in the city.  |
|  5. Cleaning and strengthening waterborne transportation | This action aims to increase the role of waterborne transportation by adding services and ease the replacement of diesel boats serving currently the connection between the city and the island. Lake Pamvotis can become an extra transportation corridor for connecting different areas of the city and the overall Ioannina conurbation with currently limited access to public transit through clean, electric and fast taxi-boats  |
|  6. Greening logistics. A new era in goods transportation | This action aims to reduce urban freight emissions through regulatory schemes that promote clear timetables, encourage clean vehicles, promote cargo bikes and infrastructure that allow for this transition. Smaller, cleaner and quiter vehicles shall deliver goods in the conurbation of Ioannina with the support of UCCs and loading/unloading platforms. Replacing ICE van and lorries entering the city will directly have an impact on local health and pollution, while also for vehicles serving the overall logistics chain which will allow for lowering emissions beyond our borders.  |
|  7. Using Sustainable Transportation on waste collection | This action aims to build on the existing waste strategy and rearrange waste collection with cleaner and smaller vehicles. The action includes projects such as smart waste collection system, supply of new waste collection vehicles (EVs) etc. Needed changes include;
Structural changes for - National scale supported by local actions
Administrative changes for – both national and Local scale,  |

# COMMENTS ON IMPLEMENTATION

Walking and cycling: a push towards a real sustainable modal shift

The increase of walking and cycling is directly related to car restrictions, to urban planning and incentives/disincentives. The space that will be created for walking/ cycling will be removed from the car. This change is radical and requires institutional changes/improvements, understanding of local conditions and changing the attractiveness of the car as the key commuting mode.

Needed changes include:

institutional changes regarding the maturation procedures and timetables (incl. studies, approvals, implementation) - NATIONAL scale,
Bonus-malus schemes (tax-redemption, direct subsidies, purchase rebates, car/bike replacement rebates etc.) for incentivising car -owners to reduce single-occupancy vehicle traffic and/or replace one household car with an active mobility alternative - NATIONAL scale supported by local actions,
Structural changes in car ownership system (correlation between car and private parking space ownership) - NATIONAL scale,
Structural changes in land use planning for obligatory neighbourhood scale parking areas and park and ride areas - NATIONAL scale supported by local actions.

| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Action type | Physical/ spatial interventions

Incentive scheme (purchase grants/ tax incentives |
| Action description | The action includes the upgrade of the current bus fleet with cleaner (electric, hydrogen etc) vehicles and the upgrade of the overall service level of the public transport. On-demand transportation services, new bus circulation plans, mini-bus services for the CC. KTEL of Ioannina (sole public transport operator) is the key stakeholder to apply the needed changes in accordance with the city's needs.

This action includes sub-projects- as thoroughly examined and approved through Ioannina's Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) - such as the re-routing of bus lines with three (3) core axis and eight (8) routes serving the dense CC and the surrounding urban areas. It also includes the fleet replacement with a local scheme for buses and EV chargers for fast charging in the city.

A landmark project that is also adopted is the development of a new Cable car service linking disconnected areas.

Increasing public transport's role as key commuting mode is inextricably related to car restrictions, parking, and car circulation policies. The scale of the interventions in the proposed action is critical, as more the projects include the replacement of the current bus fleet with EVs and the needed charging equipment, the re-routing of current service connections, and the introduction of a new means of public transport – the Cable Car- connecting currently disconnected areas. Cable cars remain one of the most economically viable public transport services that can connect marginal communities, however it is a system that is not applied in a city scale in Greece. |

Organisational and Governance Innovation  |
|   |  Action description | This action is at the core of urban mobility strategy and aims to assist the overall urban redevelopment by limiting car presence and boosting e-mobility with a comprehensive and extended EV chargers’ network. The action takes into account the ‘avoid-shift-improve’ approach and deploys a new policy paradigm for the city. This network goes along with incentivizing private car users to minimize the use of conventional cars/motorcycles and/ or replace their vehicles with cleaner ones that fully or partially run on electricity, such as battery electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.

The actions include a project for EV charging stations allocation scheme which provides 136 EV car chargers, 23 EV TAXI chargers, 3 EV chargers for trucks and lorries, 7 chargers for cars owned by disabled people, 2 chargers for tourist buses, 2 chargers for public buses (KTEL), 12 chargers for e-bikes and has a 2025 implementation time horizon. It is expected that the project will have secured financial implementation with the help of central government incentives’ scheme.

Moreover the action deals with the replacement of city-owned fossil fuel vehicles fleet with green vehicles and other policies and practices that limit internal combustion engine vehicles’ circulation in the city.

The overall strategy of the action is based on the approved SUMP strategy of the city. New street hierarchy, protected zones and new circulation plan are formally accepted but not yet realized by the wide public and the stakeholders.  |

Explain your city's motivation to join the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" and highlight your city's present commitments to climate action. You may also want to include the aims of this document.

## Your text

The Municipality of Ioannina, a proud participant in the 100 Climate Neutral Cities initiative, is embarking on a transformative journey towards achieving climate neutrality by 2030. This Commitment Plan serves as a solemn pledge, outlining the strategic imperatives that will bridge the gap between our current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory and our ambitious 2030 climate neutrality target.

Ioannina, the jewel of northwestern Greece and the capital of the Epirus Region, is a city that embodies both historical richness and forward-thinking dynamism. With a population exceeding 110,000, it serves as a strategic nexus, situated at the intersection of two major highways—Egnatia and Ionia—and in close proximity to Albania and the international port of Igoumenitsa.

Nestled amidst verdant mountains and fast-flowing rivers, the city is further adorned by Lake Pamvotida and its unique inhabited island. This natural beauty, coupled with a multicultural tapestry woven from Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities, makes Ioannina a city of diverse cultural and environmental assets.

In recent years, Ioannina has evolved into a vibrant hub of academic excellence, technological entrepreneurship, and civic engagement. Home to one of Greece's most significant university institutions, comprising 26 departments across 11 schools and over 20,000 students, the city is also the birthplace of the Epirus Science and Technology Park. This confluence of intellectual and technological capital positions Ioannina as a city ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities of sustainable development.

Our motivation for joining the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" is rooted in our commitment to leverage these assets for the betterment of our community and the world at large. We see this as a natural progression of our existing efforts to improve living conditions, protect our rich natural environment, and foster a sustainable future.

Over the past few years, Ioannina has become a burgeoning tourist destination, boasting both a robust hospitality sector and a high-quality business-tourism infrastructure. This growth has been paralleled by a focus on sustainability, as evidenced by our ongoing initiatives in renewable energy, sustainable transport, energy efficiency, and waste management. We are already in the process of implementing a range of climate actions, many of which align with the EU's climate neutrality goals.

The Municipality's commitment to climate neutrality is not a recent development. Since 2016, the Mayor signed the Covenant of Mayors, setting an optimistic target of reducing emissions by 40% by 2023 and committing to climate neutrality by 2050. The late Mayor Moses Elisaf, a visionary in his own right, took the optimistic decision to participate in the European Commission's invitation for the 100 European cities aspiring to become climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030. This decision was not made in isolation but was the result of collaborative efforts with academic institutions, private companies, and local stakeholder.

The journey towards climate neutrality for Ioannina is not a newfound ambition. Since 2016, our city has been a signatory to the Covenant of Mayors, initially setting an optimistic target of reducing emissions by 40% by 2023. The late Mayor Moses Elisaf, a visionary in sustainable urban development, further accelerated our efforts by leading the decision of the Economic Committee for the Municipality to join the European Commission's invitation for the 100 European cities aspiring to become climate-neutral by 2030. This Commitment Plan is a tribute to his legacy and a continuation of the work initiated under his leadership.

The Imperative for Action: The global climate crisis and the European Green Deal have heightened the urgency for a more proactive and targeted approach to climate action. The Municipality of Ioannina acknowledges this urgency and is committed to transcending traditional policy frameworks to adopt innovative methodologies and strategies that align with both local imperatives and global climate goals.

Methodological Framework: Inspired by the European Environment Agency's urban environment mapping and assessment, we have adopted the Climate Neutrality Zones (CNZs) methodology. This allows us to divide our territory into distinct zones, each with its unique environmental characteristics, thereby enabling tailored strategies for maximum effectiveness.

Institutional Mechanisms: To ensure systematic monitoring and implementation, we have established Climate Neutrality Offices (CNOs) and a Climate Neutrality Observatory. These institutions will work in close collaboration with the Technical Chamber of Greece (TEE) and other stakeholders to roll out comprehensive climate action initiatives.

Stakeholder Engagement: This Commitments Plan is a product of extensive multi-stakeholder engagement, involving academic institutions, local businesses, civil society, and citizens. It is a living document that will be periodically updated to reflect new commitments, stakeholder inputs, and advancements in climate science and policy.

Strategic Priorities: Our strategic priorities include decarbonizing the energy sector, promoting sustainable mobility, enhancing waste management, and fostering digital innovation for environmental monitoring. These priorities are aligned with our broader Sustainable Energy Management Plan, Local Waste Management Plan, and Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan.

Our journey towards climate neutrality is guided by a comprehensive set of commitments:

Climate Neutrality: Our primary goal is to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. This ambitious target is focused on stationary energy and transport, two sectors that are pivotal in our city's carbon footprint. We are investing in renewable energy sources and promoting energy efficiency in buildings to reduce our stationary energy emissions. In transport, we are encouraging the use of bicycles and electric cars, and envisioning a pedestrianized city center to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.
Co-Creation: We believe in the power of collaboration and are working closely with academic institutions and local citizens to co-create a future Climate Neutral and smart City. This approach ensures that our climate action plans are rooted in the needs and aspirations of our community.
Strategic Planning: We have developed several strategic plans, including the Sustainable Energy Action Plan, Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, Sustainable Urban Development Strategy, and Waste Management Plan. These plans provide a roadmap for our climate action efforts and are being implemented with the active participation of our community.
Organizational Change: Recognizing the need for dedicated resources, we intend to create a new administrative unit focusing on climate neutrality planning and monitoring. This unit will be responsible for coordinating our climate action efforts and ensuring that we stay on track to achieve our goals.
Data Monitoring: We are committed to data-driven decision making. To this end, we are renewing collected data, creating a tool for monitoring and reporting, evaluating the current situation, and proposing policies/actions for updating the existing plans.
Nature-Based Solutions: We are exploring nature-based solutions to address global societal challenges. This includes co-creating urban green infrastructure that not only enhances the beauty of our city but also contributes to our climate neutrality goals.
Lake Pamvotis Waterway: We are considering the development of a waterway on Lake Pamvotis. This project has the potential to provide a sustainable transport alternative and contribute to our climate neutrality goals.
Waste Management: We are improving waste management, with a focus on separate collection at Green Points, mobile Green Points, and municipal spaces. We are also

enhancing the separate collection of special waste streams. These efforts will not only reduce our carbon footprint but also contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment for our community.

Awareness Campaign: We are planning to implement an awareness campaign to sensitize and prevent waste generation. This campaign will educate our community about the importance of waste reduction and recycling, and encourage them to contribute to our climate neutrality goals.

The aim of this document is to detail these commitments and provide a roadmap for how the Municipality of Ioannina will maintain and enhance its climate neutrality status. This document serves as a testament to our dedication to the fight against climate change and a guide for our ongoing efforts.

Our approach is guided by key principles such as accountability, transparency, and innovation. We believe in co-creation, multi-actor and citizen engagement, and systemic and demand-driven actions. We are committed to thorough monitoring and joint learning, ensuring that our actions are effective and our progress is measurable.

We understand that the Climate City Contract is a living document and should be updated periodically to review its effectiveness, accountability to commitments, and to include new stakeholders and commitments in line with budgetary and monitoring cycles and citizen engagement processes.

Our commitments capture the outcomes of the co-creation process with local, regional, and national stakeholders, establishing new ways of working together to meet the 2030 climate neutrality challenge. Our overall priorities aim to bring about systemic change in the city as a whole, including in the sectors responsible for most emissions in the city.

We are committed to making meaningful changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in our city. We are setting ambitious objectives that will bring about real measurable change and radically reduce GHG emissions. We are providing a concrete timeline and monitorable targets for achieving these changes, as well as identifying which stakeholders need to be involved and how.

We, the undersigned, hereby commit to making the Municipality of Ioannina climate neutral by 2030. We agree on the joint vision and commitments, as formulated in the Municipality of Ioannina's Climate City Contract. We are dedicated to this mission and will work tirelessly to achieve our goals.

This Commitment Plan is not merely a document; it is a manifestation of our collective will, shared vision, and steadfast commitment to a sustainable and climate-neutral future. It sets the stage for a transformative journey that will not only make Ioannina a beacon of sustainability but also contribute to the global fight against climate change.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Articulate your 2030 climate neutrality ambition, as expressed and defined in your Cities Mission Expression of Interest (EoI). This should include your ambition and commitment to a 2030 horizon as a whole city, as well as describe any exclusion areas and summarise how these areas would be addressed beyond 2030. (A more detailed plan for exclusion areas should be included in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.) Your 2030 ambition should be supported at a minimum by a Council decision, and it is recommended that it is also supported by a wider stakeholder group. We also recommend you to list other co-benefits you aim to achieve when working towards the climate neutrality goal, like well-being, health, equity, justice, financial savings.

Πριν από τη συζήτηση του ανωτέρω θέματος της ημερήσιας διάταξης το Δημοτικό Συμβούλιο αποφάσισε ομόφωνα για το κατεπείγον συζήτησης του θέματος, σύμφωνα με τις διατάξεις του άρθρου 74 παρ. 5 του Ν. 4555/2018 και την υπ’ αριθμ. 46197/18.06.2019 εγκύκλιο του Υπουργείου Εσωτερικών.

Η Πρόεδρος του Δημοτικού Συμβουλίου κ. Ελένη Ακονίδου στο θέμα της ημερήσιας διάταξης με τίτλο: «Έγκριση της υποβολής του κλιματικού συμφώνου της πόλης των Ιωάννινων στο πλαίσιο της Ευρωπαϊκής αποστολής «100 κλιματικά ουδέτερες και έξυπνες πόλεις έως το 2030»» ενημερώνει το θέμα ότι πρέπει να προταχθεί η συζήτηση του ανωτέρω θέματος της ημερήσιας διάταξης διότι στη συνεδρίαση παρίστανται για την ενημέρωση του σώματος οι μελετητές. Το σώμα ομόφωνα αποδέχθηκε την πρόταση της κ. Προέδρου.

Στη συνέχεια η Πρόεδρος του Δημοτικού Συμβουλίου δίνει το λόγο στον Αντιδήμαρχο κ. Γεώργιο Αρλέτο, ο οποίος εισηγείται το θέμα και μεταξύ άλλων λέει: Κύριοι Σύμβουλοι, θέτω υπόψη του σώματος την υπ’ Αριθμ. Πρωτ. 93487/23.08.2023 εισήγησή μου, η οποία σας διανεμήθηκε προκειμένου να λάβετε γνώση και έχει ως κατωτέρω: «Ο Δήμος Ιωαννιτών, εναρμονισμένος με τις πρωτοβουλίες της Ευρωπαϊκής Επιτροπής, δεσμεύεται στην αντιμετώπιση της κλιματικής αλλαγής, ανταποκρινόμενος στις προκλήσεις και επιπτώσεις που αυτή επιφέρει στην κοινότητά μας. Με την ένταξή μας τον Απρίλιο του 2022 στην Ευρωπαϊκή Αποστολή «100 Κλιματικά Ουδέτερες και Έξυπνες Πόλεις έως το 2030», αναλαμβάνουμε τον ρόλο του πρωτοπόρου, επιδιώκοντας να καταστεί η πόλη μας ένα παράδειγμα καινοτομίας. Στόχος μας είναι να προβάλλουμε βέλτιστες πρακτικές και να υλοποιούμε επενδύσεις που θα συμβάλλουν στην επίτευξη της κλιματικής ουδετερότητας έως το 2030.

Ο Δήμος μας παρουσιάζει ετησίως περίπου 377.000 τόνους ισοδύναμου CO₂ ανά έτος (με έτος αναφοράς μετρήσεων το 2019).

Οι εκπομπές εντοπίζονται στους παρακάτω άξονες:
Κτιριακά: περίπου 190.000 τόνοι CO₂

|  Άξονες | Προτεινόμενες Δράσεις / Δράσεις υπό υλοποίηση  |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Δράσεις | Περιγραφή  |
|  Ενεργειακά Συστήματα | Προμήθεια και εγκατάσταση συστήματος εσωτερικής παρακολούθησης για το δίκτυο ύδρευσης της πόλης των Ιωαννίνων | Η δράση περιλαμβάνει 11.900 έξυπνους μετρητές νερού για οικιακή κατανάλωση, για την παρακολούθηση των δεδομένων σε καθημερινή βάση από απόσταση, για το εσωτερικό δίκτυο ύδρευσης της πόλης των Ιωαννίνων. Σήμερα το ποσοστό των διαρροών για το δίκτυο ύδρευσης εκτιμάται σε πάνω από 60%.
Με την προτεινόμενη δράση το ποσοστό διαρροών θα μειωθεί κάτω του 50% (εκτιμώμενη εξοικονόμηση πάνω από 20%), όπου θα υπάρξει εξοικονόμηση και από την τηλεπαρακολούθηση, η οποία μπορεί να εκτιμηθεί σε 10% εξοικονόμηση ενέργειας στην κύρια υποδομή.  |
|   |  Προμήθεια και εγκατάσταση συστήματος εξωτερικής παρακολούθησης για το δίκτυο ύδρευσης της πόλης των Ιωαννίνων | Η δράση περιλαμβάνει 50 σταθμούς παρακολούθησης για το εξωτερικό δίκτυο ύδρευσης της πόλης των Ιωαννίνων και αναβάθμιση του υπάρχοντος εξοπλισμού στις γεωτρήσεις.
Η προτεινόμενη δράση θα συμβάλει στην εξοικονόμηση τουλάχιστον 15% του νερού και γενικά στην εξοικονόμηση ενέργειας κατά 25%.  |
|   |  Αναβάθμιση των υφιστάμενων υποδομών του δικτύου αποχέτευσης | Η δράση περιλαμβάνει την πλήρη αναβάθμιση της υφιστάμενης υποδομής του δικτύου αποχέτευσης. Εκτιμάται ότι η δράση θα συμβάλει στην εξοικονόμηση ενέργειας κατά τουλάχιστον 15%.  |
|   |  Εγκατάσταση ΑΠΕ στον Τομέα Υδάτων – 1 Φ/Β σταθμός | Η δράση περιλαμβάνει την προμήθεια και εγκατάσταση 1 Φ/Β σταθμού 999,54 kW, για net metering στον Τομέα Υδρευσης και Αποχέτευσης (Δημοτική Επιχείρηση Υδρευσης και Αποχέτευσης).  |
|   |  Εγκατάσταση ΑΠΕ – 4 Φ/Β σταθμοί | Η δράση περιλαμβάνει την προμήθεια και εγκατάσταση 4 Φ/Β σταθμών 999,54 kW κάθε ένας, το οποίο θα μοιραστεί με την Ενεργειακή Κοινότητα Δήμου Ιωαννιτών. Οι Φ/Β σταθμοί θα χρηματοδοτηθούν από κεφάλαια του Δήμου ή χρηματοδότηση του ΥΠΕΝ.  |
|   |  Ολοκληρωμένη παρέμβαση στην υποδομή των φωτεινών σηματοδοτών του Δήμου Ιωαννιτών | Η δράση περιλαμβάνει την αναβάθμιση των περισσότερων φωτεινών σηματοδοτών στη γενική μητροπολιτική περιοχή της πόλης των Ιωαννίνων με νεότερα τύπου LED.  |
|  Μεταφορές & κινητικότητα | Περπάτημα και ποδηλασία: μια πραγματικά βιώσιμη μετατόπιση του τρόπου μετακίνησης | Η δράση αποσκοπεί στην αύξηση των υποδομών ήπιας κινητικότητας και στην ενίσχυση του περπατήματος και της ποδηλασίας ως τρόπων μετακίνησης. Η αύξηση των πεζόδρομων στο κέντρο της πόλης και στις γειτονιές, η αύξηση των πεζοδρομίων της πόλης σε μεγάλους δρόμους, οι ποδηλατόδρομοι και οι δρόμοι ήπιας κυκλοφορίας θα αποτελέσουν τον πυρήνα της νέας εικόνας της πόλης. Η μείωση των μετακινήσεων με το αυτοκίνητο κατά 20% θα επιτευχθεί με επενδύσεις σε νέες υποδομές και πολιτικές ήπιας κινητικότητας, αυστηροποίηση των πολιτικών και ελευθεριών για το αυτοκίνητο κ.λπ.
Η δράση αυτή περιλαμβάνει διάφορα έργα, τόσο κοινές υποδομές ανάπλασης όσο και μέτρα ήπιας και σκληρής πολιτικής. Ο βασικός στόχος είναι η δημιουργία ενός κέντρου χωρίς αυτοκίνητα και ζωντανών γειτονιών που περιορίζουν την παρουσία και τη ρύπανση των αυτοκινήτων. Οι φιλικοί προς τους ποδηλάτες και τους πεζούς δρόμοι και οι συμπληρωματικές υποδομές και πολιτικές που προωθούν την ήπια κινητικότητα θα λειτουργήσουν ως κινητήριοι μοχλοί για την αλλαγή των συνηθειών κινητικότητας.  |
|   |  Πράσινος στόλος λεωφορείων και ενίσχυση | Η δράση περιλαμβάνει την αναβάθμιση του σημερινού στόλου λεωφορείων με καθαρότερα οχήματα (ηλεκτρικά, υδρογόνου κ.λπ.) και την αναβάθμιση του συνολικού  |

|   | του ρόλου των δημόσιων μεταφορών | επιπέδου εξυπηρέτησης των δημόσιων μεταφορών. Υπηρεσίες μεταφοράς κατά παραγγελία, νέα σχέδια κυκλοφορίας λεωφορείων, υπηρεσίες μίνι λεωφορείων για το αστικό κέντρο. Το ΚΤΕΛ Ιωαννίνων (μοναδικός φορέας δημόσιας συγκοινωνίας) είναι ο βασικός εταίρος για την εφαρμογή των απαιτούμενων αλλαγών σύμφωνα με τις ανάγκες της πόλης.
Η δράση αυτή περιλαμβάνει επιμέρους έργα - όπως εξετάστηκαν και εγκρίθηκαν διεξοδικά μέσω του Σχεδίου Βιώσιμης Αστικής Κινητικότητας (ΣΒΑΚ) των Ιωαννίνων - όπως η επαναδρομολόγηση των λεωφορειακών γραμμών με τρεις (3) κεντρικούς άξονες και οκτώ (8) δρομολόγια που εξυπηρετούν το πυκνοδομημένο αστικό κέντρο και τις γύρω αστικές περιοχές. Περιλαμβάνει επίσης την αντικατάσταση του στόλου με ένα τοπικό σχέδιο για λεωφορεία και φορτιστές ηλεκτρικών οχημάτων για γρήγορη φόρτιση στην πόλη.
Ένα έργο-ορόσημο που επίσης υιοθετείται είναι η ανάπτυξη μιας νέας υπηρεσίας τελεφερίκ που συνδέει έως τώρα ασύνδετες μεταξύ τους περιοχές.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | Ζώνες χαμηλών έως μηδενικών εκπομπών: Ολοκληρωμένη και δίκαιη μετάβαση στις πιλοτικές ζώνες | Η παρούσα δράση καθορίζει τα βασικά βήματα για τη σταδιακή εφαρμογή ενός σχήματος LEZ/ ZEZ (ζώνες χαμηλών εκπομπών/ζώνες μηδενικών εκπομπών) σε τρεις πιλοτικές ζώνες της πόλης. Το κέντρο της πόλης, το νησί και η πανεπιστημιούπολη θα πρωτοστατήσουν και μέχρι το 2025 θα παρουσιάσουν επαναλαμβανόμενα αποτελέσματα στην υπόλοιπη πόλη. Μέχρι το 2028 και το 2030 όλο και περισσότερες περιοχές εφαρμόζουν περιορισμούς που σχετίζονται με τις εκπομπές αερίων του θερμοκηπίου και την κυκλοφορία των αυτοκινήτων. Έμφαση δίνεται στις πολιτικές που διασφαλίζουν μια δίκαιη μετάβαση, ενώ παράλληλα αναπτύσσεται ένα μεσοπρόθεσμο σχέδιο για την απαγόρευση των πετρελαιοκίνητων οχημάτων και όλων των οχημάτων εσωτερικής καύσης στην πόλη. Τα προτεινόμενα συστήματα UVAR (Κανονισμοί Πρόσβασης Οχημάτων σε Αστικές Περιοχές) είναι σύμφωνα με τη συνολική στρατηγική του ΣΒΑΚ για ένα κέντρο χωρίς αυτοκίνητα και μια πράσινη πανεπιστημιούπολη, ενώ εστιάζει επίσης στην αλλαγή των κανόνων στις περιοχές υψηλής και μεσαίας πυκνότητας δόμησης της πόλης.  |
|   | Λιγότερα αυτοκίνητα - καθαρότερα αυτοκίνητα | Η δράση αυτή βρίσκεται στο επίκεντρο της στρατηγικής για την αστική κινητικότητα και αποσκοπεί στην υποδοήθηση της συνολικής αστικής ανάπλασης με τον περιορισμό της παρουσίας των αυτοκινήτων και την ενίσχυση της ηλεκτροκίνησης με ένα ολοκληρωμένο και εκτεταμένο δίκτυο φορτιστών ηλεκτρικών αυτοκινήτων. Η δράση λαμβάνει υπόψη την προσέγγιση "αποφυγή-μετατόπιση-βελτίωση" και αναπτύσσει ένα νέο πρότυπο πολιτικής για την πόλη. Το δίκτυο αυτό συμβαδίζει με την παροχή κινήτρων στους χρήστες ιδιωτικών αυτοκινήτων για την ελαχιστοποίηση της χρήσης συμβατικών αυτοκινήτων/μοτοσικλετών ή/και την αντικατάσταση των οχημάτων τους με καθαρότερα οχήματα που λειτουργούν πλήρως ή εν μέρει με ηλεκτρική ενέργεια, όπως τα ηλεκτρικά οχήματα με μπαταρία ή τα υβριδικά ηλεκτρικά οχήματα plug-in.
Επιπλέον, η δράση αφορά την αντικατάσταση του στόλου βενζινοκίνητων και πετρελαιοκίνητων οχημάτων της πόλης με πράσινα οχήματα και άλλες πολιτικές και πρακτικές που περιορίζουν την κυκλοφορία οχημάτων με κινητήρα εσωτερικής καύσης στην πόλη.  |

|  Απορρίμματα και Κυκλική Οικονομία | Καθαρισμός και ενίσχυση των πλωτών μεταφορών | Η δράση αυτή αποσκοπεί στην αναβάθμιση του ρόλου των πλωτών μεταφορών με την προσθήκη υπηρεσιών και την ευκολότερη αντικατάσταση των πετρελαιοκίνητων σκαφών που εξυπηρετούν σήμερα τη σύνδεση μεταξύ της πόλης και του νησιού. Η λίμνη Παμβώτιδα μπορεί να γίνει ένας επιπλέον συγκοινωνιακός δίαυλος για τη διασύνδεση διαφόρων περιοχών της πόλης και του συνολικού πολεοδομικού συγκροτήματος των Ιωαννίνων, με περιορισμένη σήμερα πρόσβαση σε δημόσια μέσα μεταφοράς μέσω καθαρών, ηλεκτρικών και γρήγορων ταξί- σκαφών  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Πράσινη διαχείριση της εφοδιαστικής. Μια νέα εποχή στη μεταφορά εμπορευμάτων | Η δράση αυτή αποσκοπεί στη μείωση των εκπομπών των αστικών εμπορευματικών μεταφορών μέσω κανονιστικών συστημάτων που προωθούν σαφή χρονοδιαγράμματα, ενθαρρύνουν τα καθαρά οχήματα, προωθούν τα ποδήλατα μεταφοράς εμπορευμάτων (cargo bikes) και τις υποδομές που επιτρέπουν αυτή τη μετάβαση. Μικρότερα, καθαρότερα και πιο ήσυχα οχήματα θα παραδίδουν αγαθά στο πολεοδομικό συγκρότημα των Ιωαννίνων με την υποστήριξη των Κέντρων Αστικής Εφοδιαστικής και των πλατφορμών φόρτωσης/εκφόρτωσης. Η αντικατάσταση των βαν εσωτερικής καύσης και των φορτηγών που εισέρχονται στην πόλη θα έχει άμεσο αντίκτυπο στην τοπική υγεία και τη ρύπανση, ενώ παράλληλα και για τα οχήματα που εξυπηρετούν τη συνολική αλυσίδα logistics, η οποία θα επιτρέψει τη μείωση των εκπομπών πέρα από τα σύνορά μας.  |
|   |  Βελτίωση (ή "καθαρισμός") της συλλογής αποβλήτων | Η δράση αυτή αποσκοπεί στην αξιοποίηση της υφιστάμενης στρατηγικής για τα απόβλητα και στην αναδιοργάνωση της συλλογής απορριμμάτων με καθαρότερα και μικρότερα οχήματα.  |
|  Απορρίμματα και Κυκλική Οικονομία | Ξεχωριστή συλλογή χαρτιού & χαρτονιού | Σχεδιασμός, ωρίμανση και ανάπτυξη δικτύου χωριστής συλλογής χαρτιού  |

Καλούμε το Δημοτικό Συμβούλιο να υποστηρίξει αυτήν την προσπάθεια, εγκρίνοντας την ανάπτυξη και την υλοποίηση του προτεινόμενου Σχεδίου Δράσης, με την έγκριση της υποβολής του Κλιματικού Συμφώνου της Πόλης μας (Climate City Contract).

Επιλέγοντας να ακολουθήσουμε αυτήν την κατεύθυνση, δεν ανταποκρινόμαστε απλώς στην παγκόσμια κλήση για δράση κατά της κλιματικής αλλαγής, αλλά θέτουμε τις βάσεις για ένα βιώσιμο, προοδευτικό και ανθεκτικό μέλλον για την πόλη και τους κατοίκους των Ιωαννίνων.

Στον. κ. Κωνσταντίνο Καρατσώλη, Δικηγόρος Παρ’ Αρείω Πάγο - Δίκαιο Περιβάλλοντος και Πολεοδομίας, Συντονιστής της Επιστημονικής Ομάδας, ο οποίος ενημέρωσε διεξοδικά το σώμα και απάντησε στα υποβληθέντα ερωτήματα των Δημοτικών Συμβούλων.
Στους Δημοτικούς Συμβούλους και στους εισηγητές των παρατάξεων του Δημοτικού Συμβουλίου οι οποίοι έθεσαν ερωτήματα, προβληματισμούς και ζήτησαν εξηγήσεις οι οποίες εδόθησαν από τον Συντονιστή της Επιστημονικής Ομάδας και από την δημοτική αρχή.

Στη συνέχεια αφού ολοκληρώθηκε η διαδικασία των τοποθετήσεων και απαντήσεων από τη δημοτική αρχή όπως φαίνεται στο απομαγνητοφωνημένο 26 πρακτικό της 13.09.2023 συνεδρίασης η Πρόεδρος του Δημοτικού Συμβουλίου έθεσε σε ψηφοφορία και έγκριση την διατυπωθείσα εισήγηση.

Από τη διεξαχθείσα ψηφοφορία προκύπτει ότι:

Ο Δημοτικός Σύμβουλος κ. Πατσούρας Χρήστος δήλωσε ότι παρέχει λευκή ψήφο στην εισήγηση για τους λόγους που έχουν καταγραφεί στα απομαγνητοφωνημένα πρακτικά της συνεδρίασης.
Με τη διατυπωθείσα εισήγηση τάχθηκαν όλοι οι υπόλοιποι παρόντες Δημοτικοί Σύμβουλοι με την παρατήρηση των Δημοτικών Συμβούλων της παράταξης «ΓΙΑΝΝΕΝΑ ΠΟΛΙΤΕΣ ΓΙΑ ΤΗΝ ΑΝΑΤΡΟΠΗ» κ.κ. 1. Νάτση Λάζαρου, 2. Παπαχρήστου Βλάσιου για την ένταξη συγκεκριμένων δράσεων στο Σύμφωνο, ήτοι την:

Το Δημοτικό Συμβούλιο αφού άκουσε τα παραπάνω και είδε τις διατάξεις του άρθρου 65 του Ν. 3852/2010,

## ΑΠΟΦΑΣΙΖΕΙ ομόφωνα

Η υποβολή θα πραγματοποιηθεί βάσει των καθορισμένων χρονοδιαγραμμάτων, μέχρι τις 15.09.2023 στην πλατφόρμα της NetZeroCities που είναι ο επίσημος Φορέας της Ευρωπαϊκής Αποστολής και ακολούθως στην Ευρωπαϊκή Επιτροπή αφού θα έχουν ενσωματωθεί ενδεχόμενες παρατηρήσεις.
