# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Dresden in general

Dresden is a modern city with a population of around 572,240. Dresden is located in the south-eastern part of the Free State of Saxony, which borders on German territory (Bavaria, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, Brandenburg) as well as Czech and Polish territory. The layout of the city is characterised by the widening of the Elbe. Dresden is located in the border triangle of Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland on the banks of the Elbe. The foothills of the Eastern Ore Mountains, the Lusatian Granite Plateau and the Elbe Sandstone Mountains make up the attractive surroundings of the Saxon state capital. At 32,828 hectares, the city area is larger than average (fourth largest German city) and has differences in altitude of almost 200 metres. The urban structure has developed in a polycentric manner.

Today, Dresden is an important cultural city throughout Europe; its economy and population are developing dynamically. The city has the densest network of research institutions in Europe, is home to the only German university of excellence in the new federal states and is Europe's most important chip centre. Also known as the "Gateway to Central Europe", it maintains close, historically grown relations with neighbouring countries and is in intensive exchange with both eastern and western European cities.

## Population

As at 31.12.2023, Dresden had 572,240 main residents and a population density of 1,742 people per square kilometre. Dresden ranks 12th in the national comparison of major German cities. Dresden has a foreign population of approx. 12%. The population forecast 2023 extends to the year 2040, based on the population on 30 June 2023, according to which around 585,000 people would live in Dresden in 2030 and around 603,000 in mid-2040.

From January 1990 to 1998, the number of "population at the place of main residence" fell to just under 447,000 inhabitants due to emigration and relocation to neighbouring municipalities (see Figure 1-1). Out-migration and relocation to the surrounding area can be observed in two separate waves, with relocations to the surrounding area only occurring significantly in the mid-1990s as a result of increasing prosperity (particularly to enable home ownership). The incorporations carried out in 1997 and 1999 (25,483 people on 1 January 1999) partially or completely offset the aforementioned effects.

Since 1999, the population has been increasing again due to significant migration surpluses and re-urbanisation. Alongside Munich and Bonn, Dresden's population is one of the fastest growing in Germany with an annual increase of around 0.68 Percent. A slight acceleration in growth was observed until 2006. In 2006, there was even a slight surplus of births and the number of "population at the place of main residence" exceeded the 500,000 mark. As a result, the population fluctuated by more than 50,000 inhabitants within a decade. In addition to the slowdown in suburbanisation in the first years of the 21st century and the relatively high birth rate, the reason given for the (recently accelerated) increase is the second home tax, which led to the conversion of many second homes into main residences.

# Urban policy

City policy is shaped by the City Council, the Mayor and the six specialised Mayors (Deputy Mayors). A term of office lasts seven years. On 11 July 2022, the citizens of Dresden confirmed Dirk Hilbert (Unabhängige Bürger für Dresden e.V.) in his office as Mayor, which he has held since 2015, with 45.3 percent of the vote. The Dresden City Council is the elected representation of the citizens of Dresden. According to the Saxon municipal code, the Mayor chairs the City Council. The City Council lays down the principles for the administration of the City of Dresden and decides on all matters concerning the City of Dresden, unless the Mayor is responsible by law or the City Council has delegated certain matters to him. On 9 June 2024, the citizens of Dresden elected a new city council consisting of 70 honorary city councillors. The council held its first constituent meeting on 22 August 2024.

# Building stock

The building stock of the city of Dresden comprises around 70,000 buildings (see Figure 1-2). Of these, around 50 Percent are used for residential, 44 Percent for commercial and 1 Percent for public purposes. The use of the remaining 5 Percent cannot be precisely determined.

Figure 1-2: Building age structure of the flat in Dresden from 2017
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Abbildung 5-1: Baualterstruktur der Wohnungen in Dresden aus dem Jahr 2017

The majority of the flats were built before 1918. Many flats were also built in the GDR period from 1949 to 1990. After the reunification of Germany in 1990, extensive refurbishments were carried out in the building sector, which also greatly improved the energy efficiency of the buildings. The proportion of listed buildings in Dresden is around 10 Percent. As listed buildings can often only be refurbished to improve their energy efficiency at great expense, it is sensible and necessary to differentiate between listed and non-listed buildings in terms of energy refurbishment.

The energy supply of Dresden's buildings accounts for approx. 48 Percent of the total energy demand and approx. 43 Percent of GHG emissions (see Figure 2-1 and Figure 2-3). The energy supply of buildings is largely based on the final energy sources natural gas, electricity and district heating (see Figure 2-2). District heating, which in Dresden is based almost entirely on the use of natural gas by means of combined heat and power generation, currently contributes to the fact that the share of building energy supply in GHG is lower than in energy demand. In addition to GHG emissions, the high proportion of fossil fuels used to supply individual buildings and district heating leads to an import dependency of around 95 Percent (natural gas, heating oil) in the supply of heat to buildings.

In addition to the supply and supplier risks that can result from the high dependence on imports, Dresden is exposed to the price risks of fossil fuels on the international energy markets. This was particularly evident in the period from mid-2021 to mid-2023 for buildings supplied with natural gas and district heating. Future price risks arise primarily from CO2 pricing, which will increase, and further geopolitical conflicts. The use of local and climate-neutral energy sources will play a central role in realising a secure and affordable energy supply with the most stable prices possible in Dresden in the long term.

To achieve this, the energy requirements of buildings must be gradually reduced and - where possible and necessary - made fit for the use of climate-neutral energy sources. The greatest challenges exist in particular in the part of the existing building stock where energy efficiency is lower than in new buildings. This is often due to lower insulation and sealing standards, which result in higher heat losses, and heat distribution systems in buildings that require higher flow temperatures and are therefore less efficient when using renewable energies (RE). In new buildings, on the other hand, the German government has set the course for climate neutrality with the Building Energy Act (GEG 2024) with the minimum standard KfW55 and the requirement of at least  $65\%$  RE from 1 January 2024 in new construction areas.

# Green space and urban development

Dresden is one of the greenest cities in Europe. Around 62 Percent of the city's area is covered by forests and green spaces. The entire urban area of Dresden is characterised by numerous parks and green spaces, a rich variety of street trees, many allotment gardens and important cemeteries. Large forest and open spaces (Dresdner Heide, Altelbarm), a network of green spaces and avenues and over 400 streams as well as the Elbe, Weißeritz and Lockwitz rivers, together with the residential and commercial areas, also characterise a varied urban landscape.

Since 2000, there have been several floods of the century; heavy rainfall events are increasing, as are heat and drought, which have a negative impact on the city's ecological green network and the quality of life and health of its residents. As a green city with many green spaces, Dresden's urban area has a slight sink function (-0.64 tCO2/a) and also a large carbon reservoir. These must be preserved (damage to green infrastructure leads to higher emissions of the released carbon). The large watercourses should also contribute to the utilisation of heat sources (river heat pumps).

The cultural landscape of the Dresden Elbe Valley was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Programme in 2006. For many Dresdeners, the Elbe Valley area, which is exposed to views, must not be disturbed. Conversely, this has an impact on infrastructure projects such as bridge construction (as a result of which Dresden lost its World Heritage title) and/or the construction of wind turbines and ground-mounted photovoltaics.

The settlement area is made up of buildings and open spaces, recreational areas and cemeteries, so it cannot be equated with the actual degree of sealing, but it does represent the degree of urbanisation. Agricultural land in particular, on the other hand, is steadily decreasing. This is all the more problematic as this often involves high-quality soils. From a soil protection perspective, land consumption is still far too high and jeopardises the German government's goal of allowing only 30 hectares per day of land consumption by 2030. Broken down linearly to Dresden, the city is likely to take up around ten hectares a year. Aerial and satellite images are used to determine the actual land sealing across the entire area. From the long-term trend since 2010, it can be deduced that the heavily sealed areas (60 - 100 Percent) are increasing by around 46 hectares per year. This is taking place both at the expense of already moderately and lightly sealed areas with densification and gap development, as well as through the utilisation of open spaces. When land is utilised for development and sealing, particular emphasis is placed in urban land-use planning on space-saving construction and compliance with the specified floor area ratios of 1 and 2.

# Transport

Dresden has a transport system that is efficient in its basic features and also largely meets future requirements, especially for public transport and motorised traffic. After the political change in 1990, one of the greatest challenges was to integrate the Dresden conurbation into the European transport network. Over the last 30 years, enormous efforts have therefore been made in Dresden to expand the transport infrastructure, which has had a considerable impact on today's traffic flows in the Dresden urban area.

For example, the following should be emphasised:

# (Extension) construction of motorways e.g. Expansion of the A 4 motorway in the city of Dresden including the new Elbe bridge, new construction of the A 17 Dresden - Prague motorway including the corresponding motorway feeder roads, # Complete expansion of new S-Bahn lines, new construction of S-Bahn stops, renovation of Dresden main station and Neustadt station as well as numerous other stations and stops, Construction of Terminal II at Dresden Airport including better connections to the road network and the S-Bahn # Construction and renovation of Elbe bridges in the city area, # Renovation/expansion of efficient transport trains in the main urban road network and numerous other public transport lines, # Construction of new tram lines, renovation of main inner-city roads with special consideration of local public transport, # Facilities for cycling and pedestrian traffic were built and improved (e.g. section-by-section construction of the new Elbe bridge) B. construction of new sections of the Elbe cycle path, gradual expansion of cycle paths as part of the main road network, marking of cycle lanes and hard shoulders in the main road network, construction of numerous new cycle parking facilities, barrier-free design of the footpath network and traffic-calming actions).

Other projects realised include Realisation of underground car parks/parking garages in the city centre, development of a dynamic parking guidance system, expansion of the Dresden traffic control centre

and the guidance and information system, development of the coach parking guidance system Truck guidance concept and truck city map

Today, Dresden is structurally very well integrated into the national and international transport networks:

The city is directly connected to all neighbouring regional centres and metropolitan regions via the A 4, A 13 and A 17 motorways (Greater Berlin, Leipzig/Halle, Chemnitz and the Nuremberg metropolitan region, the Prague conurbation and Wroclaw).
The long-distance railway lines (Hamburg -) Berlin - Dresden - Prague - Vienna, Frankfurt am Main - Leipzig - Dresden and Hanover - Leipzig - Dresden are important in the long-distance rail network. The route to Wroclaw should also be mentioned.
In the regional rail network, the main and medium-sized centres are connected to the Dresden regional centre as a link to long-distance transport.
In the long-distance bus network, various transport companies offer regular connections from Dresden main station or Dresden-Neustadt to destinations in Germany and abroad.
The regional bus network covers the western part of the district of Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge, parts of the districts of Meißen and Bautzen and the City of Dresden.
The Elbe is a 1st class federal waterway (class Va) and connects Dresden with the inland ports of central Germany and the German North Sea ports.
Dresden has a commercial airport. In 2023, Dresden Airport had a passenger volume of around 921,400 passengers.
With the German routes D4 (Mittelland Route) and D10 (Elbe Cycle Route), Dresden is well connected in terms of supra-regional cycle traffic. With the city centre cycling concept, a classified municipal cycle route network with main, connecting and access routes has also been in place since 2007 and is being successively implemented in the city centre.
In terms of pedestrian traffic, Dresden is integrated into national hiking trails such as the Way of St James, as well as regional routes such as the Saxon Wine Trail or the Malerweg.

Traffic in Dresden has increased in connection with the dynamic urban development of recent years. The city has succeeded in absorbing this significant increase in traffic primarily through environmental transport (public transport, cycle paths and footpaths). Motor vehicle traffic fell slightly despite the growing population. The main reasons for this are: i) distances have been shortened due to the increase in population density and the supply infrastructure for daily needs has improved, ii) road infrastructure close to the city has been improved, iii) further expansion of the S-Bahn, iv) the public transport system has been continuously optimised, v) the cycling infrastructure is being gradually expanded, vi) the importance and share of cycling has increased considerably, which is also due to a change in image

The development of mobility and transport in recent years can be described on the basis of an excellent database that Dresden has at its disposal. One of the most important sources for this is the regular mobility survey "System repräsentativer Verkehrsbefragungen (SrV)" of the Technical University (TU Dresden). Dresden has been taking part in the survey, which is repeated every five years, since 1972. The most recent SrV survey took place in 2023. The results are expected at the end of 2024. In addition, a total of 42 permanent counting points spread across the entire city of Dresden automatically record motor vehicle traffic. Dresden's public transport operators collect data on the use of local public transport by systematically counting passengers. The following findings, among others, are derived from these and other statistics:

The Transport Development Plan (VEP) 2025plus shows the current planning for the desired transport development of Dresden up to 2025 and beyond. The plan was drawn up between 2009 and 2014 with the involvement of the city administration, interest groups, institutional and regional partners, politicians, scientists and citizens and was adopted by the city council on 20 November 2014. The European Commission in Brussels honoured the Dresden 2025plus transport development plan with 2nd place in the SUMP Awards 2014 and 2018, the European prize for sustainable urban mobility planning (Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan). The city administration is currently working on the Dresden Mobility Plan 2035+ (DMP2035+). (For further information, see 1.3).

# Economy

In 2022, Dresden was home to around 36,800 companies from a wide range of economic sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, hospitality, information and communication, financial and insurance services, real estate and housing, etc. The economy of the CoD is characterised by a correspondingly high level of industry diversity. A strategically important chip industry for the whole of Europe is located in the north of Dresden.

Following the economic and financial crisis in 2008/2009, positive economic development was recorded until 2019. In 2020, the effects of the coronavirus pandemic led to a remarkable 1.1 Percent decline in value added. The service sector accounted for the lion's share of value added in 2020 at around 77 Percent, with the manufacturing industry accounting for around 17 Percent and the construction industry around 6 Percent. Based on the figures available to date, it is not possible to determine whether there has been a recovery in value added over the past two years. However, it can be assumed that the value added of Dresden's companies will continue to rise. In the manufacturing sector in particular, this is generally associated with an impact on resource consumption and the associated GHG emissions.

The semiconductor industry is also of particular importance for Dresden's energy requirements. Well-known companies in this future-oriented industry and this important economic sector in Dresden include Infineon, Global Foundries, Bosch and possibly Jenoptik and ESMC in the future. The semiconductor industry has a relatively high electricity requirement for its production processes, with typical consumption processes including room cooling, process cooling water, compressed air generation, ultrapure water preparation, building vacuum and lighting in addition to the main production process. In 2018, the semiconductor industry already accounted for 16 Percent (approx. 420 GWh/a) of Dresden's electricity consumption in the public distribution grid. It also accounted for 33 Percent (approx. 1,397 GWh/a) of Dresden's natural gas consumption, although this is mainly due to power plant consumption for electricity generation directly at the factory site. Since then, the Bosch semiconductor plant has been added in 2021 and an expansion of the Infineon semiconductor plant is currently under construction. The semiconductor industry's electricity consumption from the public electricity distribution grid increased by 29 Percent to approx. 543 GWh/a between 2018 and 2022. The semiconductor industry's future expansion and relocation projects will result in further significant growth.

# 1.2 Current climate neutrality target in Dresden and current resolutions:

Dresden has been actively involved in climate protection for many years and set an important course for sustainable development at an early stage. As early as the 1990s, the city began networking at an international level and formulating ambitious climate targets. Through continuous actions, such as the preparation of climate protection reports and the establishment of the climate protection office, concrete steps were taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Dresden's most important milestones on the road to climate-friendly urban development are listed below.

The Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Plan (IEuKK) from 2013 represents the City of Dresden's current resolutions on climate protection. The IEuKK set Dresden the target of reducing GHG emissions by 10% every five years from 2005 to 2030. Since 2013, the framework conditions, technological standards and market conditions have changed considerably (including developments in gas and energy prices and CO2 pricing) and awareness of advancing climate change and its social consequences has increased enormously. Against this background, the update of the Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan (IEuKK) from 2013 was initiated by the City Council resolution on motion A0011/19 (SR/007/2020) "Update of the climate protection goals of the City of Dresden" of 30 January 2020. The 2020 city council resolution set the goal of climate neutrality well before 2050. This was the first time that a concrete target for green house gas neutrality was set and a political mandate for achievable green house gas neutrality was introduced. Climate protection was named as a task of the highest priority, which should go hand in hand with municipal welfare and the social compatibility of actions.

In addition to the application for the EU mission, which was initiated by the city administration, the 2035 target for Dresden's climate neutrality was demanded in 2022 via a citizens' petition by Dresden Zero.

Dresden recognised the urgency and the objective was specified in the City Council resolution on V1818/22 (SR/045/2022) of 15 December 2022 "Decision on the admissibility of the DresdenZero citizens' petition: Climate neutrality for Dresden by 2035". (This is not a resolution).

Since 2020, the city administration has been working on updating the local climate protection concept, taking into account the political decisions and requirements as well as the findings and knowledge transfer from the EU city mission. The Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Plan (IEK) was available in January 2024. This was confirmed by the top management on 20 February 2024 and is now available for political approval by the City Council.

# Municipal heat planning

CoD has set itself the goal of making the complex transformation process towards an affordable, secure and climate-neutral heat supply manageable and creating planning security for all stakeholders involved by means of municipal heat planning. The result is the municipal heat planning with a corresponding action portfolio for implementation. Parallel processes, particularly in the area of the municipal energy supplier SachsenEnergie AG, and different perspectives of the urban society are brought together. This dovetailing of concepts relevant to energy and climate protection is essential and is to be ensured in particular through coordinated strategic network planning across all energy networks. This also includes a revision and concretisation of the future expansion and densification area for district heating on the basis of the heat transformation plan, as well as the integration of findings from the process of the gas grid area transformation plan and the electricity grid expansion plan.

# Dresden Mobility Plan (SUMP)

Parallel to the update of the IEK, the current Transport Development Plan 2025plus, which was adopted by the City Council in 2014, is currently being updated. The new plan is entitled Dresden Mobility Plan  $2035+$  (DMP  $2035+$ ). More recent city council resolutions and changes to the general conditions are being incorporated into this update process. These include the Clean Air Plan, the Green City Plan, a CO2 reduction in the transport sector, "Vision Zero", the implementation of the cycling concept and the pedestrian transport strategy as well as a target of 30 Percent public transport share adopted by the city council.

The DMP  $2035+$  is being developed in three phases. Phase I Objectives: Analysis and evaluation and definition of new key objectives; Phase II Scenarios: Fields of action and proposed actions, drafting development scenarios with evaluation of target achievement, drafting a preferred scenario with actions. Phase III Concept development: Mobility strategy for the period up to 2035 and beyond, drawing up actions up to 2035 in an action plan.

The dovetailing of the IEK with the DMP2035+ is coordinated through strategic cooperation. The balancing of GHG emissions in the DMP 2035+ is carried out in accordance with the BISKO standard in order to balance congruently with the IEK. The starting year here is 2018 because 2018 serves as the year of analysis for the DMP 2035+ and data for both the transport model and CO2 emissions in the transport sector were already available at the time the concept was commissioned. For further information, see 3.2.2.

Der Prozess des Mobilitätsplanes 2035+

Integrated urban development concept:

The integrated urban development concept "Future Dresden 2035+" is the city-wide and overarching strategy of the City of Dresden for managing the city's development, geared towards the 2035 planning horizon. It identifies cross-thematic key objectives for urban development and localises important key projects and actions in the priority areas. It is created in collaboration with all of the city's specialist departments. On 2 March 2023, the City Council adopted the 2nd update of the paper.

The City of Dresden is aware of its responsibility for globally sustainable development and is committed to the United Nations 2030 Agenda with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By integrating the SDGs into the update of the INSEK, the City of Dresden is emphasising its contribution and the importance of the UN Sustainable Development Goals for further urban development. In the INSEK, the City of Dresden also commits itself to the visions of a "productive", "green" and "just city" of the New Leipzig Charter as a "compact city in an ecological network" (strategic model of the 2018 landscape plan, Environmental Agency of the City of Dresden, LandschaftsArchitekt Paul).

INSEK-Dresden-2035-Fortschreibung-2022.pdf

# Decarbonisation concept of SachsenEnergie AG

The conversion and expansion of the district heating system requires considerable financial and human resources, but these are limited. The individual potentials must therefore be examined and qualified for implementation step by step. Permanent monitoring of the economic feasibility of the individual decarbonisation potentials and the achievement of the target of complete decarbonisation of district heating in Dresden can be used to determine an optimal and constantly updated decarbonisation path. The basis for this continuous monitoring are scenarios and price time series from a fundamental model to map possible developments, which are adapted to the current political framework conditions, as well as a heat demand forecast for the city of Dresden.

To decarbonise district heating, SachsenEnergie AG is currently planning the implementation of various potentials, which are presented as milestones up to the year 2045. In order to achieve green house gas

neutrality by 2035, an acceleration scenario was also drawn up, which forms the basis for the greenhouse gas reduction pathway presented in the IEK.

Figure 1-4CO $_2$  reduction path in the acceleration scenario until complete decarbonisation by the end of 2035 in thousand tCO $_2$  per year

Further explanations of the decarbonisation strategy can be found in 6.1.

# Climate change adaptation concept:

The IEK forms an interface with many other CoD planning strategies. Above all, this includes the climate change adaptation concept currently being developed under the leadership of the Environment Agency. The climate change adaptation concept describes how climatic changes affect the natural resources in Dresden and what risks this poses for the urban space and for those living, working and visiting the city. The main areas of action are the water balance in the city, the vitality of urban greenery and human health. For these key areas of action, the potential risks are identified at neighbourhood level and actions are developed to reduce the risks and thus make the city more resilient to the impacts of climate change. In the implementation section, target group-specific recommendations are given on how the climate adaptation measures can be effectively implemented. Completion of the climate adaptation concept is planned for 2024. The climate adaptation concept also incorporates existing project results from climate change adaptation projects.

An overview can be found here: Adapting to the climate | City of Dresden

# Heat action plan:

The City of Dresden is currently drawing up a heat action plan to prevent health consequences and to respond to the increasing heat stress in the summer months as a result of climate change. This takes into account comprehensive intervention measures for health protection. Behavioural and situational preventative actions are intended to reduce heat stress and UV exposure and prevent damage to health. The heat action plan shows which municipal facilities are involved and when which actions take effect.
#

#

The content of the Heat Action Plan is based on the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO). The German ad hoc working group "Health-related adaptation to climate change" (AG GAK) translated and adapted the recommendations for Germany, which in turn form the basis for the Dresden Heat Action Plan. The following key topics are being developed: Central coordination and interdisciplinary cooperation, Utilisation of the heat warning system, Information and communication, Reduction of indoor heat, Special attention to at-risk groups, Preparation of health and social systems, Long-term urban planning and construction, Monitoring and evaluation of actions.

The heat action plan is drawn up by the Office for Health and Prevention. However, heat protection for health is a cross-sectional task. Therefore, other offices and institutions of the City of Dresden are involved in the formulation of actions and in addressing groups of people affected by heat.

# Clean air plan:

The updated clean air plan came into force in Dresden on 4 April 2019. The new clean air plan is a continuation of the 2011 clean air plan and became necessary because limit values continued to be exceeded, primarily due to the deficits that had become known in diesel vehicles. The clean air plan contains a large number of actions that are intended to contribute to an improvement in air quality. For example

The modes of transport of the environmental alliance are further promoted,
car park management expanded,
traffic organisation actions are taken for highly congested road sections or,
as on Königsbrücker Straße, structural adjustments have been made.

Current Clean Air Plan | City of Dresden

# Green City Plan:

As in many urban centres in Germany, the limit values for air pollutants for the protection of human health have been exceeded in the city of Dresden in recent years. The federal government's immediate action programme "Clean Air 2017 - 2020" provided the opportunity to intensify previous efforts to improve the environmental situation in the growing city of Dresden. The Green City Plan was developed for this purpose. This plan builds on existing plans in the areas of air pollution control, mobility and climate protection and develops them further. The Green City Plan of the City of Dresden contains 10 key measures with 17 individual measures, which were assessed in terms of their effectiveness, costs and feasibility.

# Smart City Strategy:

Dresden's climate strategy is flanked by a smart city strategy and other European smart city and lighthouse projects. In 2019, the City of Dresden, in partnership with co-initiator Technische Universität Dresden, was selected as part of the Smart Cities model projects to utilise the opportunities offered by

information and networking technologies in the interests of sustainable and integrated urban development. Dresden is already one of the six most digitally advanced cities in Germany. Digital applications and concepts are intended to further strengthen Dresden: the Smart City pilot project aims to create intelligent neighbourhoods with a higher quality of life, participation and sustainability. Specifically, the Smart City Strategy formulated goals, Fields of action and action plans for the Smart City Dresden model project. It was developed by EB IT together with the WISSENSARCHITEKTUR Laboratory of Knowledge Architecture (TU Dresden), with the participation of experts from various specialist departments and relevant stakeholder groups from civil society, business and science. The actions proposed for implementation include the following projects:

Cleema App: Digital platform to motivate sustainable behaviour in the urban population
Environmental monitoring: creation of a digital 3D city twin to predict severe weather events, among other things
Traffic management system: Intelligent integration of transport infrastructures and intermodal mobility
Strategic maintenance management: condition assessment, planning and maintenance of urban infrastructure
Energy self-sufficient living: Conception of an energy self-sufficient residential neighbourhood for the east of Dresden
Smart energy model: peak load management in the vicinity of the Friedrichstadt municipal hospital
Open Data: Provision and utilisation of open data for residents, business and administration
Smart participation: digital participation concept and citizen lab
Digital sports park: Digital solution for space and utilisation management in the Ostagehege sports park.

The smart applications and concepts developed during the project period from the beginning of 2022 to the end of 2026 should make a decisive contribution to establishing Dresden as a city worth living in and can be used by other cities throughout Germany.

07 07 Smart-City-Strategie v.5.16FINAL.pdf (dresden.de)

In addition to the specialist plans just mentioned, there are a number of other specialist strategies that contribute to the work of climate protection and are coordinated across departments.

# EU-HorizonEurope Mission Projects:

The smart city and climate protection and energy measures of the City of Dresden are flanked and financed by European lighthouse projects from the so-called Horizon Mission Calls, the results of which are also incorporated into the further development of the CCC.

NEUTRAL PATH: Path to climate neutrality through low-risk and fully replicable positive clean energy districts:

A central project of the City of Dresden is the conception of an energy self-sufficient residential neighbourhood based on a geothermal energy management system in the east of Dresden as a continuation of sector coupling using the example of a pilot neighbourhood. The aim of the pilot project is to draw

up a concept for the complete planning of the energy system, the refurbishments and the new buildings as well as the model equipment of a property with the new type of energy system based on active façade elements. These pilot projects serve as Field tests, which act as neighbourhood-based "germ cells" for GHG-neutrality, test sites and are to be extended to the remaining urban areas. For more information, see Part B 3.2 Module B-2.

Mobilities4EU: New mobility solutions for climate neutrality in EU cities

The strategic project MOBILITIES for EU aims to showcase Dresden's pioneering achievements in the field of climate-neutral urban mobility in Europe. The electrification, automation and connectivity of transport are central themes for achieving this goal, with user-orientated innovative concepts for passenger and freight transport being investigated and cost-efficient and practicable solutions developed that make a significant contribution to the transition towards climate neutrality. A citizens' laboratory for urban mobility is intended to create barrier-free options that bring people together and thus ensure inclusive and collaborative progress. For more information, see Part B 3.2 Module B-2.

U_CAN: Associating Ukrainian cities to the climate-neutral and smart cities mission

The City of Dresden is also a partner in a knowledge transfer project between European mission cities and Ukrainian pilot cities. These are to benefit from the experience of European mission cities and be introduced to the objectives of the European Green Deal via various knowledge transfer formats, such as online workshops, peer2peer learning and joint visits and conferences.

https://www.ucan-ukraine.eu/

EnAct4CleanCities (Mission Pilot Call-Cohort 3):

The cities of Leipzig and Dresden are currently in the process of drawing up municipal heat plans to ensure a climate-neutral heat supply in the future. Various dialogue formats are being used in Dresden to involve citizens in this process at an early stage. In addition, innovative energy counselling and smart participation tools are intended to involve and activate citizens in the heating transition. Together with Leipzig, Dresden will develop these tools and processes and apply them in the pilot project together with relevant players and stakeholders.

# 1.4 Development of CCC and integration of Dresden climate targets:

# 1.4.1 Basics CCC:

As shown above, the City of Dresden has strategies relevant to the CCC that have been developed in various participatory processes and are being implemented in pilot actions and innovative projects. The preparation of the Climate City Contract in Dresden overlaps in terms of content and timing with the
#

Dresden action plan for climate neutrality in 2030

#

updating of relevant city strategies and integrates these into the Action and Investment Plan. The content of the Action Plan is based on the Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Concept (IEK) as the overarching climate protection strategy of the City of Dresden. The Climate Protection and Adaptation Unit is responsible for updating the plan. The creation of the CCC is coordinated across departments in the Office for Urban Strategy, International Affairs and Citizenship within the Mayor's portfolio.

# 1.4.2 Integration of Dresden climate targets and Ambition 2030:

In all resolutions on Dresden's climate strategy, the City of Dresden is clearly committed to the process of transformation and the goal of becoming a climate-neutral city. As part of the update of the Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Plan (IEK) adopted in 2020, the initial situation in Dresden was quantified and described by means of a comprehensive inventory. The basis for the objectives in the IEK and thus in the CCC is the commitment to a greenhouse gas-neutral city.

In the municipal context in particular, there are different definitions compared to the global or national context due to different accounting boundaries and local requirements. The IEK correctly uses the term GHG-neutrality for the target. This refers in particular to the energy requirements for heat, electricity and production processes as well as the energy sources and infrastructures used. Based on this initial analysis, the Dresden Climate Protection Concept (IEK) considers three scenarios for achieving GHG-neutrality: two target scenarios, in accordance with the City Council resolution (V1818/22) to achieve GHG-neutrality by 2035 and alternatively by 2040, as well as a reference scenario in which the current federal policy targets are achieved by 2045. The results of the potential analyses have been incorporated into the possible reduction paths for the three previously defined scenarios. As a result, the minimum target of GHG-neutrality by 2040 is proposed in accordance with the reduction path of the 2040 target scenario. The background to this is that achieving the target of climate neutrality by 2035 is not feasible even in the 2035 target scenario with the existing potential and implementation options as well as the external framework conditions. Specifically, for the reduction path presented in the IEK, this means an  $80\%$  reduction by 2030 compared to 1990 (as an interim target for EU city emissions) or absolute emission values of -2,019,200 tCO2 $_{\text{eq}}$  compared to 2018. This would leave 1,586,900 tCO2 $_{\text{eq}}$  in 2030, which would be reduced to 329,900 tCO2 $_{\text{eq}}$  by 2040, which is defined as the GHG neutrality level for Dresden (Figure 1-5). The target covers the entire urban area and is set as a fixed value regardless of population growth. In addition, there is a  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  budget that is checked for compliance as part of monitoring and controlling.

The city-wide target is thus set for 2040, with an acceleration to 2035 if possible. From today's perspective, the framework conditions are not good enough for green house gas neutrality by 2030. This would require:

Availability of renewable electricity by 2030
Concerns about green hydrogen for industry and peak-load power plants in the urban area by 2030
Sufficient personnel capacities in craft businesses, planning offices, companies and administration to implement the necessary actions and projects by 2030.

In parts of Dresden, neighbourhoods and various locations could already be greenhouse gas neutral before 2035 and serve as Field tests that can then achieve a scaling effect. These include the Neutral Path projects and other city neighbourhoods as well as parts of the city administration.

Zielvorgabe energiebedingte THG-Emissionen (Stadtgebiet Dresden)
Figure 1-5Controllable target values for setting the reduction path

In contrast to the Eol for the application for the EU City Mission at the beginning of 2022, in which the target was stated as a significant reduction before 2050, the City of Dresden now has precise scenarios for the reduction pathway with the IEK at the beginning of 2024.

According to the considerations set out in the IEK, a GHG-neutral city of Dresden by 2030 cannot be realised as a municipality alone. It also requires changes to the framework conditions at European, federal and state level as well as the active participation of all companies, stakeholders, initiatives and associations as well as the population and their acceptance of corresponding actions.

# 1.4.3 Participation and stakeholders

Climate protection is a task for the entire city and requires actions from all city stakeholders from politics, business and science, from associations and interest groups and from citizens. For the city administration, this means on the one hand a stronger interdepartmental approach to the planning, implementation and evaluation of municipal actions. On the other hand, it is also important to promote the city-wide approach with regard to the participation and activation of important stakeholders and citizens. Concrete steps have already been taken with the establishment of a citizen participation statute adopted in 2019. The purpose of these statutes is to inform residents in good time about projects of the City of Dresden and to support citizens in preparing and submitting a recommendation for a decision by the City Council, the Mayor or the councils at the public level. Digital/online information is also provided on various citizen participation procedures in the City of Dresden and on current topics and dates.

The participation of relevant stakeholders is and was a central element in the creation of specialised plans (see 1.3.). The following stakeholder groups and participation processes are in focus for the area of climate protection and energy supply:

Participation: Development and preparation of the Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan (IEK):

As part of the development of the IEK, public participation was focussed on the following committees and networks.

Scientific Advisory Board: The Scientific Advisory Board supported the expert work in the IEK by providing expert, scientific advice and contributing relevant experience, projects or innovative ideas to the process. It was made up of eight representatives from the scientific community and one former representative of the city administration. At the five meetings, the members contributed their expertise in the fields of energy, transport, climate protection, economics and social sciences. One representative of the advisory board acted as a representative for the Round Table. The "Heat Planning Competence Group" was founded by some members of the Advisory Board, supplemented by other experts, to discuss specialised issues relating to municipal heat planning.
Round Table: In order to involve Dresden's diverse stakeholders in the IEK process, a Round Table was set up as a communication and discussion platform. The aim of the Round Table was to communicate and discuss the status of the IEK, continuously coordinate actions, recognise potential conflicts at an early stage and find solutions. The members were able to contribute their own ideas and projects and make recommendations. Around 35 representatives from Dresden City Council, the city administration, the business community, municipal investment companies, associations, institutions and initiatives took part in the five meetings of the Round Table. In spring 2023, it was decided to focus the content of the Round Table's work more strongly in specialised

working groups. This included the topics of municipal heat planning, renewable energies and climate-neutral building stock.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 1-7Composition of the Round Table to support the IEK process

Public participation: Idea finder: In the second half of 2021, citizens contributed their ideas, projects and suggestions for climate protection in Dresden and located them on a digital city map. We were looking for ideas that are as concrete and realisable as possible and contribute to reducing GHG emissions. The total of 412 ideas can be viewed on a map and in full in the call for ideas finder140. Keywords were assigned to analyse the ideas. A competition was organised for ideas that had already been worked out in concrete terms or that could possibly be implemented. Of the competition entries submitted, the ten best were selected by the climate protection team, taking into account criteria such as the concreteness of the idea, the climate protection effect and the transferability to other locations. The participants of the best competition ideas were invited to a workshop at the town hall in September 2022. Ideas with suitable content were considered as part of the development of the IEK. Many ideas were also forwarded to the relevant specialist departments in the city administration.

Climate protection forum: In July 2021, the public climate protection forum "Aufbruch! With new energy for the climate" was held as a video conference in Dresden. This marked the start of public participation in updating the IEK. Five themed workshops were held together with stakeholders from the administration, (utility) companies, associations, the private sector, schools, etc.

Participation of children and young people: Children from six different schools or after-school care centres in grades 3 and 4 were involved in the IEK by the Wirbelwind play mobile run by Outlaw gGmbH, initiated by the CoD's children and youth officer. Around 150 children took part via a questionnaire and in-depth workshops, which included a mental journey into the future, and described or drew their wishes, ideas and demands for the city and gave them to a symbolic dove for its "flight" to the town hall. For example, concrete projects were named that could be implemented directly in the schools and after-school care centres, such as the installation of solar panels on the roof, the economical use of energy, water and paper, better waste separation and fewer parent taxis. In the first half of the 2022/2023 school year, the Dresden Environmental Centre held two workshops in seven classes at different schools in grades 6, 7, 9 and 10. There is interest in a youth forum and other workshop formats in which the ideas and topics are taken up and explored in greater depth. In order to tackle more concrete solutions and projects in everyday school and private life, project days with specific tasks will be necessary in the future to deal with individual topics in greater depth.

Participation: Development and creation of the Dresden Mobility Plan (DMP) 2035+:

The VEP 2025plus was drawn up between 2009 and 2014 with the involvement of the city administration, interest groups, institutional and regional partners, politicians, scientists and citizens and was adopted by the city council in 2014. In 2021, work began on updating the VEP 2025plus and the planning process for the Dresden Mobility Plan 2035+ was launched. This is also being developed by experts from the city administration and external planners. It will be scientifically supported and discussed and agreed in various committees. In order to incorporate the diverse interests of urban society, the participation of Dresden's citizens is of great importance. In addition to the participation of the general public, there is a special format for this - the Dresden MOBIdialogue 2035+.

Scientific Advisory Board: This body provides interdisciplinary advice from scientists with different specialised profiles.
Neighbours/region working group: Here, coordination takes place with neighbouring municipalities and districts, planning associations, public transport providers and state institutions with the aim of effective regional networking on mobility issues.
The city council and the technical committee decide on the development goals, the preferred scenario and the final mobility plan DMP2035+.
Citizens: Here, the MOBIdialogue in particular is used as a platform to actively involve citizens and relevant stakeholders in the design of the Dresden Mobility Plan 2035+. This discussion forum comprises a total of 62 people: randomly selected Dresden residents as well as representatives from science, politics, associations, clubs and institutions. Together, they think about and discuss future mobility in Dresden and prepare decisions. The Dresden MOBIdialogue 2035+ (dresden.de) - for more information, see 4.1.3.
Mobil-O-Mat: With the interactive participation tool Mobil-O-Mat, all Dresden residents and people from the region were able to plan their future mobility for the state capital from 5 February to 17 March 2024. The results of all future plans made using the Mobil-O-Mat will be incorporated into the Dresden Mobility Plan 2035+. For more information, see 4.2.
Field tests: Field tests will also be carried out during the planning phase of the Mobility Plan 2035+. These will take place in addition to the aforementioned participation structures. Field tests are temporary and easily transferable transport experiments. They are used to test how different actions work. (What traffic benefits, technical effort and acceptance by road users do they contribute to the 14 key objectives for mobility in Dresden?) The findings will be incorporated into the development and political decision-making process for the Mobility Plan 2035+.

# Ongoing participation process as part of municipal heat planning:

The planning of sustainable heat supply concepts involves the participation of those affected in order to take appropriate account of local needs and requirements and to be able to communicate the plans to the population. With regard to municipal heat planning, there is great public interest in being involved in concrete developments so that necessary investments can be planned well in advance. The City of Dresden has therefore initiated a participation process under the leadership of the Climate Protection and Climate Change Adaptation Department. Many other offices and administrative units of the City of Dresden are also involved. STESAD GmbH is responsible for the general coordination, stakeholder participation and public relations work. SachsenEnergie AG is involved as the operator of the district heating network in Dresden and SachsenNetze is involved for the gas and electricity network with the aim of dovetailing the infrastructure planning as closely as possible in the development process. In addition, the involvement and integration of a large number of other important players (stakeholders) is planned.

Citizens: The core element of the participation process is the heat turnaround dialogues. These consist of two general events at Dresden City Hall and local events in the individual neighbourhoods. A kick-off event took place in April 2024. In autumn 2024, seven local dialogue events are planned with citizens, stakeholders and interested parties in selected urban areas. The aim of the local dialogue events is to present the results of the municipal heat planning to date and to discuss the actions and neighbourhood profiles that have been developed. A public dialogue event is planned for the beginning of 2025 to present the draft municipal heat planning for the City of Dresden.

# 2 Part A - Current status of climate protection

## 2.1 Module A-1 Baseline inventory of greenhouse gas emissions

### 2.1.1 GHG accounting method

The central element of monitoring the city's climate protection strategy is the city-wide energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory. This forms the basis for quantitative city-wide climate protection monitoring. Regular updates allow long-term developments in the use of energy sources, final energy consumption and GHG emissions to be identified. The GHG inventory is compiled and published by the Climate Protection and Adaptation Unit.

The BISKO methodology focuses on energy consumption and the resulting GHG emissions in the territory of the municipality. In particular, this makes the progress made in reducing energy demand in a municipality visible. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of climate protection, factors such as population growth, economic development and weather influences are taken into account in the form of further analyses. The balance makes major changes visible and shows trends, whereby small fluctuations cannot be clearly assessed as successes or failures of climate protection activities due to overlapping effects. The GHG inventory is a monitoring method at the top-down level. In addition to the GHG inventory, numerous potential studies in the area of buildings were carried out last year or are currently being carried out, which provide the basis for municipal heat planning and further area planning for RE. Based on this data, the actions for the action portfolio of the current IEK and the action programme to be continued have been and are being drawn up.

The last published GHG inventory covers the reporting year 2018, which is now far in the past, meaning that no current GHG inventory is available for the city of Dresden for the last three years. In 2024, the GHG inventory will be updated for the reporting years 2019-2022. This involves setting up a process with the help of external service providers that makes it possible to submit the balance sheet annually and according to fixed procedures. It should be noted that due to the availability of data and statistics, the current balance sheet can generally only be prepared for the year before last (e.g. in 2024, the balance sheet year 2022).

Since the 2017 reporting year, the state capital of Dresden, like many German cities and municipalities, has been reporting using the municipal reporting system (BISKO). Prior to this (until 2016), GHGs were accounted for using a separate methodology, which was based on BISKO but used its own emission factors in some cases. At that time, transport was also accounted for according to the national and not the territorial principle.

CoD uses the Climate Alliance's climate protection planner to calculate GHG emissions in accordance with BISKO. The calculation logic is based on the territorial principle - only the emissions in the urban area are considered. By using the same methodology, it is possible to compare local authorities in Germany with each other. In contrast to the presentation up to 2016, the BISKO balance sheet is no longer recorded per inhabitant, but in absolute GHG emissions. The published figures are also not weather-adjusted. This is provided for in the BISKO system.

In the BISKO system, the private households, trade/commerce/services/other and industry sectors as well as municipal facilities are included in the GHG inventory as sub-sectors of stationary energy and the transport sector. For the categorisation according to the GHG Protocol, the "stationary energy" sector corresponds to the "buildings" sector. The private households, trade/commerce/services/other and
#

#

industry and municipal facilities sectors include the energy requirements of buildings, while the industry sector is primarily characterised by expenditure on process energy.

The GHG emission factors are taken from the GEMIS database and calculations by the ifeu Institute and made available to the municipalities via the "Klimaschutzplaner (Software)" software,

In the context of the municipal GHG inventory in Dresden, commercial energy requirements are summarised under the generic term "economy", which includes the industrial and commercial/trade/services sectors and others (e.g. public facilities that are not municipally owned). The subdivision of the industry and trade/commerce/services sectors was defined in consultation with the Dresden energy supplier when the Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Plan (IEuKK) was drawn up in 2013. However, it should be noted that this categorisation no longer fully corresponds to the current data from the supplier. It is therefore necessary to revise the categorisation in order to be able to make more precise differentiations. The differentiation between energy consumption in the commercial/trade/service and industrial sectors is primarily based on the supply tariffs, whereby the industrial sector is predominantly considered a large consumer and the differentiation is based on load band measurement. Despite the necessary reworking, the breakdown into the various sectors and areas represents additional information to the actual balance of urban GHG emissions. It is important to note that this breakdown has no influence on the total sum of final energy requirements and GHG emissions, but rather serves to provide detailed insights into the specific energy requirements of the various economic sectors. In the course of updating the GHG inventory in 2024, a new system for differentiating between these two sectors is to be agreed with the energy supplier as the data provider.

# 2.1.2 The published GHG inventory to 2018

The current public GHG inventory shows the energy requirements and GHG emissions for the last five years. The following figures show the diagrams for final energy consumption (Figure 2-1) and GHG emissions (Figure 2-3) for the years 2013 to 2018 according to the BISKO methodology.

Final energy consumption in the city of Dresden barely fell between 2013 and 2018 (-2.5 % in 2018 compared to 2013). In the energy and green house gas inventory, there is a lack of clarity regarding non-pipeline-based energy sources in the stationary sector (heating oil, coal, liquid gas). To determine this consumption, which accounts for around  $4\%$  of energy consumption, data from district chimney sweeps is used, which is reported to the state office (LfULG) every five years and analysed there. The latest data from 2015 is shown in the balance sheet. Due to a lack of more recent data available from the City of Dresden in 2022, a constant number of combustion plants is taken into account in the balance sheet years up to 2018. The integration of more recent data could lead to a reduction in consumption, as the replacement of old heating systems with new ones and the associated efficiency gains are not taken into account in the figures shown here. This also has an impact on the GHG emissions shown below, as oil and coal heating systems are generally replaced with gas boilers or renewable energy systems, thereby reducing the GHG emissions caused. However, the trend shown of almost constant energy consumption is also accompanied by an average population growth of  $1\%$  per year. The largest share of energy consumption is in the business sector (trade and industry, as well as public, non-municipal facilities). This sector accounts for a total of  $47\%$  of final energy demand. Private households account for  $28\%$  of the final energy demand. Municipal buildings account for approx.  $2\%$ . This means that the stationary sector accounts for approx.  $77\%$  of the city's total final energy demand. The mobility/transport sector accounts for  $23\%$  of the final energy demand. The building energy sector requires approx.  $46\%$  of final energy. Process energy accounts for  $29\%$  of the city's final energy demand.

The energy sources used in the city (see Figure 2-2) are mainly natural gas with a share of  $34\%$ , electricity with a share of approx.  $24\%$  and district heating with  $15\%$  of the total final energy demand. It should be noted that almost  $100\%$  of district heating is generated from natural gas in CHP plants. The local electricity mix is also characterised to a large extent by natural gas CHP. Fossil fuels account for  $23\%$  of the city's final energy demand. Renewables are still of minor importance, accounting for  $1\%$  of the heat supply (based on the data sources available to the City of Dresden).

Figure 2-3GHG emissions for the years 2013 to 2018 of the Dresden GHG inventory (BISKO)

GHG emissions in the city of Dresden fell slightly between 2013 and 2018 (-7.5% in 2018 compared to 2013). In 2018, total GHG emissions amounted to approx. 3.5 million tonnes CO2_eq. However, the trend shown of only slightly decreasing GHG emissions is also accompanied by an average population growth of 1% per year. The largest share of emissions is in the business sector (trade and industry, as well as public, non-municipal facilities). This sector accounts for a total of 51% of final energy demand. This is primarily due to the high electricity demand of the economy, especially industry, and the comparatively high specific emission factor of the reference electricity. Private households account for 24% of the final energy demand. Municipal buildings account for approx. 2%. This means that the stationary sector accounts for approx. 77% of the city's total final energy demand. The mobility/transport sector accounts for 23% of the final energy demand. The building energy sector is responsible for approx. 41% of GHG emissions. Process energy accounts for 34% of GHG emissions. District heating, which in Dresden is based almost entirely on the use of natural gas by means of combined heat and power generation, currently contributes to the fact that the share of building energy supply in GHG is lower than in energy demand.

The energy sources causing GHG emissions in the city (see Figure 2-4 : Greenhouse gas emissions 2018 in tCO2,eq broken down by energy source and sectorFigure 2-4Figure 2-2) are mainly electricity with a share of approx.  $40\%$ , natural gas with a share of  $26\%$  and district heating with  $7\%$  of total emissions in the city area. It should be noted that almost  $100\%$  of district heating is generated from natural gas in CHP plants. The local electricity mix is also characterised by high proportions of natural gas CHP. Fossil fuels for mobility account for  $23\%$  of the city's emissions.

Figure 2-5 Development of GHG emissions in the city of Dresden (different accounting methods, since 2017 BISKO)

Emissions were significantly reduced from 1990 until the 2000s. This is largely due to the switch from coal to natural gas for heating and district heating. The construction of the "Nosserer Brücke" combined heat and power plant, which went into operation in 1995 and replaced the old lignite-fired power plant, made a major contribution to this. The reduction in GHG emissions has stagnated since the 2010s, although this is also due to population growth (see Figure 1-1), which overshadowed the savings effects.
#

#

In contrast to other sectors, GHG emissions in the mobility sector in both Germany and Dresden have remained more or less the same since the 1990s. This is largely due to the fact that although engines have become more efficient, the efficiency gains have been eliminated as rebound effects due to growing transport performance and a sharp increase in vehicle weight and power. In addition, more than 93 Percent of the final energy demand for transport is still covered by fossil fuels (as of 2019).

It should be noted that the development of past years cannot necessarily be compared, as the balancing in the respective years is based on different methods and the results differ in some cases (a comparison of the methodology up to 2016 and BISKO from 2017 onwards showed a difference of approx. 3 t/EW/a). The two methodological approaches are therefore analysed in parallel for the available years in Figure 2-5 are shown in parallel for the available years. The collection of data in the past according to the BISKO methodology will be examined in 2024. This can be done to the extent that historical data is available in full (possibly going back to 2010). The originally published balances should not be overwritten, but the difference between the two methods should be clarified and the development trend should be easier to understand.

However, it should be noted that the reference values (1990 and 2005) used as a basis in the following chapters of the Action Plan for the Dresden target have a different methodological approach than the current baseline inventory. These differences can no longer be corrected from this point in time. The development is therefore also characterised by a proportion of the change in methodology (approx. 1.5 t/EW/a for the stationary sector and approx. 1.2 t/EW/a for the transport sector).

## Subsidiary balance sheet agriculture

Methane and nitrous oxide are mainly produced by cattle during digestion. In agriculture, nutrient management (slurry, liquid manure, plastic fertiliser, liming) determines the level of GHG emissions. Water management can also be decisive. Drained moors and wetlands are a source of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . At present, the emissions from this Fields of action are not recorded in the urban balance sheet using BISKO. In an initial rough assessment, the IEK estimated GHG emissions of around 3,800 tonnes per year for livestock in 2020 and around 13,000 tonnes per year for agriculture (based on an agricultural area of 4,973 hectares). A brief methodological explanation can be found in 6.4. This means that the non-energy-related emissions for agricultural use are well below 20,000 tCO2 $_{\text{eq/a}}$ , which is very low compared to the current energy-related GHG emissions of more than 3 million tCO2 $_{\text{eq/a}}$ . In future, however, these GHG emissions will also play an increasing role in achieving GHG-neutrality in the urban area. It is planned to report these non-energy-related GHG emissions in the future as part of the GHG inventory.

## 2.1.3 Process for regularly updating the GHG inventory and expansion of emission sources

### 2.1.3.1 Process for regularly updating the GHG inventory

For the regular preparation of the annual green house gas inventory, the data stocks and recording system for the BISKO balance sheet and other subsidiary balances will be processed in 2024. Existing data and recording tables (Excel) will be used as part of the inventory processing. If necessary, the data collection tables are to be further developed, provided that the cost of further development does not exceed the cost of creating a new data collection system from scratch. Data recorded includes
#

O

Queries about energy demand and generation at the energy supplier (with the query centralised as far as possible),
Queries on energy requirements of the city administration,
Reports from chimney sweeps to the State Office for the Environment, Agriculture and Geology (LfULG), which collects the data tables on combustion sites every five years and makes them available to the CoD.

The review serves to provide orientation and identify the necessary documents and query tools for systematic and timely annual GHG balancing. In addition, it is planned to develop a proposal for continuous monitoring of energy consumption based on renewable energy sources, for which no continuous and comprehensive data set is currently available. However, their increasing use must also be reflected in the GHG inventory in order to visualise the switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

In order to drive forward the preparation and systematisation, questions about the data and its classification logic are to be discussed with the processors at energy suppliers and the municipal administration as part of a workshop. The aim is to find an agreed variant for recording and categorising the data in the logic of the climate protection planner (or BISKO methodology) for trade/commerce/services and others, industry, municipal facilities and private households. In addition, the workshop will be used to coordinate the necessary schedules and record them in a process overview for the annual preparation of the GHG inventory. This includes the duration of data delivery and the possible date of publication of the GHG inventory. Synergies are also to be created with the topic of GHG-neutral city administration (GHG inventory of the core administration) in order to avoid duplicate data queries. The development of the energy management system and the acquisition of new energy data software will also help to provide the information required for the GHG inventory in a timely manner.

## BISKO methodology and its limitations in GHG accounting

The BISKO methodology proves to be inadequate for the presentation of GHG-neutrality, as it is based exclusively on the recording of energy-based GHG emissions and ignores non-energy emissions from waste, wastewater, agriculture, industrial processes and product use. As a result, the methodological limitations mean that specific climate protection efforts, such as the local expansion of renewable energies for electricity supply, do not appear in the BISKO main balance sheet, as this is calculated exclusively with reference electricity. However, the majority of GHG emissions are recorded via the energy share, so that the BISKO method in its current form can sufficiently show the necessary GHG reductions for the coming years.

The system of the BISKO territorial balance is also limited, as it is not able to visualise emissions caused by Dresden's citizens outside the city area. This approach is only comprehensive if all territories use the same GHG accounting system. As things stand today, this is not yet the case.

## Necessity of additions through subsidiary balances

In view of these limitations, it is proposed to supplement the GHG inventory according to BISKO (main inventory) with additional secondary inventories. These secondary balances are intended to show specific developments that cannot be adequately taken into account in the main balance. The integration of secondary balances enables comprehensive top-down monitoring, which allows a more precise depiction of the sum of local climate protection activities. This initially includes

balance for emissions from waste,
Balance for local electricity mix,
Comparison of cumulative GHG emissions from 2018 with CO residual budget₂

Further subsidiary balances are to be added once sufficient data and methods for the municipal level have been clarified in order to be able to include other emission sources in the GHG inventory. It should also be noted that the municipal GHG inventory is not the sole indicator of successful climate protection activities in the city. Rather, a system of different assessment standards and levels is required in order to properly reflect the complexity of climate protection efforts.

## Outlook and further development

It can be assumed that the BISKO methodology will be further developed to enable municipalities to present GHG-neutrality in their municipal balance sheets. In this context, the CoD will actively participate in the Climate Alliance working groups and maintain an intensive dialogue with other municipalities and the developers of the climate protection planner. This committed participation should help to promote future adjustments to the methodology and thus enable improved and standardised mapping of climate protection measures at municipal level.

## 2.1.3.2 Subsidiary balances

## Shares of energy and non-energy emissions

Figure 2-6 shows an overview of the shares of energy and non-energy emissions in the national GHG inventory in Germany². This shows that energy-related emissions account for the largest share of GHG emissions, but that non-energy-related emissions must also be taken into account for GHG-neutrality. For a large city like Dresden, the proportion of energy-related emissions is likely to be even higher than the German average due to its urban character. However, there is no data on this that can be analysed at municipal level. Therefore, only the nationwide statistics can be used to assess the impact.

Figure 2-6Shares of energy and non-energy emissions at federal level

# Agriculture:

At present, emissions in the Fields of action of agriculture are not recorded in the urban balance sheet using BISKO. An initial rough estimate of emissions from this area was presented in the IEK. As a result, GHG emissions currently play a subordinate role compared to the city's total emissions. In the future, however, these GHG emissions will also have to be considered in order to achieve GHG-neutrality in the city. It is planned to report these non-energy-related GHG emissions in future as part of the GHG inventory. The methodology for this still needs to be analysed in more detail. However, the simple calculation of the climate protection planner based on federal key figures can be used as a minimum.

# Waste and wastewater:

The preparation of a GHG inventory for the waste sector in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol requires a systematic approach, taking into account emission scopes 1 and 3. This is necessary in order to obtain a complete picture of GHG emissions in the context of GHG-neutrality, as only energy-related emissions have been assessed in the municipal balance sheet to date.

With regard to the accounting framework, all direct GHG emissions caused by the direct incineration of waste or by landfills, although these hardly play a role in Germany any more, should be recorded. Indirect emissions from external sources, such as the production and disposal of products in waste, as well as transport in connection with waste management, should also be taken into account.

To date, there is no established and standardised methodology for balancing GHG emissions from waste in a municipal context. The BISKO methodology used for the municipal GHG inventory only takes into account the GHG emission factor of district heating or the local electricity mix for the possible use of residual waste for heat and electricity production. Assessment methods for GHG emissions resulting from other forms of utilisation or not from the local incineration of residual waste do not yet exist. A standardised methodology (analogous to the BISKO methodology or as a further development of it) must first be agreed at a higher level. Standardisation leads to comparability between municipalities
#

#

and makes it possible to use standardised assessment factors. In particular, definitions of the interfaces (spatial, organisational, municipal/commercial) are required. A complicating factor here is that the waste management sector operates in supra-regional structures after collection.

In addition to defining a standardised methodology, the comprehensive collection of data poses a major challenge. Due to the separate collection of the different types of waste and the commissioning of different waste disposal companies alone, the CoD does not have all waste quantities and transport routes. Only once the methodology and thus also the accounting framework have been clarified can it be checked which data is available in municipal hands or must be procured by adapting contracts or which data must be provided to the municipalities from the higher-level collection system (e.g. dual systems).

Once these fundamental issues have been clarified, the GHG inventory for the waste management sector can be drawn up. This would require external support, at least for the initial balance (initial set-up of the calculation logic). For this step, it would also be important to subsequently balance the year 1990 according to a similar methodology in order to evaluate the GHG emissions from waste with regard to the GHG reduction already achieved and still to be achieved by the target year of GHG-neutrality. Once the methodology has been set up and the balance drawn up, a process is to be set up with which the GHG inventory for waste can be regularly updated.

# Industrial processes (non-energetic)

There is no statistical data available at municipal level to record non-energy emissions from industrial and commercial processes or product utilisation. An initial approach that Dresden can pursue in the coming years is the use of national indicators and the extrapolation of these on the basis of economic data (knowledge of economic sectors) in Dresden. This methodology must be developed and it must be checked that the data sources used for this can also be retrieved regularly and consistently in terms of data volume.

# 2.1.5 Not yet published updated GHG inventory according to BISKO for 2019 - 2022

The updated GHG inventory according to BISKO for the years 2019 to 2022 was available as at 30 August 2024. This could no longer be taken into account in the Action Plan in the given form, as the data in the

structure of the Table 2- are not available and cannot be presented without further adjustment. It is planned to present the balance sheet to the public in autumn 2024. For this reason, the figures for the GHG inventory - in the form in which the CoD has communicated to the public to date - are included here for information purposes. It should be noted that 2018 remains the base year of the IEK reduction pathway and the potentials shown continue to relate to this. The process described above (see 2.1.3) to prepare the database has been carried out in the form described below in order to update the BISKO balance sheet and ensure consistency. In the further process up to the end of the year, further details will be agreed with data providers and the updatability of the balance sheet will be ensured.

The city of Dresden has prepared its GHG inventory in accordance with BISKO for the year 2022. The presentation covers the period from 2013 to 2022 and provides a consistent analysis of the city's greenhouse gas emissions over ten years. This is shown below for absolute emissions. It should be noted that there are changes to the historical values as a result of the revision of the data sources and consistency: The GHG inventories for the years 2013 to 2018 were adjusted retrospectively. This was necessary because a new data set from the chimney sweeps was available for 2021, which was combined with the data for 2015. This led to slight adjustments and a change in the timing of the non-pipe-based energy sources. In addition, new, more plausible values were taken into account in the energy consumption of the central heating and cogeneration plants, which also led to adjustments. Slight shifts were made in the allocation of sectors - in particular from industry to private households. In addition, a new data set for solar thermal systems was implemented.

# Key messages of the new balance sheet

Stagnation of emissions: Greenhouse gas emissions in Dresden have only changed marginally since 2013. Over the entire period from 2013 to 2022, emissions have fallen by around  $8\%$ . This reduction is mainly due to improvements in the German electricity mix up to 2020. However, emissions
#

Dresden. Dresdner

Dresden action plan for climate neutrality in 2030

#

rose again slightly in 2021 and 2022 due to external factors such as increased coal-fired power generation and reduced use of wind energy.

Energy consumption: Energy consumption in Dresden has remained at a relatively constant level since 2013, with a marginal decrease since 2018. This small change illustrates that the actions taken so far are not yet sufficient to have a significant and steady impact on overall energy consumption and thus on emissions.
Influence of the German electricity mix: Around 32% of urban energy consumption is accounted for by the electricity sector, which is heavily dependent on the emission factors of the German electricity mix. While the emission factor of the electricity mix fell continuously until 2020, it rose again in 2021 and 2022. This increase has a significant impact on the overall balance of the city of Dresden and shows the city's dependence on supra-regional developments.

## Sectoral distribution of emissions:

Transport: The transport sector accounts for around a quarter of the city's total greenhouse gas emissions. The share of this sector has increased slightly in recent years, which is due to the fact that renewable energies are increasingly being used in the stationary sector, while the transition in the transport sector is progressing more slowly.
Private households: Households are responsible for around a third of the city's energy consumption, but only contribute around a quarter of emissions. This is due to the low-emission district heating supply, which is widespread in Dresden.
Economy: The economic sector is responsible for almost half of the city's greenhouse gas emissions, which emphasises its central role in urban climate protection. This sector is particularly diverse and comprises a large number of industries with different energy requirements and emission profiles.
Municipal facilities: These only account for around 2% of urban emissions, but special attention should be paid to them due to their exemplary function and the direct control options available to the city.

## Corona effect:

The effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the GHG inventory are particularly noticeable in 2020, although these were less pronounced in the city itself than initially expected. Energy consumption in the transport sector fell significantly, while there was hardly any reduction in energy consumption in the economy. The biggest influence on emissions in 2020 was the low emission factor of the German electricity mix, but not an overall reduction in energy consumption.

## Necessity of the Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Plan (IEK)

The balance sheet clearly shows that the actions taken to date have not been sufficient to significantly reduce emissions. The stagnation of emissions over a period of almost ten years emphasises the urgent need for further climate protection measures. The City of Dresden's Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan (IEK) is therefore a decisive instrument for implementing more ambitious actions and driving forward the transformation towards a climate-neutral city.

The IEK will include actions that affect all sectors and promote both technical and behavioural changes. These include expanding renewable energies, improving energy efficiency in buildings and industry and promoting sustainable mobility. The progress made to date, such as the expansion of the district heating supply and the improvement of energy efficiency in municipal buildings, form a solid foundation that must be further expanded through the IEK in order to achieve the city's climate targets.

## 2.2 Module A-2 Evaluation of current policy guidelines and local climate protection strategy

### 2.2.1 Legal framework:

The legal foundations of climate protection are anchored at both international and national level. The Paris Agreement, the decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court and the climate protection targets of the federal government and the Free State of Saxony form the foundation within which Dresden must define and implement its climate protection targets. These legal obligations are not only binding, but also provide a framework for the development of strategies that promote climate protection and at the same time bring social and economic benefits for the city and its citizens.

List of relevant guidelines, strategies and regulations:

|  EU level  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Legislation | The EU Green Deal directives^{9} have several implications for cities. Basically, they aim to make cities more sustainable and resilient to the challenges of climate change.  |
|  Relevance | 1. sustainable mobility: cities are encouraged to expand public transport and promote zero-emission modes of transport, leading to less traffic and better air quality.
energy efficiency: Directives to improve the energy efficiency of buildings promote renovations and new buildings that are more environmentally friendly. This can lead to lower energy costs for residents.
green infrastructure: cities are encouraged to create and maintain green spaces, which not only promotes biodiversity but also improves the urban climate and quality of life.
circular economy: promoting recycling and waste prevention leads to a reduction in waste and more efficient use of resources.  |
|  Need for action | The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) will be / are challenging for cities. The directives contain sensible requirements for climate protection. However, municipalities with often tight budgets (see also budget planning 2025/26 for Dresden) face problems with implementation. For Dresden in particular, with its large building stock, it will be critical to comply with the requirements.  |
|  Support programmes | EU funding programmes that provide financial resources for the implementation of climate protection measures are the EU Cohesion Funds and relevant action programmes such as Horizon Europe, LIFE, Connecting Europe, EUI  |
|  Relevance | Dresden benefits from EU funding programmes, in particular the EU Cohesion Fund. In addition, Dresden is part of the Smart City community at EU level with projects such as the EU Smart City project MAtchUP (Dresden). Dresden is also involved in the Horizon Europe Mission projects NEUTRALPATH and MOBILITIES4EU and U_CAN, the EUI project Time2Adapt and other Interreg projects.  |
|  Need for action | Dresden has been able to significantly expand its EU project portfolio in recent years and, thus, not only generated financial support, but also participates and benefits from international knowledge transfer. At the same time, project-based funding, which also ties up a lot of human resources, will not be able to finance the major transformation.  |
|  Covenant  |   |
|  Laws | The basic law is the Federal Climate Protection Act (see table above). Other important legislation is the Building Energy Act (GEG), which sets out requirements for the energy quality of buildings, the generation and use of energy, certificates, the use of renewable energies in buildings and, for local authorities, the use of renewable energies in new buildings and refurbishments. In addition, the law on heat planning and decarbonisation of heating networks obliges the federal states to implement municipal heat planning, including heat plans, by 30  |

|  Relevance | In new construction, the German government has set the course for climate neutrality with the Building Energy Act (GEG 2024) with the minimum standard KfW55 and the requirement of at least 65 Percent renewable energy from 1 January 2024 in new construction areas. For mobility, "Vision Zero" is relevant as a road safety goal. (In 2021, the Federal Council decided that road safety is the top priority for the implementation of the Road Traffic Regulations (StVO). "Vision Zero" means: no traffic accidents resulting in death or serious personal injury. It is the basis for all traffic actions. This is enshrined in the amended Article 1 of the Administrative Regulation on the German Road Traffic Regulations (VwV-StVO) and is binding for the authorities).  |
|  Need for action | Target at federal level: Green house gas neutrality by 2045 does not sufficiently support greater ambition in the municipal context, as there are high dependencies on the higher level Among other things, decarbonisation of the purchased electricity: In accordance with the political requirements (Climate Protection Act, Renewable Energy Sources Act 2023), the purchased electricity must be decarbonised. There is an additional need for action in the area of social housing and climate protection - see below.  |
|  National level  |   |
|  Programme | In the Free State of Saxony, the strategic direction of energy and climate policy up to 2030 is set out in the Saxon Energy and Climate Programme. Although this programme does not formulate any reduction targets of its own, it refers to the national goal of achieving green house gas neutrality by 2045, which serves as the most important orientation.  |
|  Relevance | The Free State of Saxony is one of the few federal states that does not have its own target for achieving green house gas neutrality, but merely supports the implementation of the national target. Similarly, there are no specific targets for Saxon municipalities to become greenhouse gas neutral in their own properties.

# Focus Affordable and climate neutral housing

# Affordable and climate neutral housing in Germany and Dresden

As a means to achieve net greenhouse gas neutrality by 2045, the housing construction industry will have to use its investments in the building stock to drive the decarbonization of most of the remaining GHG emissions in the building sector. Only a broad-based decarbonization strategy with a switch from fossil to emission-free energy sources, more efficient energy use and adapted building management and usage behavior can ultimately lead to the required renovation rates being achieved. We have to tackle three interconnected challenges: new construction, renovation of existing buildings, and social housing.

# New construction as the basis of social housing

Quantitatively, there are too little housing units in Germany. Speeding up in housing construction has become an urgent demand. The sector of new builts need adequate margins, in order to attract investors. As in the past, this can be achieved through subsidies for new construction projects, short depreciation periods or low-interest loans. In reality, the German housing policy has withdrawn from the provision of affordable housing for decades, thus depriving itself of its influence in shaping rental prices. Meanwhile, more financial investors have

#

flooded into the housing market. They bought into large portfolios and are interested in exploiting all opportunities for rent increases. As a consequence, every year, several tens of thousands of social housing units fall out of price control, and hardly any new ones are being built – affordable housing is becoming increasingly scarce.

Therefore, new housing construction bears an important socio-economic function as in providing affordable housing. Those who currently have to look for a new apartment, are burdened by sharply increased rent prices due to lack of available flats, especially low-income households and single people or single-parent households, who have particularly high rent burden rates. This gap also explains that it has become increasingly difficult for the middle class to buy a property in recent years that build wealth and provide for their retirement.

It should be noted that municipal housing companies like Wohnen in Dresden (WiD) which are responsible for municipal social housing, have to comply with regulations on public procurement which reduces their overall efficiency. European Procurement Law requires to issue a wide tender, which consumes a lot of time and company resources, namely: Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004/18/EC Text with EEA relevance, as well as Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2495 of 15 November 2023 amending Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council in respect of the thresholds for public supply, service and works contracts, and design contests. New and climate neutral housing construction requires effective exemption clauses to duly achieve the set targets for the building sector.

As a consequence of the shortfalls, the current volume of housing construction has been shrinking continuously in real terms since 2021. The federal government's goal of building 400,000 apartments p.a. is quite lagging behind its targets. The shortfall has already grown to up to 800,000 apartments in Germany. In fact, the housing deficits mainly affect the areas of social and affordable housing.

Since 2020, the number of people in Germany living in overcrowded apartments has increased by 800,000 to 9.3 million (11% of the population). Of those at risk of poverty, more than one in five lived in too small a space.

There is a particular lack of small apartments in the price range between €6 and €10 net cold per m² of living space.

Due to the massive slump in new housing construction, the housing sector is strategically not adequately prepared for demographic and migration-related population development or for the (necessary) transformation of the existing residential building stock.

# Net greenhouse gas neutrality versus affordable housing

The German Federal Building Energy Act and the revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) aims to make all buildings in the European Union climate-neutral by 2050. To comply with this regulative framework, industry experts estimate that 45 percent of all buildings in the entire EU would have to be renovated in just nine years. At the moment, Germany is only managing to renovate one percent of the total building stock. Under the current conditions, it is impossible for the industry to cover the costs to finance necessary renovations. The costs of these obligations are translated into higher rents.

Anyway, it does not work to solve the housing gap by (renovating) existing housing alone. There is great need for new housing construction to fill the gap. There is a price problem above all and price formation takes place in existing housing when new housing does not come emerge. Missing proper public funding, modernization costs due to renovation requirements are transferred to tenants as higher rents. Some urban researchers pose that climate-friendly renovation has partly become a displacement business for rent-seeking real estate companies. Low-income households are struggling with an enormous dilemma: heating costs that are too high and
#

Dresden. 2020

Dresden action plan for climate neutrality in 2030

#

rents that are too high. They cannot cope with either. Existing tenants can be displaced and the apartments can be rented out again at high prices.

Against the background of the population growth until 2035 especially by immigration effects, it is questionable whether the housing industry can contribute to a social balance.

Dresden has been successful in attracting new investors, especially semiconductor producers into its jurisdiction. Several thousands of new apartments must be built to cope with the planned large inflow of new labour. As new builts would will inevitably lead to a higher regional rent index, Dresden municipality has to increase the portion of social housing units for social vulnerable groups. The City leaders and the construction industry are willing to do so. The challenge is to work on an adequate regulative framework and public funding schemes to achieve these goals when faced with a narrower time window, inflation, higher input and financing costs and overall lack of skilled workforce.

# Focus on wind energy

Wind energy has great potential for decarbonising the energy system. In 2040, around two thirds of net electricity generation could come from wind turbines, which means it has the most economic expansion potential of all renewable energies in the short to medium term. In Germany, wind power accounted for the largest share of renewable electricity generation in 2020 at 53 Percent. The legal framework at federal and state level has been changed in favour of an accelerated expansion of wind power plants, e.g. with the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG, 2023), the Act to Increase and Accelerate the Expansion of Onshore Wind Energy Plants (Wind Energy on Land Act, 2022), the Act on the Determination of Land Requirements for Onshore Wind Energy Plants (Wind Energy Land Requirements Act - WindBG 2022), as well as amendments to building and nature conservation laws. As a result, around two Percent of the land area nationwide must be designated as priority areas for wind energy by 2032. In Saxony, the regional planning associations have been designated as the responsible planning authorities for the planning area designations (Section 4a SächsLPIG). For Saxony, it was specified that each regional planning association must designate two Percent of its area by 2027 (Section 4a SächsLPIG). This means that CoD also has a responsibility to contribute to the expansion of wind energy. This is contradicted by the decision of the city council on 20 June 2013 that no wind turbines may be erected within the city limits. In July 2023, the regional planning association Oberes Elbtal/Osterzgebirge, which is responsible for the CoD area, decided on the partial update of the regional plan in the area of energy and carried out a participation procedure on the intended planning approach in the fourth quarter of 2023. A draft plan is expected to be available in 2025.

# Focus on the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)

# ERDF in general and subject of funding:

In the City of Dresden, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is particularly relevant for sustainable, integrated urban development projects. As part of these projects, a GIHK (area-based, integrated action plan) is created with actions from all Fields of action to ensure a sustainable, integrated approach.

# Example Dresden - Johannstadt/Pirnaische Vorstadt neighbourhood

The Johannstadt/Pirnaische Vorstadt development area is an area that already benefited from ERDF funding in the last funding period 2024-2021. A neighbourhood-based energy, climate protection and climate adaptation

#

concept was developed and examined to determine where the urban ecology could be improved and CO2 reduced. The result was a catalogue of actions. This was the basis for identifying and implementing the climate protection and climate adaptation measures, as well as improvements to the living environment and many other actions in the current 2021-2027 funding period. The current climate protection and climate adaptation measures consist of various sub-measures, such as the green roof of the new building of the adventure playground in Silbermannstraße or various PV systems on the buildings of the WGJ. Actions to improve the living environment also consist of various sub-measures, such as the creation of swale infiltration in the neighbourhood of the WGJ to protect against heavy rainfall events.

# Benefits and opportunities

With a funding rate of  $70\%$ , ERDF funding is a great opportunity to promote climate protection and climate adaptation in the city of Dresden.

A higher prioritisation of these topics in the city administration is another positive effect. The importance of these topics is also passed on within the city administration.

The short funding periods mean that projects can be realised very quickly, which makes sense in view of the current climate situation.

Sustainable, integrated urban development means that the neighbourhood is strengthened at various levels. The social level, such as the promotion of small and micro enterprises, is also taken into account. It has been shown that it makes particular sense to utilise ERDF funding within two consecutive funding periods in a neighbourhood.

# The challenges

Actions must be requested from the relevant departments for a new funding period during the current funding period. This results in high staffing peaks. These are also apparent at the beginning of the funding period. Due to the tight timeframe, multi-stage participation is usually not possible. (Intensive participation before the funding period, on the other hand, is difficult, as it is not yet certain whether the actions will actually be implemented).

The SAB (Sächsische Aufbaubank) manages the fund and acts as the interface between the state of Saxony and the municipal administration. Communication is sometimes difficult and requires a lot of patience.

EU law applies. This means a stricter approach than under national law, particularly in the areas of state aid and public procurement.

Overall, many topics in the area of climate protection and climate adaptation are still in the trial phase in the Dresden city administration, which is why the funding is still being accepted and the projects implemented very hesitantly.

Creation of green infrastructure by the specialised departments, as no funds are earmarked for the care and maintenance of the newly created green spaces.

Due to some bad experiences in the production of PV systems on existing municipal buildings in the specialised offices and the care and maintenance, hardly any cooperations come about.

Some specialist departments have a staff shortage. Without the capacity of the specialised offices, it is very difficult or even impossible to implement the actions.

# 2.2.2 Local climate protection strategy: Dresden's target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions

The IEK (Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan of the City of Dresden) presented at the beginning of 2024 also proposed a way for the city to become greenhouse gas-neutral $^{10}$  by 2040 at the latest.

The further development of the Dresden Action Plan to tackle the challenges of climate change, in parallel with the application for an EU mission, proved to be a decisive step. The seamless integration of this mission into the Action Plan, also known as the Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan (IEK), was fundamental. This integration made it possible to formulate clear objectives for the year 2030 that go beyond the City Council's targets. While the city council is aiming for climate neutrality well before 2050 and is considering a sharpening up to 2035 or alternatively 2040, it was important that the IEK already set a clear direction for this early time frame.

The reduction path designed as part of this process is not based solely on predefined target values, but also takes into account the specific potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, a high level of detail was achieved in the area of building energy supply through extensive, GIS data-supported analyses. Concrete plans and feasibility studies also already exist for the decarbonisation of district heating, which were used in the IEK. In other sectors such as industry, the pathway is based on assumptions of parameters, while a separate process is underway for the transport sector, which will be completed by 2025 and must be confirmed by a city council resolution. This process will take into account the greenhouse gas neutrality requirements and implement them accordingly.

Until now, the Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan (IEuKK) from 2013 was valid and binding for Dresden. This envisaged reducing energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in the city area by around  $41\%$  by 2030 compared to 2005, which corresponds to a target of 3,300,780 tCO2 equivalents per year (cf. Table 6-1). With the continuation of the process from the IEuKK to the Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan (IEK), the goal of green house gas neutrality for Dresden by 2040 at the
#

Dresden action plan for climate neutrality in 2030

#

latest was set. Some areas of the administration are even to be climate-neutral by 2035, while the expansion of renewable energies in the electricity sector in the city is to be driven forward by 2035. By 2040, only  $5\%$  of emissions should remain compared to 1990, with an interim target of  $20\%$  of 1990 emissions being set for 2030. As part of this update, a significant reduction in emissions is planned for 2030, which is to be reduced to the IEK target of 1,586,900  $\mathrm{tCO_2}$  equivalents per year.

The reductions in emissions already achieved are remarkable. Between 1990 and 2018, a reduction of  $54\%$  was achieved, despite a resulting population growth of around  $10\%$ . However, Dresden experienced a sharp decline in population after the 1990s and only saw population figures rise again after 1999 (cf. The published GHG inventory to 2018).

This emissions reduction target pathway demonstrates not only the City of Dresden's commitment to climate action, but also its ability to develop innovative and inclusive approaches to achieve these goals. By continuously monitoring and adapting these strategies, Dresden will continue to lead the way in the fight against climate change and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.

# Fields of action for green house gas neutrality

The IEuKK of 2013 focussed on the Fields of action electricity, heat, transport and cross-cutting issues, which only considered final energy-based GHG emissions in the GHG inventory. However, in order to achieve GHG-neutrality in the long term, it is equally important to take non-energy GHG emissions into account. This is achieved in the IEK by categorising the Fields of action. The nine Fields of action are based on the emission sources as defined in international standards. In addition, the Fields of action "Grey energy, construction, consumption and food" and "Overarching organisation and control" are introduced. Although these are not emission sources themselves and therefore cannot be recognised as a separate category in the GHG inventory, they have a considerable scope of influence. The partial combination of energy and non-energy emissions in the Fields of action "Industrial processes and product use" and "Waste and wastewater management" brings the perspective of the actors more into focus.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

#

Dresden. 1

Dresden action plan for climate neutrality in 2030

#

The Fields of action define strategic priorities with corresponding topics for action. This is done in varying degrees of detail in the IEK, whereby the focus is on providing at least an initial overview of all relevant areas. The orientation is based on the fundamental principles of climate protection:

Consistency/ substitution: replacement of fossil fuels with low-GHG or GHG-neutral energy sources, use of recyclable materials
Efficiency: efficient utilisation of emission-intensive substances and raw materials in general, reduction of energy consumption
Sufficiency: limiting energy and resource consumption: producing and consuming less

The final energy-based GHG emissions, as recorded in the GHG inventory according to BISKO, can be found in the Fields of action "Building energy supply", "Expansion of renewable energies in the area", "Mobility" and "Industrial processes and product use". Concrete potentials were analysed for the Fields of action "Building energy supply" and "Expansion of renewable energies in the area" and taken into account in the scenarios for the reduction path.

The "Industrial processes and product use" Fields of action also describe initial aspects of non-energy-related GHG emissions.

The Fields of action "Agriculture, forestry and other land uses" addresses non-energy-related emissions in this area on the one hand and the potential for natural  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  sinks in the urban area on the other.

The "Waste and wastewater management" Fields of action describe both relevant energy and non-energy GHG emissions and offer initial approaches for reducing them in these two areas.

The Fields of action "Grey energy, construction, consumption and nutrition" classifies the possible options for action in this area.

The field of action "Overarching organisation and management" acts as a cross-cutting topic and forms an overarching framework for all other Fields of action.

The Fields of action also form the basis for the action portfolio (IEK, Volume II; App.1).

The following shows how the Fields of action of the IEK fit into the logic of the CCC.

# Scenarios analysed in the IEK

Three scenarios were considered in the IEK to illustrate the possible development towards GHG-neutrality:

two so-called target scenarios, in accordance with the City Council resolution (V1818/22) to achieve GHG-neutrality by 2035 and alternatively by 2040, and
a reference scenario in which the current federal policy targets are achieved with a slight delay.

Other scenarios that do not achieve GHG-neutrality before 2050 are not taken into account. There is therefore no "business as usual" scenario (BAU scenario). The CoD recognises its contribution to achieving the federal policy targets and the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement.

The scenarios differ in terms of a number of political, social and economic aspects that accelerate, delay or only enable the implementation of climate protection measures to a limited extent. These include, among others:

political will to implement,
Availability of land for renewable energies (RE),
Authorisation times and capacities,
Acceptance among the population,
Craftsmen (capacities, expertise),
Scaling effects (e.g. reduction in system prices, reduced planning effort due to serial roll-out),
Availability of raw materials (e.g.  $\mathsf{H}_2$ ) and materials (system components),
technical progress and the transition to a sustainable economy.

Figure 2-8 provides a brief description of the scenarios.

# Reduction path calculator in the IEK

The reduction path calculator, which was developed in the IEK, is a tool that shows the possible reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) for the city of Dresden over time in the three different scenarios. The timeline covers the period from the start year 2018 to the target year of GHG-neutrality 2035, alternatively 2040 and beyond to 2045. The starting point for the reduction path calculator is the GHG inventory for the balance sheet year 2018.

It should be noted that the reduction path calculator is a model that shows the conditions under which GHG-neutrality can be achieved in Dresden. The reduction potentials included in the calculator are based on concrete and calculated potentials. However, it is not possible to use the pathway to assess how the trajectory shown can be realised in reality. For this, the respective underlying assumptions must be checked and compared with the respective feasibility of specific actions. Despite this, the reduction trajectory provides important information on the "levers" for achieving GHG-neutrality. Its main purpose is to visualise a compilation of the individual steps towards achieving GHG-neutrality by 2035 or 2040 and to enable a comprehensive, cross-potential analysis. The objective for the reduction path calculator is:

Presentation of the temporal potential for GHG reduction,
Presentation of the resulting final energy requirements and GHG emissions, taking into account the energy demand and GHG reduction potential over time,
Examination of the achievement of GHG-neutrality by 2035 and 2040 in the scenarios,
Presentation of the difference between the resulting GHG emissions and the GHG neutrality target ("ambition gap") for the scenarios.

In addition to the current GHG emissions (2018), the GHG reduction potentials from the potential analyses in the IEK and the assumed changes outside the urban area (scenario framework) are included in the reduction path. The reduction path is based on the calculation methodology used for the city's GHG inventory. This is based on the calculation of GHG emissions as the product of final energy demand and
#

#

specific GHG emission factor  $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right.$  equivalents) per energy source. The potentials can have a mathematical effect on the final energy demand or the specific GHG emissions (GHG emission factor). Table 2- shows the potentials and their mechanism of action for the reduction pathway.

Table 2- : Mechanisms of action of the analysed reduction potentials on the reduction pathway

|  Electrification of means of transport | Reduction in final energy demand for fossil fuels Increase in final energy demand for electricity for mobility | ■ Transport  |
|  "Greening" of the reference stream | Reduction of the GHG emission factor for the federal electricity mix | ■ Residential building ■ Non-residential buildings ■ Process energy industry ■ Transport  |
|  Increasing the share of renewable energies for electricity generation in the urban area (expansion of PV and wind energy) | Reduction of the GHG emission factor for local electricity mix 11 | ■ Residential building ■ Non-residential buildings ■ Process energy industry ■ Transport  |

|  Switch to hydrogen as an energy source | Reduction in final energy demand for natural gas and other fossil fuels/other fuels Increase in final energy demand Hydrogen | ■ Process energy industry ■ Transport  |

The mechanisms of action are stored accordingly in the reduction path calculator.

Based on the scenario analyses, for which a target scenario for 2035 and a target scenario for 2040 were examined in the IEK, a concrete path to reduce GHG emissions for the CoD was proposed as a result (target scenario). This path must meet the requirements of City Council resolutions A0011/19 and V1818/22 to achieve climate neutrality well before 2050 or 2035 (alternatively 2040). In addition, it should fulfil the guidelines for GHG-neutrality and take into account the Paris-compliant  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  budget, which makes it necessary to set interim targets.

The implementation of the analysed potentials for reducing energy-related GHG emissions leads to a defined target state of GHG-neutrality with regard to energy-related GHG emissions, whereby the time component for the implementation of the potentials is not shown.

Table 2- shows the framework conditions for the target scenario.

The expansion path of the renewable electricity potentials should be in line with the 2035 target scenario in order to meet the 80 Percent expansion target of the EEG 2023 and at the same time ensure greater municipal influence and reduce dependency on purchased electricity (federal electricity mix).

The reduction path for the other areas takes place by 2040 - in line with the 2040 target scenario - as achieving green house gas neutrality by 2035 is not feasible even in the 2035 target scenario. This is due to the required planning periods, skilled labour capacities and dependencies on higher levels (e.g. availability of green hydrogen infrastructure, fully decarbonised electricity supply). By specifying the target year 2040, sufficient leeway for achieving GHG-neutrality is taken into account.

A separate reduction path is assumed in the mobility sector, which is based on the scenarios used in the DMP 2035+. A further analysis in scenarios and specific actions will be carried out as part of the Dresden Mobility Plan 2035+, which is currently being developed. Unlike the stationary sector, the mobility sector is therefore not underpinned by differentiated potentials and assumptions in the target path, but should rather be seen as an overarching requirement for the further development of actions in the DMP2035+.

Summarising the above-mentioned potentials and temporal progressions, the reduction pathway for GHG emissions is as follows Figure 2-13 broken down by energy source or in Figure 2-14 by emission source. It should be noted that the reduction path represents the interim target for 2030 for EU urban emissions, but also shows the target for GHG-neutrality (reduction by  $95\%$  compared to 1990). In addition, the path beyond 2040 is shown so that further reductions after 2040 also become effective and visible.

The reduction pathway scenarios make it clear that it is possible to achieve GHG-neutrality by 2040. In order to realise this goal, the urban potential identified as feasible, particularly in the energy sector, must be fully exploited.

Complete energy self-sufficiency cannot be realised for Dresden. Nevertheless, there is considerable potential through the installation of local renewable energy systems for the provision of electricity,
#

Dresden action plan for climate neutrality in 2030

#

which is estimated at around 1,500 GWh/a. Tapping into this potential harbours several opportunities, including increasing the security of supply, making it more attractive for industrial settlements and promoting local value creation.

The realisation of the targeted GHG-neutrality in the urban area is based on several pillars. A number of key requirements must be met in order to achieve the defined targets:

Substitution of natural gas: Natural gas must be substituted as an energy source by 2040.
Decarbonisation of the purchased electricity: In accordance with the political requirements (Climate Protection Act, EEG 2023), the purchased electricity must be decarbonised (if the decarbonisation of electricity is not progressing as quickly as assumed, this can be mitigated by targeted savings).
Availability of emission-free hydrogen: Hydrogen must be available and "largely emission-free" by 2035.
Defossilisation of mobility: The aim is to achieve the greatest possible defossilisation in the mobility sector by 2040 (concretisation and implementation of the target via DMP 2035+).
Implementation of SachsenEnergie AG's decarbonisation concept (acceleration scenario, in particular tapping industrial waste heat potential): The implementation of this concept plays a decisive role in achieving the defined targets.
Efficiency gains in industry: High efficiency gains in industrial processes are essential to maximise this sector's contribution to GHG-neutrality, with the assumed savings in the industrial sector of 30 percent in total being offset by a simultaneous increase.
In addition, the aim is to increase the efficiency of heating requirements in existing buildings by twelve Percent.

The proposed reduction path is characterised by a high level of ambition, but is considered feasible under the assumptions made.

# Target for Dresden (city council resolution)

For the City Council's resolution on the IEK, the specified reduction path is translated into concrete, controllable (interim) values for GHG reduction. The target for the resolution text within the framework of the IEK is to achieve GHG-neutrality with a reduction of 95 Percent compared to 1990 GHG emissions by 2040 at the latest. Against the background of the citizens' petition adopted by the City Council with the target of 2035 ("Dresden Zero") and the urgency of climate protection, the acceleration of all implementation measures to achieve greenhouse gas neutrality as early as possible must be pursued. In order to concretise this overarching objective, interim targets will be defined:

For 2027: a minimum reduction of 70 Percent.
For 2030: A minimum reduction of 80 Percent of GHG emissions, based on the target of the EU mission.
For 2035: A minimum reduction of 90 Percent of GHG emissions, as a further step towards the overall target by 2040.

In order to achieve the target, the potential for renewable energies in the urban area identified in the IEK, particularly in the areas of wind energy and PV, is to be tapped by 2035. This includes the targeted utilisation and expansion of these renewable energy sources in the following stages (electricity generation from renewable energy plants, expansion target for 2040 already achieved, therefore no value).
#

Dresden action plan for climate neutrality in 2030

#

The reduction and expansion targets are shown in Table 2-. The reduction target in Percent represents a rounded value for better clarity. The specific figures in tCO2_eq are taken from the values of the reduction pathway. These correspond to the exact values of -70.0% in 2025, -79.9% in 2030, -88.0% in 2035 and -95.8% in 2040 reduction compared to 1990 GHG emissions.

Table 2- : Overview of the interim targets of the reduction pathway of the target for achieving GHG-neutrality in Dresden

|  Year (Interim) target | Test year | Reduction target compared to 1990 (rounded) | Concrete target value for energy-related emissions in tCO2.eq/a | GHG reduction in relation to 2018 in tCO2.eq/a | Electricity generation from RE plants in GWh/a  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  2027 | 2029 | -70 % | 2.371.705 | -1.234.500 | 365  |
|  2030 | 2032 | -80 % | 1.586.900 | -2.019.200 | 680  |
|  2035 | 2037 | -90 % | 944.700 | -2.661.500 | 1.440  |
|  2040 | 2042 | -95 % | 329.900 | -3.276.300 | No specification  |

The (interim) targets are reviewed as part of monitoring and controlling with a two-year delay (review year). The GHG inventory according to BISKO as well as the indicator for the feed-in of renewable energy systems and the renewable energy systems installed in the urban area are used to check the achievement of targets.

The GHG inventory is expanded to include the cumulative GHG emissions from 2020 to the respective review year in order to check the consumption of the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  budget. This comprehensive review enables a targeted evaluation of progress and ensures that the (interim) targets set as part of the climate protection strategy are on track.

Another significant step towards achieving the target is the endeavour to make the city administration GHG-neutral by the target year of 2035. This emphasises the commitment at municipal level not only to reduce GHG emissions in general, but also to lead by example in the administration itself.

Module A-3 Systemic obstacles and opportunities for climate neutrality in 2030

System description and analysis:

Categorisation of the municipal scope for action

There are certain factors and aspects that are not directly within the municipalities' control that can affect their GHG-neutrality efforts. Some of these factors are:

National and international environment: Major political and economic decisions at national and international level can influence the framework conditions for municipal initiatives. For example, national laws, international agreements or global economic trends can influence the opportunities and challenges for municipalities.
Social developments: Various developments in society as a whole in terms of preferences, trends or socio-demographic factors can only be changed to a very limited extent at municipal level. For example, the necessary trend towards a certain sufficiency, i.e. a resource- and energy-saving lifestyle, can only be realised as a development for society as a whole, whereby the federal and EU levels must also exert their influence.
Economic structure: The economic structure of a region may to some extent be outside the direct control of a municipality. If a municipality is heavily dependent on emissions/energy-intensive industries, it may be more difficult to achieve GHG-neutrality without simultaneously impacting the economy.
Technological developments: The availability and affordability of green technologies and innovations can be influenced by external factors beyond the control of an individual community. This can make the introduction of new green technologies more difficult or easier.
Global market dynamics: Access to environmentally friendly resources and technologies can also be influenced by global market dynamics that depend on political decisions, trade agreements and international economic relations.
Research and development: Progress in research and development, particularly in the field of renewable energies and climate-friendly technologies, cannot be directly controlled by local authorities.
Natural conditions: Some natural conditions, such as local climate, geography or the availability of renewable resources, may be factors outside the direct control of a municipality.

Despite these challenges, the CoD can play an active role by using its local resources and spheres of influence, promoting cooperation and exerting political pressure on other levels to create favourable framework conditions for climate protection.

## 2.3.3 Focus: Challenges in the building sector

At a good 30 Percent, the energy renovation status in Dresden is better than the national average. On the one hand, this is pleasing, as only a relatively small proportion of buildings are considered to be unrenovated and therefore urgently require energy-efficient refurbishment. On the other hand, the energy refurbishments of the last three decades mean that it is often not worthwhile from the building owner's or tenant's point of view, for example, to reinforce the façade insulation, retrofit panel heating or carry out other extensive energy refurbishments. In view of the income burdens that may result from additional extensive energy refurbishments, the acceptance of the actions, but also the limited capacities of the trades, it therefore does not seem advisable to demand extensive energy refurbishments to achieve high efficiency standards as an action in general. Such actions would have to be accompanied by a high level of public funding and would be difficult to implement due to the known shortage of skilled labour. Even if the highest possible energy efficiency standards would be desirable in principle, in view of the challenges outlined, it must be ensured that the building energy supply achieves GHG-neutrality by pragmatic and innovative means. This means that only as much energy refurbishment should be required as is necessary for the use of green district heating or the use of renewable energies in the form of heat pumps or neighbourhood heating networks, where possible in the building. If green hydrogen is available as a climate-neutral option for the building, this would be the benchmark.

For all of the climate-neutral options mentioned, no or only relatively minor energy refurbishment measures need to be carried out on the outer shell or the building's heat distribution system due to the already relatively good state of refurbishment. These could be, for example, the replacement of individual radiators or simple sealing measures, usually with the aim of reducing the required maximum flow temperatures in the building to below $65^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. Most greenhouse gas-neutral solutions can operate at this temperature. Nevertheless, this must be checked on a case-by-case basis by the specialised company or planner and should not be misunderstood as a general recommendation. In addition to switching to greenhouse gas-neutral heat generators, a key objective should be to maximise the overall energy efficiency of the building and thus save energy.

#

By innovative means, we mean that so-called serial refurbishments could also be considered for suitable building types, for example. Serial refurbishment means the use of prefabricated façade or roof elements including the associated system technology (e.g. PV, heat pump modules) and their more efficient installation on or in existing buildings. The elements prefabricated off-site have such a high degree of prefabrication that the time required on site is significantly reduced compared to conventional refurbishment. These are currently on the rise, are also subsidised by the German government[13] and have several advantages. Firstly, they are usually more cost-effective than commissioning several specialist planners and individual trades. They also reduce interface management between the trades and the associated risks and, finally, they effectively counter the problem of skilled labour, as the time required is significantly reduced.

Another innovative means is to combine different heating technologies as intelligently as possible. For example, investment costs can be saved if a rather small heat pump is installed in an existing building for the efficient provision of the basic heat load and an additional low-cost heat generator is only added for the few very cold days of the year or in rooms with higher temperature requirements. This could be, for example, additional infrared panels in individual rooms or so-called split air conditioning units. In this way, investment costs can be saved on building refurbishment and possibly also on the heat generator, while still achieving a high level of living comfort and a reliable and climate-neutral supply.

A key aspect of energy-efficient building refurbishment is checking the hot water supply. In many apartment blocks, a high hot water temperature is permanently generated and possibly still circulated in the building due to the risk of legionella. This results in considerable heat losses. In apartment blocks with hot water circulation, the hot water energy consumption corresponds to the same level as the heating energy consumption due to the circulation losses. These systems lead to high operating costs and make the use of RE more difficult. It is therefore necessary to examine the extent to which these systems can be made more efficient in operation by means of an adapted legionella control programme or a technical retrofit/conversion, taking into account the drinking water hygiene regulations. This is being investigated as part of the Neutral Path project together with the TU Dresden. The findings are to be incorporated into municipal heat planning.

One approach that can be easily combined with sector coupling is the joint development and utilisation of (local) energy resources. Specifically, this means, for example, district heating or local heating networks, which offer the possibility of integrating various local energy sources or important supplementary energy sources (e.g. biomass, hydrogen, "surplus electricity") and storing the heat generated from them and making it available as required. Therefore, in addition to the further development of Dresden's district heating system, the expansion and construction of new local heating networks outside the district heating areas is an important contribution to an affordable, secure and climate-neutral heat supply.

# 2.3.4 Opportunities: Regional added value, cost savings and benefits

Climate protection aims to minimise the negative effects of climate change as far as possible. In the context of urban development, the goal of a climate-robust and resilient city takes centre stage. A city that not only withstands the challenges of climate change, but is also sustainable and adaptable, offers a variety of additional benefits. These include an increased quality of life, improved public health and the creation of attractive green and recreational spaces. In addition, sustainable urban design helps to reduce maintenance and flood protection costs. A particular focus here is on the city of Dresden, where targeted climate protection measures can both save costs and improve environmental and living conditions in the long term. The most important benefits and associated cost and savings potentials are presented in more detail below. The costs and cost savings mentioned relate to Dresden.

# Avoidance of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  costs

Costs already have to be paid for the emission of greenhouse gases. A distinction must be made between European and national emissions trading. The European Union introduced the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) in 2005 to reduce GHG emissions from power plants, industrial facilities and aviation in a cost-efficient manner. The quantity of available certificates is continuously decreasing, causing certificate prices to rise while demand for certificates remains the same or increases. The EU ETS allowance price is currently around 70 euros/ $\mathrm{t}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{e}}}$ . Since 2021, there has also been national emissions trading, which currently affects the transport and heating sectors and will also affect the waste sector from 2024. The Emissions Trading Authority (DEHSt) at the Federal Environment Agency is responsible for implementation. Currently, certificate prices are fixed and not determined on a market basis. In 2023, the national allowance price was 35 euros/ $\mathrm{t}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{e}}}$ . However, as part of the "Fit for 55"
#

Dresden action plan for climate neutrality in 2030

#

package at European level, there are plans to also integrate the heating and transport sectors into a European certificate trading scheme, the "EU ETS 2", from 2027. $^{14}$

It must therefore be assumed that certificate prices in European emissions trading will equalise from 2027 and continue to rise. The fundamental model calculations carried out by SachsenEnergie AG as part of the district heating transformation plan resulted in a certificate price forecast of EUR  $208 / t_{\mathrm{CO2}}$  for the year 2045. This forecast is subject to major uncertainties, but should be used to illustrate the direct annual savings of future  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  price costs for Dresden. If the goal of GHG-neutrality is achieved in Dresden, this corresponds to an annual GHG emissions reduction of 3.2 million tonnes $_{\mathrm{CO2}}$  compared to 2018 emissions. If these emissions still occur in 2045 and emission allowances would have to be purchased for them, this would result in annual costs of around 668 million euros. Over a period of 20 years, which corresponds to the technical service life of heating systems, for example, this would mean savings of more than 13 billion euros. In reality, however, it must be assumed that the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  certificate price will rise even more sharply due to its significant shortage, particularly at the end of the 1940s, meaning that the savings for Dresden would be significantly higher.

# Ecological benefit according to damage cost approach (climate impact costs)

The damage cost approach published by the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) estimates the amount of damage caused to society by GHG emissions and the resulting climate change. "The damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions will increase over time, for example as the value of buildings and infrastructure damaged by extreme weather events increases. Therefore, the cost rates to be applied will also increase over time."15 For GHG emissions emitted in 2022, this damage cost rate is estimated by the UBA at 237 euros/tCO2 and for 2050 at 286 euros/tCO2 , but with a higher weighting of the prosperity of current generations compared to that of future generations (time preference 1 Percent). If the prosperity claim were weighted equally (0 Percent time preference), the cost rate for 2050 would rise to 865 euros/tCO2 . This clearly shows that not only the achievement of GHG-neutrality itself, but also the total emissions still emitted until GHG-neutrality is achieved cause considerable damage and must therefore be included in the analysis. Based on the damage cost rates for a higher weighting of the current level of prosperity (time preference 1 Percent) and in comparison between the target for achieving GHG neutrality and the reference scenario of the IEK, the acceleration of the federal target for achieving GHG neutrality in 2045 alone results in a reduction in the damage amount of around EUR 3.2 billion by achieving GHG neutrality by 2040 and adhering to the CO2 budget for the 1.75 °C target (see chapter 6.1 and Table 6-3).

# Strengthening regional value creation

Another sustainable benefit from an economic perspective is the increase in regional added value for Dresden and the region. This is because a large proportion of the investments listed will not only take place in Dresden, but will also be realised by regional companies from planning to construction. The fact that the additional plants and infrastructure have to be serviced and maintained also leads to long-term orders and jobs for the regional economy. Furthermore, Dresden will significantly reduce its energy imports and thus also the outflow of financial resources.
#

#

# Location advantage

Climate protection is playing an increasingly decisive role as a location factor for municipalities, particularly in terms of attracting large companies. Companies are attaching more and more importance to sustainable business practices and favour locations that offer a future-proof, climate-friendly infrastructure. Municipalities that pursue clear climate protection strategies and implement actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are signalling a willingness to innovate and a sense of responsibility. This can help to strengthen their image as an attractive business location and increase their competitiveness in global competition. Companies also benefit from sustainable location development, as it makes it easier for them to achieve their own climate targets and sustainability requirements. By creating climate-friendly framework conditions, a municipality not only secures its ecological future in the long term, but also attracts investors and companies that are active in sustainable growth markets.

# Increasing the security of supply

Dresden is currently more than 95 Percent dependent on imports of fossil fuels to cover its heating requirements. This is primarily due to the import of natural gas. Such dependence on fossil fuel imports is not only problematic in terms of the outflow of cash flows and rising  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  costs, but also represents a supply risk. Even if Dresden, as a major city, will probably always be dependent on energy imports, reducing and diversifying them as sustainably as possible will contribute to greater resilience in the event of external shocks. With the IEK's proposed target path, the dependency in the heat supply is reduced or diversified from more than 95 Percent of the heat demand being covered by natural gas imports to around 25 Percent of the heat demand being covered by hydrogen imports (used in the district heating CHP plants) and a small proportion of electricity imports (used for heat pumps). As the district heating CHP plants are used in particular on days with high electricity prices, for example on cold winter days with low renewable electricity generation, they generate some of the electricity required for heat pumps in Dresden's distribution grid in addition to the waste heat for district heating. They thus contribute to a reduced dependence on electricity imports. On days with good conditions for PV electricity generation, a significant proportion of the heat pump electricity required in Dresden will be generated directly with intelligent control, and connected heat storage units can be charged accordingly. In times with good conditions for electricity generation from wind power, Dresden will be able to benefit from favourable imports via the transmission grid in addition to its own plants.

# Financial benefits and increased self-sufficiency

In addition to the benefits from Dresden's overall perspective, the operation of private RE systems, for example PV roof or balcony systems, can help to reduce energy costs for tenants or building users and thus contribute to a financial advantage. Ideally, companies can also reduce their energy costs by using renewable energy systems on their buildings or areas compared to full grid supply. In addition, supplying their own decentralised energy and possibly storage systems represents a certain degree of self-sufficiency, which can contribute to local security of supply.

To summarise, it can be stated at this point that the investments in Dresden's GHG-neutrality not only make an important contribution to achieving climate protection targets, but also bring several important additional benefits.

# Social benefit

The energy transition has the potential to make the energy supply more democratic at both an individual and international level. At an individual level, depending on individual circumstances, it can expand the

opportunities for participation in the energy supply, although not everyone can benefit equally. This can increase the self-efficacy of individual groups and thus also the acceptance of actions. Internationally, this can reduce inequalities between countries and reduce dependencies on fossil resources. While the energy transition does not bring about complete democratisation in the political sense, it does make various aspects of energy supply more democratic.

Last but not least, climate protection and climate change adaptation measures have an impact on the health, mortality and quality of life of the urban population. As a result of global warming, heat stress in the summer months is increasing enormously for residents in densely populated neighbourhoods. In order to prevent health consequences, the City of Dresden is currently drawing up a heat action plan. This takes into account comprehensive intervention measures for health protection. Behavioural and situational preventative actions are intended to reduce heat stress and UV exposure and prevent damage to health.

Increasing weather changes and natural disasters also have an impact on the quality of life and health of the city's inhabitants. Climate protection is intended to mitigate the effects of climate change as far as possible.

# 3 Part B - Pathways to climate neutrality by 2030

# 3.1 Module B-1 Climate neutrality scenarios and impact pathways

The reduction path pursued by the City of Dresden to achieve GHG-neutrality is characterised by a very high level of ambition, but is considered feasible under the assumptions made. Complete energy self-sufficiency is not realisable for Dresden. Nevertheless, there is considerable potential through the installation of local renewable energy systems for the provision of electricity, which is estimated at around 1,500 GWh/a. Tapping into this potential harbours several opportunities, including increasing security of supply, making the city more attractive for industrial settlements and promoting local value creation.

The realisation of the targeted GHG-neutrality in the urban area is based on several pillars. A number of key requirements must be met in order to achieve the defined targets:

Substitution of natural gas: Natural gas must be substituted as an energy source by 2040.
Decarbonisation of reference electricity: In accordance with the political requirements (Climate Protection Act, Renewable Energy Sources Act 2023), the reference electricity must be decarbonised (if the decarbonisation of electricity does not progress as quickly as assumed, this can be mitigated by targeted savings).
Availability of emission-free hydrogen for industrial applications: Hydrogen must be available and "largely emission-free" by 2035.
Defossilisation of mobility: The aim is to achieve the greatest possible defossilisation in the mobility sector by 2040 (concretisation and implementation of the target via DMP 2035+).
Implementation of SachsenEnergie AG's decarbonisation concept (acceleration scenario, in particular tapping industrial waste heat potential): The implementation of this concept plays a decisive role in achieving the defined targets.
Efficiency gains in industry: High efficiency gains in industrial processes are essential to maximise this sector's contribution to GHG-neutrality, with the assumed savings in the industrial sector of 30 percent in total being offset by a simultaneous increase.
In addition, the aim is to increase the efficiency of heating requirements in existing buildings by twelve Percent.

Another significant step towards achieving the target is the endeavour to make the city administration GHG-neutral by the target year of 2035. This emphasises the commitment at municipal level not only to reduce GHG emissions in general, but also to lead by example in the administration itself.

# Description of the impact pathways

The impact pathways are characterised by the fact that they have the greatest influence on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the city. They address a large proportion of the city's GHG emissions (energy-related emissions &gt; 85% of total emissions). At the same time, they must be implemented quickly in order to achieve short-term reductions. The necessary planning and implementation periods must be taken into account, particularly in the case of infrastructural changes.

Various assumptions are included in the impact paths:

Green hydrogen will not be available until after 2030 at the earliest, meaning that the switch to hydrogen for industrial applications will not be possible until after 2030.
The GHG emission factor of natural gas will increase by 2026 due to increased shares of LNG, which has a higher emission factor than pipeline natural gas.
#

#

The share of district heating in building heating will increase to approx. 50% by 2040 (strong expansion, therefore also more total emissions from district heating than if no expansion takes place).
The share of renewable energy in the urban area could reach 20% of total electricity demand by 2030 and 42% of total electricity demand by 2040. To achieve this, the potential for generating approx. 1,500 GWh/a from PV and wind energy would have to be utilised by 2035.
The expansion of production capacities for industry will lead to an increase in energy demand and thus GHG emissions by 2030 (forecast based on existing studies); the savings from energy efficiency in industrial companies will dampen this effect and will be visible as a reduction from 2030.

Wirkungspfade im zeitlichen Verlauf (Kumulierte THG-Reduktion)

In the following, the impact paths are assigned to the respective Fields of action and the associated impacts are shown in numerical values. The original Table B-1.1 from the Actions Plan template has been split up in order to present direct impacts and indirect impacts clearly for the 2030 target and the 2040 target (GHG neutrality of 95% reduction). The early and late changes can be found separately in the following table.

Explanation of the direct impacts (quantified): the figures given include a partial offset between 2018 (GHG inventory) and the start year 2021 for the building potential study in the energy requirements for electricity and their development; this is due to different data sources and models for analysing individual buildings. With the update of the 2019-2022 GHG inventory, there will be a validation option for the sum of the data sets. It can be assumed that there will be no deviation in the total across all emission sources in the stationary area, but that this may occur in the individual categories. To take this into account, the impact pathway for reducing the energy demand for buildings and process energy was summarised. It should be noted that the model still assumes an increase in industrial use up to 2035, which reduces the efficiency gains.

# 3.2 Module B-2 Climate neutrality portfolio design

The climate neutrality portfolio in the CCC incorporates the most important actions from the three core sectoral plans IEK, DMP35+ and climate change adaptation of the CoD. The climate neutrality portfolio was developed as an action portfolio as part of the IEK. This is based on the Fields of action of the IEK and is therefore not fully consistent with the system of the CCC's Action Plan template. The action portfolio only contains actions that can be implemented by the City of Dresden and its participating companies. Third-party actions are outside the scope of municipal action and are therefore not part of the action plan. These are listed and described by actor in the Commitent (Part 1).

The following three portfolios of measures correspond to the table

# Focus EU project NEUTRAL PATH

The city of Dresden's smart city project "NeutralPath" focuses on the urban heat and energy transition, particularly in the building sector with locations in the Leuben and Loschwitz districts. Five cities form the innovation network here: together with Zaragoza, Dresden is demonstrating feasible PCEDs as a pioneering city, in close dialogue with the three "copycat cities" of Ghent, Istanbul and Vantaa. The aim is to develop and demonstrate energy-positive, climate-neutral urban neighbourhoods (Positive Clean Energy Districts/PCEDs) in Dresden and Zaragoza, Spain as model cities and Ghent (Belgium), Istanbul (Turkey) and Vantaa (Finland) as multipliers or copycat cities. The project focuses on the building sector, specifically the decarbonisation of the heat supply, expanding the use of renewable energy sources and increasing the energy efficiency of buildings ("heat transition"). Electromobility and sector coupling are dealt with as integrated topics. Relevant actions:

Demonstration of climate-neutral neighbourhoods (Positive Clean Energy Districts) in Dresden
Installation of photovoltaic systems and heat pumps to increase local energy production and optimise consumption
Development of a low-temperature heating network as a prerequisite for the integration of renewable energies in Leuben
Energetic refurbishment and modernisation of existing residential buildings and installation of innovative insulation solutions in Pillnitz-Hosterwitz
Monitoring and performance monitoring of the installed systems in parallel: Establishment of innovation centres for PCEDs (Climate-Neutral Labs) in Dresden

# 3.2.2 Portfolio of mobility measures

The IEK does not include any actions in the area of mobility. These measures are part of the Dresden Transport Development Plan (VEP) 2025plus for the Dresden Mobility Plan (DMP) 2035+, which is currently being updated (see 1.3). Based on jointly developed key objectives and various scenarios, a preferred scenario with actions will be developed there and the actions will be described in more detail. This is planned for 2025.
#

Action plan for climate neutrality 2030

#

In December 2022, the City Council adopted 14 key objectives for the DMP2035+. These form the basis for the evaluation of the scenarios and necessary actions.[17]

Climate: The transport system contributes to the necessary CO2 reduction and thus to climate protection.
Accessibility: All destinations can be reliably reached by citizens and businesses throughout the city using suitable means of transport, depending on the purpose.
Participation: All population groups can use Dresden's transport system easily, conveniently and without barriers.
Road safety: The transport system is being reorganised so that there are fewer accidents with fatalities and serious injuries. Dresden is aiming for "Vision Zero" by 2035.
Health: Traffic is becoming quieter and cleaner and Dresden is complying with noise and air quality limits. The transport system promotes active mobility.
Urban-friendly choice of transport: Walking and cycling as well as public transport with its multi-mobile services achieve a share of at least 75 Percent of urban traffic by 2035. The services are so well developed and networked that they fulfil mobility needs without the need for a car.
Short distances: Urban and transport planning ensures short distances in Dresden. In everyday life, all destinations are easily accessible on foot, by bike or by public transport.
Urban space quality: Streets and squares are designed to create spaces for people to live, move, stay and communicate. This requires intensive greening, which also improves the local urban climate.
Regional connections: Dresden and the region are well connected in terms of transport. By 2035, more than 50 Percent of visitors and commuters in Dresden will use public transport and bicycles.
Mobility management: All stakeholders in Dresden take responsibility for the sustainable mobility of their customers, visitors and employees and actively support the use of alternatives to private cars.
Economic efficiency: The transport system becomes crisis-proof, orientated towards the common good and conserves natural resources, as only then will it be economical in the long term. The costs of climate-neutral mobility are distributed fairly between the economy, the public sector and citizens.
Energy and space efficiency: Energy consumption for transport is significantly reduced. Transport facilities are built in a space-efficient manner.
Innovation and technology: Dresden focuses on innovative traffic control, digitalisation and automation for sustainable, safe and energy-saving mobility.
Mobility culture: Respect and mutual consideration characterise the way we work together. The needs of the individual and the common good are weighed up in a goal-orientated manner.

# Campus line

A new tram line is being built between the Löbtau and Strehlen districts. It is intended to relieve the heavily used bus route 61, which is an important connection to the TU Dresden and is used by students in particular.

With its greater capacity, the tram is intended to relieve bus traffic and make public transport more efficient and faster. With modern light rail vehicles, more passengers can be transported and travelling comfort is increased. In this way, even more people can be won over to climate-friendly modes of transport.

The new routes will enable new direct connections and better links, for example to the TU campus, including from Gorbitz, Löbtau, Pieschen and Reick. Further information about the planned new connections can be found here.

In addition to the construction of new tram lines, the modernisation of centrally located connection points (e.g. Tharandter Straße central stop, Nürnberger Platz, Wasaplatz, Strehlen stop) is also taking place.

# MOBILITIES4EU

Innovative and cost-effective concepts for passenger mobility and freight transport, developed and implemented according to participatory and user-centred principles, are at the heart of the EU project MOBILITIES FOR EU. MOBILITIES FOR EU identifies innovative solutions for urban mobility that can accelerate the transformation of the urban transport sector and include electrification, automation and connectivity as key themes to achieve this goal. Seven European cities, most of which have committed to the 112 Mission Cities, form the core of the project. They are divided into pioneer and replication cities. Dresden, along with Madrid (Spain), is one of two pioneer cities that will test the effectiveness of 27 innovative mobility solutions in eleven pilot actions. The 27 solutions relate to innovations in both vehicles and the overarching infrastructure. Examples include autonomous medium-sized e-buses for transporting around 20 people and the development of a decentralised data ecosystem for autonomous mobility for automated driving. The demonstration includes a design phase, the deployment of the solutions and their evaluation to assess their impact and relevance for future expansion and replication. The implementation of new urban mobility solutions can only be effective if they meet the needs of city residents and other local stakeholders. Therefore, Urban Transport Labs (UT-Labs) will be set up in all seven project cities to involve these stakeholders and play an important role in the project. The labs are involved in all project phases, in particular in the co-design of pilot activities and in the planning of up-scaling and replication activities after the project period. The centrepiece of Dresden's participation in the EU project Mobilities for EU is the Urban Transport Lab - OSTRA Laboratory for Urban Mobility located in the project area. This innovation hub will promote cooperation between citizens, industry, science and administration in order to shape the future development of mobility. Our goal is to create accessible options that bring people together regardless of their personal abilities, ensuring inclusive and collaborative progress. Beyond the duration of the project, the lab will further develop Dresden's transport system and position the city as a pioneer for sustainable urban mobility. The Urban Transport Lab will open on 31 August 2024. Further milestones include the testing of a charging robot in the Ostragehege in autumn 2024 (with VW GI) and car park monitoring in the Ostragehege at the end of 2024/beginning of 2025. The project is scheduled to run for the next five years, during which the technologies will be deployed and monitored by a project consortium comprising 29 prestigious institutions from nine European countries, covering the different perspectives of academia, industry and the public sector. MOBILITIES FOR EU is funded under Horizon Europe - the European Commission's research and innovation funding programme - in collaboration with the two European partnerships CCAM and 2ZERO.

# 3.2.3 Portfolio of measures for green infrastructure and climate change adaptation

Further actions relevant to climate protection, particularly in the area of "green infrastructure", can be found in the climate adaptation concept (KAP), which is also currently being drawn up. The following are examples of climate change adaptation actions relevant to climate protection. These actions relate to the area of "green infrastructure".

Table 3- 2: Selected actions relating to the reduction of GHG from the draft climate adaptation concept

|  Federal Garden Show (BUGA) 2033 in Dresden | With the signing of an implementation agreement between the City of Dresden and the Deutsche Bundesgartenschaugesellschaft (DBG) on Thursday, 13 June 2024, the joint plan for a Dresden Federal Garden Show in 2033 was sealed. This was preceded by a resolution of the city council with a clear majority in favour of holding the Federal Horticultural Show 2033 (BUGA). This was based on an initial sketch of ideas and then a feasibility study, which was completed by the end of September 2023. Local stakeholders, institutions and citizens were able to participate in the feasibility study. In addition to the agricultural development and use of the Südpark, a large part of the urban green space is qualified as a natural biotope area, which can be accessed on foot and by bike via an attractive network of paths. These also connect to the surrounding urban neighbourhoods and link the green and open spaces with each other. The BUGA represents a major contribution to the development of green infrastructure in Dresden in the context of climate change adaptation measures.  |

# 3.2.4 Action profiles - individual action plans

The system of actions in the IEK was carefully designed and should be retained. It was decided not to depart from this system in the Action Plan, as it was already published with the City Council's submission on the IEK and any deviations from it could lead to confusion. Further cost data will only be included in the investment plan, as this information is not to be published at present. The system of actions is explained below:

The IEK is divided into three volumes, with Volume II containing the action portfolio. The focus of the IEK is on an action portfolio, which is characterised by concretely developed packages of measures and fact sheets agreed with the stakeholders. Its detailed presentation not only makes it easier to agree on the necessary next steps, but also facilitates the targeted implementation of the actions that form the prelude to achieving GHG-neutrality in Dresden. The independence of the action portfolio allows it to be used autonomously, in the sense that stakeholders can use the action portfolios for their own work independently of the concept.

The updatable system of the action portfolio and the action profiles helps to ensure that the actions can be planned and updated over time. This structure supports the sustainable implementation of actions and provides scope for adjustments in the dynamic context of climate protection. In order to ensure effective controlling and enable transparent monitoring of success, the actions in the action portfolio (Volume II) are integrated directly into the climate protection monitoring software to be procured. This integration ensures that the implementation of the actions can be monitored promptly, precisely and conveniently and that it is possible to react to changing conditions. Aligning the fact sheets with the requirements of the Municipal Guidelines - Technical Annex ensures that the actions comply with current standards and regulations. This ensures that the actions listed fulfil the requirements for funding.

#

The structure of the action portfolio and the action profiles envisaged in the IEK thus offers a starting point for a clear and practical guideline for the implementation of climate protection measures, which is to be continuously expanded over the next few years into an action programme that reflects the target pathway adopted by the city council to achieve GHG-neutrality. The municipal scope for action is to be made clear and recommendations for action for other stakeholders outside the CoD's remit are to be taken into account.

In the action portfolio, the various Fields of action, packages of measures and specific actions are presented in a clearly structured hierarchy. This structure not only facilitates clarity, but also makes it easy to identify and assign the individual actions. In some cases, actions can also be assigned to several Fields of action, in which case the Field of action in which the action is likely to have the greatest impact has been selected. The links and interactions between actions and Fields of action can be identified in the action profiles.

The structure of the action portfolio is as follows:

# Level 1: Fields of action (FoA):

The various Fields of action for reducing greenhouse gases are described in detail in the IEK. These form the basis for the future action programme. Each Fields of action is labelled with an abbreviation to ensure clear identification in the measure numbers (Table 3-1).

Table 3- : Overview of the Fields of action in the action portfolio

|  Fields of action | Abbreviation for Fields of action  |
| --- | --- |
|  FoA 1: Building energy supply | G  |
|  FoA 2: Expansion of renewable energies in the area | E  |
|  FoA 3: Mobility | M  |
|  FoA 4: Industrial processes and product utilisation | I  |
|  FoA 5: Agriculture and forestry | L  |
|  FoA 6: Waste and wastewater management | A  |
|  FoA 7: Grey energy, construction, consumption and nutrition | K  |

#

|  FoA 8: Technical GHG sinks | S  |
| --- | --- |
|  FoA 9: Overarching organisation and control | O  |

## Level 2: Packages of measures:

The second level contributes to further differentiation. Each package of measures is given a consecutive number, preceded by the abbreviation of the associated Fields of action and separated by a dot. This numbering enables a clear allocation of the actions clustered in the package of measures. As of the status of the action portfolio, the options for action required in the packages of measures are not fully underpinned by concrete actions.

Example:

G.1: Package of measures in the Fields of action Buildings
E.2: Package of measures in the Fields of action Energy supply (central)

## Level 3: Actions:

The third level consists of the specific measure profiles within a package of measures. The numbering is consecutive, with the number of the associated action package being placed in front and separated from the two-digit number of the specific action by a hyphen.

Example:

G.1-01: First concrete action in action package G.1 (buildings)

This systematic structure not only enables the action portfolio to be organised efficiently, but also makes it easier to search for, identify and implement specific climate protection measures. Each element in this hierarchy helps to present the large number of actions clearly and to facilitate their integration into the overall context of climate protection.

Key measures are listed below. The IEK action portfolio is attached as an extra document to the CCC (Annex ...). All packages of measures and actions are listed there.

|  Title: Expansion and decarbonisation of district heating  |   |
|  Description: Dresden's district heating network already represents an important backbone of the city's heating supply with a share of approx. 44% of heat demand and a length of 630 kilometres. Its CHP plants utilise highly efficient, coupled electricity and heat generation. However, this is still based on fossil natural gas, which must be replaced for a climate-neutral heat supply. SachsenEnergie AG's decarbonisation concept, which places a special focus on district heating, shows the potential and ways to achieve GHG-neutral district heating by 2035 and 2045. The heat transformation plan for district heating underpins this with further detailed planning. This concerns, for example  |   |
|  ■ Thermal utilisation of residual waste  |   |
|  ■ Use of large heat pumps  |   |
|  ■ Use of electrode heating boilers  |   |
|  ■ Lowering the grid temperatures ("Low Ex")  |   |
|  ■ Expansion of heat storage capacities  |   |
|  In addition to replacing natural gas, Dresden's district heating also has potential for densification and expansion. The compression potential lies in particular in areas where natural gas and district heating are currently still being used in parallel.  |   |
|  Objective: The expansion and decarbonisation of district heating is to use the heat transformation plan to demonstrate how a climate-neutral district heating supply can be achieved by means of specific, coordinated individual measures. It takes into account the redensification of existing areas as well as expansion areas. The results of the heat transformation plan will be integrated into municipal heat planning in such a way that they are compatible with the Dresden City Council's climate neutrality target.  |   |

|  Ring 30 - Waste treatment and recycling plant  |   |
|  Description of the Together with Stadtreinigung Dresden GmbH, SachsenEnergie AG is planning the construction and operation of a waste treatment plant including a thermal waste utilisation plant in the form of a refuse-derived fuel (RDF) cogeneration plant. With the construction of our own plant in Dresden and its connection to CoD's central district heating network, up to 80% of the energy contained in residual waste can be utilised. By pretreating the waste, recyclable materials still contained in the residual waste can also be fed back into material cycles and a high-calorific substitute fuel can be produced for heat generation. The quantities generated on site are also disposed of safely on site. Natural gas previously used and imported from abroad will be proportionately substituted and the generation of heat decarbonised accordingly. As a result, this economical and ecological solution in municipal hands closes local material and energy cycles. In the future, this will make an important contribution to the affordability of waste disposal and energy supply for local people and create new jobs at the same time. The Hammerweg site, which has been used for waste management for decades and is located close to the conurbation, which is essential for district heating supply, will become a new focal point for this. A state-of-the-art RDF cogeneration plant will characterise the site in terms of energy management as a future component of a secure electricity and heat supply for CoD. There are currently plans to create processing capacities for non-hazardous waste with a capacity of up to 110,000 tonnes per year. The RDF will be thermally utilised in a new RDF cogeneration plant to be built with a combustion capacity of approx. 120,000 tonnes per year. The steam generated will be used to generate electricity and heat by means of an extraction condensing turbine. Innovative technologies in the turbine area and in the utilisation of waste heat potential are intended to achieve a fuel utilisation rate of up to 80%. The heat generated will be fed into the central district heating network of the city of Dresden as district heating.  |   |
|  Objective Decarbonisation of Dresden's district heating generation and securing an affordable waste disposal and energy supply. By pretreating residual waste and bulky waste that is subject to disposal, recyclable materials are to be fed back into the material cycle and the substitute fuel produced in the RDF cogeneration plant is to be utilised in the best possible way to generate energy. Waste utilisation close to the conurbation should also ensure a considerable reduction in transport routes.  |   |

|  Description of the  |   |
|  The project comprises the planning and construction of a heat pump system in the urban area of Dresden Löbtau (near the Nossener Brücke). The heat pump is to utilise river water (surface water) from the Vereinigte Weißeritz as a heat source. The river water is to be taken from the middle water channel via a lateral branch. The water will be channelled to a pump shaft via an extraction structure in the bank walls and subsequent pipelines. From there, the water is channelled to the heat pump hall. Once the river water has cooled down in the heat pump's evaporator, it is channelled back into the Weißeritz via pipes and a shaft. The heat extracted from the river is brought to a higher, usable temperature level in the heat pump and then fed into the central district heating network. The heat pump has a thermal output of 6.5 MW. The above information reflects the current planning status.  |   |
|  Objective: Use of environmental heat to decarbonise district heating.  |   |

|  Description: The aim of the project is the construction and operation of a heat pump system for green neighbourhood heating in Dresden-Gorbitz. The planned heating capacity is approx. 1 - 1.6 MWth. The mine water from the deep Elbe tunnel serves as the heat source. In a first planning step, the site fundamentals including the potential of the heat source for the provision of district heating were recorded and necessary preliminary investigations such as an exploratory borehole to determine the geological conditions were carried out. The design of the plant and the necessary peripherals will be specified in more detail in the more detailed planning stage. According to the current planning status, the construction of the plant can be divided into four sections. These include the excavation of a technical cavern in the deep Elbe tunnel, the installation of the mine water pipe from the surface to the cavern by means of boreholes, the construction of the mine water route from the borehole to the Q10 heat exchanger station (WÜS Q10) and the equipping of the empty WÜS Q10 with a heat pump and the necessary peripherals. In particular, permits are required for the necessary work, some of which must be carried out on the city's compensation areas. Care is taken to minimise the permanent use and sealing of green spaces. Furthermore, contractual agreements with WISMUT GmbH are a prerequisite for the utilisation of mine water heat.  |   |

Description: Municipal heat planning is a strategic planning instrument that shows the path to an affordable, secure and climate-neutral heat supply for the City of Dresden in terms of space, time and concrete actions.

Based on the determined heat requirements of the buildings, potentials from renewable energies and waste heat sources, as well as the existing supply infrastructure, different heat supply areas are developed, which are adapted to the local conditions.

With a view to the existing supply infrastructure and its future development, municipal heat planning takes into account the district heating, electricity and gas network infrastructures and, in particular, their subsequent transformation and expansion plans:

Heat transformation plan for district heating
Gas grid transformation plan (GTP)
Electricity grid expansion plan (NAP)

Another important element of municipal heat planning is its close development with local energy network operators, the intensive involvement of relevant stakeholder groups, e.g. from the housing industry or the skilled trades, as well as extensive public relations work. The aim is to achieve cost-efficient planning and implementation of the heating transition as well as broad acceptance.

Objective: The primary objective of municipal heat planning is to develop a socially and economically viable transformation path for a greenhouse gas-neutral heat supply for the entire urban area of the City of Dresden.

|  a potential analysis a target scenario actions implementation monitoring In addition, the creation of analysis scripts for evaluating relevant geoinformation and calculating scenarios is a central task in municipal heat planning, which are also referred to as "heat planning tools". These tools also make it possible to efficiently update the municipal heat planning and monitor actions. In addition, relevant stakeholders will be involved in the preparation of the municipal heat planning and extensive public relations work will be carried out. The energy network operators (district heating, electricity, gas) must be involved in the creation process. In order to be able to fulfil these extensive tasks, external service providers must be commissioned for project and stakeholder management as well as for energy expertise.  |   |

|  Energy consulting programme  |   |
|  Description: A municipal information and energy counselling service is to be set up by the City of Dresden for citizens, property owners and companies. The subject of the advisory service is the use of energy in and on buildings. As a first step, the establishment of an information service in the form of a digital contact point (website) is planned for 2024. The information service bundles existing information (in the areas of climate protection, energy and heat supply) and refers to existing advice options (e.g. BAFA or SAENA). In addition, the organisation of information events together with experts is planned. In addition to an information service, an initial energy counselling service will also be set up as a short-term action. The service will serve as a point of contact for advice on energy-related issues, funding opportunities, energy saving and energy efficiency as well as renovation and modernisation measures in and on buildings. From 2025, medium to long-term actions are possible, including energy-related refurbishment advice in neighbourhoods (KfW 432), the expansion of the advisory service (e.g. e-mobility advice) or the establishment of a municipal funding programme.  |   |
|  Objective: The aim of the information and energy advice service is to create a first point of contact for systematic and holistic advice on energy and energy efficiency in and around buildings. It supports citizens, property owners and companies as well as energy consultants in Dresden in gathering information and making decisions to increase the energy efficiency of a building. Energy advice makes an important contribution to the implementation of the energy transition and fulfilment of the climate protection goals in the City of Dresden.  |   |

# Neighbourhood concepts

Description: Neighbourhood heating concepts are a key pillar of the energy transition in the heating sector, in which entire neighbourhoods are considered instead of individual buildings in order to improve the efficiency of the overall system and tap further potential for renewable energy sources. A number of specific neighbourhoods are already being planned:

# Geystrasse" pilot project

A key pillar of the energy transition in the heating sector are so-called "cold" local heating solutions or networks (lowering operating temperatures compared to conventional systems, thus enabling heat generation from renewable energies) and neighbourhood heating concepts (looking at entire neighbourhoods instead of individual buildings to improve the efficiency of the overall system).
As part of the Geystraße neighbourhood concept, the existing and planned new buildings of the Olga-Körner nursing home run by the municipal company CULTUS gGmbH and the planned owner-occupied homes are to be connected to a "cold" local heating network. The heat will be extracted using geothermal probes and the brine pumped into the buildings will be raised to the required temperature level using brine-water heat pumps. The concept is rounded off by coupling with PV and solar thermal systems to power the heat pumps and regenerate the geothermal probes.
The result will be a heating solution that enables a high degree of self-sufficiency and largely market-independent, stable prices.

|  Title: Dresden Hydrogen Agenda  |   |
|  Description: Hydrogen plays a central role in achieving GHG-neutrality in Dresden. This applies in particular to the decarbonisation of Dresden's district heating and industry, which means that it is also highly relevant for process energy. It is also an important element in maintaining energy and supply security. The connection to the hydrogen core network, which has been announced for 2032 in Dresden, represents an important milestone. However, in order to be able to provide and ensure the corresponding quantities of hydrogen and the necessary hydrogen distribution networks for Dresden, coordination between the relevant players at municipal/regional level is absolutely essential. SachsenNetze GmbH should be in charge of bundling the hydrogen requirements and should also draw up the GTP on this basis. However, this process should be actively supported by partners such as the CoD, in particular the Office for Climate Protection and Climate Change Adaptation and the Office for Economic Development, SachsenEnergie AG as the district heating network operator, as well as key potential industrial hydrogen customers. The needs of industry and district heating must be recorded in as much detail as possible. A process for bundling the required quantities as a basis for specific purchase quantities must be defined and their procurement implemented. In addition, the necessary plans for the specific network conversion and, if necessary, the laying of a main pipeline from the hydrogen core network must be recorded and presented. An initial comprehensive draft must be available by the second quarter of 2025. Active stakeholder management, e.g. with regard to transmission system operators, federal and state governments, as well as association work must be actively pursued by the partners. Objective: By the beginning of 2025, a comprehensive determination, evaluation and bundling of all hydrogen requirements in Dresden as well as a process definition for the bundled procurement of hydrogen quantities must have been completed. All necessary infrastructure measures must also be identified by then and underpinned by feasibility studies and preliminary planning with regard to cost estimates, approval processes and time required, etc. The partners involved are actively lobbying all relevant stakeholders for the realisation of the hydrogen core network for Dresden in 2032.  |   |

|  Establishment and stabilisation of a regular climate protection exchange format in the CoD  |   |
|  Description: A temporary IEK project group was set up as part of the updating of the Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan. This was to cover the duration of the update. Due to the express wish of those involved in the project group to continue exchanging information on a regular basis even after completion of the update, the idea arose to transform the IEK project group into an informal working format at working level. In contrast to the project groups of the Climate Protection Working Group, no specific objectives are imposed on this exchange format and there is no obligation to report formally. This informal format is intended to serve as a dialogue platform where stakeholders can exchange ideas on climate protection topics and issues within the administration. The aim is to create an open forum in which ideas can flow freely. Unlike the focussed project groups, space is deliberately created here for informal discussions. The IEK project group in this new format is thus intended to be a kind of nucleus for new projects and actions in the area of climate protection. In 2024, this format will be used to discuss specific topics within the framework of the EU Urban Mission, focussing on areas outside the core group. Preparations for the acquisition of a climate protection platform are also on the agenda in order to improve the coordination and management of the various initiatives. The format also serves to provide regular information about ongoing climate protection activities within the administration. In this informal setting, participants can gain a holistic overview of progress and challenges, which creates the basis for effective collaboration and future projects.  |   |

|  Implementation of a web-based climate protection platform in the CoD  |   |
|  Description: The climate protection activities and the climate protection strategy of the city of Dresden are to be dynamically developed, monitored and made accessible to the public using a web-based platform. There are already established solutions on the market such as Climate View, Kausal Watch, FutureProofed and GAIA. These platforms were developed specifically for monitoring/controlling and scenario modelling. The platform serves both as a tool for coordinating and harmonising internal work and between the organisational units involved, as well as for communicating progress to the public in a meaningful and interactive way. The city's climate protection efforts are made visible, which can increase public awareness of the objectives as well as the motivation for civic participation. The platform is a suitable tool for controlling actions quickly and permanently. The actions can be assigned to different persons responsible so that each person responsible for the action can enter the progress independently. It is also possible to set deadlines for reporting progress on actions. Thanks to an automated report, the implementation status of the actions of the urban climate protection strategy can be easily retrieved and presented to decision-makers as required (e.g. resolution control for the IEK, city council enquiries). The platform facilitates access to the city's climate protection strategy and its implementation and enables many stakeholders to obtain the desired information quickly and clearly. In the first step, the platform is to be used to map the reduction path of the IEK for Dresden, to show the GHG savings for the key measures (from the data of the reduction path calculator) and to underpin this with the actions from the action portfolio. Further actions are to be added on an ongoing basis. For the award process, requirements for the software (specification) are to be jointly formulated by potential measure sponsors. Subsequently, the climate protection platform is to be used permanently for controlling actions. Example: in 2023, the city of Dortmund published its climate plan on a climate protection platform. This can be found under the term "Dortmund Climate Barometer". Direct link: https://www.dortmund.de/themen/umwelt-nachhaltigkeit-und-klimaschutz/klimaschutz-und-klimafolgenanpassung/klimabarometer/  |   |

|  Title: Financing municipal climate protection  |   |
|  Description:  |   |
|  According to the municipal task system, climate protection is still a voluntary, not a mandatory task. This leads to corresponding problems with regard to prioritising the task of climate protection when the local authority's financial scope for action is limited. The CoD should therefore advocate a corresponding strengthening of the task as part of the political discourse.  |   |
|  Furthermore, there is no standardised definition of what qualifies as a climate protection measure in the municipal context. As a rule, climate protection measures also have a positive impact on other areas (energy saving, health aspects), making it difficult to draw a clear distinction. Climate protection is a cross-sectional task and should therefore be taken into account in all municipal activities, including the preparation of the municipal budget. This applies in particular to investments. If a climate protection measure is economically viable, it should also be implemented. Economical climate protection measures must not be dispensed with in order to secure the overall budget in the event of cost increases. For the preparation of future budgets, it should also be examined how climate protection can be made (more) visible in the municipal budget and which expenses and investments should be prioritised with regard to achieving GHG-neutrality or where municipal expenses and investments may be an obstacle or even counteract the municipal climate protection goals.  |   |
|  In the future, the financing of actions in the area of climate protection will continue to compete with the financing of other municipal tasks. It is therefore important to examine alternative financing models and, if necessary, to make greater use of tried and tested solutions. The expansion of contracting solutions, for example, should be mentioned in this context. In addition, existing savings from the implementation of climate protection measures could be used to finance new climate investments as part of a fund model. Another possibility is an annual "climate budget". This budget could be based on the CO2 emissions of the CoD and a corresponding price per tonne of CO2. This "climate budget" would be available exclusively for financing climate protection measures.  |   |
|  Another point is the fulfilment of municipal tasks in the form of municipal associated companies, which must also be increasingly involved in the implementation of climate protection actions (see also action O.6-03).  |   |

There are already established procedures in the procurement process that have a positive impact on both climate protection and financial aspects. This applies, for example, to the life cycle assessment when analysing the economic viability of a purchase. These considerations should be focussed on even more in the future. In the future, it should also be examined whether it is possible to expand the criteria to include a climate protection assessment (including climate impact costs), which would lead to a more qualified assessment.

Objective: To secure a sustainable financing basis for municipal climate protection measures.

# Greenhouse gas-neutral Dresden 2040 action programme

Description: The expansion of the climate protection measures named in the Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Plan (IEK) into a coherent action programme represents an important step. This programme is to be continuously expanded in the coming years in order to reflect the target path set by the city council for achieving green house gas neutrality. Particular attention will be paid to clearly defining the municipal scope for action and at the same time integrating recommendations for action for stakeholders outside the CoD's remit.

New findings, technologies and experiences can be integrated into the planning process through continuous further development, which is ensured by the constant addition of actions. An adaptive approach is taken to ensure that the interim targets set are achieved. If interim targets are not met, actions are adjusted to ensure progress towards the overall target. This flexible and adaptable approach enables an effective response to changing conditions and challenges.

The action programme is to be published (in a reduced form) in order to promote the participation and understanding of urban society. Publication not only serves to provide information, but also creates a basis for citizen feedback and participation.

Responsibility for maintaining and implementing the actions lies with specific organisational units that contribute their expertise in the respective areas. These organisational units play a key role in the implementation of the actions and help to ensure that the set goals are achieved. The overall programme is continuously monitored and maintained by the Climate Protection and Adaptation Unit. This controlling ensures that the action programme is implemented efficiently, enables regular reviews of progress and helps to successfully achieve the overall goal of a greenhouse gas-neutral Dresden.

|  Description: The original municipal scope for action lies in the GHG-neutrality of its own properties and vehicle fleet as well as municipal emission sources. To this end, the goal of GHG-neutrality by 2035 is proposed for the CoD. This is in line with the approach taken by many local authorities or results in other federal states solely from the requirements of state laws. A separate implementation roadmap with corresponding concrete actions must be developed to realise this goal.  |   |

|  Description: Operationalising the process of a greenhouse gas-neutral administration (GHG-NV) requires a clear, systematic procedure. The following preparatory steps are necessary to set up the process in the city administration of CoD: ■ Clarification of the relevant actors, responsibilities and organisational structures for achieving the GHG-NV target ■ Clarification of processes and coordination formats ■ Develop target image together with the organisational units involved ■ Clarification of system boundaries according to operational, financial control approach or proportional approach ■ Clarification of the accounting framework: which emission sources are to be included in the GHG-NV (data availability) ■ Clarification of the existence of GHG emission sources in the city administration (organisational units with properties, vehicle fleet, business trips, procurement, etc.) ■ Materiality assessment of the climate protection aspects of the administration ■ Development of an overarching roadmap ■ Clarification of how to deal with compensation ■ Submission of a template for GHG-N management in the DB-OB to confirm the work processes Setting up the process and creating a corresponding template for the DB-OB is to be supported by external consultants. This will make it possible to draw on experience from other municipalities that have already started such a process (e.g. Munich).  |   |

|  Title: Monitoring and controlling concept  |   |
|  Description: Controlling of the Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Plan (IEK) takes place in an agile process due to the tight time frame until the target year. By adopting the IEK, the city council commissions the city administration to initiate and implement the actions, which are continuously expanded and modified. Concrete interim targets of the city's climate protection strategy are linked to the target of a greenhouse gas-neutral Dresden and are reviewed two years after achievement when the respective GHG inventory is submitted. This assessment enables deviations to be identified and the climate protection strategy to be adjusted.  |   |

Adjustments may also be necessary prior to realisation if framework conditions change fundamentally. Decision-makers are involved through dynamic processes, including readjustment, taking new actions and decision-making by the city council. A close dialogue between stakeholders, well-maintained data and regular monitoring ensure the effective implementation of the IEK and enable a well-founded assessment of target achievement.

Regularly comparing the greenhouse gas balance with the targets from the reduction pathway is crucial to ensure that the actions have the intended effect. Any deviations identified serve as a basis for adjusting the climate protection strategy and formulating new actions. The comparison of the GHG inventory thus becomes the central instrument for the transparent monitoring and control of IEK implementation.

The following specific tasks are to be performed as part of monitoring and controlling.

Linked to the decision control for the IEK:

Carry out annually
Obtaining the status of work and interviewing those involved
Presentation of the budget funds used for climate protection (coordinate procedure)
Present implementation status of IEK
Report on implementation status via climate protection platform (reporting interface from platform required)
Centralised and ongoing reporting by the participating departments and municipal companies via the climate protection platform
Submit a proposal for further activities required to achieve the goal

Close dialogue between the relevant players:

Continuous harmonisation and coordination of all parties involved
Ensuring effective implementation of the actions under the IEK
Promotion of a transparent exchange of information

Well-maintained data structure:

Regular updating of the data framework required
Updateability of data and assumptions on the reduction path
Continuous monitoring as an accurate and relevant basis for adaptation requirements

Summarised strategy for residual emissions

The residual emissions that will remain from 2030 until green house gas neutrality is achieved by 2040 in accordance with the target defined in the IEK are already presented in the Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Plan (IEK). The strategy for dealing with these residual emissions has therefore been comprehensively developed and integrated into the concept. A large part of this strategy has already been incorporated into the previous chapters, as the methodological approach to dealing with residual emissions was derived according to the same principles as the other actions.

The unavoidable residual emissions of 5% of 1990 GHG emissions, which must be offset in order to achieve the net zero target, are treated as follows: The remaining GHG emissions must then be balanced by "negative emissions". Possible technical processes for binding greenhouse gases are, for exampleBioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS),Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) orthe material binding of CO_{2} in green polymers (green naphtha).

The technical GHG sinks are currently still theoretical considerations or research statuses, but not yet market-ready broadband applications. It is also not clear how durable such storage or utilisation solutions for binding CO_{2} are. In addition, these solutions for capturing and storing CO_{2} require a great deal of energy and resources. The point is that technical CO_{2} sinks can therefore only make a small contribution to meeting climate protection targets.

One methodological problem that has not yet been solved is the avoidance of "double counting". There are no climate protection obligations below federal level in Germany - all measures at state or municipal level are voluntary. In order to rule out "double counting" of compensation projects below federal level with federal actions, a procedure is required for managing and weighting compensation payments below federal level. Such a procedure does not currently exist. As a result, local and regional climate protection projects can currently only be recognised informally as offsetting measures, as there is always a risk of double counting. Further expert discussion of the topic is required at federal, state and municipal level.

Natural CO_{2} sinks are actions in the areas of land use, land use change and forestry. The sinks account for around 21,000 CO_{2} tonnes per year in the city of Dresden. This means that they only have a minor offsetting effect compared to the greenhouse gases emitted.

In conclusion, it should be noted that technical (and natural) sinks are important in order to compensate for the (few) unavoidable residual GHG emissions. It remains to be seen in what form these can contribute to this in the long term. At present, the focus of climate protection should definitely be on the far greater and relevant potential for avoiding greenhouse gases.

### Module B-3 Indicators for monitoring, evaluation and learning

The evaluation of the city's climate protection strategy requires precise indicators that go beyond the BISKO balance sheet. The energy and GHG inventory already provides important indicators, especially when broken down into the commercial, industrial and private household sectors. This enables a detailed analysis of developments per consumer group.

Reviewing the local expansion of RE to the electricity supply is another crucial aspect. This can be done by evaluating data on the feed-in of EEG plants and analysing the market master data register. This information provides insights into the progress of the integration of RE into the local electricity grid.

Another indicator relates to the heat consumption of private households in relation to total living space. This indicator makes it possible to monitor developments in energy-efficient refurbishment and user behaviour. By analysing heat consumption in detail, it is possible to assess the extent to which actions to increase efficiency and change behaviour are being implemented.

An additional indicator to illustrate the reduction of greenhouse gases could be the relationship between the energy consumption of companies and their economic performance. This indicator makes it possible to assess the efficiency of companies in terms of their energy consumption and serves as an important factor in the assessment of economic sustainability.

As part of the further development of the monitoring and controlling concept of the City of Dresden, a set of indicators is being developed that enables a continuous and concrete review of the development of individual areas and is based on the indicators of the CCC. The effort involved in obtaining the necessary data must be reduced to an acceptable level so that the indicators can be updated annually together with the preparation of the GHG inventory.

The indicators mentioned focus on the main shares of the city's GHG emissions that are based on the use of final energy (stationary energy and transport). The accounting methods for other emission sources have not yet been sufficiently determined, meaning that the impact pathway in the area of non-energy emissions cannot yet be analysed in the municipal context. An example of this is the survey of GHG emissions from agriculture, which is derived from national key figures and only determines GHG emissions on the basis of livestock numbers and known agricultural areas. These figures cannot be used to identify a trend towards sustainable and climate-friendly agriculture at municipal level. These would only show average trends at national level or, depending on the data source, at state level.

The Climate Advisory Board advises the Mayor and the City Council on all matters relating to climate protection and adaptation to climate change. It consists of representatives of the City Council as well as knowledgeable residents from the areas of higher education institutions, municipal companies, environmental, transport and business associations who are to be appointed by the City Council in an election.

The Climate Advisory Board comments on drafts and amendments to the City of Dresden's fundamental plans and programmes in the energy, mobility, housing and nature conservation sectors in good time before the City Council adopts its resolutions. The Climate Advisory Board also deals with the central issues of climate change adaptation in the City of Dresden. At the request of the City Council, one of its committees or the Mayor, the Climate Advisory Board comments on specific individual issues relating to climate protection or climate change adaptation in the City of Dresden.

The composition of the Climate Advisory Board is regulated by a corresponding statute in conjunction with the main statutes. The parliamentary groups of the City Council, universities, companies and transport and environmental organisations are represented on the Climate Advisory Board. In connection with the establishment and coordination of the Climate Advisory Board, administrative work is required for the preparation and follow-up of the meetings, the preparation of documents for the Climate Advisory Board, the drafting and issuing of the Board's statements and the monitoring of the meetings (minutes, etc.).

On 18 April 2024, the resolution on the Climate Advisory Board was confirmed by the City Council.

## Central Climate Protection Strategy Coordination Centre

With the amendment of the main statutes (V1938/22), the Mayor was instructed to set up a "Central Climate Protection Strategy" coordination centre. The tasks of this coordination centre are carried out by the Mayor's management conference/advice service and prepared by the Climate Protection and Adaptation Unit. The tasks include

Ensure an overview of the various concepts and projects in the CoD with climate protection relevance (e.g. IEK, climate change adaptation concept, DMP+, INSEK, sustainability strategy)
Ensuring the acceleration of the central climate protection strategy (GHG-neutrality in accordance with the IEK resolution) in city administration projects. Coordination of the interfaces between the individual concepts and projects
Submitting centralised funding applications for the entire city administration and its own companies (e.g. funding according to municipal guidelines)
Ensuring the exchange of information between the various players in the CoD and relevant players in urban society

#

With regard to the associated companies, the Mayor or the Deputy Mayor representing him as Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the members of the City Council as elected members of the Supervisory Board can represent the interests of CoD to the extent permitted by their function.

An annual resolution review to the City Council and the public on the implementation of climate protection targets is linked to the current GHG inventory and is carried out additionally and in more detail, in particular including the decarbonisation of the energy and heat supply, and is sent to both the Climate Advisory Board and the members of the City Council. In particular, it will be placed on the agenda of the Environment and Climate Committee for information.

## Climate steering group

The existing cross-departmental Climate Steering Group (SG), chaired by the Deputy Mayor for Environment and Climate, Law and Order and representing the Lord Mayor, advises on important cross-departmental decisions on the implementation of climate protection and climate adaptation on the basis of the half-yearly information and meets in preparation for the Lord Mayor's official consultation.

Important cross-departmental actions are, in particular, those that affect several business areas, key issues of budget and staff planning, prioritisation within the administration or cooperation with the associated companies. Other members of the Climate Steering Group are the Deputy Mayor responsible for the topics to be discussed. Proposals for the topics of the steering group can be submitted to the Climate Protection and Climate Change Adaptation Unit from all divisions, companies and project groups.

If necessary, proposals for decisions are drawn up on the basis of the preliminary deliberations of the Climate Steering Group, which are then discussed and decided on in the Mayor's official consultation and submitted to the City Council for a decision.

## Climate Protection and Climate Change Adaptation Unit

The Climate Protection and Adaptation Unit is the central administrative unit for the development and implementation of the energy and climate protection concept. It currently consists of six people. It also prepares the official consultation of the Mayor (coordination centre) on the topic of climate and establishes the connection between the various concepts and the implementation of the IEK, such as the Dresden Mobility Plan 2035+ and the Integrated Urban Development Concept (INSEK). The staff unit is also responsible for the planning and implementation of municipal heat planning and the associated heat turnaround dialogue.

## Formation of project groups:

The formation of project groups has proven to be an effective instrument for interdepartmental cooperation on key topics. These can involve co-operation between departments and municipal enterprises as well as municipal associated companies and other external players. Successful project group work requires the agreement of a common project objective, the appointment of a project manager and a joint working agreement with a project objective.

In certain project phases, other participants may be involved. Project groups can be formed between those agreed or on behalf of the Mayor or Deputy Mayor. As a rule, the responsible Deputy Mayor or

O

head of department in charge coordinates and monitors the work of the project groups independently, unless special regulations are required. In order to be able to make proposals for acceleration and implementation as well as for technical controlling, the Climate Protection and Climate Change Adaptation Unit needs contact persons for queries and agreements in addition to those responsible in the hierarchy (Deputy Mayor, office and plant managers) in important OUs and operations. These contact persons communicate directly with the Climate Protection and Adaptation Unit, ensure communication within their organisational unit and prepare decisions at the necessary level in a binding and swift manner. It is proposed that they be designated as climate change officers for their respective organisational units.

# Establishment and stabilisation of a regular climate protection exchange format in the CoD:

In the course of updating the Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan, a temporary IEK project group was set up. This was intended to cover the duration of the update. Due to the express wish of those involved in the project group to continue exchanging information on a regular basis after completion of the update, the idea was born to transform the IEK project group into an informal working format at working level. In contrast to the project groups of the Climate Protection Working Group, no specific objectives are imposed on this exchange format and there is no obligation to report formally. This informal format is intended to serve as a dialogue platform where participants can exchange views on climate protection topics and issues within the administration. The aim is to create an open forum in which ideas can flow freely. Unlike the focussed project groups, space is deliberately created here for informal discussions. The IEK project group in this new format is thus intended to be a kind of nucleus for new projects and actions in the area of climate protection. In 2024, this format will be used to discuss specific topics within the framework of the EU Urban Mission, with a focus on areas outside the core group. Preparations for the acquisition of a climate protection platform are also on the agenda in order to improve the coordination and management of the various initiatives. The format also serves to provide regular information on ongoing climate protection activities within the administration. In this informal setting, participants can gain a holistic overview of progress and challenges, which creates the basis for effective collaboration and future projects.

# Municipal shareholdings and companies:

The CoD fulfils its municipal tasks not only within the framework of the so-called "core administration", but also in the legal form of its own company and in companies organised under private law (mainly GmbH and AG). Own-account enterprises are not legally independent. Accordingly, they are included in the CoD balance sheet. These are in detail

Own operation of the Heinrich Schütz Conservatory
Own IT services
Own day-care centres
Municipal cemetery and funeral services
Dresden Municipal Hospital
Own operation of sports facilities Dresden

The municipal investment companies prepare their own GHG inventory. The first balance sheet of the municipal investment companies is to be presented for the 2022 balance sheet year, initially focussing on Scope 1 and 2. On this basis, suitable actions to achieve GHG-neutrality by 2035 are to be developed

in line with the requirements for the city administration. The next step will be to expand the balance sheet to include Scope 3 and expand the actions accordingly.

# 4.1.2 Multi-level governance:

The CoD plays a decisive role in communicating overarching responsibilities at state and national level. The City of Dresden is a member of the Saxon Association of Towns and Municipalities (SSG). This organisation represents municipal interests at regional (Saxon) level. Dresden is also a member of the German Association of Cities and is represented in the various specialised commissions at political and technical level. As part of the EU City Mission, Dresden is also a member of the informal stronGERcities network, which regularly (every fortnight) discusses the progress of the CCC at employee level.

As part of these formats, the CoD initiates a constructive exchange with the federal government and the Free State of Saxony regarding the aspects identified below. This includes not only the transfer of relevant information, but also active participation and cooperation with the national authorities in order to strengthen the effectiveness of climate protection measures:

Create framework conditions for increased expansion of RE in the electricity sector in line with the targets of the Climate Protection Act and expansion path in line with the EEG 2023 (reference electricity),
Creation of an improved regulatory framework and improved subsidy conditions to accelerate the switch from fossil-fuelled heating systems to renewable solutions and to reduce the energy requirements of residential and non-residential buildings in a socially acceptable manner,
Implementation of the hydrogen strategy for the provision of largely GHG-neutral ("green") hydrogen with accelerated ramp-up of the hydrogen infrastructure and domestic hydrogen. The introduction of a hydrogen system must not lead to a lock-in of fossil structures - transitional solutions must be limited to a short period of time in a binding and plannable manner,
Improve the incentive system for switching to climate-neutral energy sources and resources, e.g. through appropriate  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  pricing over the life cycle. Pricing should be based on the expected follow-up costs. Climate-damaging resource utilisation must not be more cost-effective than climate-friendly resource utilisation,
Revision of grid fee structures for the fair financing of climate grids
Harmonise distribution grid fees and equalise regions affected by strong RE expansion,
Implement flexible grid fee structures for controllable loads (in accordance with BNetzA regulations $^{19}$ ),
Limiting future increases in emissions from the German natural gas mix (influence of LNG gas and non-conventional natural gas sources) through contractually binding requirements for climate-friendly production conditions in producing countries and regular inspections of plants.

## 4.1.3 Involvement of relevant stakeholders:

### The public

Climate protection requires not only technological and political solutions, but also the active participation of urban society and effective public relations work. Involving the community in climate protection initiatives not only creates an awareness of the urgency of the problem, but also promotes broad support for appropriate actions.

Raising public awareness promotes identification with climate protection goals and strengthens the sense of responsibility at local level. By involving different interest groups, diverse perspectives can be taken into account and more effective, accepted solutions can be developed. Public relations work plays a decisive role in clarifying complex issues and reducing reservations about environmentally friendly actions. Transparent communication about progress, challenges and possible changes creates trust and enables informed participation of the population in the climate protection process. The active participation of the community also promotes identification with climate protection goals and strengthens the sense of responsibility at local level.

For effective participation and public relations work in the area of climate protection, it is advisable to develop a structured participation concept and a communication plan. These instruments help to clearly define the objectives, target groups, communication channels and activities. In future, these instruments should be utilised to a greater extent in the CoD in order to bundle and consolidate the participation and public relations work carried out by many stakeholders in the CoD. This may also require support from external service providers or the reorganisation of communication in climate protection.

### Objective:

Creating awareness,
Activation of the urban community,
Transparency on climate protection activities,
Identification with climate protection strategy

Public relations work plays a decisive role in municipal climate protection, especially when it comes to anchoring the municipal climate protection strategy on a broad level and actively mobilising society. A first step is to build on many years of public relations work and to update and systematically stabilise it around the new objective. This not only enables the dissemination of information, but also creates a reliable point of contact for citizens to obtain continuous information on the progress of municipal climate protection.

The integration of the city's climate protection strategy on a broad scale requires targeted and transparent communication. Various means are to be utilised for this, including press releases, potentially a regular newsletter, the constant updating of the website and the use of social media. Through these channels, the Integrated Energy and Climate Concept (IEK) will be presented to the public in a clear manner in order to inform citizens comprehensively about the IEK content.

It is essential to actively involve the public in the process of implementing the IEK. This can be done through targeted information events and dialogue platforms where citizens are not only informed but also invited to contribute their opinions and ideas. Transparency in communication creates trust and enables the participatory organisation of municipal climate protection. Continuous and appealing public relations work thus not only promotes acceptance, but also the active participation of the population in the climate protection process.

# Mobility: MOBIdalog 2035+

The Dresden MOBIdialogue 2035+ was set up in order to take the diversity of interests in the city's society into account as much as possible. A total of 62 people belong to this discussion forum: randomly selected Dresden residents as well as representatives from science, politics, associations, organisations and institutions. Together, they think about and discuss future mobility in Dresden and prepare decisions. The MOBIdialogue 2035+ started its work in summer 2021 and meets twice a year. The composition is broken down as follows:

Members of the city council (25 seats): The City of Dresden wrote to 1,000 randomly selected Dresden residents and personally invited them to participate in the MOBIdialog 2035+. 97 applications were received in the online portal of the city planning office. As more applications were received than there were places available, a representative selection had to be made. This was done according to the criteria of a good distribution by urban area, a gender balance and a mix of age groups.
Advisory Board (2 seats incl. Chairman)
Political groups (8 seats)
Initiatives, associations and clubs (18 seats): ADAC Sachsen e. V. (2 seats), Architektenkammer Sachsen, Arbeitskreis Stadtplanung, DresdenZero, Dresden zu Fuß (local group of the German Pedestrian Traffic Association FUSS e.

# Mobility: online citizen participation

In order to involve the general public in the development of the Dresden Mobility Plan 2035+, online citizen participation takes place in every planning phase. The first took place in 2022 to evaluate the key objectives for mobility. The second online citizen participation will take place in February/March 2024 with the Mobil-O-Mat on actions for future, climate-neutral mobility in Dresden. Further information at 4.2.

# Economy:

Regular dialogue with companies is a strategic goal of the City of Dresden and promotes a common approach to climate-friendly business practices and, above all, serves to share experiences.

Sustainability round table with Dresden companies: The sustainability round table serves as an instrument for implementing the city's climate protection strategy (IEK) and the CCC as part of the EU city mission. The aim of the regulars' table is the exchange between municipal and business stakeholders (best practice examples, presentations, etc.), general commitment of companies to the climate neutrality target path, identification of relevant contributions to GHG reduction by individual companies, agreement on monitoring procedures, publicising progress towards climate neutrality).

Information days for Dresden companies: As part of the long-established "Information Days for Dresden Companies" series of events, the topic of "Sustainability" was selected for the first time in 2023. An event on different topics will be held every quarter, with the topics being selected via a survey of Dresden's business community. The series of events organised by the City of Dresden's business service provides the city's companies with a unique opportunity to find out about topics relevant to climate protection and to enter into dialogue with each other. The series enables a
#

Dresden. Diezqcu

Action plan for climate neutrality 2030

#

lively exchange of ideas, best practices and experiences between the participating companies. The focus is not only on providing information, but also on promoting interactive dialogue. Participants have the opportunity to learn from each other, discover synergies and develop sustainable solutions together. This framework is also intended to enable the CoD to identify the need for action and necessary support from the city administration in order to (re)organise the business location in a sustainable and future-proof manner. This series of events therefore not only emphasises the CoD's commitment to climate protection, but also strengthens networking and cooperation between local companies in order to jointly contribute to a sustainable and climate-friendly economy.

Supporting Dresden's economy in the transformation of energy infrastructures, including hydrogen supply: Dresden's economy is to be actively supported on the way to providing climate-neutral energy sources. This concerns the following topics, among others:
Conversion of the existing gas network to transport green hydrogen
Inclusion in municipal heat planning (e.g. waste heat potential)
Networking of stakeholders for the realisation of innovative PV concepts, etc.

The involvement of those responsible in the city administration in preliminary enquiries and (building) applications as well as contact with the approval authorities and support in negotiations, including moderation in the event of conflicts, for example when connecting companies to the hydrogen core network, should be guaranteed. These actions will ensure that companies can successfully switch to climate-neutral energy sources in good time and successfully manage the associated adjustments to the energy infrastructure. Objective:

Targeted exchange of information between municipal and economic players (e.g. in the identification of cross-sectoral demand drivers as well as land potential)
Demand-driven expansion of the hydrogen network for additional customers
Efficient approval procedure and accelerated decision-making process (advice/support in identifying suitable route options and preparing applications for approval)
Support with social communication

# Culture - Climate network

As part of the "Culture for Future" programme, the "Dresden Charter for Sustainability in the Cultural Sector" was created and signed by 37 municipal, state and independent cultural institutions. The central objective of this charter is to support a comprehensive sustainability transformation of the cultural sector. A sustainability strategy is to be successfully implemented in all of Dresden's cultural institutions by 2030. Significant changes must take place over the next three years within the Fields of action of energy efficiency/resource efficiency (themed year 2024), climate-friendly mobility (themed year 2025) and risk management (themed year 2026) in order to make cultural institutions fit for the future.

This requires network management. This should look after the network and thus make the presence and explosive nature of the topic visible within the participating partners. It should continue, stabilise and further expand the cooperation and networking activities between the cultural institutions sponsored by the municipality and municipally funded stakeholders that have been initiated as part of "Culture for Future". Introduced exchange formats are to be further developed and the transfer of knowledge beyond Dresden is to be established.
#

Dresden. Diezqcu

Action plan for climate neutrality 2030

#

The network management should also contribute to communication between the participating cultural institutions and their visitors and urban society and thus use cultural means to promote the necessary change in awareness and required individual behavioural changes, without which the climate crisis cannot be overcome. The network's work will be monitored and reported on continuously throughout its entire duration. All network content will be transferred to a digital platform and made available to the public for knowledge transfer. In addition, the network platform will bundle participation processes for projects and plans. It should offer the opportunity to present these ideas to a selected user group or the public in order to develop them further.

An important goal of the network is to inform the public about the sustainable changes within the respective network member. In addition, the creation of a word-image brand helps to support the work of the network in terms of communication and to create a recognition value for its work. The Enabling City Transformation (ECT) mission call is to be used for the partial financing of this project.

## Education - schools and children and young people:

Implementation of environmental education lessons
Climate schools: Anchoring aspects of climate change, climate protection and climate adaptation holistically in school activities
Model municipality: The CoD is one of 50 model municipalities nationwide for education for sustainable development in a municipal context (BiNaKom): in this way, the school authorities are working together with schools and civil society to implement the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Pilot testing of a youth climate council in cooperation with BUND Sachsen (Dresden, Leipzig) for 18 months

## Energy

In order to actively satisfy the need for information on municipal heat planning as the City of Dresden, a contact point is needed in Dresden for the numerous and mostly localised questions relating to a secure, greenhouse gas-neutral and affordable energy supply. To this end, STESAD GmbH is to quickly set up a municipal energy advice centre to support Dresden's citizens and companies (Energielotse Dresden), which will complement existing services offered by other providers and partners. It closes existing information gaps and either directs citizens and companies to existing relevant services and partners or, if not otherwise possible, provides its own information and advisory services. The energy pilot also provides important information on the municipal heat planning, which is scheduled for publication in 2025. The role of the energy pilot is not to provide individual technical advice, but rather to provide information on general heating supply and energy topics and refer people to suitable experts as required.

## Involvement of vulnerable groups

According to the European Commission's "Fit for 55" climate package, part of the revenue from the emissions trading system for buildings and road transport is to be used as part of a climate social fund. Vulnerable groups are to be explicitly supported. At federal level, there is already a short study by the UBA, which offers a proposal for the definition and quantification of vulnerable households in Germany,

determines their CO2 cost burden and provides a cursory estimate of the investment requirements for building energy efficiency measures for vulnerable households. In Dresden, vulnerable groups and social aspects are considered in the context of municipal heat planning.

|  Social aspects of Dresden's municipal heat planning  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Municipal heat planning takes social aspects into account in various ways in order to contribute to the affordability of heating costs for citizens. The main ways are as follows:  |   |
|  1. participation of key stakeholders for the social aspects in the heat planning process as part of a specialised working group on "Housing and affordable heat" and as part of the heat competence group.  |   |
|   | The specialist working group "Housing and affordable heating" consists of representatives from the housing industry, the social welfare office, the consumer protection centre, the rent protection association and a public funding institute. The working group has met once so far and has already formulated key framework conditions and important information for the heat planning process. These range from new pricing mechanisms for district heating, the limited savings potential due to past refurbishment activities, the risk of large rent increases due to disproportionately high refurbishment measures, which in extreme cases would force lower-income people to move, as their housing may then no longer be considered needs-based and social benefits would no longer be paid for it. Such and similar information is taken into account as far as possible in the heat planning process and actions are derived where necessary (see point 5). There is also an advisory body, the Heat Competence Group, in which scientists in particular provide methodological support for the process and also pay attention to social aspects.  |
|  2. informing the public at an early stage and providing feedback for the heat planning process in specific dialogue / event formats  |   |
|   | The City of Dresden is organising various information events to reach a broad public and enable dialogue on social aspects as well. A first so-called Heat Turning Dialogue I already took place on 15.04.2024, which covered a variety of topics including the affordability of hydrogen, for example. In addition, there will be on-site information events in parts of Dresden, particularly focussing on areas with critical framework conditions for a socially acceptable heat transformation. The preliminary conclusion will be the Heat Turning Dialogue II in the second quarter of 2025, at which the draft of the final municipal heat planning will be presented. In addition, the action portfolio (see point 5) must include information support, particularly for social aspects of the implementation of the municipal heat planning. The "Elo" energy pilot (see point 3) will be one instrument for this.  |
|  3. setting up a municipal, digital energy guide to provide citizens with individual, localised information and options for action at the lowest possible threshold  |   |
|   | The "Elo" energy pilot will be set up as a digital, interactive information platform in parallel to the heat planning process. Among other things, it will contain a digital energy twin that provides citizens with localised information. Using a kind of chatbot AI, it will also answer questions that are as personalised as possible, particularly on costs, subsidies, gradual conversions and refurbishment measures, in order to ensure affordability. It also refers the user to the right contact person from a strong local advisory network  |

|   | for the relevant enquiry. These include the consumer advice centre, the Saxon Energy Agency (SAENA), energy consultants, funding and financing institutions and the heating network operator. The implementation of this action, which is also important from a social perspective, is made possible by the EU Pilot Call funding of the "EnAct4Cities" project. Implementation and continuation will be integrated into the municipal heat planning action programme (see point 5).  |
| --- | --- |
|  4. identification of heat supply areas (technology preselection) based on the most cost-effective technology for the buildings in the respective area  |   |
|   | According to the WPG, municipal heat planning must identify so-called heat supply areas. This means recommending a priority type of supply, i.e. either a heating network, a hydrogen network or a decentralised supply solution, in an area. In order to make the selection of the type of supply as cost-effective and thus as socially acceptable as possible, a comprehensive heat planning toolset is used in Dresden's municipal heat planning. This includes different assumptions for various future developments with regard to technological and economic parameters, such as the development of heat pump, electricity, hydrogen or CO2 costs. A scenario calculator uses these assumptions and calculates the costs for all buildings in Dresden for all types of heat supply available for the respective building and identifies the most favourable for the respective scenario. In an iterative u process, the plausibility and any additional costs for network expansion and conversion are then taken into account and finally a target scenario is derived that minimises the overall costs of the transformation.  |
|  5. evaluation of specific indicators with as much spatial resolution as possible, such as the "share of wallet", which represents the share of total annualised heating costs in current and future household income  |   |
|   | On the basis of statistical distributions of income data, including from the municipal citizens' survey, we generate an indicator in combination with the determined current and future heating costs (see point 1) that forms the ratio between heating costs and statistical household income. The average for 2021 in Dresden is approx. 3.9%. In the future, it will rise to an average of around 4.5%, although there is a wide range. However, there are also individual buildings where this value rises to over 10%. Accordingly, the indicator is intended to help identify areas where a critical situation could arise from a social perspective as a result of the transformation of the heat supply.  |
|  6. development of targeted actions for areas, buildings or, if applicable, groups of people in the target scenario that are assessed as critically or cost-intensively burdened on the basis of the indicator evaluation (see 4.)  |   |
|   | When developing measures, which is an essential part of municipal heat planning, care is taken to ensure that social distortions are avoided as far as possible. In order to recognise this at an early stage, the spatially resolved "share of wallet" indicator from point 5 is used for orientation. This can indicate, for example, in which area a supplementary municipal subsidy for investments in a heating network or effective building refurbishment measures might be necessary or where the designation of future urban development areas, e.g. as part of ERDF funding or as a redevelopment area, makes sense. In addition, actions for the continuous provision of information to citizens, including on social aspects, as well as the implementation and continuation of the "Elo" energy pilot are included.  |

# Dresden Future City Process - Citizens' Lab

Dresden initiated a future process in 2015, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Together with Dresden's citizens, administration and scientific support - Leibniz Institute of Ecological Urban and Regional Development (IOER) and the knowledge architects at TU Dresden - research was conducted into how the path to a sustainable and innovative city can succeed. The aim of the competition was to design a holistic and sustainable Vision 2030+ for Dresden together with citizens, science, local politics, business and administration, to plan the path to this vision and to implement it in the form of projects. The implementation took place in Field tests, i.e. with scientific support (test areas in public spaces). Successfully initiated or implemented projects have given Dresden the status of a "city of the future" with a model character. The projects dealt with the recycling of materials (material mediation), the sustainable use of food and the climate-friendly design of school playgrounds.

The Bürger labor Dresden is an interactive, central location in the heart of the city centre: a transfer space for dialogue between the city administration and citizens. In this low-threshold and largely barrier-free space, new forms of participation and sustainable, innovative ideas for modern urban society are developed. The Bürger labor Dresden can be used free of charge by associations and initiatives.

With the current implementation of the Smart City action "Smart Participation", digital tools of the city administration are being tested in direct exchange with citizens in order to create a smart coordination centre and an interactive transfer space in the heart of Dresden in the long term.

# Innovative participation formats: Mobile-O-Mat

With the interactive Mobil-O-Mat, citizens can actively help shape what the mobility of the future should look like. At the end, a broad picture of public opinion emerges from all the participants. This makes it possible to see how citizens visualise mobility and transport in Dresden. Using the interactive participation tool Mobil-O-Mat, all Dresden residents and people from the region were able to plan their mobility of the future for the state capital from 5 February to 17 March 2024. In addition, interested parties were able to meet with transport planners from the City of Dresden on 5 afternoons in the city's citizens' laboratory and use the Mobil-O-Mat there.

There are four goals for the Mobil-O-Mat:

climate-friendly mobility
travelling socially, healthily and safely
urban-compatible transport system
accessibility and economic stability

The Mobil-O-Mat simulates the effects of each decision and shows how these set goals are influenced. A certain value is stored for each action, which is paid into the four targets. Their status slowly changes colour in the display from grey to light green and dark green. The more completely the participants achieve the targets, the more balanced the planning for Dresden will be. With the Mobil-O-Mat, each participant has made a selection of measures and submitted their personal set of measures.

Public participation with the Mobil-O-Mat is now complete. Over 6,600 people from Dresden and the region took the opportunity to playfully help shape the transport planning of the future. A quarter of

the participants also provided valuable information on transport planning in the city of Dresden. In addition to the online participation of the Mobil-O-Mat, the Office for Urban Planning and Mobility offered six open discussions with transport experts in the Citizens' Lab. 25 people took advantage of the opportunity to play through the Mobil-O-Mat directly on site in the town hall, asking comprehension and technical questions and discussing current transport issues. The results of this public participation are incorporated into the Dresden Mobility Plan 2035+.

# Residential courtyard design - climate change adaptation and citizenship

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall (1990), Dresden's neighbourhoods have developed in different ways. It has become clear that there are major social challenges in certain neighbourhoods. This is why the City of Dresden is focusing even more strongly on neighbourhoods with special development needs and pursuing holistic and cooperative neighbourhood development, such as in the Prohlis district. By the end of 2022, the City of Dresden had drawn up the "Prohlis 2030+ Masterplan" together with residents and institutional stakeholders. An important goal of the state capital is to further improve the quality of life and amenities in Prohlis. The many large and green residential courtyards, which provide a pleasant climate and offer potential for attractive places to exercise and spend time, offer great added value for the district.

The inner courtyard within Spreewalder Strasse, Prohliser Allee and Georg-Palitzsch-Strasse was selected as the pilot for an ideas workshop on residential courtyard design. Part of this residential courtyard is owned by the municipality and is available as an open space with development potential. The communal area in the inner courtyard is currently fenced off and not open to the public. An ideas workshop was held in September 2022 to design the inner courtyard.

TU Dresden provided methodological support for the ideas workshop and used the digital tool U-Code. The inner courtyard and its features (e.g. large green areas) were digitally recorded and displayed on a screen for all participants to see during the ideas workshop. The aim of the event was to collect and develop ideas for the inner courtyard design together with the residents present and to visualise the results in a virtual 3D model at the same time. At the same time, actions for climate adaptation were examined.

# Training and deployment of climate coaches

In order to make the topic of behavioural change and energy saving more concrete, the concept of climate coaches was born and implemented at district level (Johannstadt district). Citizens were supported by climate coaches over a certain period of time in their everyday lives. The climate coaches pointed out where CO2 could be successfully saved at home or during leisure time. In discussions with the households, they found out where further savings could be made. The climate coaches provide advice, tips and ideas and remain in contact with the households for an individually determined period of time.

# Johannstadt climate coaches - Johannstadt.de

The successful concept is now to be expanded and further promoted. Additional volunteer climate coaches are being trained in the city districts and localities to advise other residents on ways to save CO2 in a target group-oriented manner and based on their own personal experience (special target groups may include schoolchildren, senior citizens, migrants and the financially disadvantaged).

The training and deployment of climate coaches in the city districts and localities promotes climate protection awareness, education on CO2 avoidance and concrete local commitment and networking. This reaches people who otherwise cannot be reached through general public relations work. The climate ambassadors are trained in various modules and empowered to pass on their knowledge. In this way, residents are sensitised to the topic of climate protection in everyday life at a low threshold and empowered to take action themselves. If desired by the local council or borough, small project ideas can also be developed in the course of the consultation and, if necessary, financed via the local budgets.

# Foundation of a youth climate council by BUND

As part of the updating of the energy and climate protection concept (IEK), school pupils were also involved. Based on this commitment, the idea was developed to formalise the participation of young people (14-17 years) and to establish a youth climate council that can contribute more effectively to the public discourse on climate protection. The project focuses on the intersection of promoting democracy, youth participation, climate protection and climate adaptation. The aim is to incorporate the ideas, wishes and visions of young people into the city's climate protection policy. The Youth Climate Council

builds on the work of climate working groups in schools, which are then represented on the Youth Climate Council. The project is supported by the Dresden Regional Group of the German Federation for the Environment and Nature Conservation (BUND), Saxony Regional Association. Discussions are currently being held with the city administration regarding the funding and implementation of the project.

# Participation in the AGORA Climate Change Adaptation Project - EU Climate Adaptation Mission

The City of Dresden and various stakeholders from Dresden are participating in the EU-funded AGORA project, which supports the overall objectives of the EU mission on climate change adaptation. The aim is to promote transformation processes in different social, economic and political contexts through transdisciplinary instruments and approaches. The focus is on democracy, climate justice, gender equality and equity as well as climate change adaptability and empowering citizens to proactively support decision-making processes.

The City of Dresden is acting as a pilot region. The basis for the work with various stakeholders is the current draft of the climate change adaptation strategy of the City of Dresden, which serves as the starting point for the discussions. Relevant stakeholders from the entire city are brought together in various workshops and using different methods. The focus so far has been on climate risks and adaptation needs and challenges, as well as on identifying what has already been done and still needs to be done by both local administrations and other relevant stakeholders.

# Energy game - NEUTRAL PATH: Energise

As an innovative new tool for activating and involving citizens, a board game was created as part of the EU project NEUTRAL PATH: Energise.

The aim is for players to engage with positive energy districts. By drawing various action cards, players learn behaviours and habits that save or waste energy. By using product and service cards on sustainable technologies or actions, players can actively transform their own district into a zero-energy district and win the game. The money available must also be used wisely.

Figure 4-2View of the prototype (German) of the "ENERGIZE" board game

The aim of the game is to sensitise families and especially children and young people to the issues of the energy transition, energy saving and heating in a fun and simple way. An important realisation of the game is that doing nothing (i.e. investing nothing) does not lead to achieving the goal and thus to winning.

Once the final prototypes have been completed, the game will be trialled in various public formats. It is important that the game is accompanied by experts who can explain the game and its background and thus enter into dialogue with people.
Outlook and next steps

The submission of the CCC in September 2024 marks the first milestone in the climate protection strategy up to 2030. This lays the foundation for adapting the CCC/IEK-DMP35+. The IEK action portfolio will be continuously developed throughout the city, thus ensuring the iteration of the CCC. In concrete terms, the iteration of the CCC for 2026 means that only changes compared to the first submission status in September 2024 will be reported. In addition, further commitments will be collected and stakeholders activated for structural urban climate protection work. The aim of the iteration is to enrich the climate protection strategy and the systemic approach through a deeper understanding of the framework conditions and necessary adjustments and to close current gaps.

### Co-operation

Climate protection can only succeed together. The City of Dresden is already working with selected stakeholders in the city on climate protection in a variety of forms and on a project basis in various areas. Examples include formats such as the sustainability round table of Dresden's business community, the Culture for Future sustainability process of Dresden's cultural sector and the participation committee for the Dresden Mobility Plan MOBIdialog 2035+. These processes are to be systematised and embedded in an overarching city-wide climate protection participation strategy, whereby the stakeholder-specific approach will continue to be pursued and expanded. The IEK/CCC and the process for gaining commitments for the CCC provide a framework that contributes to activating the urban ecosystem for climate protection.

### Evaluation and monitoring

As part of the further development of the monitoring and controlling concept of the City of Dresden, a set of indicators is being developed that enables a continuous and concrete review of the development of individual areas and is based on the indicators of the CCC and goes beyond the previous GHG inventory. The energy and GHG inventory already provides important indicators, especially when broken down into the commercial, industrial and private household sectors. This enables a detailed analysis of developments per consumer group, but must be further developed to include additional building blocks for describing green house gas neutrality in terms of the territorial principle. In the IEK, this topic is already described in the "Monitoring and controlling" package of measures. It states that monitoring and controlling must above all be systematised and transformed into a clear, continuous and consistent process. The indicators are updated annually together with the preparation of the GHG inventory and other monitoring and reporting instruments (e.g. resolution controls). This also includes digitising the monitoring of measures using a web-based climate protection platform.

# 6.1 Decarbonisation concept for district heating

The conversion and expansion of the district heating system requires considerable financial and human resources, which are, however, limited. The individual potentials must therefore be examined and qualified for implementation step by step. With the help of permanent monitoring of the economic feasibility of individual decarbonisation potentials and the achievement of the target of complete decarbonisation of district heating in Dresden, an optimal and continuously updated decarbonisation path can be determined. The basis for this continuous monitoring are scenarios and price time series from a fundamental model to map possible developments, which are adapted to the current political framework conditions, as well as a heat demand forecast for the city of Dresden.

In order to decarbonise district heating, SachsenEnergie AG is currently planning to implement the measures shown in Illustration 6-1 which are shown as milestones up to the year 2045.

# Low Ex - reduction of the mains temperatures

Low Ex means lowering the temperature level in the district heating network. This means that heat losses, which are currently around 15 Percent, can be reduced in the district heating network. A lower temperature level also enables better feed-in of renewable heat into the network and cost-effective heat storage in unpressurised large heat storage tanks (temperature level  $&lt; 100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ). In addition, the thermal stress on the plastic casing pipes used in the district heating network is reduced, thereby increasing their service life. This potential is one of the key prerequisites for the further decarbonisation of district heating. In order to be able to operate the district heating system with lower flow temperatures even in winter (nominal design case), it is necessary to redesign the heat exchangers in the approximately 8,000 consumption points in the district heating network and to reduce the network return temperature from the customer systems. This action is therefore one of the long-term goals with a time horizon for full implementation by 2035/2040. Until all customer systems have been fully converted, the network will continue to be operated at higher temperature parameters during periods with very high load requirements (a few hundred hours per year) for hydraulic reasons. For the remaining and therefore predominant part of the year, however, a low-ex mode of operation is already possible today.

# Installation of large heat pumps

Heat pumps can raise low temperature levels to usable temperature levels for district heating using electrical energy, environmental or waste heat.

Several large heat pump projects are currently being planned (Table 6-). Due to the considerable challenges involved in determining an exact location, clarifying the ownership structure and the economic operation of the heat pumps, it cannot be assumed that all projects can be realised at the present time.

Table 6- : Overview of large heat pump projects, status

Ring 30 - Waste treatment and recycling plant

Together with Stadtreinigung Dresden GmbH, SachsenEnergie AG is planning the construction and operation of a thermal waste utilisation plant in the form of a substitute fuel cogeneration plant.

With the construction of its own plant in Dresden and its connection to CoD's central district heating network, up to 80 Percent of the energy contained in residual waste can be utilised. By pretreating and drying the waste, recyclable materials still contained in the residual waste can also be fed back into material cycles and a high calorific value substitute fuel can be produced for heat generation at the same site. The waste handling and long-distance transport previously required for the waste volumes from the Dresden conurbation could thus be eliminated in the future. The quantities produced on site will also be safely disposed of on site. Natural gas previously used and imported from abroad to generate heat will be substituted on a pro rata basis. As a result, local material and energy cycles can be closed through this self-economic solution in municipal hands. For further details, see Volume II, actions G.3-01.

# Solar thermal energy

Solar thermal energy must be located in the immediate vicinity of the district heating network in order to be economically viable. There is also competition for space between solar thermal energy and PV. A 1 MW solar thermal plant is currently being built in Dresden Räcknitz, with commissioning scheduled for March 2024. There are currently no plans to expand further solar thermal areas for feeding into the central district heating network.

# Deep geothermal energy

Utilising deep geothermal heat in the district heating network would be able to supply it with emission-free and (operationally) cost-effective heat for a long time. However, the technological, geological and therefore financial risks are high. Preliminary investigations are currently being carried out to examine suitable methods of geothermal heat utilisation for the subsurface and the legal framework for mining. If the risks (geological and cost risks) are reduced to a viable level and technical feasibility is ensured, around 40 MW of heat output should be tapped using deep geothermal energy by the mid-1930s.

# Electrode boiler

In electrode heating boilers, water is heated by the direct use of electrical energy. An electrode heating boiler is already in operation at the Nossener Brücke power plant. In addition, two further plants with 40 MW each are to be built at the Reick site in order to absorb power peaks and ensure a heat supply with green heat. Further electrode heating boilers will be built at the Nossener Brücke site in the mid-
s, so that the total number of electrode heating boilers will decarbonise around 10 Percent of the heat supply.

### Heat accumulator

Two storage lines are already in place at the Reick innovation power plant. As the volatility of generation will continue to increase in the future, further heat storage facilities with a thermal storage capacity of 1,750 MWh are to follow at the Nossener Brücke site at the end of the 1920s. For cost reasons, the storage facilities should preferably be realised as unpressurised storage facilities (temperature level <100°C).

### Electrolyser

Waste heat is generated during the operation of an electrolyser. SachsenEnergie AG is currently examining whether it makes sense to participate in the operation of electrolysers. To this end, the construction of an electrolyser is planned, whose waste heat potential of 3.75 MWh_{th} could be utilised for the district heating supply. An expansion potential for Dresden and the surrounding area is estimated at up to 210 GWh_{th} , which can also be fed into the central district heating network depending on the location of the electrolyser.

### Conversion of existing CHP plants to hydrogen

As a result of the investigations carried out, a complete decarbonisation of Dresden's district heating generation fleet is only possible by using hydrogen in the CHP plants that are still required. On the one hand, this requires the connection of the Nossener Brücke and Dresden Reick power plant sites to the European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB) and the sufficient availability of hydrogen at economically viable prices. Secondly, the plants must be made hydrogen-compatible, which requires the gas engine CHP plant in Reick and the gas turbine CHP plant at Nossener Brücke to be converted.

### Generation balance and emissions path

If all the decarbonisation potentials presented for district heating are implemented at a certain point in time, this results in a change in the district heating generation fleet over time. Illustration 6-2 shows the annual generation balance for the central district heating network in the years 2021 to 2045. The generation balance is the result of a deployment optimisation calculation, which uses a mathematical optimisation model to calculate the optimal operation of each individual generation unit based on the minimum total generation costs. In addition to technical plant parameters, the parameters included in the model are the hourly price time series of an energy industry scenario, the forecast development of heat demand and the temperature curves of environmental and waste heat sources.

The future generation fleet of the centralised district heating network will be made up of various technologies. These will be utilised depending on the current electricity, CO_{2} and gas/hydrogen prices and thus work together optimally. When electricity prices are low, power-to-heat systems such as electrode boilers, large heat pumps and electrolysers can be operated economically and feed heat into the central district heating network. When electricity prices are high, the existing CHP plants, which will run on hydrogen in the long term, will be used primarily to provide heat in future. Heat from thermal waste utilisation, waste heat from industrial processes, deep geothermal energy and solar thermal energy can be provided independently of the electricity price due to low variable heat generation costs. By integrating large heat storage systems into the system, the generation and consumption of heat can be decoupled in terms of time, thus increasing the flexibility and efficiency of the district heating network.

(see Illustration 6-4). This corresponds to an additional saving of 300 thousand tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  per year. Accelerated decarbonisation of district heating by 2035 is technically possible, but requires political and technical conditions that cannot be directly influenced. For example, the connection to the European Hydrogen Backbone and the availability of hydrogen at economically viable prices are already required in the early 1930s. Furthermore, industrial waste heat must be made available even more extensively for feeding into the district heating network and, last but not least, authorisation procedures must be significantly accelerated. In order to continue to guarantee the economic viability, social compatibility of the energy supply and security of supply, it can be assumed that additional funding will be required.

# 6.1.2 Expansion and redensification

In the more densely populated neighbourhoods of the city, where the potential for renewable energy is limited, the use of decarbonised district heating represents an important climate-neutral heating alternative to existing natural gas or heating oil solutions. This applies to buildings in existing district heating areas that still use a natural gas connection and to densely populated areas that are not yet part of the district heating supply area but could in principle have the prospect of being connected. A provisional district heating map with assumed expansion areas shows Illustration 6-5. This was used as the basis for the PotEEGeb study and determined that of around 13,300 buildings supplied with district heating in 2021, there is potential for growth of a good 4,000 buildings in the existing and expansion areas. As part of the heat transformation plan, SachsenEnergie AG is investigating which potential for densification and expansion can be realised for Dresden's district heating network. The results will be taken into account accordingly in municipal heat planning.

# Outlook

Dresden has the potential to completely decarbonise its district heating and it is possible to switch to using  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  -free heat sources. The district heating system is already an important part of Dresden's heating infrastructure. Due to its significant share of Dresden's heating market and the possibility of providing fully decarbonised heat in the future, the district heating system will continue to play an important role in the success of the decarbonisation of Dresden's heating supply in the long term. As a result, the densification of the existing district heating area and the expansion of the district heating network are also being analysed in SachsenEnergie AG's current heat transformation plan.

# 6.2 Definition of green house gas neutrality

The concept of climate neutrality is not clearly defined. Particularly in the municipal context, there are different definitions due to different accounting limits and local requirements compared to the global or national context.

Definition of greenhouse gas (GHG) neutrality and climate neutrality:
#

Dresden. Diezqcu

Action plan for climate neutrality 2030

#

Climate neutrality is a state in which human activities have no net effect on the climate system. These activities include climate-impacting emissions, actions aimed at removing greenhouse gases from the atmospheric cycle and human-induced activities that have regional or local biogeophysical effects.
GHG-neutrality, on the other hand, "only" means net zero GHG emissions. Accordingly, the goal of climate neutrality requires a different and more ambitious policy than the goal of GHG-neutrality, as in addition to GHG emissions, all other effects of human activity on the climate must also be taken into account, e.g. land sealing by roads and settlements.

In practice, the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. In the IEK, the term GHG-neutrality is correctly used for the target.

In addition to the concept of GHG-neutrality, there is also the approach of the CO residual budget $^{20}$  for evaluating climate protection targets. Global warming is largely dependent on the total amount of greenhouse gases emitted. These greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere and have a climate impact over many decades (so-called Global Warming Potential - GWP). This means that not only the annual emissions, but also the cumulative GHG emissions over time are decisive for limiting global warming. When assessing climate protection targets, it is therefore not only the point in time at which GHG-neutrality is achieved that is decisive, but above all the amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted in a defined period of time. If the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  residual budget is considered, the path to GHG-neutrality must be steeper than if there is only one defined end point. The  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  residual budget was calculated for Germany by the German Advisory Council on the Environment and is therefore more of a concept for assessing national climate protection targets. There is no such calculation for local authorities, so a separate budget was derived for Dresden from the national budget. The derivation of the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  residual budget can be found later in this chapter.

The following guidelines for achieving GHG-neutrality were developed for Dresden as part of the development of the IEK and agreed with the Scientific Advisory Board in summer 2021:

Avoiding GHG emissions takes priority in line with the precautionary principle.
The top priority is to comply with a  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  residual budget in accordance with the UN Paris Agreement.
The path to GHG-neutrality is described on the basis of the reduction potential, the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  residual budget and a time target.
Energy-related GHG emissions can be largely avoided through technical and behavioural actions.
Unavoidable GHG emissions (e.g. from agriculture or wastewater or from the upstream chain) amounting to a maximum of 5 Percent $^{21}$  are offset, if possible regionally.
Rebound effects are minimised.

Due to the city council's decision to focus the climate protection concept on a specific time target (V1818/22), it is necessary to deviate from the previously adopted definition in certain respects. This concerns the use of a  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  residual budget to describe the target. Due to the clear target for the year 2035 (alternatively 2040), the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  residual budget can no longer be used as the sole target definition.

GHG-neutrality in Dresden should therefore be described by the following parameters
#

#

the reduction of greenhouse gases by 95 Percent of the comparative level of GHG emissions from 1990 to the target year,
a time target: 2035, alternatively 2040

This describes the target at a specific point in time. Expressed in figures, this means that energy-related GHG emissions must fall to 0.4 million tonnes per year by the target year. The calculation steps for determining this figure and further details can be found later in this chapter.

Dresden's participation in the EU City Mission adds a further ambition to its own target: to be GHG-neutral by 2030. The minimum requirement according to the definition of the EU City Mission is the reduction of greenhouse gases by 80 Percent compared to 1990. This does not correspond to the definition of (almost) net zero emissions for the CoD (reduction by 95 Percent), but gives the opportunity to include the ambition of the EU mission in the reduction pathway up to the target year 2035/2040 as an interim target. This interim target (80 Percent reduction) also fulfils the previous climate protection target of the IEuKK.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Illustration 6-6Scheme for defining GHG-neutrality targets

In addition, it is also important to set clear targets for the path to the goal, as compliance with the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  residual budget and the achievement of the GHG neutrality target can only succeed if a significant gradual reduction is achieved starting from today.

For information purposes, the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  budget consumed by the time the target is reached is shown as part of the publication of the GHG inventory. The  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  budget varies with the number of inhabitants and is therefore a guideline value to show the approximation to the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement. In the IEK, the reduction path to be presented to achieve GHG-neutrality is checked for compliance with the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  residual budget, but the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  residual budget is not part of the target. Compliance with the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$

residual budget is to be ensured through the introduction of suitable, concrete interim targets. These are to be firmly defined as absolute GHG emissions and do not fluctuate with the number of inhabitants.

Table 6- summarises the target values for the interim target for 2030 (EU city emissions) and the GHG neutrality target for 2035/2040.

Table 6- : Target values for the path to GHG-neutrality in absolute GHG emissions

|  Interim target value: residual GHG emissions reduced by 80 % compared to 1987/90 | 1.580.003  |
|  Target value GHG-neutrality Residual GHG emissions with 95 % reduction compared to 1987/90 | 395.001  |

# Excursus: Calculation of the GHG-neutrality target values and the residual CO2 budget for Dresden

The GHG emissions for the base year 1990 are required to calculate the GHG emission level for the GHG-neutrality target. These were determined for the CoD as part of a study that is not publicly accessible. The basis is data from 1987 and 1990, as better data was available for these years. The corresponding per capita greenhouse gas emissions of  $15.4\mathrm{tCO2}_{\mathrm{eq / EW / a}}$  are included and published in the old GHG inventories before the switch to the BISKO methodology and balancing with the climate protection planner. Based on the per capita emissions, the absolute GHG emissions were calculated using the population of Dresden in 1990. These values are not corrected for weather, as they are the greenhouse gases actually emitted. The target values that can be derived from the baseline value are shown in Table 6-1 are included.

The interim target (80 % reduction) also fulfils the IEuKK's previous climate protection target of 5.8 tCO2_eq/EW/a in 2030. With a projected population $^{22}$  of 569,100 in 2030, absolute GHG emissions would then amount to 3.3 million tCO2_eq/a, which is well above the 80 % reduction target of 1.5 million tCO2_eq/a.

# Unavoidable residual emissions

There is no forecast for Dresden as to what unavoidable residual emissions would remain after all GHG reduction potentials have been exhausted. For Germany, around  $5\%$  of emissions[23] from 1990 are estimated to be unavoidable (residual emissions from landfill, agriculture and industrial processes). This approach is also used for Dresden, although it is expected that the actual unavoidable emissions from the above-mentioned emission sources will be less than  $5\%$  of the GHG emissions from 1987/90, as the proportion of emissions from agriculture in the CoD, for example, will be significantly lower than the national average due to its urban character.

# Derivation of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  budget

In order to meet the Paris climate targets, humanity only has a certain budget of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions left (IPCC report,  $2018^{25}$ ). This budget is calculated for Germany according to the size of the population (SRU - German Advisory Council on the Environment) and a budget target for the CoD is derived from this. The lower limit for energy-related  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions is 26.7 million tonnes to achieve a  $1.75^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  target with a  $67\%$  probability. The upper limit for the energy-related  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  budget is approx. 41.6 million tonnes to achieve a  $1.75^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  target with a  $67\%$  probability. Budgeting is based on the distribution methodology. While the global  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  budget was presented in the IPCC report in 2018 for different temperature rises and probabilities, the national budget distribution between the countries has not yet been bindingly

clarified. The countries therefore have a free hand in the interpretation. Different approaches are being discussed on how to deal with the budget consideration in relation to their own target formulation, which is primarily concerned with the question of fair distribution of the remaining budget. The German Advisory Council on the Environment recommends the population principle for Germany. The principle is based on the assumption that past emissions are not taken into account, but that the budget is assumed to be as ambitious as possible. Furthermore, an equal per capita emission right is assumed for every inhabitant of the earth. If the population increases, the budget would increase accordingly; if it decreases, the budget would decrease. This principle is also applied to Dresden. The calculated values can be found in Table 6-3 and Table 6-4.

A fundamental problem with using this calculation approach for Dresden is that the specific budget values are not compatible with the energy-related GHG accounting methodology of the City of Dresden. The BISKO methodology refers to energy-related GHG emissions and considers several greenhouse gases. The residual budget only takes  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  into account and summarises energy-related and non-energy-related  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions.

The following assumptions were therefore made to transfer the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  budget to the balance sheet boundaries of Dresden:

Assumption for calculating the energy and non-energy budget: The BISKO balance sheet of the CoD only takes into account the energy-related  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions. Accordingly, it is necessary to deduct the non-energy-related  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions from the budget. The National Inventory Report on the German GHG Inventory shows that around  $93\%$  of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions (only  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  not  $\mathrm{CO}$ ) $_{2,\mathrm{aq}}^{24}$  are energy-related. Applied to Dresden,  $93.2\%$  of the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  residual budget would be assumed to be energy-related, while  $6.8\%$  of the budget would not be energy-related. The derivation of the shares is shown below in Table 6-2 below.

For the  $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  target with  $67\%$  target achievement (lower limit of the budget for Dresden), the Environmental Council did not specify a budget for Germany in its report. The following calculation follows the Environmental Council's logic for determining the remaining budget for the  $1.75^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  target. To this end, the IPCC's globally calculated budget was first extrapolated to Germany using the number of inhabitants. The German emissions for 2019 were then subtracted from the budget to determine the remaining budget for 2020. The overall German budget from 2020 was then distributed evenly among Germany's inhabitants.

Assumption for evaluating the reduction pathways in the various scenarios of the IEK: The annual GHG emissions per reduction pathway are totalled up to a defined year (cumulative emissions) and compared with the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  budget. If the cumulative emissions exceed the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  budget, the budget is used up and the respective temperature limitation target is missed from a municipal perspective.

Assumption for dealing with  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions and GHG emissions: There is currently no data on a residual GHG budget (i.e. covering other greenhouse gases in addition to  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ). The GHG emissions according to the BISKO accounting are therefore deducted from the energy share of the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  budget for the sake of simplicity. According to this calculation, the residual budget is more heavily burdened, i.e. tends to be consumed earlier.

# 6.3 In-depth categorisation of sectors according to BISKO $^{26}$

Private households: The sector includes all single and multi-person households (including people in shared accommodation). This therefore also includes all hostels and communal facilities that serve the purpose of accommodation or housing. A separation from the small business sector (cf. tertiary sector/other) should be endeavoured.

Industry: Manufacturing companies (industry and manufacturing trade) of manufacturing companies with 20 or more employees. This corresponds to the definition used by the statistical offices of the federal states to record energy consumption. It can be assumed that for other data providers (e.g. energy suppliers) the industry/manufacturing sector largely corresponds to the sectors as listed in the individual sections of the manufacturing sector.

Municipal facilities: Defined here as the total energy consumption of municipal facilities. A differentiation between administrative buildings, municipal schools and day-care centres as well as street lighting

is desirable for the presentation of key figures in the municipal climate protection benchmark. This sector also includes other municipal buildings and the energy consumption of municipal infrastructure facilities, including water/wastewater, roads and waste.

TTS/Other: This sector includes the energy consumption of all previously unrecorded commercial operations (trade, commerce, services, mining, quarrying, manufacturing with fewer than 20 employees and agricultural operations).

# 6.4 Determination of GHG emissions from agriculture

As part of the evaluation of the potential integration of GHG emissions from agricultural activities in Dresden, emissions from livestock farming in Dresden were analysed in 2020.

The livestock data reported up to 1 January 2020 was used to determine the balance using data from the CoD Veterinary Office. The emission factors for the various animal classes were taken from Thünen Report  $67^{27}$  from 2019. Based on this, it was possible to calculate the emissions of the three main greenhouse gases (methane, ammonia, nitrous oxide) in tonnes per year. The animal classes cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens, horses and goats were considered in the analysis. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) factors stored in the climate protection planner were used to calculate the CO2 equivalents of the greenhouse gases analysed (methane 25, ammonia 8, nitrous oxide 298).

Taking into account the GWP factors, approx. 4,520 tCO2_eq/a are emitted annually by livestock farming in the Dresden region analysed. The values and calculation steps are listed in the table.

In order to obtain a value for the emissions from the use of agricultural land, the calculation module was used that is included in the climate protection planner used by the CoD for balancing GHG at city level. By specifying the total area of agricultural land, GHG emissions can be determined on the basis of average values for Germany and the federal states. The area value of 9,473 ha results in 12,850 tonnes  $\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{eq}}$  /a that are emitted by agricultural land use (excluding livestock farming).

# 6.5 Parameter set for scenarios

# 6.5.1 GHG emission factors

There are various methods and observation areas according to which emission factors for greenhouse gases are determined. The CoD uses the emission factors provided by the climate protection planner for the city-wide GHG inventory. These are provided by ifeu on the basis of the GEMIS database and studies by the Federal Environment Agency via the climate protection planner[28]. These values are currently stored in the climate protection planner until 2021.

Forecasts for the development of GHG emission factors are also required to map the development of GHG emissions. These forecasts come in part from the input of SachsenEnergie AG from its decarboni

sation concept and its underlying fundamental model, or the values are based on these forecasts. Specifically, this concerns the assumptions on the development of the German electricity mix and Dresden's district heating emissions.

## Development of the electricity mix emission factors

The GHG emission factors used for the scenarios for the reference electricity mix are taken from an IINAS study $^{29}$ , which presents emission factors with upstream chain and influence of transport and conversion, as used in the BISKO methodology.

For the reference scenario and the target scenarios, different expansion stages of RE in the German electricity mix were assumed. In the reference scenario, the assumptions are based on the NECP model of the German electricity mix for the support years 2030 and 2050 (with the assumption of a  $65\%$  share of renewable energies by 2030).

For the target scenarios, it was assumed that the political targets set out in the EEG 2023 are achieved (expansion of RE by 2030 with an  $80\%$  share). The IINAS study also provides values for the emission factor for the reference electricity (IINAS-EEG model)

Reference scenario, values from Table 4 of the IINAS study

Electricity local 2030 NECP, consumer side  $261\mathrm{g / kWh}$  (with upstream chain and transport)
Electricity local 2050 NECP, consumer side  $31\mathrm{g / kWh}$  (with upstream chain and transport)

Share for transport and conversion is  $8\mathrm{g / kWh}$  for 2030 and  $2\mathrm{g / kWh}$  for 2050; these values are used to convert values for target scenarios from the producer side to the consumer side

Target scenarios, values from Table 9 and Table 7 of the IINAS study

Electricity power plant fleet (IINAS-EEG) 2030 (Table 9),  $126\mathrm{g / kWh}$  on the producer side,  $134\mathrm{g / kWh}$  on the consumer side (with surcharge of  $8\mathrm{g / kWh}$ )
Electricity power plant fleet 2045 (dena) (Table 7),  $13\mathrm{g / kWh}$  on the producer side,  $15\mathrm{g / kWh}$  on the consumer side (with surcharge of  $2\mathrm{g / kWh}$ )

In the electricity mix factors used on the consumer side, no distinctions are made with regard to the withdrawal of electricity from different voltage levels. The influence of the conversion from MV to LV is therefore neglected in this analysis, as it will only have a minor influence on the overall emissions anyway.

Linear interpolation is used between the above-mentioned base years.

# Development of the natural gas emission factor

The GHG emission factor for natural gas also requires a forecast within the scenarios due to current developments in the energy sector. The constant GHG emission value previously used in BISKO, which is based on Russian pipeline natural gas, is no longer considered realistic due to the partial switch to liquefied natural gas. In order to take into account an appropriate premium or an updated value, two studies were used to estimate medium-term developments. The Ifeu $^{30}$  provides an overview of the different GHG emission factors of pipeline natural gas and liquefied natural gas (see Table 6-). However, this source does not state what proportions of liquefied natural gas are forecast. For this purpose, a study by ewi $^{31}$  was used to estimate possible future shares of LNG. In the NZE-H scenario, which corresponds to a climate policy scenario, LNG has a share of approx. 7 to  $8\%$  in 2030. The mixed emission factor for natural gas is calculated on the basis of these assumptions (see Table 6-). A value of  $7\%$  for LNG and  $5\%$  for hydrogen is assumed for 2030. For the year 2025/26, the values are set at  $18\%$  for LNG and  $1\%$  for hydrogen. The calculation results in a mixed emission factor of 0.246 for 2030 and 0.270 for 2025/26 - these are assumed to be the same for the target scenarios and the reference scenario. The intermediate values are interpolated linearly.

# Development of district heating emission factors

For district heating, the developments in the final energy source mix of SachsenEnergie AG's decarbonisation concept were offset against the GHG emission factors used in the IEK. In order to take into account the proportionate GHG emissions for the provision of heat from CHP plants, an allocation factor was determined from the empirical data in the climate protection planner for the district heating generation plants. The district heating network losses, which were assumed to be  $15\%$ , were deducted from this factor. As a result, an allocation factor of  $57.47\%$  was used, which reflects the GHG emissions share of the heat supply from the CHP generation plants. For the sake of simplicity, this was also used for the

future hydrogen CHP plants. It was also assumed that the GHG emissions from the planned thermal waste utilisation of  $120\mathrm{gCO / kWh_{2eend}}$  would be eliminated for the target scenarios from 2040 and for the Ref_2045 scenario from 2045. The German electricity mix emission factors described above were applied to the electricity required by electrode boilers and large heat pumps in the district heating system. For solar thermal energy and deep geothermal energy in district heating generation, a simplified assumption of  $23\mathrm{gCO / kWh_{2eend}}$  was made. The district heating emission factors calculated from this are shown in Table 6-6 and in Table 6-7 can be seen.

# Emission factors for local renewable energies

Values for the GHG emission factors of renewable energies for 2018 and 2021 are taken from the climate protection planner. These GHG emission factors primarily account for a large proportion of specific emissions from the upstream chain, i.e. the production process for these plants, and hardly any from operational greenhouse gas emissions. The development of GHG emissions from the energy used in production and transport therefore plays a significant role for these technologies. This applies to the renewable energies biomass, solar thermal energy, photovoltaics and wind. For the GHG emission factors of the other renewable energy sources, a flat-rate reduction to  $50\%$  of the GHG emission factor from 2018 in 2045 (the same in all scenarios) is envisaged.

# Determination of hydrogen

In the target scenarios and the Ref_2045 scenario, different GHG emissions are assumed for the use of hydrogen. These emission factors were also taken into account in the calculation of the district heating emission factors.

For the IEK, the availability of imported green hydrogen from the MENA region was assumed for the target scenarios from 2030. For the reference scenario, on the other hand, it was assumed that only blue hydrogen will initially be available from 2035 and will develop into an equal mix of blue and green hydrogen by 2045. The emission factors used for the assessment are based on the results of an IINAS short study $^{32}$ . The GHG emission factors for hydrogen used for the various scenarios can be found in Table 6-5. This means that hydrogen already represents a significant GHG reduction compared to the specific GHG emissions of  $247\mathrm{gCO}_{2\mathrm{aq}} / \mathrm{kWh}$  associated with natural gas (pipeline natural gas).

Table 6-5 : Assumed GHG emissions for hydrogen

|  GHG emission factors (incl. transport) i | from 2030 | 2035 | 2045  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Target scenarios (Target_2035, Target_2040): Green hydrogen (from MENA region) | 33 g/kWh | 33 g/kWh | 33 g/kWh  |
|  Reference scenario (Ref_2045): Blue-green hydrogen (50%/50%) | - | 53 g/kWh | 43 g/kWh  |

These assumptions, especially for the target scenarios, should be regarded as optimistic. It should be noted that Dresden itself cannot produce sufficient quantities of green hydrogen.

Linear interpolation is used between the support years or the last value is assumed to be constant in subsequent years.

## 6.6 Calculation of the reduction path in the IEK

The reduction path calculator is a tool that shows the possible greenhouse gas reduction for energy-related greenhouse gas emissions for the city of Dresden over time in three different scenarios. An Excel tool was developed by the climate protection team to enable this visualisation.

The timeline covers the period from the starting year 2018 (current greenhouse gas inventory) to 2050. The choice of the long period beyond the target year 2035/2040 is intended to enable comparison within a constant observation horizon. It also makes it clear that the GHG reductions will continue to have an effect even after GHG-neutrality has been achieved in the target year.

In addition to the explanations in 2.2.2 it should be noted that the calculated final energy requirements are annual values - in MWh/a. These are therefore balance sheet considerations of the demand and supply side. The temporal progression of the feed-in from renewable energy systems is not stored, but is calculated over a year using the full utilisation hours. There is a deviation from this for PV systems on buildings. For these, a temporal resolution (6-hour block) of the respective system yield was also taken into account in the model that was created for the potential study on local renewable energy supply at building level (PotEEGeb). This was used to determine the coverage shares and surplus quantities of the PV systems. These are included in the reduction path calculator.

## Bundling of energy sources

The starting point for the CoD's reduction path calculator is the GHG inventory for the 2018 reporting year. The inventory is available for each energy source:

for stationary energy
Biogas
Biomass
Lignite
Natural gas
District heating
Liquefied petroleum gas
Heating current
Heating oil
Local heating
Solar thermal energy
Other renewables
Other conventional
Hard coal
Electricity (stationary energy application)

before. This categorisation is based on the BISKO methodology of the climate protection planner $^{33}$ (KSP), which CoD uses to prepare its municipal GHG inventory. This strong subdivision of individual emissions is not useful for the reduction path calculator. In order to ensure the manageability and clarity of the calculations and the results to be presented, simplifications were defined, which are explained below.

# Clustering of Fields of action/emission sources

The reduction path should be presented for the named Fields of action. This requires a "translation" of the above-mentioned sectors into the Fields of action for which energy-related GHG emissions can be recorded. Table 6-10 shows the respective allocation. The GHG emissions for municipal facilities are recorded in the non-residential buildings. A separate presentation is not appropriate due to their small share (1-2 %) of greenhouse gas emissions.

Table 6-10: Allocation of Fields of action to the sectors (BISKO methodology)

|  Abbreviation Sector GHG inventory (BISKO) | GHG inventory sector (BISKO) | Fields of action in the reduction path calculator  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  PHH | Private households | Residential building  |
|  GHD | Trade, commerce, services and other | Non-residential buildings  |
|  KE | Municipal facilities | Non-residential buildings  |
|  IND | Industry | Process energy industry  |
|  Transport | Transport | Mobility  |

# Clustering of energy sources

In the evaluation in particular, the energy sources should be limited to the main GHG emitters so that the diagrams and tables are easy to read and understand. A higher degree of differentiation can be used in the calculation tool itself, but even there energy sources were summarised into meaningful groups (Table 6-11).

The associated GHG emission factors for processing in the reduction path calculator were also calculated from the 2018 GHG inventory for the groups of energy sources formed - from the quotient of total GHG emissions and total final energy demand per group.

To forecast the development of greenhouse gas emissions, the energy source hydrogen was introduced in addition to the energy sources set out in the climate protection planner. This is not yet available on a large scale and will only play a role from the 2030s onwards. Nevertheless, hydrogen is included in the reduction pathway.

Table 6-12: Allocation of the Fields of action to the energy sources considered therein

|   |  | Renewable heat | Natural gas and other fossil fuels | District heating | Heating current | Electricity | Hydrogen | Fossil fuels  |

|  Process energy |  |  | X | X |  | X | X |   |
|  Mobility |  |  |  |  |  | X | X | X  |

In order to be able to map the substitution and reduction potentials pragmatically but appropriately, various specifications must be made for the reduction path calculator, as shown below, which make the tool manageable.

# Breakdown of final energy consumption by energy source

For the use of heat pumps, the energy requirements are divided into environmental heat (renewable energy) and electrical drive energy (electricity). This is necessary because in future the greenhouse gas emission factor for the electricity purchased from the grid (German electricity mix) will be significantly lower than today. For the "heat pump" application, the electricity-related share of specific greenhouse gas emissions due to the electricity required for operation is comparatively high compared to other renewable energy applications such as wind, solar thermal and photovoltaics. In the case of wind, solar

thermal and photovoltaics, the influence of the electricity mix on the respective GHG emission factor comes primarily from the upstream chain (production, transport). For heat pump applications, the development of the GHG emission factor for the electricity mix is therefore taken into account by recording the energy flows separately as heating electricity and "emission-free" environmental heat.

For the GHG emission factors of the other renewable energy sources, a flat-rate reduction to 50 % of the GHG emission factor from 2018 in 2045 (the same in all scenarios) is envisaged.

## Dealing with the GHG reduction pathway for the mobility sector

Since no scenarios from the DMP+ process were available for the mobility sector at the time the IEK was finalised, the default values of the reduction path according to the Climate Protection Act (KSG) were used. The system described above for mapping the final energy requirements per energy source is also applied to the area of mobility. As no specific reduction paths per energy source were available from the DMP+ process in relation to energy demand, the reduction in the mobility sector for GHG was mapped by using mixed values. As soon as the exact scenarios are available, they will be stored in the reduction path calculator and thus also the reduction path for the final energy demand in the mobility sector.

In deviation from the reduction paths that were developed in advance for the mobility sector for 2035, 2040 and 2045 in accordance with the Climate Protection Act (KSG), an adjustment had to be made in the reduction path: the reduction to 0 % assumes that no residual emissions (e.g. from the upstream chain) arise. However, as shown in 6.5.1 (especially for reference electricity up to 2045), there are still emissions, such a generalised reduction is not in line with the BISKO system. For this reason, as no specific energy requirements per energy source were available that could be offset against the GHG emission factors used, the reduction path according to the KSG was used as a basis for the target scenarios. In the reference scenario, a flat-rate and linear reduction from 2025 to 2045 was assumed. Even if GHG-neutrality is achieved in 2045, a share of 5 % in the target scenarios and 10 % in the reference scenario is still assumed for residual emissions (upstream chain of electricity supply and mobility sectors that are difficult to convert, e.g. heavy goods and air transport). The target values for the scenarios are shown in Table 6-13 are shown in Table 618.

Table 6-13 : GHG reduction path for the mobility sector in the reduction path calculator

|  GHG emissions in relation to 2018 | 2021 | 2025 | 2030 | 2035 | 2040 | 2045  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Target scenarios | 100 % | 87 % | 52 % | 32 % | 12 % | 5 %  |
|  Reference scenario | 100 % | 100 % |  |  |  | 10 %  |

## Dealing with local renewable electricity producers

By definition, the BISKO methodology applies the GHG emission factor of the German electricity mix to the final energy demand for electricity. From a physical/technical point of view, this is the correct approach, as a municipality can never be self-sufficient in terms of supply from the overarching electricity

grid. Due to the surplus or shortfall in electricity generation and fluctuating electricity demand, quantities of electricity are drawn from or fed into the higher-level grid at different times. This cannot be mapped in the municipal greenhouse gas balance, as the composition of the purchased electricity (specific GHG emissions) at the respective times for each municipality would also need to be known for a correct calculation.

The reduction path deviates from this agreement in that it is calculated using a local electricity mix for renewable energies. The advantage of this approach is that it also recognises and takes into account local efforts to expand renewable energies for electricity generation. These would otherwise "fizzle out" if the GHG emission factor of the German electricity mix were used. In reality, however, local efforts to expand renewable energies are also included in the German electricity mix. The GHG emission factor for the German electricity mix can only fall in future if the expansion of renewable energies is driven forward across the board.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Illustration 6-8System for taking local RE plants (local electricity mix) into account in the reduction path calculator

In the calculation model, the yield values of the potential renewable energy systems (wind, building-independent PV and PV on/at buildings) are added together. The required reference electricity is the difference between the final energy demand for electricity and the yield of the local renewable energy systems for the respective year. The GHG emission factor of the local electricity mix is then calculated from the individual values. It should be noted that only the RE plants from the potential analysis are taken into account. Other electricity generation plants that exist in the urban area are included in the federal electricity mix. The electricity used by the building's own PV systems is included in the local electricity mix in the calculation model, as this corresponds to the system for calculating greenhouse gas emissions. The calculation method does not differentiate according to the voltage level at which the electricity is consumed. In reality, of course, this also has an impact on the loading and unloading of the electricity grid infrastructure. However, this cannot be mapped in this framework. However, in order to obtain indications of developments in relation to the electricity distribution grid, surplus electricity used by the company and surplus electricity fed into the grid are analysed and presented separately.

The reference electricity is valued with the GHG emission factor of the federal electricity mix. Theoretically, this factor would have to be adjusted for the yields from the renewable energy plants that are taken into account separately for the local electricity mix. However, the shift in the specific GHG emission factor of the federal electricity mix is negligible in the calculation model due to the magnitude of the local RE potential compared to the total electricity generation in Germany (0.3% of Germany's total net feed-in in 2022).

The local electricity mix factor (non-BISKO) is used to analyse the reduction path. In the reduction path calculator, there is also an evaluation with the federal electricity mix - without taking into account the local RE plants. Due to a similar development (reduction of the GHG factor of the federal electricity mix and gradual expansion of RE plants and thus gradual reduction of the local electricity mix factor), both approaches result in almost congruent reduction paths. In Illustration 6-9 shows an example of the course of the GHG emission factors for the local electricity mix and the federal electricity mix for the Target_2035 scenario.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Illustration 6-9 Comparison of the GHG emission factor for the local electricity mix and the federal electricity mix using the 2035 target scenario as an example

This shows that the difference between the factors over time is small and therefore the non-BISKO method can be used for the evaluation. The visualisation of local efforts was given preference over adherence to the BISKO methodology due to its importance for the implementation of the energy transition. It should also be noted that this methodology is only used to calculate the GHG emitted and is not designed for forecasts. In future, both representations (BISKO with federal electricity mix and local electricity mix as a secondary balance) will be used to compare the reduction path with the current GHG inventory.

# Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan 2025plus

An overview
# Introduction

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

In its Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) 2025plus, the City of Dresden has in its possession a transport development framework adopted by the City Council for the first time since 1994.

However, this does not mean that transport strategy planning work has been at a standstill since 1994. Significant updates to the 1994 transport concept can be found in the 1998 Land Use Plan, the 2002 Integrated Urban Development Concept, the 2003 Transport Concept (not adopted) and Dresden's 2006 Mobility Strategy.

Now the time had come to develop a transport strategy concept that would take account of the general changes that have taken place in recent times, namely:

Global developments such as fluctuations on the currency markets, price movements in the commodities sector, etc.
New European and national legislation, e.g. concerning clean air
Increased calls from citizens for a cleaner, quieter and safer environment and a better quality of life
Demographic change in Western European countries associated with falling and ageing populations and growing individualism in lifestyles
Growing financing needs for renovation and maintenance of the transport infrastructure
Rapidly increasing public demand for more participation in planning processes.

Against this backdrop, work started in 2009 on a new SUMP which would look towards 2025 and beyond. The challenges to be overcome were huge. With assistance from a Round Table consisting of more than 40 partners from a wide range of institutions, associations, clubs etc., a scientific advisory board, a Round Table made up of regional representatives, and a civic steering group, the planning document was drafted by a planning consortium over a period of four years. The transport policy spokespeople of the political parties on the City Council were also involved in this process.

Two City Council resolutions were adopted during this time, which recorded the results achieved and enabled work to continue on a secure footing. Following an intensive and constructive yet contentious Round Table discussion the "Goals for the future development of transport in the City of Dresden up to 2025 and beyond" were drawn up and adopted. The call for a development scenario setting out the main focal points was also thoroughly and intensively discussed. It was decided to opt for the local public transport based scenario.
After the draft SUMP was submitted by the planning consortium, an intensive discussion ensued in the City Council and with the citizens of Dresden, the public discussion culminating in the Dresdner Debatte (Dresden Debate). Around 4,500 people visited the website and the red container in the city centre, where citizens had the opportunity to speak directly to members of the city administration, was also very well attended. As a result, some 930 tips, suggestions and comments were received from Dresden residents, of which 450 related directly to the Dresden SUMP. Many of the suggestions already formed part of the plans, while others were put forward multiple times or could be combined due to their similarities with others. Twenty-one suggestions from residents were ultimately incorporated into the concept by way of a City Council resolution.

After five years of intensive work, the plan was adopted by Dresden City Council on 20 November 2014.

It should not be forgotten that our Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan had already been escalated to the European level by Dresden's Lady Mayoress Helma Orosz in its early days. Having been presented as a major project for Dresden at a European conference of the Polis network, the SUMP 2025plus attracted considerable international attention right from the start. The status of the planning was reported on at several European workshops and the plan itself was ranked as one of the best European Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans.

On 20 March 2015 the City of Dresden was presented with an award for its SUMP 2025plus by EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc. In the ranking of European cities demonstrating planning excellence in meeting today's requirements for urban mobility development, Dresden tied in second place with the city of Ghent, Belgium, behind the winner, Bremen.

I would like to take the opportunity of this statement to thank all citizens of Dresden, including all members of the SUMP Round Tables, the scientific advisory board and the many employees of the city administration for their sterling efforts in working together on this plan.

In particular, I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to my predecessor, Jörn Marx, under whose committed patronage the Dresden SUMP came into being and who put so much personal effort into making the plan a success.

I wish the Dresden SUMP the very best of luck and success on its path towards implementation.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

In the SUMP 2025plus, the City of Dresden has at its disposal a well substantiated strategy for the coordinated, balanced development of transport in the city. The SUMP is closely intermeshed with the city's urban guidelines, such as InSEK, the Integrated Urban Development Concept and the clean air, noise reduction and energy/climate protection plans. Our SUMP is also an important cornerstone of Dresden's new land use plan.

Joint development priorities have been identified and the stage has been set for the development of urban mobility in Dresden with a view to creating a modern city that is fit for the future.

Now we are faced with the ambitious task of implementing the SUMP – and that applies to both the city administration itself and its many specialist partners as well as the citizens of Dresden! For it is the citizens of our city and our many guests and visitors who use the city's transport system. And we want everybody to be able to contribute in their own way to giving it shape and making Dresden an attractive city with a high quality of life.

# 1. Why do we need a new SUMP now?

Transport planning has a long history in Dresden. Dresden's new Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan 2025 plus follows in the footsteps of a series of significant predecessors, such as the general transport plans of 1950, 1967 and 1977, and the 1991 Guidelines for Future Transport Policy in the Dresden Conurbation. The first comprehensive transport concept following German reunification in 1994 and the 2006 Dresden Mobility Strategy built upon many years of planning.

If planning work up to the 1990s focused primarily on adapting the road infrastructure to increasing motorisation and rising motor vehicle traffic volumes, the 2006 Mobility Strategy lays down very different guidelines. It reflects the change in transport policy goals: in order to enable citizens to take part in communal life, mobility must be ensured for everyone, while at the same time reducing the adverse effects of traffic such as noise, airborne pollutants and environmentally harmful emissions. These issues appear to be contradictory. The key to developing a mobility and transport system that takes both of these aspects into account will from now on be to use existing infrastructure more effectively and place more emphasis on promoting more sustainable means of transport, such as local public transport and non-motorised traffic (walking/cycling).

## A changing city

Maintaining and preserving the existing roads and bridges and the public transport network alone presents the city with enormous financial and planning challenges every year. In addition, deficits are accumulating in aspects including road and bridge repairs or combating accident hotspots like Schillerplatz and congested traffic hubs such as around Marienbrücke/Könneritzstraße. On the other hand, Dresden would not be able to develop dynamically or thrive economically without urban development and reconstruction. To achieve this, Dresden will continue to have a need for new road and rail network projects, such as the following:

The Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe Stadtbahn Programme 2020
The new federal highway B 6 in Cossebaude (a federal government project)
Road improvements in Reick/Strehlen/ Gruna to create better traffic links to the science hub in the east of the city.

## Strategy paper

### The Dresden SUMP

provides upcoming transport plans and activities with a strategic focus
compares the costs and effects
highlights priorities and identifies urgent tasks.

The strategy paper is not a rigid set of plans. The projects have largely been developed in consensus between the parties on the City Council and the supporting bodies, while providing enough scope to allow the city administration to set its own local community policy priorities. The implementation process is constantly accompanied by outcome reviews which enable the city to respond in good time to new general conditions while keeping tabs on the transport policy goals set.

# 2. How did the Dresden SUMP 2025plus come into being?

The Round Table is no model of harmony. On the contrary: the development of the SUMP was at times characterised by controversial debate. Nonetheless, the work of the Round Table is bound by the principle of openness and transparency and by the aim of finding joint consensus.

In the past, transport concepts with a strategic focus usually came about as "expert documents". Indeed, the 1991 Transport Policy Guidelines and the 1994 Transport Concept both gave rise to in-depth local policy discussions. Since then, however, the culture of participation has been changing. In parallel with current efforts in other major cities, the Dresden SUMP sets new standards and priorities for incorporating as many stakeholders and citizens as possible in the planning process. The process was accompanied by the following bodies:

Steering group with representatives of the parties on the City Council, the deputy mayors, the SUMP project manager, the moderator of the Round Table and other bodies
A scientific advisory board with academics specialising in transport and urban planning (from Dresden University of Applied Sciences and other academic institutions)
The Round Table, with various stakeholders and interest groups (DVB AG, Verkehrsverbund Oberelbe, ADFC, ADAC, etc.)

The Round Table Region, with representatives of neighbouring municipalities (Bannewitz, Heidenau, Freital, Wilsdruff, Radebeul, Moritzburg, Ottendorf-Okrilla, Radeberg, Wachau), the administrative districts and the Free State of Saxony
The city administration project group with representatives of the offices concerned

The members of the Round Table played a special role as sources of ideas, stakeholders, discussion partners and, in particular, as key figures representing citizens, local politics and the professional public.

Dresden residents were involved throughout the entire development process, with a range of participation formats. A key element in this was the Dresden Debate. Over a period of four weeks, Dresden residents were given the opportunity to discuss the draft in depth online

(→ www.dresdner-debatte.de) as well as face-to-face with specialists from the city administration at the red Infobox at Dr.-Külz-Ring. The public consultation gave rise to around 1,000 suggestions which were incorporated into the development of the Dresden Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan 2025plus. In addition, the city authorities made the SUMP available at all local administrative offices and discussed it with those present.

Integrated transport planning means "working together not against each other"!

The Dresden SUMP 2025plus is the result of cooperation and compromise: both in dealings between authorities and with politicians as well as in exploring the strategies and measures with stakeholders and interest groups.

As such we have paved the way for a sustainable future for mobility in Dresden in an understandable, effective and affordable way that will not lead to endless political arguments.

# 3. General conditions and transport development goals in Dresden

Developments in demographics, spatial structures and regional infrastructure determine the general conditions for mobility and transport in Dresden. The population in the Free State of Saxony and the area surrounding Dresden is declining. The average age is rising as the number of retired and old people increases, while the proportion and number of children and adults of working age is falling. This trend is set to continue going forward.

However, there are indications of an upturn in population numbers in Dresden and other big cities after many years of decline. Following the low point in 2000 where the population had dropped to around 478,000, by 2010 Dresden had 522,000 inhabitants, and the city is expecting the number to grow to more than 550,000 by 2025. Thus the growth processes taking place in the city contrast with a largely stable situation in adjacent communities and the stronger decline in population in the region as a whole. This will impact on future transport development in Dresden.

The general conditions for the Dresden SUMP are informed first and foremost by the land use plan and the legally binding development plans, as well as by statutory requirements and higher-level objectives. This results in binding concepts for Saxony's capital city which focus in particular on the environmental credentials of its transport. These include:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
As a major economic factor and standard bearer of the City of Dresden, tourism also has to be taken into account in mobility planning

Clean air laws with binding limits for particulates and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$
The role Dresden intends to play in protecting the climate
Traffic noise reduction targets for Dresden based on the EU Environmental Noise Directive

Some plans have already been developed and adopted in this area, including:

The City of Dresden Clean Air Plan (May 2011)
The City of Dresden 2030 Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Concept (November 2012) and
The Noise Reduction Master Plan (2008/draft 2014)

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
↑ Urban and regional transport systems must be closely linked

Taking the general requirements and analyses into account, the participants in the Round Table developed and discussed the goals for the Dresden SUMP. These were modified by the City Council committees and ultimately adopted by the Dresden City Council in March 2011. The four criteria are as follows:

Criterion 1: Enduring, sustainable and eco-friendly transport and mobility standards for citizens and the economy

Criterion 2: Socially just participation in mobility – taking into account specific needs resulting from differing living conditions – and thus equal opportunities for everyone to take part in society

Criterion 3: Achieving and maintaining high quality levels regarding the city and the environment by raising the efficiency of integrated transport systems and reducing the use of natural resources for transport purposes

Criterion 4: Mobility planning to be an open planning and decision-making process taking into account transport engineering, associations, transport providers, other social groups, officials, concerned citizens and various technical disciplines.

Thirty-four sub-goals define these criteria in concrete terms. They form the basis for developing suitable scenarios and measures.

→ The sustainable modes of transport – rail, bus, walking and cycling – play a key role in achieving this SUMP

As you get older, playing an active part in community life is particularly important. But things often get in the way. I haven't been able to drive a car or ride a bike for a while now. So as a wheelchair user I'm often dependent on help from other people or disabled-friendly solutions.

Senior citizens travel by bus, tram, train, bicycle or car – but mainly on foot, becoming increasingly dependent on rollators, wheelchairs and walking aids as they get older. And as they want to stay in their own homes for as long as possible, safe, accessible foot-paths and pavements are a must.

$\uparrow$ Development of motorisation in Dresden (private and company cars)

public transport and walking/cycling – increased by the same proportion in the same period.

## Cycling

It can have escaped very few people's attention that there has been a significant increase in the number of bicycles on our roads since the early 1990s. The slight decline in 2013 compared with 2008 has less to do with cycling falling out of favour and more to do with the extreme weather conditions (long, snowy winters and a lot of rain). More and more people are tending to cycle in all weathers and even on longer journeys and for carrying goods.

## Traffic development

Developments in mobility and transport over the past few years can be described using an excellent database which Dresden has at its disposal. One of the main sources for populating this database is the regular mobility survey entitled "System repräsentativer Verkehrsbefragungen (SrV)" (system of representative transport surveys) run by TU Dresden. Dresden has been taking part in the five-yearly survey since 1972. In addition, 42 permanent counting stations situated across the entire city automatically register motor vehicle traffic. Public transport usage data is gathered by Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe by means of systematic passenger counts. These and other statistics have resulted in the following findings:

## Motorisation

While German reunification initially lifted the lid on pent-up demand for private cars in Dresden, as in the rest of former East Germany, the number of cars on the roads has stagnated since the mid-1990s. A very slight upturn has been seen since 2008, with just over 400 private and company cars to every 1000 Dresden residents in 2013. As a result of the growth in population, however, there are currently almost 20,000 more cars registered in Dresden than there were in 2008 (an increase of 10%).

## Modal split among Dresden residents

### Cars

The use of the car as a means of transport increased significantly between German reunification and the early years of the new millennium, reaching a peak in 2003 of 43% of all trips (based on the main form of transport on each trip). However, the proportion of cars using has fallen again since 2003 (2008: 41%, 2013: 39%).

On the other hand, the proportion of sustainable forms of transport – local

After a marked decline in the early 1990s – a trend that was in evidence right across Germany – the proportion of pedestrians has also been increasing in recent years.

$\uparrow$ Disabled-friendly facilities benefit all transport users

## Local public transport

Also following a clear decline in the early 1990s, the share of public transport in the overall mix has stabilised again and is in fact increasing slightly at present. Given the current growth in population, it may be assumed that overall passenger numbers are set to increase significantly.

← Development in average traffic volumes on the Elbe bridges in Dresden (individually and averaged over all bridges; Albertbrücke completely closed in 2014)

# Transport volumes in the road network

There are permanent traffic counting stations at the bridges across the River Elbe and along trunk roads. Analyses of the data have revealed that car traffic, and in particular HGV traffic within Dresden dropped significantly with the opening of the A 17 motorway in 2005 following rapid rises in the 1990s. Despite dynamic urban development and growing population numbers, motor vehicle volumes in the Dresden city area have remained at a constant level since 2008.

# Local public transport passenger numbers

Passenger numbers on trams, buses, ferries and mountain railways have risen constantly in line with the population growth over the past few years. Local public transport therefore plays an indispensable part in keeping the overall transport system fully functional.

Dresden's S-Bahn has also registered continuous growth. Its passenger numbers increased by almost a third between 1998 and 2010.

# Summary of developments in recent years

Traffic in Dresden has increased as a result of the dynamic developments that have taken place in the city over the past few years. The city has largely managed to accommodate this marked growth in traffic with sustainable means of transport (public transport, cycling and walking). Motor-vehicle traffic has fallen slightly despite the growing population. This is in particular due to the following factors:

With the increase in population density, distances travelled have become shorter and the supply infrastructure for daily needs has improved
Road infrastructures leading to the city have been improved (in particular the new A 17 federal motorway and its access roads)
Further expansion of the S-Bahn in the Dresden conurbation, with connections to major neighbouring cities and municipalities (particularly S 1 connecting Pirna, Heidenau, Radebeul, Coswig, Weinböhla and Meißen)
The local public transport system has been constantly optimised
The significance of cycling has increased considerably as a result of a change of image

# 5. Deficits and challenges

Cleaner air, less noise and lower greenhouse gas emissions – these are major goals that we can only achieve with mobility focused on resource conservation. This is why the Environment Office has been involved in the Dresden SUMP right from the start.

We are supporting the SUMP and its strategic focus to a significant extent with our climate protection, noise reduction and clean air plans.

Dr Christian Korndörfer
Head of City of Dresden Environment Office

Despite the significant investments and efforts being made, there are still a large number of infrastructure deficits that will have to be tackled over the next few years. The adopted goals of the Dresden SUMP on sustainable development of the overall transport system give rise to other challenges. Particularly important are the requirements arising from environmental legislation, some of which are compulsory.

Some of the main deficits are listed below (as of 2015):

Structural defects in roads and bridges
Königsbrücker Straße
Loschwitzer Straße
Sections of Hamburger Straße
Bischofsplatz and Bischofsweg
Gerokstraße
Stauffenbergallee between Königsbrücker Straße and Radeburger Straße
Augustusbrücke
Blue Wonder (long-term load capacity)
Nossener Brücke

All of these roads are also noise hotspots.

Road safety/accident hotspots
Schillerplatz
Postplatz
Pirnaischer Platz
Straßburger Platz
Georgplatz

Overloaded junctions with major traffic congestion causing severe delays on public transport
Schillerplatz/Körnerplatz
Fetscherplatz
Albertplatz
Marienbrücke/Könneritzstraße traffic artery with several junctions
Dreißigplatz

Other deficits also exist, such as the following:
Air quality limits exceeded in some areas
Inadequate public transport provision in some areas
Design shortcomings in public spaces
Gaps in the bicycle route network
Backlog in provision of bicycle parking facilities
Poor pedestrian crossing facilities on some main roads
Inadequate disabled access

→ Poor quality roads, noise, airborne pollution and a lack of bicycle paths present a challenge for redevelopment and renovation work (Königsbrücker Straße)

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
$\uparrow$  Roads and squares are areas of public life: Martin-Luther-Platz following renovation

However, the aims underpinning the Dresden SUMP do not only involve addressing the existing deficits from today's point of view. There will be further challenges for the development of the transport system, in order to achieve dynamic, sustainable urban development that takes account of all important aspects in the future too. Of particular importance in this regard are:

These challenges cannot always be eliminated with specific measures, since general conditions and goals may change. For this reason, the Dresden SUMP is made up of specific projects (action strategy) and strategies extending further into the future (Mobility Strategy 2025plus).

Transport-related requirements for further economic development
Use of resources and environmental protection (including climate protection)
Demographic developments
Social balance (ensuring the participation of all population groups in society through mobility)
Urban quality of life (quality of open spaces, environmental quality).

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

In the Dresden conurbation, stable surrounding communities and a region characterised by a strongly declining population contrast with the dynamic development going on in the City of Dresden. Against this backdrop, a balanced SUMP can help avoid higher volumes of motor vehicle traffic while at the same time offering the population and businesses the high-quality mobility they need. The SUMP 2025plus is a key foundation for this. However, the extent to which it can be implemented in stages will be decisive.

# 6. How can we achieve the goals? Scenarios as pathways to the future

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

All stakeholders in the planning process are usually quick to agree on transport planning goals. However, opinions are often divided as to the strategies and approaches required to meet them. In drawing up the Dresden SUMP, therefore, the transport planners used the so-called scenario technique, a method that allows the impact of various approaches to be worked out. Five different scenarios were looked at.

The "Baseline forecast 2025" scenario looks at how transport would develop if all projects in progress were to be implemented without any additional measures being taken. This scenario includes the following projects:

Completion of federal road S 177n between Pirna and the A 4 motorway
Construction of new federal road S 191n from Goppeln to B 170
Installation of two extra tracks on the Dresden – Radebeul/Coswig rail route
New S-Bahn stop at Bischofsplatz in Dresden
Introduction of 15-minute frequency on S-Bahn line 1

The "Anyway case 2025" scenario also includes all the measures deemed to be implementable by 2025 by the various authorities responsible for road-building (federal government, federal state of Saxony, City of Dresden) – see the chapter on the Action Strategy 2025plus, described as "anyway measures" below. These include the following projects:

Redesign of/improvements to Königsbrücker Straße between Albertplatz and Industriegelände
Improvements to Hamburger Straße from Weißeritzbrücke to Warthaer Straße
New B 6n bypass at Cossebaude
Implementation of Stadtbahn programme in 2020
New central stop at Tharandter Straße

In addition, three other scenarios were worked out which clearly set out the scope for action and development in Transport Development planning over and above the development that is likely to take place anyway.

Scenario A 2025 looks at what would happen if all "anyway measures" were to be implemented by 2025, including further expansion of the road network, but measures for pedestrians and cyclists and traffic calming measures were also to be put in place. Scenario A is therefore dominated by the general objective of "good accessibility with the focus on motor-vehicle traffic measures" and includes the following measures:

Construction of a new bridge over the River Elbe at Niederpoyritz
Provision of step-free access at Stauffenbergallee/Königsbrücker Straße interchange
Better links with the Dresden Ost science hub, with a bridge under the railway at Liebstädter Straße
New S-Bahn stop in Stauffenbergallee and at Nossener Brücke
Continued gradual expansion of foot-path and bicycle path network

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
1
Sharing not owning: new services also lead to changes in behaviour in Scenario C

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Scenario B 2025 has a different goal in mind: "Good accessibility for all by improving short-range mobility and saving resources." This scenario includes all "anyway measures" and also focuses more on promoting sustainable modes of transport (local public transport, cycling and walking). Below are some examples:

Renovation of Blue Wonder and moratorium on construction of additional motor traffic bridges over the River Elbe until 2030
Greater renovation of the main road network
More frequent services on main Stadtbahn lines
Construction of four new S-Bahn stops
Regional railway to Ottendorf – Okrilla to be replaced by Stadtbahn line
Low-cost public transport mobility options (concessional tickets etc.)
Invest comprehensively in the foot-path and bicycle path network

Scenario C 2025 includes the same projects as Scenario B. However, whereas Scenarios A and B are based on transport behaviour from today's point of view, Scenario C assumes a change in behaviour resulting from higher mobility costs, greater environmental awareness and changed lifestyles. In this scenario, a change such as this, as can already be seen among today's young generation, would be supported by concrete measures on the part of the City Council but would not be directly impacted by them.

What findings can be gained from the calculations in the various scenarios?

Allowance should be made in the forecast for a significant increase in journeys in the urban area. This is not only the result of the growth in population but also the additional mobility options such as car sharing.
Projects currently in progress ("baseline forecast" scenario) and projects already decided ("anyway" scenario) clearly demonstrate a balanced mix of measures between those focused on the road network and those focused on sustainable forms of transport. Despite the population growth in Dresden, the volume of traffic on the roads is declining.
Investments focused too heavily on the road network will lead to rising demand in motor vehicle traffic beyond current levels, which would likely give rise to traffic problems (Scenario A).
Investments in ecomobility and measures to improve mobility increase the share of sustainable forms of transport while at the same time improving the general conditions for motor vehicle traffic and helping to reduce pollution from traffic (Scenario B).
If sustainable investments and measures impacting on mobility coincide with a behavioural change, the ambitious transport-related goals in the City of Dresden's climate protection concept could also be reached.

Supplemented by selected Scenario A projects, following a comprehensive discussion it was ultimately decided to take Scenario B as the basis for the further elaboration of the Dresden SUMP.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

This City of Dresden SUMP was developed with the cooperation of the town of Heidenau and takes account of shared regional interests in areas such as business traffic, bicycle paths and local public transport. I wish those concerned much success in implementing this plan.

Jürgen Opitz
Mayor of Heidenau

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

The region's roads and railways – and indeed even the River Elbe – are very much oriented towards Dresden. But a SUMP that does not include the surrounding area is unthinkable. In drawing up the Dresden SUMP, the City of Dresden has faced up to this challenge in an exemplary fashion.

# 7. Modules and content of the Dresden mobility strategy 2025plus

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

From my point of view, what makes the Dresden SUMP 2025plus stand out is the way it was drawn up. Right from the start, the planning process was to a significant extent geared towards transparency and openness, which it ultimately achieved to a previously unheard-of degree. In this way we were able to tap into the immense wealth of ideas and experience among Dresden's citizens and incorporate it in the SUMP through the Dresden Debate.

Dr Matthias Mohaupt
Project Manager, SUMP

In 2006 city transport planners drew up a mobility strategy for the City of Dresden consisting of four key modules following the principle of "Avoid - Move - Improve".

The aim was to minimise traffic, and in particular motor vehicle traffic, by optimally linking urban planning and transport planning. The most effective way of doing this is by achieving urban development that focuses on mixed use structures and the short paths and distances that these bring about. Unavoidable traffic should be accommodated with suitable forms of transport, giving priority to ecomobility (local public transport, cycling or walking) wherever possible. For this purpose, the substance of the existing transport infrastructure should be preserved and moderately expanded where doing so would bring about a specific improvement. Transport management should be used to optimise the use of infrastructure and minimise the impact of traffic on the environment. Finally, the aim of mobility management should be to help citizens identify the best form of transport to use for their day-to-day journeys with the least impact on the environment.

# City development and transport

# Transport infrastructure

# Transport management

# Mobility management

The Mobility Strategy 2025plus picks up on and elaborates upon these aspects, focusing in particular on the following:

Creating greater coordination between urban development, land-use planning and transport planning and developing more locations with easy access
■ Prioritising non-motorised traffic and public transport in order to achieve the energy efficiency, climate protection, clean air and noise reduction targets
Taking sufficient account of demographic trends and guaranteeing mobility and safety in traffic so as to enable as many citizens as possible to play an active part in society
Placing more emphasis on urban quality of life as a location benefit and developing the corresponding transport infrastructure
Designing transport infrastructures sensitively and to a high quality standard, taking the interests of all transport users into account
Promoting and interconnecting new, alternative forms of mobility (keywords: multimodality, car sharing, electro-mobility, etc.)
Ensuring financial sustainability in the development of the transport system by securing its long-term existence as a priority
Improving the planning culture in Dresden by including stakeholders and the public in subsequent planning processes in a consensus-based manner (the production process of the SUMP has already generated real impetus in this area)

Furthermore, the Mobility Strategy 2025plus identifies a number of concepts that require elaboration or updating alongside the SUMP 2025plus. These include:

## Concepts underpinning individual forms of transport

Examples: city-wide cycling concept, foot-path network concept, concept for speeding up and increasing capacity on local public transport

## Incorporation of findings from the SUMP into existing urban development, transport and environmental concepts

Examples: Update of HGV-guidance concept, clean air plan, framework urban development plans and development concepts for various locations

## Transport-related observations on development priorities and areas with special challenges

Examples: in-depth studies on the possible extension of Fröbelstraße up to Bayrische Straße to create a better link to the upcoming Dresden Ost science hub and the redevelopment of Große Meißner Straße at Neustädter Markt

The Mobility Strategy 2025plus describes how to secure and further develop the long-term future of Dresden's transport system beyond the action strategy of the SUMP 2025plus.

# 8. Key projects in the action strategy

The Dresden SUMP 2025plus contains a large number of projects involving improvements to infrastructure and services for all forms of transport, some of which are described below. The complete list can be found under the reference numbers shown in Annex 6.2 to the Dresden SUMP at www.dresden.de/vep.

Some projects that were decided before the SUMP was drawn up form key elements of the SUMP 2025plus ("anyway measures"). Some of these are third-party projects by the Free State of Saxony, the Federal Government and Verkehrsverbund Oberelbe.

Construction of missing sections of federal road S 177n between Pirna and the A 4 motorway (M 3)
Construction of federal road S 191n from Goppeln to the B 170 (M 4)

S4 Concentration of tram services in line with environmental targets and the needs of the changing population (M 41)
S6 Lower-cost mobility options in local public transport, such as concessional fares and tourist offers (M 119)
S8 Improving disabled access at stops and on vehicles, target 100% by 2022 (M 78)
S7 New S-Bahn stops (Albertstadt, Königsbrücker Landstraße and Richard-Strauss-Platz) (M 45/46)
S8 New Strehlen-Schillerplatz Stadtbahn route via Zwinglistraße (M 99)
S9 Regional railway to Ottendorf-Okrilla to be replaced by Stadtbahn connection (M 81)
S10 Systematisation/consolidation of rail services on the line to Coswig on the left bank of the Elbe and to Bischofswerda (M 42/M 100)
S11 Improvements to regional bus services to Bannewitz and Moritzburg (M 80)
S12 Speeding up local public transport by controlling traffic at junctions (M 101)
S13 Construction of a central bus station (ZOB) at Dresden central station (M 109)

## Accessibility and pedestrian traffic

Pedestrian infrastructure projects are usually very small scale. The Dresden SUMP cannot take them into account individually but sets the central agenda for them. The following starting points and measures have been given priority:

S4 Stronger integration of pedestrian traffic on an equal basis in projects in public spaces (M 29)
S5 Development of a city-wide pedestrian network concept (M 31)
S6 Development of more detailed transport concepts for individual districts, giving greater priority to pedestrian traffic and disabled access (M 31)
S7 Better pedestrian crossing facilities (centre islands, pedestrian crossings) and short waiting times at traffic lights (M 32/M 33)
S8 Continuation of the pavement programme, taking the needs of less mobile people into account (M 34)

Supplementary programmes and projects are being developed for the individual aspects, with a view to defining specific structural and organisational measures.

Efficient urban railways, green tram tracks, hybrid or electric buses, a multi-branched network of lines – all factors that make local public transport in Dresden environmentally-friendly and attractive and make the city a great place to live. And that's why we intend to expand the Stadtbahn network and our services. The SUMP provides an important foundation for this.

The general financial conditions play a key role in the implementation of the measures in the Dresden SUMP. From a practical point of view, the City of Dresden must set priorities and have the courage to implement political strategies. Highly efficient, safe traffic routes and mobility services that serve all interests and all users are a fundamental precondition for the economic upturn.

# Bicycle traffic

The SUMP also contains basic targets for cycling, a selection of which are given below:

Improve year-round availability of bicycle paths (M 48)
Set up bicycle stations (Central Station, Dresden-Neustadt station) and other bicycle parking facilities throughout the city in order to substantially improve bicycle parking (M 49/M 53)
Develop bicycle superhighways as part of the cycling concept (M 51)
Improve tourist offerings, including completing the bicycle path and footpath on the right bank of the Elbe at Loschwitz/Pillnitz and Übigau, provide facilities at Junge Heide-Kaditz-Elbe, and improve links to neighbouring municipalities (M 58/102)
Review the ferry service between Ostragehege and Altpieschen with particular reference to pedestrian and bicycle traffic (M 110)

The cycling concept for the City of Dresden, which complements the SUMP 2025plus (still in development at the time of publication), contains various concrete projects.

# Mobility management and innovation approaches

While less priority will be given to projects on expanding the infrastructure in the future, the priority of those involving mobility measures will increase. Above all, the emphasis will be on using the best (and most environmentally-friendly) form of transport for day-to-day journeys. This is uncharted territory in many areas and calls for ideas as well as the courage to innovate and experiment. The aim of innovation in this context is to constantly monitor current developments and use them as the basis for creating new approaches. TU Dresden and the Fraunhofer Institute for Transportation and Infrastructure Systems offer an excellent scientific setting for this.

Within the field of mobility management, emphasis should be placed on developing the following approaches in particular:

Strengthening the City of Dresden mobility team (M 36)
Promoting new mobility services through mobility management at company level (M 36)
Establishing mobility management for key commercial sites with large numbers of small and medium-sized businesses (M 36)
Continuing and extending "Jobtickets" and "Semestertickets" (M 37)
Setting up intermodal mobility hubs intersecting with car sharing, cycle hire and electro-mobility as an alternative to and alongside the use of private cars (M 141)

Innovations in all areas of mobility and transport development will be pursued at the Dresden Transportation Engineering location. From today's point of view, priority will be given to approaches that:

Provide better information for services that link different forms of transport (M 140)
Establish electric vehicles, for example in city logistics and bicycle courier services, with the City Council pioneering the use of electric vehicles by gradually switching its vehicle pool, and introducing them in local public transport, including buses (M 144/M 146)

Innovative ideas that promote cycling and walking are also called for (space-saving, high-capacity bicycle parking facilities, better road safety for pedestrians, etc.).

→ Cyclists also need space: bicycle parking at Neustadt station

# Elbe river crossings and setting aside space

Situated as it is on the River Elbe, bridges play a particularly important role in Dresden. With the construction of new river crossings in the Waldschlößenareal in Dresden, in Pirna and in Niederwartha, crossing the river from the residential area in the upper Elbe valley to the other side has become a whole lot easier. Renovating existing bridges will also play a role in this in the future. The greatest challenges lie in the renovation of the Augustusbrücke in the short term and the Loschwitzer Brücke (Blue Wonder) in the medium term. And despite the fact that the Blue Wonder, with Schillerplatz and Körnerplatz, will remain at its capacity limit for the foreseeable future, according to the scenario calculations there is no urgent need for additional river

crossings in the form of bridges or tunnels before 2025. The specific circumstances of the urban landscape and natural spaces make it unlikely that there will be any new construction to relieve pressure in the immediate vicinity of the river over the next 15 to 20 years. Projects to relieve the pressure on the Blue Wonder are therefore gaining in significance (e.g. improved local public transport links to Buhlau-Weißig).

Space should be set aside for future developments in the city area, such as an additional bridge to the west of Marienbrücke (the "3rd Marienbrücke") or a bridge along the extension of Erfurter Straße.

I commute around 30 km a day by public transport between my home and my work in Dresden. In future I hope that there will still be an attractive public transport system serving the towns and rural areas surrounding Dresden and that it will be speeded up and given priority. After all, as a commuter you don't want to be spending your precious leisure time sitting in buses and trains for hours on end.

Getting there quickly and safely in any weather: an efficient tram and bus system plays an important role in our day-to-day routines and helps us lead active lives. Cycling as an alternative: safe, clearly marked bicycle paths will help lots of people get to their destinations quickly and independently.

# 9. Steps towards implementation

A plan is only worthwhile if it achieves something. Over the next few years it will be important to take the right steps while keeping within the available budget. The fact that the SUMP 2025plus provides for various options and classifies projects by priority gives the city an effective toolkit to work with.

It will be up to local politicians and administrators to gradually prepare for the projects that are necessary and most suitable for implementing the Dresden SUMP. Alongside the planning objectives, the City Council will also keep an eye on current developments. It should also be investigated to what extent the general conditions that formed the basis for the SUMP 2025plus still apply, and whether the goals can be achieved with the implemented measures.

As the Dresden SUMP is phased in, it will be important to monitor the actual impact it is having so as to enable the City Council to make adjustments where necessary (keyword: monitoring/evaluation).

## A substantial basis is provided by the following:

Repeated traffic censuses counting motor vehicle and bicycle traffic and local public transport passenger numbers
Periodic mobility survey “Mobilität in Städten – SrV” (Mobility in Cities)
Measurements of motor vehicle journey times in the road network
Analyses of hindrances to trams and buses
along with numerous other systematically recorded data and indicators

Making adjustments may mean reviewing priorities in the implementation of projects in the SUMP 2025plus or even updating the plan itself. In the future, the SUMP will continue to deliver important starting points for ensuring sustainable mobility and transport for all citizens, creating even more favourable conditions for the development of the local and regional economy, reducing or avoiding environmental pollution from traffic and, last but not least, further improving the quality of life in Dresden.

The city administration will keep the City Council and the public properly informed about the progress being made in implementing the SUMP 2025plus and the impact it is having.

→ With the extension of S-Bahn line S 1, conditions for the many commuters from and to the surrounding areas will improve

Anyone who is mobile in our city is a transport user. It is therefore essential to represent the complexity of transport developments in a transparent, cohesive and comprehensive way in order to be able to identify trends.

This is precisely what the Dresden SUMP 2025plus does. Alongside various strategic goals, it sets out concrete goals that are important for preserving the traffic infrastructure, such as renovating bridges and roads, and particularly pavements and bicycle lanes. It is also important to improve traffic information and guidance systems and to manage capacity utilisation in existing traffic areas in a way that best meets everyone's needs, with the additional effect of reducing traffic noise and airborne pollution.

We also have other complex construction projects ahead of us in the form of Stadtbahn 2020. In future we intend to focus more on cycling traffic and making transport facilities more accessible. Being home to a University of Applied Sciences, we want to continue to get the most out of our proximity to science and innovation.

Preserving the existing infrastructure will keep our financing requirements at a high level. It will be interesting to see how the implementation of the ambitious goals and plans of the SUMP 2025plus over the next few years will work in terms of the city budget.

A large number of other areas of transport will be incorporated into this plan, with corresponding goals formulated. The present SUMP is therefore an important technical concept for all the players, stakeholders and interested parties who want to help shape transport processes in our city.

# Anmerkung zu den Gender-Formen:

Gemäß Allgemeiner Dienstanweisung für die Beschäftigten der Landeshauptstadt Dresden (ADA) Punkt 5.4.2 Absatz 6 ist "[...] im gesamten Schriftverkehr der Stadtverwaltung die Gleichberechtigung von Frauen und Männern sprachlich zu berücksichtigen. Hierbei ist der ausgeschriebenen weiblichen und männlichen Sprachform immer gegenüber Abkürzungen oder Zusammenfassungen der Vorzug zu geben." Die sprachliche Gleichbehandlung von Frauen und Männern darf allerdings nicht zu Lasten der Verständlichkeit von Verwaltungstexten verwendet werden bzw. führen. Für die Umsetzung geschlechtergerechter Sprache gilt somit, dass die im VEP verwendeten Personenbezeichnungen und ihre Verbindung eindeutig, grammatikalisch korrekt und semantisch stimmig sein muss. Vor diesem Hintergrund wurden im vorliegenden Text Paarformulierungen (feminine und maskuline Wortform), Pluralformen ("der/die"; "alle"), eine geschlechtsneutrale oder -umfassende Form bzw. Umformulierungen verwendet. Lediglich bei anerkannten verkehrlichen Fachbegriffen, die ohne konkreten Personenbezug verwendet werden, wurde in Abstimmung mit der Gleichstellungsbeauftragten für Frau und Mann auf gendergerechte Formulierungen im Sinne der Verständlichkeit punktuell verzichtet (z. B. bei Fußgängerverkehr, Besucherverkehr, Pendlerkonzept u. ä.).

## 0.1 Grundlegende Beschlüsse des Stadtrates

Der Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus wurde mit Stand 09.09.2013 als Vorlage V2476/13 in den Entscheidungsprozess des Stadtrates eingebracht. Am 20.11.2014 wurde diese Vorlage durch den Stadtrat der Landeshauptstadt Dresden bestätigt. Vorausgegangen war der Beschluss des Ausschusses Stadtentwicklung und Bau vom 5. November 2014, der in der Sitzung SB/001/2014 verschiedene Änderungen zum bestehenden VEP-Entwurf vom 09.09.2014 in die Vorlage V2476/13 eingebrachte.

Zudem wurde in der Sitzung des Stadtrates vom 20.11.2014 die Vorlage V2745/14 beschlossen, die Anpassungen des VEP aufgrund der Bürgerbeteiligung in Form der „Dresdner Debatte“ zum Verkehrsentwicklungsplan vorsieht. Dieser Vorlage hatte der Ausschuss für Stadtentwicklung und Bau in der Sitzung SB/081/2014 am 02.04.2014 nur mit Änderungen zugestimmt, allerdings wurde im Stadtrat die ursprüngliche Version der Vorlage abgestimmt, die wiederum eine Integration der Abwägungsergebnisse in den VEP fordert.

Aus diesen Beschlüssen leitet sich der Auftrag für die Stadtverwaltung ab, den Entwurf des VEP 2025plus vom 09.09.2013 mit dem Redaktionsstand des Beschlussstages 20.11.2014 entsprechend zu überarbeiten.

## 0.2 Änderungen aus dem Beschluss zum VEP2025plus (V2476/13)

Der Beschluss besteht aus 7 Teilen, deren Auswirkungen auf das Dokument (Text, Anlagen, Abbildungen) nachfolgend beschrieben wird:

Beschlusspunkt 1a „Maßnahmenkatalog Anlage 6“: Ergänzung des Bewertungsschemas in Kap. 4.4 und Änderung der entsprechenden Prioritäten in Anlage 6 (Unterteilung in Anlage 6.1 mit den ursprünglichen Bewertungen aus der Entwurfsversion VEP vom 09.09.2014 und einer neuen Anlage 6.2 mit den nun neuen Bewertungen entsprechend der Beschlussfassung),
Beschlusspunkt 1b „Radverkehrsnetz“: Anpassung des Erläuterungstextes der Abbildung 16 sowie des Textes im Kapitel zum Radverkehr (Kap. 6.7.3),
Beschlusspunkt 1c „Fußgängerverkehrskonzepte“: Anpassung des Erläuterungstextes der Abbildung 18 sowie des Textes im Kapitel zum Fußgängerverkehr (Kap. 6.8),
Beschlusspunkt 1d bis f „Straßennetzkategorien“: Entsprechende Änderungen der Abbildungen 6 und 7 sowie der Anlage 8 (Erläuterungen),
Beschlusspunkt 2 „Anpassungen Anlage 6“: Anpassungen in Anlage 6.2 sowie der entsprechenden Passagen im Textteil – es entfallen die Maßnahmen 39 (Unterstützung regionales Pendlernetzwerk) sowie Nummer 89 (Verpflichtung zu Carsharing-Stellplätzen in Bebauungsplänen),
Beschlusspunkt 3 „Runder Tisch und Bürgerbeteiligung“: Anpassung des Textes in Kapitel 1.1 zum Prozess des VEP und in Kapitel 5.3 zur Bürgerbeteiligung,
Beschlusspunkt 4 „Kernbeschluss und Evaluation“: Erarbeitung von Indikatoren, die die bisherigen Monitoring-Kriterien ersetzen und entsprechende Anpassung des Kapitels 5.9 mit Methodik, neuer Indikatorentabelle und geänderten Zeiträumen der Evaluierung,
Beschlusspunkt 5 „Anlage 9 - zentrale, stadträumliche Defizitbereiche“: Keine Änderungen in der Anlage allerdings Kommentar in Kapitel 6.9.2, dass diese Lösungsansätze vom Stadtrat nur zur Kenntnis genommen wurden und vertieft geprüft werden sollen – sie bilden somit keine festen Maßnahmen des VEP,
Beschlusspunkt 6 „Kenntnisnahme Runder Tisch“: keine Änderungen im Dokument,
Beschlusspunkt 7 „Kenntnisnahme Runder Tisch Region“: keine Änderungen im Dokument.

Durch die dargestellten Anpassungen werden keine relevanten Kostengrößen verändert. Eine neue Kostenberechnung für den VEP ist damit nicht erforderlich.

## 0.3 Änderungen aus dem Beschluss zur Dresdner Debatte (V2745/14)

Als Instrument der Bürgerbeteiligung wurde der Entwurf des VEP im Zuge der dritten „Dresdner Debatte“ diskutiert. Sowohl Online als auch durch Vor-Ort-Diskussionen und Informationen wurden seine Inhalte von einer breiten Öffentlichkeit diskutiert (Details dazu siehe Kapitel 1.4). Die Abwägungsergebnisse wurden als Vorlage V2745/14 in den Stadtrat eingebracht. Der dazu gefasste Beschluss fordert die Integration der Abwägungsergebnisse (Anlage 3 der Vorlage) in den VEP. Alle Maßnahmen, denen in Anlage 3 der Vorlage teilweise oder vollständig gefolgt werden kann, werden in den VEP eingearbeitet. Dies betrifft in Summe 21 Maßnahmen bzw. aggregierte Maßnahmenkomplexe (z. B. zum ruhenden Verkehr) bzw. einige Prüfaufträge. Im VEP-Dokument wurde das wie folgt umgesetzt:

Anpassung der Festlegungen („Anregung wird gefolgt“) in Text und Anlage 6.2,
Aktualisierung der innovativen Ansätze in Text und Anlage 6.2,
Übernahme von einer Vielzahl von Anregungen in das Radverkehrskonzept,
interne Auflistung der Prüfaufträge für die Verwaltung und Integration in den Arbeitsprozess.

Durch die Anpassungen aus der Dresdner Debatte werden keine relevanten Kostengrößen verändert. Eine neue Kostenberechnung für den VEP ist damit nicht erforderlich. Da zudem die beschriebenen Maßnahmen großteils Innovationen sowie Ergänzungen zu bestehenden Handlungsansätzen beschreiben, sind die bestehenden Prioritäten (siehe Kap. 4.4) weiter gültig.

## 0.4 Indikatoren für die Evaluierung

Der Evaluierungsprozess des VEP wurde durch den Beschluss des Stadtrates verändert. Indikatoren und zeitliche Prioritäten für die Zielerreichung im Kapitel 5.9 wurden entsprechend angepasst und die zeitlichen Abläufe umorganisiert. Die erste Evaluierung erfolgt 2017.

# 1. Grundlagen

## 1.1 Prozess der Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung in Dresden

Der Verkehrsentwicklungsplan (VEP) 2025plus ist das konzeptionelle Steuerungsinstrument, mit dem Ziele und Strategien urbaner verkehrlicher Entwicklung für einen Planungshorizont von 10 bis 15 Jahren beschrieben und bewertet werden. Der VEP dient den politischen Entscheidungsebenen, aber auch den Akteuren in Wirtschaft, Verbänden etc. sowie Bürgerinnen und Bürgern als Orientierung und Handlungsleitfaden.

Im Herbst 2009 startete die Arbeit am VEP 2025plus und schreibt damit den verkehrskonzeptionellen Prozess in der Landeshauptstadt Dresden fort, der im Jahr 1990 auf Basis vorheriger Generalverkehrspläne begonnen wurde. Dieser Prozess ist durch wichtige Stationen gekennzeichnet:

Leitbild für die künftige Verkehrspolitik im Ballungsgebiet Dresden von 1990 (Arbeitsergebnis der Untergruppe Verkehr des zeitweiligen Arbeitskreises „Komplexe Stadtentwicklung der Stadt Dresden“; hierbei handelt es sich um das erste verkehrspolitische Material, das nach der politischen Wende in basisdemokratischer Arbeit entstanden ist),
Verkehrskonzept der Landeshauptstadt Dresden von 1994 (entwickelt auf Basis des oben genannten Materials),
Verkehrsnetze für den ÖPNV und das Hauptverkehrsstraßennetz im Flächennutzungsplan 1998 und im Integrierten Stadtentwicklungskonzept 2002,
Fortschreibung des Verkehrskonzeptes aus dem Jahre 2003 (verwaltungsinternes Material, jedoch mit Trägern öffentlicher Belange bereits abgestimmt),
Umfassende Bilanz zum Umsetzungsstand des Verkehrskonzepts von 1994 (dem Stadtrat der Landeshauptstadt Dresden im Jahre 2005 vorgelegt),
Beschluss des Stadtrates zur Aufstellung eines Verkehrsentwicklungsplans (SR-46-2007 vom 1. März 2007).

Um den Ansprüchen innovativer und zeitgemäßer kommunaler Verkehrsplanung zu genügen, wurde seitens der Stadtverwaltung für den Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden eine Arbeitsstruktur entwickelt, die sowohl die fachliche Qualität und ein effektives Zeitmanagement sichert als auch eine Vielzahl von Akteuren sowie interne und externe Kompetenzträger beteiligt. Die nachfolgende Grafik zeigt die Organisationsstruktur des Prozesses:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Grafik 1: Organisationsstruktur der Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung in Dresden

Der VEP-Prozess begann Ende 2009 mit der Konstitution der begleitenden Gremien

Wissenschaftlicher Beirat
Lenkungskreis
Runder Tisch und
Runder Tisch Region.

Neben dem mit Expertinnen und Experten der Technischen Universität (TU) Dresden, des Deutschen Instituts für Urbanistik (DIfU) Berlin und der TU Stuttgart besetzten Wissenschaftlichen Beirat kommt dem Runden Tisch eine Schlüsselfunktion zu. Unter externer Moderation gehören ihm Vertreter von Wirtschafts- und Verkehrsverbänden, Verkehrsträgern, unterschiedlichen gesellschaftlichen Interessengruppen, Planungsverwaltung und allen Stadtratsfraktionen an. Erfahrungen mit ähnlichen Beteiligungsmodellen lagen bis 2009 in nur wenigen deutschen Städten vor.

erfolgte die Formulierung von konsensualen Zielen für die Verkehrsentwicklung durch den Runden Tisch in einem überwiegend konstruktiven, teilweise auch kontroversen Diskussionsprozess unter externer Moderation. Grundlage waren die Ergebnisse aus vier Arbeitsgruppen, in denen die Mitglieder des Runden Tisches Ziele, Leitlinien und Prioritäten für die Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung 2025plus diskutiert haben. Der VEP ist dabei im Gesamtansatz als kooperativer und iterativer Prozess zum Erreichen der formulierten Leitziele zu verstehen. Durch die in ihm verankerten Evaluierungs- und Monitoringstrategien (siehe Kapitel 5.9) ist er sowohl ein hinreichend verbindliches als auch ein ausreichend flexibles Instrumentarium für eine zielgerichtete

Verkehrspolitik. Der Runde Tisch soll aufgrund seiner positiven integrativen Wirkung auch nach Beschluss des VEP als begleitendes Gremium Umsetzung und Evaluierung des VEP begleiten.

Im April 2011 wurde auf der Grundlage einer zweistufigen europaweiten Ausschreibung (Verhandlungsverfahren mit öffentlichem Teilnahmewettbewerb) das Planerkonsortium IVV Aachen und IVAS Dresden mit der inhaltlichen Erarbeitung des VEP beauftragt.

Die Arbeitsergebnisse aller wichtigen Etappen der Bearbeitung wurden den politischen Gremien vorgelegt:

Analyse der Ist-Situation/Problem- und Mängelanalyse der Mitglieder des Runden Tisches (Info-Vorlage V0685/10 im Ausschuss für Stadtentwicklung und Bau am 18. August 2010),
Zielstellung für die künftige Verkehrsentwicklung (Stadtratsbeschluss Nr. V0811/10 am 24. März 2010),
Analysebericht zur Verkehrsentwicklung in Dresden (Info-Vorlage V1204/11 im Ausschuss für Stadtentwicklung und Bau am 24. August 2011),
(Entwicklungs-) Szenario für die weitere Bearbeitung des Verkehrsentwicklungsplans 2025plus (Vorlage V1630/12 im Ausschuss für Stadtentwicklung und Bau am 12. September 2012).

Im Vorfeld der Entscheidungen zugunsten eines Entwicklungsszenarios wurden in Gesprächsrunden mit den baupolitischen Sprechern der Stadtratsfraktionen die fachlichen Inhalte mit dem Ziel der Kompromissfindung zwischen unterschiedlichen Auffassungen und Reflexionen vertieft. Der Wissenschaftliche Beirat war in die Positionsbestimmung und Entscheidungsvorbereitung beratend eingebunden.

Die Landeshauptstadt Dresden beschreitet mit dem Procedere bei der Erstellung des VEP 2025plus keinen Sonderweg. Das ist die Kernaussage eines VEP-Fachkolloquiums, das gemeinsam mit der TU Dresden, der Deutschen Verkehrswissenschaftlichen Gesellschaft (DVWG) Sachsen und der Landeshauptstadt Dresden am 15. Oktober 2012 durchgeführt wurde. Beiträge aus Bremen, Magdeburg, Leipzig, Dortmund, München und Dresden haben gezeigt, dass insbesondere die Anforderungen und Ansprüche an einen transparenten Erarbeitungsprozess mit breiter Bürgerbeteiligung die moderne VEP-Erstellung prägen, zugleich aber auch eine erhebliche Herausforderung bei der Organisation dieser Prozesse darstellen. Das Modell des Runden Tisches wurde dabei als ein maßgebender und effizienter Bestandteil herausgearbeitet. Auf besonderes Interesse stieß im Dresdner Beitrag der Bericht über die Bildung eines „Runden Tisches Region“, der die Brücke zu den Interessen der benachbarten Städte und Gemeinden bis hinein in die Euroregion Elbe-Labe schlägt.

Im Rahmen der POLIS-Präsidentschaft Dresdens fand der VEP 2025plus internationale Beachtung. Die gemeinsame Erarbeitung der Ziele wie auch die Erörterung unterschiedlicher möglicher Szenarien für die künftige Verkehrsentwicklung in Dresden war zwar von kontroversen Debatten geprägt, sie endete jedoch stets einem tragfähigen Kompromiss.

Verkehrsentwicklungspläne sind längst keine ausschließliche Aufgabe für (Verkehrs-) Fachleute. Sie sind vielmehr Planwerke, die ihren Nutzen für die Menschen einer Stadt, für deren Wirtschaft, Handel und Gewerbe, für den Tourismus und vieles andere mehr entfalten sollen. Moderne Verkehrsentwicklungspläne werden nicht nur für, sondern mit den vielfältigen Interessenträgern und den Bewohnerinnen und Bewohnern einer Stadt erarbeitet.

Von besonderer Bedeutung hinsichtlich der integrierenden Funktion des VEP ist die Abstimmung mit den Zielen der Integrierten Stadtentwicklung (und hier besonders des aktuell in Fortschreibung befindlichen InSEK). Der Verkehrsentwicklungsplan greift die entsprechenden Zielstellungen auf und bildet somit das strategische Bindeglied zwischen Stadtentwicklung und Verkehr. Folglich wurden die Ziele der Stadtentwicklung sowie die sich daraus ableitenden räumlichen Schwerpunkte früh und umfassend in die Erarbeitung des VEP sowie in die Erarbeitung der verkehrlichen Leitziele und der räumlichen Schwerpunkte eingebunden bzw. aufeinander abgestimmt. Hinsichtlich ihrer Hauptentwicklungsrichtungen sollen VEP und InSEK gleich ausgerichtet sein, da sonst Widersprüche in der Bewertung und Umsetzung von wichtigen Maßnahmen im Verkehrssystem entstehen könnten.

Einen weiteren wichtigen Anknüpfungspunkt bildet die Flächennutzungsplanung. Die im VEP beschriebenen Flächenvorhaltungen müssen in die Flächennutzungsplanung integriert werden. Aber auch der Landschaftsplan als Grundlage der Flächennutzungsplanung steht damit in Wechselwirkung zum Verkehrssystem und insbesondere der Verkehrsinfrastruktur.

Dieses Planungsverständnis erfordert stets aktuelle Informationen zum Bearbeitungsstand und zu den Arbeitsinhalten, die vor allem über das Internet bereitgestellt werden. Eine gute Resonanz hatten zudem zwei Podiumsdiskussionen sowie Vorträge bei verschiedenen Veranstaltungen mit anschließenden Diskussionen. Viele Einwohnerinnen und Einwohner werden auch über die Mitglieder des Runden Tisches erreicht und so in den Planungsprozess eingebunden. Zur besseren Transparenz von Verwaltungsabläufen wurde ein Planercafé eingerichtet. Hier erhalten die Mitglieder des Runden Tisches einen vertiefenden Einblick in die sonst nicht sichtbaren VEP-bezogenen Arbeiten der Verwaltung. Als das wichtigste Diskussionsforum der interessierten Bürgerschaft fand die Dresdner Debatte zum VEP im Herbst 2013 - vor der Diskussion im Stadtrat - statt.

Der Runde Tisch begleitete die Erarbeitung des VEP 2025plus von Beginn an intensiv und konstruktiv. Die Mitglieder des Runden Tisches formulierten Anforderungen an den VEP, analysierten Mängel und Probleme des Dresdner Verkehrssystems und gaben Hinweise und Voten aus der

Sicht der jeweils vertretenen Fachsparte zu verschiedenen Bearbeitungsetappen des VEP. Der Runde Tisch kann nicht die Entscheidungssouveränität der politischen Gremien ersetzen, ist aber eine maßgebende Beratungsinstitution für die beschließenden Gremien.

Der Wissenschaftliche Beirat hat den gesamten Planungsprozess fachlich und inhaltlich intensiv begleitet sowie innovative Ideen eingebracht. Der Wissenschaftliche Beirat beriet und unterstützte den Auftraggeber bereits in der Phase der Ausschreibung sowie in allen Bearbeitungsetappen (Prognose, Problem- und Mängelanalyse, Szenarienbildung, Wirkungsermittlung, Maßnahmenbewertung, Erarbeitung der Mobilitätsstrategie und des Handlungskonzepts) aus neutraler fachlicher Sicht. Der Beirat fungierte als wichtiger, streitbarer aber auch vermittelnder Partner bei der Bewältigung von Problemen und dem Aufzeigen von Lösungsstrategien.

## 1.2 Leitziele der zukünftigen Verkehrsentwicklung

Die „Ziele für die künftige Verkehrsentwicklung der Landeshauptstadt Dresden für den Zeithorizont 2025 und darüber hinaus“ wurden vom Stadtrat der Landeshauptstadt Dresden am 24. März 2011 beschlossen (Beschluss Nr. SR-025-2011). Sie bestehen aus einer Präambel, vier Leitzielen und 43 Unterzielen.

Die Präambel lautet:

Verkehr ist kein Selbstzweck! Er dient der Mobilität der Bevölkerung und der Sicherung der urbanen Wirtschaft. Beides setzt die freie Wahl der Verkehrsmittel voraus.
Die Erhaltung der Mobilität – bezahlbar, sicher und umweltschonend – ist eine gesamtgesellschaftliche Aufgabe ersten Ranges. Sie sollte im Konsens und unter weitestgehendem Verzicht auf dirigistische Maßnahmen umgesetzt werden.
Das Recht auf körperliche Unversehrtheit sowie die Gleichstellung aller Menschen ist Verfassungsgrundsatz. Auch die Verpflichtung, auf die Gleichwertigkeit der Lebensverhältnisse hinzuwirken, ist in der Verfassung des Freistaates Sachsen verankert. Beides sind essentielle Leitlinien für die heutige und künftige Verkehrsentwicklung.
Die Entwicklung von Mobilität und Verkehr ist mehr denn je globalen Einflüssen (Konjunkturschwankungen, begrenzte fossile Energieressourcen und steigende Energiepreise sowie Klimaveränderungen) unterworfen. Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung muss darauf Antworten finden.
Gleiches gilt für die Auswirkungen des demografischen Wandels, woraus veränderte Lebens-, Verkehrs- und Mobilitätsbedürfnisse erwachsen.
Die Verkehrsinfrastruktur muss unter besonderer Beachtung des Kosten-Nutzen-Verhältnisses erhalten und entwickelt werden.

VAS

Nationale und europäische Gesetze und Verordnungen geben essentielle Rahmenbedingungen für die Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung vor. Die Stadt Dresden wird diese aktiv mitgestalten. Die vier Leitziele sind wie folgt formuliert:

Leitziel 1:
Zukunftsfähige, nachhaltige und umweltgerechte Verkehrs- und Mobilitätsqualität für die Bevölkerung und die Wirtschaft.

Leitziel 2:
Sozial gerechte Mobilitätsteilhabe - unter Berücksichtigung spezifischer Bedürfnisse aufgrund unterschiedlicher Lebensbedingungen – und damit gleiche Chancen für alle zur Beteiligung am gesellschaftlichen Leben.

Leitziel 3:
Gewährleistung und Sicherung einer hochwertigen Stadt- und Umweltqualität durch Effizienzsteigerung integrierter Verkehrssysteme und Reduzierung des verkehrsbedingten Verbrauchs natürlicher Ressourcen.

Leitziel 4:
VEP als offener Planungs- und Entscheidungsprozess unter Einbeziehung von Verkehrswissenschaft, Verbänden, Verkehrsträgern, sonstigen gesellschaftlichen Gruppen, Beauftragten, interessierten Bürgerinnen und Bürgern sowie unterschiedlichen Fachdisziplinen.

Jedes Leitziel wird durch Unterziele weiter konkretisiert. Präambel, Leitziele und die 43 Unterziele zeigt Anlage 1. Im Beratungsprozedere im Ausschuss Stadtentwicklung und Bau wurden die vom Runden Tisch erarbeiteten konsensualen Ziele und Unterziele nur leicht modifiziert.

Diese Zielstellungen sind wichtige Grundlage und Bestandteil der Erarbeitung des VEP 2025plus.

## 1.3 Struktur des VEP mit Mobilitätsstrategie und Handlungskonzept

Der VEP 2025plus basiert auf den Vorarbeiten des Verkehrskonzepts 2003 und dessen fachlicher Fortschreibung. Entsprechend der Aufgabenstellung des VEP besteht das Gesamtdokument aus 4 Teilen:

Teil A: Grundlagen und Bestandsanalyse
Teil B: Entwicklungsszenarien, Wirkungen und Prioritäten
Teil C: Mobilitätsstrategie 2025plus
Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025

Entsprechend ist der vorliegende Bericht gegliedert.

Seite 12
Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus
Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil A: Grundlagen und Bestandsanalyse
LVM VERITAS

Der erste Teil des Verkehrsentwicklungsplans Dresden 2025plus dokumentiert im Wesentlichen die Erkenntnisse einer synoptischen Verkehrsanalyse, die sich auftragsgemäß auf bereits sehr zahlreich vorliegende Unterlagen, vorhandene Kenntnisse und Kompetenzen abstützt. Die **Bestandsanalyse** verfolgt folgende Ziele:

Herstellen eines gleichen Kenntnisstands aller Beteiligten zum Verkehrssystem,
Erkennen von Trends und Zusammenhängen von Mobilität und Verkehrsmittelwahl,
Aufzeigen wichtiger Defizite,
Differenzieren von Ergebnissen und Daten nach VEP-Relevanz,
Bereitstellen von Grundlagen für die Ableitung sinnvoller Szenarienansätze,
Aufbau belastbarer Grundlage für den VEP-Prozess und als Basis für das Monitoring.

Die wesentlichen Analyseergebnisse sind in Kap. 2.2 dokumentiert. Sie werden durch einen ausführlichen Analysebericht vom Juli 2011 ergänzt.

Der zweite Teil des Verkehrsentwicklungsplans Dresden skizziert die bis zum Jahr 2025 erwartete Bevölkerungsentwicklung und zeigt – darauf aufbauend – am Beispiel von drei unterschiedlichen **Maßnahmen- und Verhaltensszenarien** die damit jeweils verbundenen Wirkungen im Bereich Verkehr und Umwelt auf. Die Maßnahmenwirkungen werden modellgestützt ermittelt. Teil 2 bildet den methodischen Kern des VEP Dresden und umfasst

Strukturdatenprognose
Entwicklungsszenarien
Maßnahmenbewertung
Prioritätenreihung der Maßnahmen.

Die Szenarientechnik, die modellgestützten Wirkungsberechnungen und die anschließende Maßnahmenbewertung schaffen die fachlichen Voraussetzungen, die bestgeeigneten Maßnahmen zur Erfüllung der VEP-Ziele im Lichte der zu erwartenden Wirkungen auszuwählen und weniger geeignete oder weniger wirksame Maßnahmen zu erkennen und entsprechend nachrangig zu behandeln bzw. zu verwerfen.

Die **Mobilitätsstrategie 2025plus** bildet den strategischen Teil des Verkehrsentwicklungsplans Dresden (Teil 3). Sie beinhaltet die Ansätze des VEP, die deutlich langfristiger wirken und Prinzipien beschreiben. Die Mobilitätsstrategie 2025plus enthält:

generelle strategische Entwicklungsprinzipien über 2025 hinaus,
Strategien zur Bestandssicherung für die bestehenden Verkehrsnetze,
Anforderungen an die Fortschreibung und Vertiefung von den VEP ergänzenden Konzepten,
Ansätze zur Verbesserung der Verkehrssicherheit,

Seite 13

wichtige Prinzipien des Verwaltungshandelns insbesondere in der Bauleitplanung,
zu vertiefende Planungsansätze und weiteren Untersuchungsbedarf,
Angaben zu notwendigen Flächenfreihaltung und zu langfristigen Entwicklungsoptionen der Infrastruktur sowie
Ansätze für Monitoring und Evaluation des VEP.

Der strategische Teil des Verkehrsentwicklungsplans 2025plus wird ergänzt durch einen handlungsorientierten Teil (Teil 4). Das Handlungskonzept 2025 enthält die konkreten Maßnahmen, die bis zum Jahr 2025 (ggf. auch bis 2030) umgesetzt werden sollten, um die Ziele der Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung in Dresden bestmöglich zu erfüllen. Das Handlungskonzept 2025 enthält:

zentrale stadträumliche Maßnahmen mit nachgewiesener Wirkung im Sinne der verkehrlichen Leitziele der Stadt Dresden,
alle prioritär oder sinnvoll bewerteten Maßnahmen,
Pilotprojekte auf Basis der Mobilitätsstrategie sowie
bereits beschlossene und wirkungsgeprüfte Maßnahmen bis 2025.

Der vorliegende Bericht enthält die Arbeitsergebnisse in allen vier Teilbereichen der Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung und versteht sich als umfassende Gesamtdokumentation (lediglich der Analyseteil ist hierbei erkenntnisorientiert zusammengefasst worden). Auf diese Weise werden der stringente Planungsansatz, die verwendete Planungsmethodik sowie Auswahl und Priorisierung der Maßnahmen des Handlungskonzepts deutlich.

## 1.4 Informationen zum Beteiligungsprozess mit der „Dresdner Debatte“ zum VEP

Der Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus wurde in seiner mehrjährigen Erarbeitungsphase intensiv durch verschiedene fachliche und ehrenamtliche Gremien in Bürgerschaft und Politik ausgewogen begleitet (siehe Kapitel 1.1). Der so entstandene Entwurf des VEP wurde dann in Form der „Dresdner Debatte“ im September/Oktober 2013 einer breiten öffentlichen Diskussion zugänglich gemacht. Er wurde im Internet veröffentlicht und in einer Infobox im Stadtzentrum mit Ansprechpartnern der Verwaltung für 4 Wochen zur Diskussion ausgelegt.

Unter dem Titel „Fischelant Mobil – Verkehr neu denken“ debattierten vom 21. September bis 19. Oktober 2013 Bürgerinnen und Bürger auf der Onlineplattform www.dresdner-debatte.de und in der Infobox vor Ort am Dr.-Külz-Ring zur Verkehrsentwicklung in Dresden und zum Entwurf des Verkehrsentwicklungsplans 2025plus. Damit setzte die „Dresdner Debatte“ zum VEP-Entwurf die Kontinuität der seit Beginn des VEP-Planungsprozesses erfolgten breiten Fachbeteiligung fort und weitet die Beteiligung auf die Bevölkerung aus. Dieser Bürgerdialog hatte zum Ziel, Vorschlä-

Grafik 2: Internetseite, Plakat und „Container“ der Dresdner Debatte zum VEP

Die Debattenwebsite im Internet wurde von insgesamt fast 4500 Personen aufgerufen. Die Anzahl der Seitenaufrufe während der aktiven Laufzeit der Debatte lag bei 42 293. Es wurden 1200 Beiträge verfasst, die sich wie folgt zusammensetzen: 364 Vorschläge, 549 Kommentare, 279 ausgefüllte Modalsplit-Umfragen, dazu 1459 Bewertungen. Über 400 Mal wurden die bereit gestellten Informationsmaterialien heruntergeladen. Die meisten Teilnehmer verfassten ihre Beiträge und Kommentare ohne vorherige Registrierung. In die Infobox kamen an 19 Tagen insgesamt circa 570 Besucher. An der Ballosplit-Umfrage (dem analogen Pendant zur Onlineumfrage zum Verkehrsmittelmix bzw. Modal Split 2025) beteiligten sich rund 2600 Bürgerinnen und Bürger.

Die Beiträge und Anregungen aus der Dresdner Debatte spiegeln subjektive Sichtweisen und Erfahrungen des eigenen Erlebens der Bürgerinnen und Bürger wider. Diese individuellen Ansichten sind in den Kontext einer gesamtstädtischen Planung zu setzen und entsprechend zu differenzieren in VEP-relevante Anregungen und Vorschläge, Anregungen zur Qualitätsverbesserung des Dresdner Verkehrssystems, Anregungen für Verkehrs- und Mobilitätspartner (DVB AG, VVO

GmbH u. a.). So erfolgte eine Sichtung aller Vorschläge und Kommentare zu ihrem Bezug zum VEP-Entwurf. 95,5 % der Anregungen werden weiter genutzt. 52 % aller Anregungen betreffen das planerische „Tagesgeschäft“ und 48 Prozent sind VEP-relevant. Von letztgenannten sind 2/3 bereits im VEP-Entwurf enthalten, so dass dessen Inhalte dadurch bestärkt werden. 1/3 der VEP-relevanten Anregungen betreffen bisher unerwähnte Aspekte. Die aggregierte Aufbereitung dieser neuen und bisher unberücksichtigten Maßnahmen der Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung ergibt 64 Themenbereiche, wovon 21 Bereiche zur Aufnahme in den VEP 2025plus vorgeschlagen wurden. Dies erfolgte mit der Vorlage V2745/14 „Ergebnisse der Dresdner Debatte zum Entwurf des Verkehrsentwicklungsplans 2025plus (VEP 2025plus) der Landeshauptstadt Dresden“.

## 2.1 Vorliegende Dokumente und Materialien

Dem Verkehrsentwicklungsplan 2025plus liegt eine umfassende Analyse aller vorliegenden verkehrlichen Daten zu Grunde, die größtenteils im Analysebericht vom 29.07.2011 bereits dargestellt wurden. Mit dem Stand vom 02.04.2012 wurde zu den Szenarien- und Kostenrechnungen ein eigener Bericht erarbeitet, indem die Ergebnisse detailliert aufbereitet wurden.

In den folgenden Kapiteln wird im Sinne eines Gesamtverständnisses das Wesentliche beider Dokumente dargestellt und um aktuelle Erkenntnisse aus den Arbeitsprozessen in 2012 ergänzt. Grundlage der Untersuchung ist eine Vielzahl von kommunalen und externen Daten, Untersuchungen, Konzepten und Beschlüssen:

Dokumente der Stadt Dresden, des Freistaates Sachsen und des ÖPNV-Aufgabenträgers im jeweils aktuellen Stand seit 1994 bzw. 2003 (siehe Anlage 2, Teil 1) – hervorzuheben ist hier das Verkehrskonzept 2003/2009, das für wichtige Teile die Bezugsgrundlage bildet
der Beschluss des Stadtrates über „Ziele für die künftige Verkehrsentwicklung der Landeshauptstadt Dresden für den Zeithorizont 2025 und darüber hinaus“ vom 24.03.2011
Aussagen der Akteure des Runden Tisches zu Leitzielen und Defiziten (siehe auch Anlage 2, Teil 2)
Aussagen von Nachbargemeinden und Kreisen (siehe Anlage 2, Teil 2)
Daten-Zuarbeiten der Ämter der Stadt Dresden (siehe Anlage 2, Teil 3)
Forschungsarbeiten und Messungen, insbesondere der TU Dresden (siehe Anlage 2, Teil 3)
Strukturdatenammlungen/ Prognosen (siehe Anlage 2, Teil 3) sowie
eigene Kenntnisse und fachliche Einschätzungen

Die vorliegenden ca. 60 Einzeldokumente und Forschungsarbeiten wurden durchgesehen, bewertet und für die Analyse genutzt. Im Rahmen des Analyseprozesses erfolgte eine enge Abstimmung mit dem Integrierten Energie- und Klimaschutzkonzept der Landeshauptstadt Dresden (Teil CO₂-Verkehrsemissionen Dresden) sowie mit dem Fortschreibungsprozess zum Integrierten Stadtentwicklungskonzept.

Als Ergebnis der Materialanalyse kann folgendes generelles Fazit gezogen werden:

Im Wesentlichen zeigen die Dokumente ähnliche und im Grundsatz kaum widersprüchliche Entwicklungsrichtungen für die Gesamtstadt auf.
Zwischen Entwicklungsplanungen und Umweltanforderungen stehen weniger generelle als vielmehr maßnahmenbezogene Diskrepanzen.

Die Konzepte zeigen größtenteils hinsichtlich einer attraktiven, zukunftsorientierten und ressourcenschonenden Stadtentwicklung erstrebenswerte Ziele
Bei der Darstellung von Maßnahmen werden zwar häufig Prioritäten benannt - konkrete und realistische zeitliche Vorgaben (und deren Einhaltung) sowie eine mögliche Finanzierung werden nicht in allen Fällen berücksichtigt

Die aktuellen Ergebnisse aus dem Energie- und Klimaschutzkonzept Dresden (Beschluss SR/056/2013) werden derzeit diskutiert. Teilweise wurde mit der Umsetzung einzelner Maßnahmen bereits begonnen. Hier zeigt sich, dass die Effekte aus dem Bereich Kfz-Verkehr auch mit Verstetigungen im Ablauf sowie Anpassungen der Fahrzeugtechnik deutlich weniger effektiv sind als Verbesserungen im Modal Split zu Gunsten des ÖPNV sowie des (auch elektrifizierten) Radverkehrs.

Zu verkehrlichen Fragestellungen besteht in Dresden eine Vielzahl weiterer Beschlüsse des Stadtrates bzw. der Ausschüsse. Diese sind Grundlage des politischen Handelns und des fachlichen Planens. Der VEP berücksichtigt explizit wichtige Beschlüsse zu verkehrlichen Neu- und Ausbauvorhaben (sogenannte „Sowieso-Maßnahmen“, siehe Kapitel 6.2) aber auch wichtige Beschlüsse zu Verkehrssicherheit, Luftreinhaltung oder Verkehrsmanagement. Ausgewählte Beschlüsse wurden im Teil 4 der Anlage 2 dokumentiert und zeitlich geordnet. Ein inhaltlicher Abgleich aller bestehenden Beschlüsse ist nicht Aufgabe eines VEP. Vielmehr sind die beschlossenen Leitziele als übergeordnetes Planungsziel zu sehen, vor deren Hintergrund Umsetzungen bewertet und Ermessensspielräume auch in bestehenden Beschlüssen ausgeschöpft werden sollen.

## 2.2 Wesentliche Analyseergebnisse

### 2.2.1 Bestand und Entwicklung des Verkehrssystems

Die Stadt Dresden ist gemäß dem Landesentwicklungsplan Sachsen Oberzentrum im Verdichtungsraum Oberes Elbthal. Der Verdichtungsraum Oberes Elbthal beinhaltet den stark verflochtenen Siedlungsbereich von Pirna im Südosten bis Meißen im Nordwesten und verfügt über fast 800.000 Einwohnerinnen und Einwohner. Die Stadt Dresden selbst weist im Jahr 2012 insgesamt 530.722 Einwohnerinnen und Einwohner mit Hauptwohnsitz aus.

# Regionale und überregionale Anbindungen

Dresden verfügt über eine strukturell sehr gute Einbindung in die nationalen bzw. internationalen Verkehrsnetze:

Über die Bundesautobahnen A 4, A 13 und A 17 ist die Stadt direkt mit allen benachbarten Oberzentren und Metropolregionen verbunden. Das sind insbesondere der Großraum Berlin im Norden, der Raum Leipzig/Halle im Nordwesten, Chemnitz und weiterführend die Metropolregion Nürnberg im Südwesten, der Ballungsraum Prag im Süden und Wroclaw (Breslau) im Osten.
Im Schienenfernverkehrsnetz sind die Fernbahnstrecken (Hamburg -) Berlin – Dresden – Prag – Wien, Frankfurt am Main – Leipzig – Dresden und Hannover – Leipzig – Dresden von Bedeutung. Darüber hinaus ist die Strecke nach Breslau zu erwähnen. Gleichzeitig dient das Schienennetz der direkten Anbindung der Oberzentren Görlitz und Bautzen sowie zahlreicher Mittelzentren (z. B. Pirna, Freiberg, Riesa).
Im Schienenregionalverkehrsnetz werden die Grund- und Mittelzentren wie z. B. Radeberg, Königsbrück, Kamenz, Tharandt, Meißen, Hoyerswerda, Glashütte oder Altenberg an das Oberzentrum Dresden als Verknüpfungspunkt zum Fernverkehr angebunden.
Im Fernbusverkehrsnetz bieten verschiedene Verkehrsunternehmen ab Dresden-Hauptbahnhof bzw. Dresden-Neustadt regelmäßige Verbindungen ins In- und Ausland an u. a. nach Berlin, Düsseldorf, Stuttgart, München, Prag und Budapest.
Das Regionalbusverkehrsnetz umfasst den westlichen Teil des Landkreises Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge, Teile der Landkreise Meißen und Bautzen sowie die Landeshauptstadt Dresden. Die Regionalverkehr Dresden GmbH – das größte regionale Busverkehrsunternehmen – betreibt derzeit 76 Linien, von denen 15 Linien in ihrem Routenverlauf das Stadtgebiet Dresdens teilweise im Taktverkehr bedienen. Eine Linie führt von Dresden nach Teplice (Tschechien). Auf zahlreichen Relationen werden täglich nur wenige, nicht vertaktete Fahrten angeboten – teils variieren die Linienwege, teils ist das Linienangebot nur auf Werktage (Mo.-Fr.) beschränkt.
Die Elbe ist eine Bundeswasserstraße 1. Ordnung (Klasse Va) und verbindet Dresden mit den Binnenhäfen Mitteldeutschlands und den deutschen Nordseehäfen.
Über den Verkehrsflughafen Dresden werden ca. 32.700 Flugbewegungen im Jahr mit über 1,89 Mio. Fluggästen (Stand 2012) abgewickelt. Über die Flugverbindungen ist Dresden über Luftdrehkreuze mit Umsteigemöglichkeit in kontinentale und interkontinentale Verbindungen eingebunden.
Mit den Deutschlandrouten D4 (Mittellandroute) und D10 (Elberadweg) ist Dresden im überregionalen Radverkehr gut angebunden. Aus dem SachsenNetz Rad (Radverkehrskonzeption des Freistaats Sachsen 2005) führen zudem u. a. die Sächsische Städteroute sowie die regionalen Radrouten II-15 (Pillnitz – Städteroute) und II-31 (Dresden – Bastei) durch Dres-

den. Mit dem Radverkehrskonzept Innenstadt liegt zudem seit 2007 ein klassifiziertes kommunales Radroutennetz mit Haupt-, Verbindungs- und Erschließungsrouten vor, das in der Innenstadt sukzessive umgesetzt wird.

Im Fußgängerverkehr ist Dresden in überregionale Wanderwege wie den Jakobsweg, aber auch in regionale Routen wie den Sächsischen Weinwanderweg oder den Malerweg eingebunden.

Die benannten Autobahnen und Eisenbahnstrecken sind weitgehend Bestandteil der Transeuropäischen Netze. So verläuft der (multimodale) Korridor III von Dresden nach Breslau und weiter in Richtung Krakau/ Ukraine. In Nord-Süd-Richtung verläuft der Korridor IV (Nord-/ Ostsee – Berlin – Dresden – Prag – Wien – Balkanländer). Seitens des Freistaates Sachsen werden umfangreiche Bemühungen zur Stärkung der Korridore auf sächsischem Gebiet unternommen. Dazu gehört insbesondere der Ausbau der Bahnverbindung von Berlin nach Dresden und die Weiterführung als Neubaustrecke über den Kamm des Erzgebirges in Richtung Prag.

Insbesondere in der Fernverkehrsanbindung durch die Bahn bestehen aber weiterhin deutliche Defizite, deren Beseitigung aber weitgehend außerhalb der direkten Einflussmöglichkeiten der Stadt Dresden liegt. Hier ist nur ein politisch koordiniertes Handeln auf allen Ebenen zielführend, das vehement für die berechtigten Interessen einer zeitgemäßen Erreichbarkeit Dresdens per Bahn als Metropole europäischen Ranges eintritt.

Aufgrund der aktuellen ordnungspolitischen Maßnahmen der Bundesregierung wird die Bedeutung des Fernbusverkehrs kurzfristig deutlich steigen. Eine Ausweitung des innerdeutschen Fahrtenangebots ab Dresden ist deshalb zu erwarten. Dafür besteht derzeit kein Angebot für entsprechend verkehrlich eingebundene und attraktive Abfahrtsstellen. Die Planungen für einen ZOB am Hauptbahnhof wurden bisher nicht umgesetzt.

Durch die Gleiserweiterung auf den Streckenabschnitten Dresden-Neustadt – Pirna sowie die voraussichtlich bis 2016 abgeschlossene Sanierung/ Ausbau des Streckenabschnitts Dresden-Neustadt – Coswig (zeitgleich mit dem Ausbau der Fernbahnstrecke Dresden – Leipzig) werden Fern- und Regionalverkehr (S-Bahn) separiert, somit beide Verkehre weniger beeinträchtigt und letztlich beschleunigt.

Für die regionalen Verknüpfungen bestehen vor allem durch die Autobahnen und die noch im weiteren Ausbau befindliche S-Bahn sowie durch das Regionalbahnsystem hervorragende Voraussetzungen. Das bestehende S-Bahn-Netz kann jedoch in seiner verkehrlichen Wirksamkeit gestärkt werden, indem an bestehenden Strecken die teilweise bereits konkret geplanten neuen Zugangs- und Verknüpfungspunkte entstehen.

# Innerstädtischer Verkehr

Dresden verfügt auch innerstädtisch über ein in seinen Grundzügen leistungsfähiges und auch den zukünftigen Anforderungen weitgehend gerecht werdendes Verkehrssystem insbesondere für ÖPNV und Kfz-Verkehr. Es bestehen allerdings punktuelle Überlastungsbereiche sowohl im Straßen- als auch im ÖPNV-System. Das Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnsystem stößt dort sowohl infrastrukturseitig als auch angebotsseitig durch die Einwohnerentwicklung und durch wachsende Ausbildungs- und Berufsverkehre an Kapazitätsgrenzen.

Die Stadtstruktur mit dem bestehenden Straßennetz ist in **Abbildung 1** dargestellt. Die Stadtstruktur mit dem bestehenden ÖPNV-Netz ist als **Abbildung 2** beigefügt.

Im Straßennetz bestehen punktuell Überlastungen, die durch lokalen Um- oder Ausbau oder intermodale Ansätze aufgelöst werden sollten. Die Reisezeiten im Kfz-Verkehr sind in den letzten Jahren auf einen Wert von über 27 km/h gestiegen, während die der Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn auf einem Wert von unter 20 km/h stagnieren (vgl. Grafik 4). Die Maßnahmen der ÖPNV-Beschleunigung an Knotenpunkten haben u. a. dafür gesorgt, dass neue Anbindungen im Straßennetz zumindest nicht zu einer Verschlechterung der Reisezeiten führen. Deshalb besteht dringender Handlungsbedarf, der sich insbesondere auf Knotenpunkte bezieht, wo dem ÖPNV häufiger und prioritärer bzw. in Abhängigkeit von Fahrplanlage und Umsteigebeziehungen Freigabezeiten eingeräumt werden müssen. Ein fairer Wettbewerb der Verkehrsträger ist anders nicht mehr möglich, da die mittlerweile erforderliche Steigerung der ÖPNV-Kapazitäten in einer wachsenden Großstadt sonst kaum umsetzbar ist.

Hinsichtlich der Netzqualitäten im Rad- und Fußgängerverkehr haben sich in der Vergangenheit durch die Umsetzung von entsprechenden Konzepten sowie umfangreichen Um- und Ausbauten im Straßen- und Wegenetz positive Entwicklungen ergeben, die aber noch hinsichtlich Netzdichte, Durchgängigkeit, Dimensionierung, Konfliktvermeidung und relativer Investitionsvolumina hinter den Netzentwicklungen im Kfz-Verkehr und ÖPNV zurückbleiben.

Die Dresdner Innenstadt innerhalb des 26er Rings ist per ÖPNV aber auch im Kfz-Verkehr sehr gut erreichbar. In das Parkleitsystem der Innenstadt sind ca. 6.800 Stellplätze integriert, wovon im Tagesmittel zwischen 8 und 20 Uhr nur ca. 42 % belegt sind. Im Stadtzentrum am 26er Ring sind selbst in Spitzenzeiten an Samstagen mit 2.300 freien Stellplätzen und einer Auslastung von 66 % noch große Stellplatzreserven in bestehenden Parkierungseinrichtungen vorhanden, die auch bei weiterhin dynamischer Innenstadtentwicklung für zukünftige Anforderungen ausreichen. Die Auslastung der innenstadtnahen Parkgaragen ist dabei nicht gleichmäßig. Trotz Parkleitsystem kommt es an Tagen mit besonders hohem Besucheraufkommen (u. a. ausgewählte Samstage in der Adventszeit) zu ungleichen Verteilungen des Parksuchverkehrs, was die entsprechenden Zufahrtsstraßen teilweise überlastet.

Das Nebennetz mit seinen erschließenden Wohnstraßen und einer hohen Bedeutung für Aufenthalt und Stadtqualität ist in Dresden bereits zu 94 % verkehrsberuhigt. Hinsichtlich einer einheitlichen und möglichst weitgehend selbsterklärenden Straßenraumgestaltung verkehrsberuhigter Bereiche sowie deren Durchlässigkeit für den Fußgänger- und Radverkehr bestehen noch Potenziale. Diese müssen hinsichtlich ihrer Kosteneffektivität einzeln geprüft werden.

Die angestrebte Entkopplung einer positiven Wirtschaftsentwicklung und des Bevölkerungswachstums von der Zunahme des Kfz-Verkehrs wurde in Dresden bereits erreicht. Trotz einer erfolgreichen Stadtentwicklung stagnieren die Verkehrsbelastungen im Straßennetz.

Zusätzliche Verkehrsleistungen werden insbesondere durch die Verkehrsmittel des Umweltverbundes aufgefangen, was einerseits auf die verbesserten Angebote, andererseits auf einen Bewusstseinswandel der Dresdner Bevölkerung in Bezug auf Mobilität, Lebensqualität und Umwelt zurückzuführen ist. Im Jahr 2008 konnte der Umweltverbund einen Anteil von 59 % am gesamten Verkehrsaufkommen erreichen. Davon entfielen auf den Radverkehr 16 %, auf den ÖPNV 21 % und auf die Fußwege 22 % (vgl. Grafik 5). Inwiefern der Trend der Zunahme des Umweltverbundes weiterhin anhält, werden die anstehenden Mobilitätsbefragungen 2013 zeigen.

Die systematischen Verkehrszählungen an den Dauerzählstellen zeigen, dass die Zahl der Kfz auf den Brücken in Dresden derzeit in Summe trotz Eröffnung der Waldschlößchenbrücke 2013 stagniert (vgl. Grafik 6). Gleiches trifft auch auf die Verkehrsmengen an den Ortseingängen zu.

Entgegen diesem Trend entwickeln sich die Zahlen der ÖPNV-Nutzenden auf den Dresdner Elbbrücken. Neben steigenden Fahrgastzahlen im Bahnverkehr über die „2. Marienbrücke“ ist die Zahl der über die Brücken beförderten Fahrgäste des DVB von 2004 bis 2011 um 39 % gestiegen.

# Umwelt und Motorisierung

Im Bereich des Kfz-Verkehrs bestehen durch punktuell hohe Lärmemissionen und kritische Werte der Feinstaub- und Stickoxid-Belastungen (siehe Masterplan Lärmminderung 2009 und Luftreinhalteplan 2011). Konflikte zwischen dem Gesundheitsanspruch der Bevölkerung und den verkehrlichen Nutzungen. Zur Vermeidung einer Umweltzone muss die Stadt Dresden deshalb ihren Luftreinhalteplan umsetzen.

Bestehende innovative Ansätze im Dresdner Verkehrssystem, wie das derzeit mit 20 % pro Jahr dynamisch wachsende Carsharing mit über 200 Fahrzeugen an 92 Stationen, stoßen bereits an Grenzen und müssen mit kommunaler Unterstützung auch in Verbindung mit Mobilitätsmanagement oder Verleihsystemen weiterentwickelt werden. Carsharing-Nutzende haben mit einem Kfz-Anteil am Verkehrsaufkommen von ca. 10 % eine vierfach seltenere Kfz-Nutzung als der Durchschnitt der Bevölkerung (vgl. Grafik 7).

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Grafik 7: Modal Split von Carsharing-Nutzenden im Vergleich zu Gesamtheit der Bevölkerung
Quelle: Befragung der Mobility Center GmbH 2011 sowie SrV 2008

Etwa 70 % der am Carsharing Teilnehmenden leihen sich ein Carsharing-Auto lediglich einmal im Monat (oder seltener), und zwar ganz überwiegend zum Einkaufen oder zum Transport von Gegenständen. Ihr bevorzugtes Verkehrsmittel ist mit ca. 44 % das Fahrrad. Vorteile des Carsharrings liegen zudem in der angebotenen modernen Fahrzeugflotte mit kleinen, effizienten Motoren, was im Vergleich zum Gesamtbestand an Kfz zu deutlich geringeren mittleren Emissionen führt sowie bei einem geringeren Bedarf an Stellplatzfläche im Straßenraum.

Dieser Trend spiegelt sich zu Teilen auch in der Entwicklung der privaten Motorisierung der Dresdner Bevölkerung wider, deren Werte etwa seit dem Jahr 1995 stagnieren und derzeit bei unter 400 Kfz/ 1000 Einwohnerinnen und Einwohner liegen (vgl. Grafik 8). Dabei sind Unterschiede zwischen zentralen städtischen Lagen mit sehr niedrigen Werten und dezentralen Lagen (z. B. Schönfelder Hochland) zu verzeichnen.

Grafik 8: Entwicklung der Pkw-Motorisierung in Dresden

Elektromobilität spielt in Dresden derzeit vor allem in Form der Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn und der S-Bahn eine wichtige Rolle. Damit sind bereits heute ca. 18 % aller Fahrten der Dresdner Bevölkerung der Elektromobilität zuzuordnen. Das aktuelle Ziel der Bundesregierung, bis 2020/ 2025 ca. 1 Mio. Elektro-Kfz auf Deutschlands Straßen zu bringen, hieß, dass damit ca. 5 % aller Kfz in Deutschland elektrisch angetrieben wurden. Bei einer gleichverteilten Flottendurchmischung und einem Anteil des Kfz-Verkehrs am städtischen Verkehrsmarkt in Höhe von 40 % entspräche das einem um lediglich 2 % gestiegenen Elektro-Anteil am Dresdner Modal Split. Bis 2025, dem zeitlichen Horizont des VEP, wird deshalb Elektro-Mobilität nicht in Form von Kfz-Mobilität sondern insbesondere in Form des ÖPNV sowie ergänzend auch von „elektrifizierten“ Fahrrädern an Bedeutung gewinnen. Die Zahl von Fahrrädern mit Elektrounterstützung wird bereits im Jahr 2013 die 1-Mio-Marke in Deutschland durchbrechen. Hinsichtlich von positiven Klimaeffekten und Energiebilanzen stellt sich aber auch die Frage, wie Elektromobilität für verkehrliche Nutzungen aus regenerativen Energien gespeist werden kann.

Bezüglich der verkehrlichen und umweltseitigen Datengrundlagen, die hier nur zusammenfassend und auszugsweise gezeigt werden können, ist Dresden beispielgebend für andere Städte. Diese Spitzenposition sollte mit Unterstützung der Wissenschaft weiter ausgebaut werden.

## 2.2.2 Ausgewählte Defizite im Verkehrssystem der Stadt Dresden

Ein separater Analysebericht („Synoptische Verkehrsanalyse“, Juli 2011) greift alle diesbezüglich bereits vorliegenden Daten und Erkenntnisse auf und fasst diese in systematischer und synoptischer Form zusammen. Einzelheiten über Zustände und Mängel sowie deren Wechselwirkungen können dem Analysebericht entnommen werden. Grundlage dieses Berichts sind Zuarbeiten Dritter, namentlich des Runden Tisches, der städtischen Fachämter sowie der betroffenen Verkehrsunternehmen, Verbände und Interessengruppen. Eine noch differenziertere Analyse ist im Rahmen der Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung nicht erforderlich.

Ausgewählte Defizitbereiche des ÖPNV und MIV sind in **Abbildung 3** dargestellt. Auf Fragen stadträumlicher Qualität und der daraus entstehenden Konflikte wird in den Kapiteln 2.2.4 und 2.3 eingegangen. Die wichtigsten Defizite im Dresdner Verkehrssystem sind:

### Kfz-Verkehr und Straßennetz

Wichtige Bereiche mit dringend erforderlichen Sanierungen im Hauptstraßennetz sind u. a.:
Königsbrücker Straße, Bautzner Straße/ Bautzner Landstraße (teilweise in Umsetzung), westliche Stauffenbergallee, Schandauer Straße/ Borsbergstraße (teilweise in Umsetzung), Blasewitzer Straße, Fetscherplatz und westliche Hamburger Straße.

Netzabschnitte, die als Staustrecken bzw. als überlastete Strecken angesehen werden können sind u. a.
An der Christuskirche (Verbindung Winterbergstraße - Wasaplatz), Rayskistraße (Bahnbrücke Richtung Reicker Straße), Bautzner Straße zwischen Albertplatz und Pulsnitzer Straße, Carolabrücke Richtung Neustädter Markt, Hansastraße ab Lößnitzstraße Richtung Großer Meißner Straße, Grundstraße/ Loschwitzer Brücke mit Körnerplatz und Schillerplatz, Käthe-Kollwitz-Ufer Richtung Albertbrücke, Leipziger Straße i. H. Dreyßigplatz (Mickten), Lennéstraße, Naumannstraße Richtung Blaues Wunder und Schäferstraße westlich der Weißeritzstraße.

Kritisch ist die Verknüpfung zwischen Magdeburger Straße, Weißeritzstraße und Kösneritzstraße zu bewerten, da hier kurze Knotenpunktabstände mit komplexen Lichtsignalschaltungen, hohem Verkehrsaufkommen (auch im ÖPNV) sowie verschiedenen Bahnquerungen korrespondieren. Problematische Verkehrszustände treten zudem im Bereich Bahnhof Dresden-Neustadt (Hansastraße – Antonstraße – Hainstraße – Robert-Blum-Straße – Leipziger Straße sowie mangelnde Erreichbarkeit aus Richtung Marienbrücke) sowie am Fetscherplatz und den zuführenden Straßen auf, die sich nach Eröffnung der Waldschlößchenbrücke weiter verstärken werden.

Im Dresdner Netz kommt es durch Schleichverkehre, fehlende Netzelemente oder bestimmte Zwangspunkte zu unverträglichen verkehrlichen Überformungen durch Kfz-Verkehr in verschiedenen Hauptrelationen. Diese sind u. a.:

Seite 26
Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus
Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil A: Grundlagen und Bestandsanalyse
LVD
WBS

An der Christuskirche/ Altstrehlen, Marienallee bis Bischofsweg, Aachener Straße, Altcotta, Meißner Landstraße/ Dresdner Straße in Cossebaude (B6), Fetscherplatz, Sophienstraße, Augustusbrücke und Neustädter Markt, Leipziger Straße/ Dreyßigplatz, Terrassenufer, Dr.-Külz-Ring/ Prager Straße

Als besonders problematisch stellen sich die Konflikte zwischen den hohen Kfz-Verkehrsmengen (und Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnfrequenzen) auf dem Dr.-Külz-Ring und den querenden Fußgängerverkehr im Zuge der Prager Straße dar. Hier sind Freigabezeiten ausgereizt. Ähnliche Barrierewirkungen entfaltet auch die St.-Petersburger-Straße zwischen der Innenstadt und dem Robotron-Areal bzw. dem Großen Garten. Weitere Bereiche in der zentralen Innenstadt mit Konflikten zwischen Kfz-Verkehr, Fußgänger- und Radverkehr sind Postplatz, Sophienstraße, Augustusbrücke, Terrassenufer.
Konzepte für die Wegweisung bei Großveranstaltungen fehlen im Bereich Elbe/ Friedrichstädter Flutrinne.

## Ruhender Kfz-Verkehr

Im ruhenden Kfz-Verkehr sind insgesamt relativ wenige Defizite festzustellen, u. a. weil in Wohnquartieren mit vergleichsweise hohem Parkdruck bereits Bewohnerparkbereiche eingerichtet wurden. In weiteren Bereichen soll Bewohnerparken geprüft bzw. eingeführt werden, z. B. in

Striesen West, Johannstadt Nord, Uniklinikum/ MPI, Zwinglistraße, Schillerplatz, Weißer Hirsch West, Radeberger Vorstadt/ Waldschlößchen, Innere Neustadt Ost, Innere Neustadt West, Äußere Neustadt West, Hechtviertel/ Leipziger Vorstadt, Altmickten, Trachenberge/ Pieschen, Trachau/ Klinikum Neustadt, Friedrichstadt, Kesselsdorfer Straße, Südvorstadt, Südvorstadt Ost, Strehlen, Flughafen/ Klotzsche, Pillnitz, Zschachwitz Fähre.

Weiterer Verbesserungsbedarf für den ruhenden Verkehr besteht in folgenden thematischen Bereichen:

Steuerung des Parkraumangebotes räumlich und monetär (im Sinne der jeweils planerisch gewünschten Nutzung durch Anwohnerinnen und Anwohnern, Besucherinnen und Besucher oder Pendlerinnen und Pendler),
Parksituation im Veranstaltungsverkehr Flutrinne Ostragehege (wenig P+R-Angebote, Überlagerungen Parkflächen/ Veranstaltungen, Blockade von Rettungswegen durch Falschparkende, gleichzeitige Sperrung Elberad- und -wanderweg),
Parksituation im Veranstaltungsverkehr am Stadion in der Lennéstraße,
Parksituation im Umfeld von zentralen Einrichtungen mit hohem Pendler- und Besucheraufkommen (z. B. auch TU Dresden mit Erweiterungsgebieten an der Nöthnitzer Straße)
Park and Ride in Dresden West/ Autobahnabfahrt Dresden-Altstadt im Bereich der Hamburger Straße (Linie 1) für Veranstaltungs- und Besucherverkehr und

LUV
VAS

Park and Ride für Berufspendler, besonders aus Richtung Süden (Bannewitz/ Dippoldiswalde).

Im Reisebusverkehr bestehen zudem Probleme durch Falschparkende und Belegungen durch Veranstaltungen im Bereich des zentralen Busparkplatzes Pieschener Allee.

# Verkehrssicherheit

Die Mängelanalyse des Verkehrssicherheitskonzeptes 2010 (vom Stadtrat als V1041/11 im Jahr 2011 mit konkreter Umsetzungsforderung beschlossen) benennt 341 Unfallhäufigungsstellen (Stand 2004, aktueller Stand liegt noch nicht vor). Dabei gefährden aus planerischer bzw. anlagenseitiger Sicht u. a. partiell fehlende Fußwege, hohe Geschwindigkeiten, mangelnde Querungshilfen und fehlende Sichtbeziehungen die Verkehrssicherheit. Das Verkehrssicherheitskonzept wurde in den letzten Jahren in wichtigen Teilen wie beschlossen umgesetzt.

Stellen mit erhöhtem Unfallgeschehen unter Beteiligung verschiedener Verkehrsteilnehmergruppen (Fußverkehr, Radverkehr und Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn) sind laut Verkehrssicherheitskonzept:

Pirnaischer Platz, Dr.-Külz-Ring/ St.-Petersburger-Straße (Georgplatz), Grunaer Straße/ Blüherstraße, Straßburger Platz und Albertplatz Nord.

Von der DVB AG werden zusätzlich folgende Unfallschwerpunkte mit Beteiligung des ÖPNV benannt:

Königsbrücker Straße zwischen Louisenstraße und Albertplatz, Fritz-Reuter-Straße/ Hansastraße, Hoyerswerdaer-/ Melanchton-/ Tieckstraße, Kesselsdorfer Straße zwischen Rudolph-Renner- und Reisewitzer Straße, Rothenburger Straße, Tolkewitzer Straße/ Spohrstraße und H.-Schütz-Straße, Prager Straße (Fußgängerunfälle), Postplatz (Fußgängerunfälle), Sachsenallee Außenring und Nossener Brücke (Unfälle Kfz/ Bus).

Zur Verbesserung der Verkehrssicherheit und der Konfliktvermeidung besteht zusätzlich Handlungsbedarf am Postplatz (Verbesserung der Verkehrsführung, insbesondere für den Fußgänger- und Radverkehr, aber auch für den Kfz-Verkehr) sowie allgemein im Umfeld von Schulen und Kindertagesstätten (Konflikte zwischen Holen/ Bringen und Radverkehr/ Parken).

# ÖPNV

Wesentliche Erschließungsdefizite im ÖPNV bestehen unter Berücksichtigung der Kriterien und Aussagen des Nahverkehrsplanes in folgenden Bereichen:

Jägerpark, Tittmannstraße/ Augsburger Straße, Jägerstraße/ Prießnitzstraße (Äußere Neustadt), in der Albertstadt West (Arbeitsplatzschwerpunkt), in Trachenberge, im Bereich Goetheallee und teilweise in Stadtgebieten mit dezentralen Lagen.

Zudem könnte der bestehende ÖPNV durch neue S-Bahn-Haltepunkte im Bereich Bischofsplatz, Albertstadt, Nossener Brücke, Königsbrücker Straße und Richard-Strauss-Platz stärker genutzt werden.

Aktuell ist die Verkehrsqualität für den ÖPNV an 26 Knotenpunkten mit Lichtsignalanlagen mangelhaft. Handlungsbedarf im Sinne einer besseren Abwicklung des ÖPNV besteht insbesondere an folgenden Knotenpunkten:

Albertplatz, Ammon-/Freiberger Straße, Bautzner-/ Rothenburger Straße, Dohnaer-/ Erich-Kästner-Straße, Ebertplatz, Fritz-Foerster-Platz, Georgplatz, Könneritzstraße/ Jahnstraße, Könneritzstraße/ Ostra-Allee, Könneritzstraße/ Schweriner Straße, Körnerplatz, Lennéplatz, Nürnberger-/Budapester Straße, Nürnberger Platz, Pillnitzer Straße/ Steinstraße, Pirnaischer Platz, Rathenauplatz, Schillerplatz, Schlesischer Platz, Schweriner-/Löbtauer Straße, Straßburger Platz, Tharandter-/ Kesselsdorfer Straße, Tolkewitzer-/ Kretschmerstraße, Wasaplatz, Weißeritzstraße/ Friedrichstraße und Weißeritzstraße/ Jahnstraße

Konfliktbereiche mit Behinderungen zwischen Kfz-Verkehr und ÖPNV sind u. a. südliche Löbtauer Straße, Königsbrücker Straße südlich Louisenstraße, Bautzner Straße zwischen Weintraubenstraße und Radeberger Straße, Marienbrücke in Richtung Könneritzstraße, Tolkewitzer Straße, Schäferstraße und Fritz-Reuter-Straße,

Knotenpunkte mit Rückstauerscheinungen im Kfz-Verkehr, die zu Behinderungen im ÖPNV führen sind u. a.: Albertplatz, Anton-/ Leipziger Straße, Dreyßigplatz, Fetscherplatz, Körnerplatz, Marienbrücke/ Magdeburger Straße, Schillerplatz und Wasaplatz.

Die Nutzbarkeit des Öffentlichen Personennahverkehrs ist für alle Menschen zu gewährleisten. Die Forderung nach einer barrierefreien Gestaltung ergibt sich aus der UN-Behindertenrechtskonvention und der im Januar 2013 geänderten Fassung des PBefG, wonach bis 2022 die vollständige Barrierefreiheit verpflichtend umzusetzen ist. Entsprechend sind Haltestellen und Fahrzeuge auszubilden, wobei derzeit in Dresden nur 45 % aller Haltestellen barrierefrei ausgebaut sind. Defizite in der Barrierefreiheit bestehen insbesondere an folgenden stark genutzten Haltestellen:

Altenberger Straße (Umbau geplant), Augsburger Straße (Uniklinikum), Bautzner-/ Rothenburger Straße (im Umbau), Bergmannstraße (im Bau), Bühlau Ullersdorfer Platz, Bünaustraße, Bischofsweg, Liststraße, Ludwig-Hartmann-Straße, Nürnberger Platz, Stauffenbergallee, Tharandter Straße, Wasaplatz u. a.

# Radverkehr

Vor allem bei folgenden Straßen und Plätzen ist die Situation für Radfahrerinnen und Radfahrer unbefriedigend:

Könneritzstraße (in Abschnitten nur Radverkehrsfreigabe des Gehwegs bei baulich stark beschränkten Fahrbahnen), Antonstraße (zwischen Albertplatz und Bahnhof Neustadt gemeinsame Nutzung des von Fußgängerverkehr stark frequentierten Gehweges), Bodenbacher Straße (abschnittsweise keine Radverkehrsanlagen), Albertbrücke (Radverkehrsanlage in Planung), Alaunstraße/Bautzner Straße (teilweise in Umsetzung), Augustusbrücke/Köpckestraße, Bischofsweg, Elberad- und -wanderweg im Bereich Terrassenufer, Emerich-Ambros-Ufer, Flügelweg, Kesselsdorfer Straße, Königsbrücker Straße, Leipziger Straße, Magdeburger/Bremer Straße, Nürnberger Straße, Postplatz, Pennricher Straße, Rudolf-Renner-Straße, Sachsenallee/Sachsenplatz, Schäferstraße, Schandauer Straße (teilweise in Umsetzung), Schlesischer Platz, Sophienstraße, Strehlener Straße, Teplitzer Straße, Wiener Straße Richtung Hbf und Zellescher Weg.

Weiterhin ist die Erreichbarkeit des Hauptbahnhofs mit dem Fahrrad auf legalem Wege nur eingeschränkt möglich. Defizite am Elberad- und -wanderweg bestehen zwischen Loschwitz und Pillnitz sowie im Bereich Niederwartha (Abschnitt in Planung). Die Verbindungsstraße „Am Walde“ (von Radebeul nach Dresden) ist weder mit Geh- noch mit Radwegen ausgestattet.

Problematisch ist auch der Umgang mit dem Radverkehr bei regelmäßigen oder baustellenbedingten Sperrungen von Streckenabschnitten. Auffälligstes Beispiel ist der Elberad- und -wanderweg, für den weder für den Hochwasserfall noch für Veranstaltungen (Filmnächte Königsufer, Konzerte in der Flutrinne im Ostragehege) die Möglichkeit einer sicheren und attraktiven Umleitung besteht. Hier fehlen Angebote im Zuge der Großen Meißner Straße/Carolaplatz/Wigardstraße bzw. an der Magdeburger Straße/Bremer Straße/Hamburger Straße.

Handlungsbedarf besteht weiterhin im Bereich B+R. Vor allem am Hauptbahnhof sowie am Neustädter Bahnhof fehlen weitere Abstellmöglichkeiten für Fahrräder, die nach Möglichkeit überdacht und in der Nähe der Eingänge angeordnet werden sollten. Auch an Straßenbahn/Stadtbahn- oder Bushaltestellen fehlen meistens geeignete Radabstellanlagen. Bislang besaßen jedoch Verknüpfungspunkte mit dem SPNV (Verknüpfungen mit Verkehrsmitteln besonders hoher Reichweite) Priorität.

Nicht in jedem Fall werden planerische Lösungen entwickelt werden können, die alle Defizite zufriedenstellend beseitigen. In diesen Fällen ist eine besonders sorgfältige Abwägung erforderlich.

# Fußgängerverkehr

Kritische Abschnitte auf der besonders wichtigen und stark frequentierten Fußgängerachse Hauptbahnhof – Albertplatz sind insbesondere die Augustusbrücke (hohes Fußgängeraufkommen und Konkurrenz zu illegal den Gehweg befahrenden Radverkehr) sowie die Querungen Sophienstraße/ Schlossplatz.
Punktuell sind Bereiche, in denen erhebliche Fußgängerströme auf querende Kfz oder den ÖPNV treffen, kritisch. Hervorzuheben ist hier beispielhaft:
die Querung des Dr.-Külz-Rings (jeweils zwei Richtungsfahrbahnen und die mittig dazwischen liegende ÖPNV-Trasse sind zu queren),
die Querungen der Wilsdruffer Straße (separate ÖPNV-Trasse),
die Große Meißner Straße/ Köpckestraße (Fußgängertunnel mit erheblichen Steigungen und Mitnutzung durch den Radverkehr, umwegige Querungen mit langen Zugangswegen),
die Albertstraße/ der Albertplatz (umwegige Querungen mit langen Zugangswegen) sowie
die St.-Petersburger Straße durch querschnittsbedingte starke Trennwirkungen.
Für mobilitätseingeschränkte Personen stellen die ausgedehnten Pflasterbereiche der Innenstadt (u. a. Postplatz, Altmarkt, Neumarkt, Schlossplatz, Theaterplatz) Hindernisse dar.

# Verkehr und Umwelt

Aus der Lärmminderungsplanung sind die lautesten Straßen Dresdens bekannt, die eine hohe Lärmbetroffenheit (Betroffenen-Index BI &gt; 4,0, Quelle: Lärmkartierung des Umweltamtes Dresden) aufweisen. Die Ursachen liegen dabei in hoher Verkehrsbelastung sowie teilweise in der Oberflächenbeschaffenheit. Unter Berücksichtigung der bereits zahlreich erfolgten Sanierungen (u. a. durch das Konjunkturpaket II der Bundesregierung) sind dies u. a. noch folgende Straßenabschnitte:

Albertstraße von Metzer Straße bis Albertplatz, Bautzener Straße von Albertplatz bis Prießnitzstraße (teilweise Pflasterbelag, teilweise derzeit in Sanierung), Borsbergstraße von Krenkelstraße bis Müller-Berset-Straße (Pflasterbelag, derzeit in Sanierung), Buchenstraße von Hechtstraße bis Rudolf-Leonhardt-Straße, Budapester Straße von Glauchauer Straße bis Schweizer Straße, Bürgerstraße von Gehestraße bis Torgauer Straße, F.-C.-Weiskopf-Platz von Altplauen bis Chemnitzer Straße, Freiberger Straße von Oederaner Straße bis Ebertplatz, Großenhainer Straße von Hansastraße bis Trachenberger Platz, Hansastraße von Großenhainer Straße bis Conradstraße, Hoyerswerdaer Straße von Bautzener Straße bis Tieckstraße, Käthe-Kollwitz-Ufer westlich Thomas-Müntzer-Platz, Kesselsdorfer Straße von Gröbelstraße bis Koblenzer Straße, Königsbrücker Straße von Albertplatz bis Stauffenbergallee (Pflasterbelag), Leipziger Straße von Erfurter Straße bis Peschelstraße, Lockwitzer Straße östlich Wasaplatz, Lommatzscher Straße von Leipziger Straße bis Wächterstraße, Nürnberger Straße von Nürnberger Ei bis Budapester Straße, Österreicher Straße von Salzburger

Straße bis Leubener Straße, Riegelplatz, Rothenburger Straße von Bautzener Straße bis Böhmische Straße, Rudolf-Renner-Straße von Kesselsdorfer Straße bis Pennricher Straße (Pflasterbelag, Sanierung in Planung), Schäferstraße von Walterstraße bis Löbtauer Straße, Schandauer Straße westlich Bergmannstraße (derzeit in Sanierung), Schillerplatz und Teplitzer Straße von C.-D.-Friedrich-Straße bis Gostritzer Straße.

Eine Überschreitung der Stickoxidbelastung NO₂ im Prognosenullfall 2015 nach Luftreinhalteplan 2011 (Plan 21a) tritt an folgenden Straßen im Bereich bewohnter Gebiete auf:

Albertplatz, Bautzner Straße/ Martin-Luther-Straße, Bautzner Straße/ Weintraubenstraße, Buchenstraße, F.-C.-Weißkopf-Platz, Hamburger Straße/ Bremer Straße, Hansastraße/ Lößnitzstraße, Königsbrücker Straße nördlich Stauffenbergallee, Körnerplatz, Leipziger Straße/ Konkordienstraße, Moritzburger Weg/ Brücke über A 4, Riegelplatz, Schäferstraße/ Weißeritzstraße und Schillerplatz.

Eine Überschreitung der Partikelemissionen PM₁₀ im Prognosenullfall 2015 nach Luftreinhalteplan 2011 (Plan 21b) tritt an folgenden Straßen im Bereich bewohnter Gebiete auf:

Albertplatz, Albertstraße, Altcotta, Bautzner Straße/ Martin-Luther-Straße, Bautzner Straße/ Weintraubenstraße, Bergstraße nördlich Nöthnitzer Straße, Buchenstraße, Georgplatz, Große Meißner Straße im Bereich Blockhaus, Kesselsdorfer Straße i.

Carsharing als Mobilitätsangebot für zweckgebundene Pkw-Nutzer wächst in Dresden derzeit mit 20 % pro Jahr dynamisch. Das vorhandene Angebot an Stellplätzen auf privaten Flächen stößt damit an seine Grenzen. Öffentlicher Straßenraum darf noch nicht für entsprechend gekennzeichnete Carsharing-Stellplätze genutzt werden. Das Potenzial des Carsharings wird damit hinsichtlich Energie- und Raumeffizienz noch nicht ausreichend genutzt.

## 2.2.3 Schwerpunkte der Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung

Die integrierte Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung in Dresden soll auf Basis der Analysen positive Trends in Bezug auf die beschlossenen Zielsetzungen aufgreifen und im Sinne einer weiteren erfolgreichen Stadtentwicklung fortführen. Für die Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung werden daraus folgende Schwerpunktaufgaben für den Abbau von Defiziten und die Optimierung im Bestand abgeleitet:

Verknüpfung der Dresdner Stadtentwicklung mit verkehrlichen Kriterien wie guter Erreichbarkeit durch alle Verkehrsträger, stadt- und umweltverträglicher Mobilität und der vorwiegenden Nutzung bestehender Infrastrukturen,
Berücksichtigung von Teilhabe, weitgehend stabilen Mobilitätskosten, Barrierefreiheit und Geschlechtergerechtigkeit in allen Bereichen der Verkehrsentwicklung insbesondere durch die Sicherung kurzer Wege und der Erhöhung von Chancen für Nahmobilität,
Verknüpfung städtebaulicher und verkehrlicher Ansätze zur Entlastung und verbesserten Erschließung der Innenstadt bei gleichzeitiger deutlicher Aufwertung des öffentlichen Raumes gemäß den Zielstellungen des Leitbildes Innenstadt und des Straßenbaumkonzepts,
Fokussierung der städtebaulichen und planerischen Aktivitäten auf Handlungsschwerpunkte an großstädtischen Magistralen sowie in zentralen Stadtbereichen mit starker Funktionsmischung und hohem Verkehrsaufkommen (z. B. Körnerplatz/ Schillerplatz/ „Blaues Wunder“),
Förderung der lokalen Wirtschaft, u. a. durch weitere Optimierung des Wirtschaftsverkehrs im Innenbereich
Verbesserte Nutzung von Brachflächen in zentralen Bereichen mit sehr guter Erreichbarkeit, hoher ÖPNV-Gunst und kurzen Wegen (z. B. Bahnhof Mitte/ Weißeritzstraße) sowie entlang angebauter Hauptverkehrsstraßen durch spezifische, innovative Konzepte, die ein attraktives Wohnen und Arbeiten trotz verkehrlicher Belastungen ermöglichen,
Steigerung der Leistungsfähigkeit und Attraktivität des ÖPNV mit S-Bahn und Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn als maßgeblichem Beitrag zur Erreichung der Umweltziele und Gewinnung von Fahrgästen von anderen Verkehrsmitteln durch Verbesserung der Reisegeschwindigkeiten der Stadtbahn auf 21 km/h gemäß aktuellem Nahverkehrsplan 2011 und Verdichtung des Fahrtenangebots entsprechend der Nachfrage,
Konsolidierung des Straßennetzes mit Beseitigung lokaler Problemstellen und punktueller Erreichbarkeitsdefizite auch durch den Bau neuer Netzelemente,
Umfassende Förderung des nicht-motorisierten Verkehrs (Fuß- und Radverkehr) entsprechend seiner stark zunehmenden Bedeutung für die nahräumliche Erschließung und die gesamtstädtische Mobilität (hier insbesondere verstärkt Radverkehr - Anlagen, Abstellen, Sicherheit, E-Bikes/ Pedelecs, etc.),

Seite 33

LVM VERITAS

Konsequente Nutzung der Möglichkeiten des Verkehrssystem- und Mobilitätsmanagements sowie sonstiger innovativer Ansätze für mehr Effizienz im Stadtverkehr,
Verbesserung der Verkehrssicherheit, besonders für den nicht-motorisierten Verkehr, da Dresden auch im Vergleich mit anderen Großstädten in Deutschland eine besonders hohe Zahl an Unfällen mit Personen- und Sachschäden aufweist¹,
Maximale Nutzung der Potenziale einer energieeffizienten und emissionsarmen Stadtmobilität, die von modernen, innovativen Verkehrs- und Mobilitätsformen ausgehen (z. B. Elektromobilität, Public Bikes, Carsharing, Multimodale Informationsvernetzung, City-Logistik u. a.),
Einbeziehen ergänzender Aspekte in die Kosten-Nutzen-Bewertung kommunaler verkehrlicher Maßnahmen und Investitionen, insbesondere minimale Folgekosten, Energieeffizienz und Emissionsbegrenzung,
Sicherung wichtiger Infrastrukturoptionen über den Betrachtungszeitraum 2025 hinaus (insbesondere potenzielle Brückenstandorte, Stadtbahntrassen und Straßen- und Wegeverbindungen) in Bezug auf die absehbaren städtebaulichen Entwicklungen,
Weiterführung der Diskussionskultur im VEP-Prozess mit dem Ziel, Verständnis und Unterstützung für die zu beschließenden Konzepte und Maßnahmen zu gewinnen.

## 2.2.4 Fragen von Stadtentwicklung und Verkehr

### Stadtqualität

Die moderne Stadt ist ein dynamisches Netzwerk von Menschen, Transportmitteln, baulicher Substanz und Verkehrsinfrastruktur. Mobilität ist dabei nicht das Ziel an sich, sondern ein Mittel, das die Interaktion der Menschen ermöglicht (siehe auch die Leitziele in Anlage 1).

Allein mit dem Ausbau eines einzigen Verkehrsträgers kann den Ansprüchen nach gerechter Mobilität nicht Rechnung getragen werden. Echte nachhaltige Mobilität erfordert ein zusammenhängendes System, in dem sich die verschiedenen Verkehrsmittel ergänzen – zu Fuß gehen, mit dem Fahrrad fahren, mit dem Kfz fahren und dem ÖPNV nutzen.

Die Attraktivität der Stadt Dresden entsteht jedoch nicht primär aus einem attraktiven Verkehrssystem. Das Verkehrssystem muss vielmehr die bestehenden naturräumlichen, städtebaulichen, wirtschaftlichen, sozialen und bildungsbezogenen Potenziale Dresdens fördern. Das kommunale Entwicklungsziel, besonders die Innenstadt zu stärken, impliziert jedoch wachsende Quell- und Zielverkehre. Diese werden noch nicht in dem Maß stadtverträglich abgewickelt, wie es die Entwicklungsziele unterstellen.

IVAS

Die oft geforderte hohe Erreichbarkeit auch mit Kfz führt zwangsläufig zu Konflikten mit den Stadtentwicklungszielen (z. B. Grünachsen etablieren, Wohnfunktionen stärken, Barrieren überwinden). Dies zeigt sich z. B. an der Wilsdruffer Straße, wo durch den Neubau einer sehr großen Anzahl von Tiefgaragenstellplätzen das mögliche Entlastungspotenzial nicht voll genutzt wird. Durch die Vielzahl von Stellplätzen in zentralen Lagen wird zudem umweltverträgliche Mobilität im Zentrum nicht in dem Umfang gefördert, wie sie in den Stadtentwicklungskonzepten als „verkehrsvermeidend“ beschrieben wird. Hohe Kfz-Verkehrsmengen in zentralen Bereichen senken vielmehr die Wohnattraktivität und konterkarieren damit das Ziel, die Innenstadt auch außerhalb von Tourismus und Einkauf zu beleben.

Die folgende Grafik 9 zeigt die im Planungsleitbild gewünschten Entwicklungen auf. Barrieren bilden hier z. B. der 26er Ring an der Könneritzstraße/ Weißeritzstraße aber auch die St.-Petersburger-Straße.

Die Verknüpfung der Grünbereiche „Großer Garten“ mit dem Promenadenring und des „Ostrageheges“ mit der Innenstadt bleiben eine besondere Herausforderung, deren hohe Bedeutung im Leitbild Innenstadt festgeschrieben ist und so in die verkehrlichen Planungen integriert werden soll.

# Baukultur und Verkehr

Nachhaltige Mobilität kann nur gelingen, wenn Stadtplanung und Verkehrsplanung aufeinander abgestimmt werden. Das Thema Baukultur einzig an dem einen oder anderen gelungenen Verkehrsbauwerk oder an hochwertigen Materialien festzumachen, genügt der notwendigen Komplexität der Herangehensweise und der Planung für öffentliche Räume mit Qualität für alle jedoch nicht.

Mit dem Thema „Baukultur Verkehr“ verbindet sich darum der Appell an ein ganzheitliches Mobilitätsverständnis, ausgehend von der Normensetzung, der Planung, dem Straßenbau, der Optimierung des Transports von Gütern und Personen, dem Bau von Trassen des ÖPNV, Regional- und Fernverkehrs, über die vorbereitende, begleitende und vermittelnde Kommunikation bis hin zum Management des dynamischen Systems. Dazu müssen die Verkehrsnetze multifunktional gedacht werden, nicht mehr sektoral oder segmentiert.

Die erstarkende öffentliche Diskussion über Lebensqualität im Rahmen des Städterankings lässt erkennen, dass eine gute Qualität des öffentlichen Raums ein wichtiger Trumpf für die Attraktivität einer Stadt ist, sowohl aus Sicht der Bewohner als auch der Gäste. Bewusst gestaltete, gepflegte öffentliche Räume sind ein Teil der urbanen Kultur und nicht nur reine Funktionsträger.

Ziel muss die Optimierung des Ganzen und nicht die Maximierung der Einzelbedürfnisse sein. Im Rahmen der Fachplanungen sollen sich Funktionalität, Ästhetik und Aufenthaltsqualität zu einem ganzheitlichen Stadtraum verbinden. Eines der Mittel hierfür, welches bereits in Anwendung ist, stellt das Dresdner Gestaltungshandbuch (siehe Anlage 2) dar, mit dem sich drei strategische Ziele verbinden:

Kenntlichmachung der stadträumlichen Logik und Orientierung,
Stärkung der Stadtidentität mit einer für Dresden typischen Gestaltungssprache,
Schaffung von Zonen für unterschiedliche Aufenthaltsweisen.

Das Gestaltungshandbuch gibt nicht vor, wo und in welcher Reihenfolge geplant und gebaut wird. Im Ergebnis sollen vielmehr Zug um Zug Straßen als Teil des städtischen Lebensraumes zu Stadträumen gestaltet werden. Sie sollen nicht nur dem Kfz-Verkehr vorbehalten sein, sondern Menschen mit unterschiedlichsten Verkehrsmitteln – auch Fußgängerinnen und Fußgängern – oder Menschen, die einfach nur verweilen möchten.

# Einwohnerentwicklung

Dresden als dynamisch wachsende Stadt muss sich insbesondere auf die Innenentwicklung konzentrieren. Bei Verdichtung entlang bestehender Achsen des ÖPNV sowie in Bereichen mit guter

WBS

Nahmobilität führt Einwohnerwachstum nicht zwangsläufig zu mehr Kfz-Mobilität. Vielmehr werden Wege verstärkt zu Fuß, per Fahrrad oder mit dem ÖPNV zurückgelegt. Mit einer solchen Strategie ist auch langfristig die Entkopplung von Stadtentwicklung (auch im wirtschaftlichen Sinne) und Kfz-Verkehr möglich.

Unterstützt wird dieser Prozess durch die Urbanisierungstrends und die Zuwanderung auch aus dem Umland. Da sich die Einwohnerzahl des Umlands insgesamt durch demografische Prozesse und Wanderungsbewegungen bis auf wenige stabile Gemeinden in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft zu Dresden weiter verringert, verringern sich auch lang laufende Pendlerverkehre nach Dresden, die zu großen Teilen per Kfz abgewickelt werden und aus vielerlei Gründen nicht mit einem sehr hohen Anteil auf ÖPNV verlagerbar sind. Auch der Radverkehr spielt bei regionalen Pendlerströmen nur eine relativ geringe Rolle.

## Verkehrlich integrierte Lagen

An verkehrlich sehr gut erreichbaren Standorten mit hoher ÖPNV-Gunst (vor allem im Einzugsbereich der S-Bahn) sind derzeit noch Brachen vorhanden oder die bestehende Bausubstanz ist in einem schlechten Zustand. Insbesondere vor dem Hintergrund des erklärten Ziels, weiterhin kurze Wege zu stärken und bestehende Infrastrukturen im Straßennetz und im ÖPNV effektiver zu nutzen, müssen entsprechend des Verdichtungsziels der Stadtentwicklung für solche Standorte verstärkt angepasste Nutzungskonzepte entwickelt und umgesetzt werden.

Diese Konzepte müssten die Herausforderung meistern, die Vorteile dieser Lagen (sehr gute Erreichbarkeit auch ohne Kfz durch hohe ÖPNV-Gunst, optimale Versorgungsstrukturen, vielfältige kulturelle Angebote) durch innovative bauliche Lösungen zu nutzen und dabei den Nachteilen (teils hohe verkehrliche Belastungen im Umfeld) auch durch die Gestaltung des Straßenraumes entgegen zu wirken. Beispielhaft für solche Standorte, an denen auch Pilotprojekte für eine innovative und multimodale Mobilität denkbar sind, sind Bereiche in der Friedrichstadt (Weißeritzstraße, Schäferstraße), in der Altstadt (Schweriner Straße), die Bereiche der Hafencity/Alter Leipziger Bahnhof, am Bahnhof Neustadt sowie die Brachen an der Bahn in Pieschen und Reick.

## Gestaltung der „Magistralen“

Durch die Zerstörungen im 2. Weltkrieg sind im Unterschied zu anderen Städten nur noch wenige Straßenräume in Dresden vorhanden, die mit hoher Dichte, starker Funktionsmischung aus Wohnen, Handel und Gewerbe sowie eindrucksvollen Fassaden an den Blockrändern dicht an wichtigen Stadtstraßen das urbane Image Dresdens als Großstadt verkörpern. Waren vor der Zerstörung Dresdens die Prager Straße, die St.-Petersburger-Straße aber auch Schweriner Straße, Guntzstraße und die Grunaer Straße dicht angebaut, so sind dort nun zurückgesetzte und wenig dichte Strukturen zu finden. Jedoch lassen sich immer noch einige Beispiele für „Großstadtstra

ßen“, die für die städtische Identität von höchster Bedeutung sind, finden, wie z. B. die Königsbrücker Straße oder die Kesselsdorfer Straße.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Königsbrücker Straße 2011

Die Herausforderung bei der Gestaltung dieser Stadträume besteht darin, die verkehrlichen Ansprüche (verkehrliche Bündelung und Erschließung im Kfz-Verkehr, Achse im ÖPNV und Radverkehr und hohe Bedeutung für den Fußgängerverkehr) mit denen von Wohnen, Gewerbe und Aufenthalt sowie Emissions- und Lärmkonflikten in Einklang zu bringen, um die Bausubstanz und vor allem deren Funktionsfähigkeit für das Wohnen zu sichern. Gleichzeitig sind solche Straßenräume „Visitenkarten“ einer jeden Stadt, an der sich Charakter und Attraktivität widerspiegeln.

## Wirtschaftsentwicklung und Verkehr

Die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung Dresdens ist positiv. Als wichtige Wachstumsbereiche sind im Gegensatz zu anderen deutschen Städten vor allem die Bereiche Forschung und Wissenschaft zu benennen. Dies sind Bereiche, die im Vergleich zu ihrer Wertschöpfung relativ geringe Schwerverkehrsbelastungen induzieren. Davon profitiert Dresden, da die Lkw-Belastungen gerade in innerstädtischen Bereichen als weitgehend verträglich zu bezeichnen sind. Auch im Güterverkehr per Bahn sind die Konflikte in Dresden verglichen mit anderen Städten ähnlicher Bedeutung eher gering. In Dresden muss vielmehr darauf geachtet werden, nicht die Potenziale für industrielle Ansiedlungen zu verlieren, was sich insbesondere in den Plänen zur Stilllegung des Güterbahnhofs Friedrichstadt sowie von Industriebahnanschlüssen äußert.

## 2.3 Zentrale stadträumliche Defizitbereiche

Um verkehrliche Maßnahmen den Notwendigkeiten der Stadtentwicklung anzupassen und Defizite abbauen zu können, wurde im Zuge der Analysen ein qualitativer Bewertungsprozess durchgeführt, der verkehrliche Konflikte aufdecken und Prioritäten verteilen soll. Auf Grundlage einer fachlichen Bewertung wurden im Zuge des Bewertungsprozesses stadträumliche Bereiche identifiziert, wo maßgebliche verkehrliche Konflikte (Kfz mit ÖPNV oder Kfz mit Fußgänger- oder Radverkehr) oder stadträumliche Konflikte (Funktionskonflikt zum Städtebau oder Probleme der Luftqualität bzw. des Verkehrslärms) auftraten. Damit wurden mit der Hilfe von Fachdiskussionen, Analyseunterlagen und eigener Ortskenntnis verschiedene Bereiche mit maximal 4 auftretenden

Seite 38
Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus
Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil A: Grundlagen und Bestandsanalyse
LVM VERITAS

Konflikten bzw. Betroffenheiten belegt. Voraussetzungen zur Übernahme als Defizit im Zuge des VEP sind dabei:

das Auftreten von mindestens 2 Defizitkategorien
das Auftreten von mindestens 10.000 Kfz/ Tag im Straßenraum
starke ÖPNV-Linien (Bus oder Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn mit mind. 6 Fahrten/ Stunde und Richtung)
das Vorhandensein von betroffenen Anwohnerinnen und Anwohnern im Bereich oder starken Randnutzungen (Fußgängerverkehr, starke Quellen und Ziele) und
bestehende Handlungsspielräume durch noch nicht durchgeführte Sanierungen in der jüngeren Vergangenheit

Damit wurden 34 stadträumliche Bereiche identifiziert. Diese wurden in drei Gruppen differenziert:

Gruppe 1 – im Zuge bereits beschlossener großer Neu- oder Umbaumaßnahmen ist eine Verbesserung zu erwarten (11 Bereiche),
Gruppe 2 – in mindestens 3 Kategorien bestehen Konflikte und eine Verbesserung ist nur durch neue Maßnahmen zu erreichen (8 „zentrale Maßnahmenbereiche“),
Gruppe 3 – eine Verbesserung ist durch Maßnahmen weitgehend im Bestand zu erreichen bzw. es liegen Planungen vor, den Bestand anzupassen – hier sind teilweise nur 2 Konfliktkategorien vertreten (15 Bereiche).

Während die Konfliktbereiche der Gruppe 1 im Zuge beschlossener Maßnahmen im Horizont des VEP Verbesserungen erfahren, besteht für die Gruppen 2 und 3 weiterer Handlungsbedarf. Dabei spielt die Gruppe 2 eine besondere Rolle, da hier viele Konflikte auftreten und es gleichzeitig umfassenderer Maßnahmen bedarf, diese zu lösen. Die Stadtbereiche der Gruppe 2 werden im Folgenden als „zentrale Maßnahmenbereiche“ und die entsprechend entwickelten Maßnahmen als „zentrale Maßnahmen“ bezeichnet. Die Konflikte ÖPNV/ Kfz-Verkehr leiten sich aus den Analysen der Wartezeit an den Knotenpunkten ab und bezeichnen eine ungenügende Qualitätsstufe des Verkehrsablaufs (QSV F).

Unter Beteiligung aller Akteure am Runden Tisch sowie in der Verwaltung wurden im VEP-Prozess im Oktober 2011 auf Grundlage eines Facharbeitspapiers konzeptionell-strategische Ansätze sowie die zentralen stadträumlichen Handlungsansätze bewertet. Dabei wurden alle Ansätze bestätigt. Weitere zentrale stadträumliche Defizitbereiche wurden seitens der beteiligten Akteure nicht benannt. Die so definierten Bereiche können keinen Anspruch auf Vollständigkeit stellen und müssen in ihrer Anzahl begrenzt werden, um Handlungsschwerpunkte bilden zu können.

LVM

Die so als konfliktreich identifizierten Stadtbereiche sind in Anlage 3 aufgeführt und bilden einen ersten Auswahlvorschlag. In Abbildung 19 sind diese Stadtbereiche klassifiziert grafisch dargestellt. Sie entsprechen in vielen Bereichen mit den in Abbildung 3 dargestellten Konfliktbereichen aus den Analysen im Verkehrssystem und hier insbesondere den Straßen mit hoher Lärmbetroffenheit. Im Zuge der Maßnahmenentwicklung wurden besonders die zentralen stadträumlichen Defizitbereiche bei der Maßnahmenentwicklung berücksichtigt (vgl. Kapitel 2.3).

## 2.4 Strukturprognosen und Stadtentwicklung

Die Einwohnerzahl Dresdens betrug im Jahr 2010 insgesamt 515.842 und im Jahr 2012 bereits 530.722 Personen. Für das Jahr 2025 ging die kommunale Statistikstelle der Stadt Dresden noch im Jahr 2010 von 532.200 Einwohnern in Dresden aus (+ 16.500 EW). Die aktuelle Einwohnerprognose der Stadt Dresden auf Basis der 2011 aktualisierten Bevölkerungsprognose des Statistischen Landesamtes lässt für das Jahr 2025 aber 550.800 Einwohnerinnen und Einwohner (+ 35.000 EW, entsprechend + 6,8 %) in Dresden erwarten. Die Prognose aus dem Jahr 2011 wurde im VEP entsprechend berücksichtigt.

Die Einwohnerentwicklung in den direkt angrenzenden Gemeinden von Dresden ist leicht rückläufig (2010: 227.300 EW, 2025: 224.600 EW, entspricht Rückgang von 2.700 Personen bis zum Jahr 2025). Der übrige Verflechtungsraum umfasst wesentliche Teile der Kreise Meißen, Bautzen, Sächsische Schweiz/Osterzgebirge und Mittelsachsen. Mit zunehmender Entfernung von Dresden verstärkt sich der Rückgang der Einwohnerzahlen. Einzelheiten dazu zeigt Grafik 10.

Für das Verkehrsaufkommen ist neben der Anzahl der Bevölkerung vor allem die Altersverteilung von Bedeutung, da sich die Aktivitäten und die Verkehrsmittelwahl der verschiedenen Altersgruppen unterscheiden (z. B. mobile Berufstätige, Rad fahrende Jugendliche, zu-Fuß-gehende Seniorinnen und Senioren).

Grafik 11 vergleicht die Entwicklung der verkehrsrelevanten Altersgruppen von Analyse (2010) und der aktuellen Prognose 2025.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Grafik 11: Unterschiede der Altersstruktur zwischen Analyse 2010 und Prognose 2025 als absolute Veränderung der Einwohnerzahlen in Dresden (die Prognose 2025 beruht auf Daten aus dem Jahr 2011)

Besonders stark wachsen die Gruppen der Kinder und Jugendlichen sowie der Hochbetagten. Demgegenüber entwickeln sich die Gruppen der 65- bis 74-Jährigen und der Personen im erwerbsfähigen Alter im Vergleich zur Analyse 2010 rückläufig. Fragen der Barrierefreiheit sowie der nicht-Kfz-bezogenen Mobilität (Kinder, Jugendliche und Hochbetagte) werden sich deshalb zukünftig immer häufiger stellen.

Auch Familienarbeit (Holen, Bringen) und die Sicherheit auf Ausbildungswegen werden an Bedeutung gewinnen. Dresden wird aber nur dann weiter wachsen, wenn eine entsprechende wirtschaftliche Entwicklung die Grundlage dafür bildet. In diesem Fall ist auch mit stärker wachsendem Wirtschaftsverkehr zu rechnen.

Eine weitere wichtige Komponente bei der Beurteilung der aktuellen Einwohnerprognose sind die räumlichen Verteilungen. Die Lage der Wohnung hat eine direkte Wirkung auf Art und Häufigkeit der Verkehrsmittelnutzung, da die Angebote für Aktivitäten und Verkehrsmittelzugang in den

Stadtquartieren unterschiedlich sind. Grafik 12 zeigt, dass es zwischen der Analyse 2010 und der Prognose 2025 deutliche räumliche Verschiebungen erwartet werden.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Grafik 12: Entwicklung der Einwohnerzahlen im Vergleich der Jahre 2025 und 2010

Das Wohnen in den innenstadtnahen Stadtbereichen Dresdens nimmt deutlich zu, während außenliegende Stadtbereiche von diesem Trend weniger profitieren. Das Bevölkerungswachstum betrifft insbesondere die Leipziger Vorstadt, Pieschen, Friedrichstadt, Löbtau, Cotta, Striesen, Nickern und Strehlen. Der leichte Rückgang im Zentrum der Altstadt und in Teilen der Südvorstadt dagegen ist auch auf die Altersstruktur zurückzuführen und den damit weiter sinkenden Haushaltsgrößen bei gleichbleibender Wohnraumgröße.

Die zentral orientierte Einwohnerentwicklung wirkt insgesamt positiv auf verkehrlich effiziente Stadtstrukturen und ermöglicht preiswerte und energiearme Mobilität in einem stärker nahräumlich orientierten Verkehrssystem. Die Rolle von Radverkehr und ÖPNV wird damit nochmals wichtiger, da in zentralen Bereichen sonst die Konflikte von Verkehrslärm und Emissionen zunehmen und der Raum für Infrastrukturneubau oder -verlagerung fehlt.

Die Arbeitsplatzentwicklung unterscheidet sich von der Einwohnerentwicklung nicht grundsätzlich. Für die Stadt Dresden wird eine positive Arbeitsplatzentwicklung erwartet, für die direkt angrenzenden Umlandgemeinden und für den übrigen Verflechtungsraum wird derzeit jedoch von rückläufigen Entwicklungen ausgegangen. Einzelheiten zeigt Grafik 13. Danach könnten die Arbeitsplätze in Dresden um knapp 2 % (entsprechend +4.800 AP) anwachsen und in den direkt angrenzenden

zenden Umlandgemeinden dafür deutlich zurückgehen. Im übrigen Verflechtungsraum wird langfristig aus demografischen Gründen die Anzahl der Arbeitsplätze ebenfalls zurückgehen.

Vor dem Hintergrund der starken Zunahme der Einwohnerzahlen, insbesondere der Personen im schulpflichtigen Alter, werden in Dresden die Schulplätze² insgesamt um knapp 30 % und in den unmittelbar angrenzenden Umlandgemeinden um 6,5 % steigen müssen. Für den übrigen Verflechtungsraum wird bis 2025 mit einer in etwa konstanten Anzahl Schulplätze gerechnet. Einzelheiten zeigt Grafik 14.

# 3. Szenarienbildung und Wirkungsberechnung

## 3.1 Vorbemerkungen und verwendetes Verkehrsmodell

Die Szenarientechnik ist eine im Rahmen kommunaler Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung anerkannte wissenschaftliche Methode, um die Konsequenzen planerischen Handelns anhand verkehrlicher Wirkungen vorzuzeichnen. Dabei gelingt es, komplexe Wirkungszusammenhänge aus dem Verkehrsverhalten der Menschen, aus den Anforderungen des Wirtschaftsverkehrs und aus der Entwicklung der Verkehrsinfrastruktur auf Basis plausibler Annahmen gleichzeitig abzubilden und so Erkenntnisse für alle Verkehrsträger (Kfz, ÖPNV, Rad und Fuß) aus einem einzigen, integrierten Bewertungsprozess zu gewinnen.

Die Szenarientechnik ist bei aller Komplexität ein effizientes Instrument, um auf der Ebene der Gesamtstadt oder ausgewählter Teilbereiche zu belastbaren Entwicklungsaussagen zu gelangen, die einzeln nicht beschreibbar oder bewertbar wären. Dazu müssen Szenarienannahmen entwickelt werden, die zu den vorgegebenen Leitzielen sowie zu den im Rahmen der Verkehrsanalyse erkannten Problemen und Mängeln (vgl. Kap. 2.1) passen. Die Ergebnisse der Szenarienberechnungen helfen, Wirkungsrichtungen bestimmter verkehrlicher Maßnahmenansätze zu erkennen sowie Aussagen zur Entwicklung der Verkehrsbelastung im Straßennetz und den daraus erwachsenden Umweltwirkungen abzuleiten.

Szenarienberechnungen sind in der Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung essentiell, um vor einer Festlegung auf bestimmte Maßnahmenansätze deren Gesamtwirkungen zu kennen und unter Nutzung weiterer Parameter (Kosten, Prioritäten usw.) ausgeglichene und wirkungslogische Handlungs- und Maßnahmenkonzepte zusammenzustellen. Ein besonderer Stellenwert kommt dabei der Ausgewogenheit von Maßnahmen zu, d. h. der Passgenauigkeit auf möglichst viele der vorgegebenen Entwicklungsziele.

Die Szenarien des Verkehrsentwicklungsplans Dresden bilden keine Flächennutzungsszenarien ab, sondern beruhen auf den jeweils gleichen Annahmen zur Stadtentwicklung.

Der Nachweis der Szenarienwirkungen erfolgt mit Hilfe eines eigens für diesen Zweck entwickelten multimodalen Verkehrsmodells für den motorisierten Verkehr (Software VISUM). Das Verkehrsmodell umfasst die Stadt Dresden und ihr Einzugsgebiet. Die Verkehrsnetze und Modellparameter beruhen auf Zuarbeiten der Stadt Dresden sowie auf Daten aus dem detaillierten kommunalen Verkehrsmodell 2025 (vgl. hierzu auch Kapitel 2.4). Die Erkenntnisse, die mit dem überschlägigen Verkehrsmodell bei der Szenarienrechnung gewonnen wurden, sollen nach Abschluss der Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung in das kommunale Verkehrsmodell einfließen.

## 3.2 Entwicklungen und Annahmen

Die Szenarien bauen auf der erwarteten Entwicklung der Strukturdaten auf und bilden die Trends der Dresdner Verkehrsentwicklung der vergangenen 10 bis 15 Jahre auf Basis empirischer Untersuchungen (insbesondere Mobilität in Städten – SrV) nach. Dies betrifft vor allem das Verkehrsverhalten der Bevölkerung, das seit 1998 durch eine deutlich steigende Radnutzung, Zuwächse im ÖPNV und eine sinkende personenbezogene Verkehrsleistung im Kfz-Verkehr gekennzeichnet ist.

In der Überlagerung aller Einflussfaktoren, die durch veränderte individuelle Mobilität bei gleichzeitigem Bevölkerungswachstum in Dresden und starken Schrumpfungstendenzen im Umland gekennzeichnet sind, ergeben sich in Dresden seit Jahren stagnierende oder zurückgehende Belastungen im Straßennetz (vgl. Grafik 6 auf Seite 23).

Die bestehenden Trends werden anhand der zukünftig erwarteten Randbedingungen fortgeschrieben. Gleichzeitig werden Arbeitsplatzverteilungen, Gewerbestandorte, Bildungs- und Versorgungseinrichtungen, Schwerpunkte von Einkaufen und Freizeit sowie sonstige Schwerpunktnutzungen auf Basis aktueller kommunaler Statistiken und zukünftiger Entwicklungen entsprechend der Bauleitplanung berücksichtigt. Ebenso werden differenzierte Altersstrukturen sowie die Fragen des Gender-Mainstreaming (Familienarbeit, ÖPNV-Zugang, Mobilität Jugendlicher) in den Szenarien beachtet.

Die Szenarien zum Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden berücksichtigen auch die Trends im Verkehrsverhalten, Annahmen zur Entwicklung von Elektromobilität und Carsharing sowie Kostenaspekte der Mobilität. Dabei kommt dem persönlichen Mobilitätsstil, der vor allem durch den jeweiligen Wohnstandort und die dort vorhandenen verkehrlichen Angebote geprägt ist, eine hohe Bedeutung bei der Verkehrsmittelwahl zu. Diese lässt sich auch mit den Begriffen „Nahmobilität“ und „Stadt der kurzen Wege“ beschreiben. Eine solche zentrenorientierte Entwicklung wird für Dresden im integrierten Stadtentwicklungskonzept als Zielstellung angesetzt. Damit wird auch eine preiswerte und energieeffiziente Mobilität im Sinne einer dichten europäischen Stadt („Renaissance der Städte“³), steigender Energiepreise und den Anforderungen an die Luftreinhaltung möglich. Die letzten Jahre haben gezeigt, dass durch die forcierte Nutzung innerstädtischer Entwicklungsflächen sowie baulicher Nachverdichtungen Impulse in dieser Richtung auch in Dresden gesetzt werden konnten.

Generell wird für alle Szenarien vereinfachend unterstellt, das die freie Wahl des Verkehrsmittels auch in Zukunft erhalten bleibt, eine Umweltzone in Dresden nicht eingerichtet wird (rechtlich aber auch nicht ausgeschlossen werden kann) und die bestehende Verkehrsinfrastruktur in guter Qua

lität erhalten bleibt. Zudem wird davon ausgegangen, dass der ÖPNV seine Leistungen weiterhin in der heutigen Qualität erbringen kann und die dafür erforderliche Infrastruktur sowie geeignete Fahrzeuge zur Verfügung stehen. Diese bestandsorientierten Annahmen stellen vor dem Hintergrund der erforderlichen Finanzierung große Herausforderungen dar. Ein Negativszenario mit sinkenden Netz- und Angebotsqualitäten widerspräche den Leitzielen der zukünftigen Verkehrsentwicklung.

Aus langjährigen empirischen Untersuchungen (insbesondere aus Zeitreihen der Befragung SrV⁴) ist bekannt, dass die individuelle Mobilität nicht nur durch die Zugehörigkeit zu einer bestimmten Personengruppe und durch infrastrukturelle Randbedingungen bestimmt wird. Auch weitere Faktoren, wie ein zunehmendes Umweltbewusstsein, eine stärkere Kostensensibilität oder die veränderte individuelle Wertschätzung von (Kfz-)Mobilität prägen zunehmend das Verkehrsverhalten, wobei neue Mobilitätsoptionen wie z. B. Carsharing gezielt genutzt werden. Diese Faktoren wurden im Rahmen klassischer Verkehrsprognosen bislang in der Regel nicht berücksichtigt. Im Rahmen des VEP Dresden gehen sie jedoch über einen gesonderten Ansatz des Verhaltenswandels in die Szenarienberechnungen mit ein.

Die Szenarientechnik des VEP beruht darauf, plausible Entwicklungsannahmen zu treffen und die daraus erwachsenden gesamtstädtischen, komplexen und intermodalen Wirkungszusammenhänge abzubilden. In der Phase der Szenarienbildung kann und soll noch nicht geprüft werden, inwieweit die mit den einzelnen Szenarien verbundenen Maßnahmenansätze finanzierbar sind und ob sie in der dargestellten Form auch umgesetzt werden können. Stattdessen sollen im Rahmen eines Vorzugsszenarios diejenigen Maßnahmenansätze weiter ausgearbeitet werden, die im Sinne der Zielstellung besonders wirksam sind, die Ausgewogenheit zwischen den Verkehrsträgern gewährleisten und deren Umsetzung nicht unrealistisch erscheint.

## 3.3 Vergleichsfälle und VEP-Szenarien

Um darzustellen, wie sich die vorgenannten Entwicklungen und Annahmen z. B. auf die Verkehrsnachfrage und die Verkehrsmittelwahl auswirken, werden vergleichende Betrachtungen durchgeführt. Dabei wird der Analysefall 2010 zunächst mit zwei Prognosefällen verglichen, die den im Prognosejahr 2025 erwarteten Verkehrszustand ohne VEP-Maßnahmen beschreiben (sog. Ohne-Fälle als Vergleichsfälle). Die Vergleichsfälle sollen zeigen, wie sich das Dresdner Verkehrssystem entwickeln würde, wenn man:

die heutige Netz- und Angebotsstruktur erhalten und zusätzlich lediglich die bereits begonnenen Verkehrsprojekte vollenden, jedoch keine weiteren Maßnahmen durchführen würde (Prognose-Nullfall 2025),

W

die heutige Netz- und Angebotsstruktur erhalten würde, jedoch zusätzlich alle vom Stadtrat nach 2003 beschlossenen, großen Verkehrsprojekte fertig stellen könnte und weitere Baulastträger ihre bereits beschlossenen Projekte ebenfalls umsetzten (Sowieso-Fall 2025).

Die Vergleichsfälle basieren auf den gleichen Strukturannahmen wie die Szenarienfälle des VEP (sog. Prognose-Mitfälle). Werden diese Ohne-Fälle den VEP-Szenarien (Mit-Fälle) gegenüber gestellt, wird erkennbar, welche Wirkungen allein auf die Strukturentwicklungen und die (ohnehin erwarteten) Verhaltensentwicklungen zurückzuführen sind und welche (zusätzlichen) Wirkungen sich unmittelbar aus den VEP-Szenarien und den damit im einzelnen verbundenen VEP-Maßnahmen ergeben. Sämtlichen im Folgenden dargestellten Szenarioberechnungen ist noch die etwas ältere Prognose aus dem Jahr 2010 hinterlegt.

In einer Sensitivitätsbetrachtung wurden der Prognose-Nullfall und der Sowieso-Fall mit der neuesten Strukturdatenprognose belegt, um die Wirkungsrichtung einer solchen Entwicklung zu ermitteln. Da die grundsätzliche Entwicklungsrichtung der beiden Strukturdatenprognosen weitgehend identisch ist und somit weder die Szenariendiskussion noch die Szenarienentscheidung beeinflusst, wurde zunächst auf weitere aktualisierte Berechnungen verzichtet.

Die vorgenannten Vergleichsfälle sind wie folgt definiert:

## Prognose-Nullfall 2025 (P0)

heutige Netz- und Angebotsstruktur sowie zusätzlich Verkehrswirksamkeit aller bereits im Bau bzw. Umsetzung befindlichen Projekte:

Waldschlößchenbrücke mit ihren Anschlüssen,
Staatsstraße S 177n zwischen Pirna und der A 4,
Staatsstraße S 191n von Goppeln bis zur B 170,
viergleisiger Ausbau der Schienenstrecke Dresden – Radebeul/ Coswig,
S-Bahn-Haltepunkt Dresden-Bischofsplatz
15-Minutentakt auf der S-Bahnlinie S1.

# "Sowieso-Fall" 2025 (Sowieso)

wie Prognose-Nullfall, jedoch zusätzlich Realisierung aller Maßnahmen, die vom Stadtrat seit 2003 mit Beschluss unterlegt sind oder von Bund bzw. Freistaat Sachsen auf Basis der BVWP bzw. des Landesverkehrsplans bis 2025 geplant sind und als realisierbar eingeschätzt werden ("Sowieso-Maßnahmen"):

Ausbau der Königsbrücker Straße zwischen Albertplatz und Industriegelände,
Neubau eines Teilstücks der Straße „Emerich-Ambros-Ufer“ stadteinwärts im Bereich Altcotta,
Ausbau der Hamburger Straße von der Weißeritzbrücke bis zur Warthaer Straße,
Ausbau des Knotenpunkts Magdeburger Straße/ Weißeritzstraße als 1. teil des Ausbaus der Magdeburger Straße
Neubau der B 6n (Ortsumgehung Cossebaude) mit Anbindung an die S 84n nach Meißen,
Sanierung und Verbreiterung der Albertbrücke,
Realisierung Stadtbahnprogramm 2020 mit Umsetzung der drei Stadtbahnstrecken Löbtau – Strehlen/ Tiergartenstraße, Bühlau – Weißig und Johannstadt – Innenstadt – Plauen,
Realisierung der Zentralhaltestelle Kesselsdorfer Straße.

Die Zusammenstellung aller „Sowieso-Maßnahmen“ ist in **Abbildung 4** dargestellt.

Die Szenarienberechnungen im VEP Dresden unterscheiden drei Szenarien (Szenario A, B und C), die

zum einen unterschiedliche Entwicklungen der infrastrukturellen Ausstattungen und der Angebote im ÖPNV sowie im Radverkehr unterstellen,
zum anderen Unterschiede beim Verkehrsverhalten der Dresdner Bevölkerung berücksichtigen.

Die VEP-Szenarien A und B bilden bei gleichem Verhaltensansatz („Verhalten gemäß Trendentwicklung“) verschiedene Annahmen zum Ausbau der Verkehrsnetze ab, um den Einfluss der Maßnahmenintensität zu erkennen. Die Szenarien B und C hingegen nutzen bei gleichen Annahmen zum Ausbau der Verkehrsnetze verschiedene Ansätze des Verkehrsverhaltens (Szenario B „Verhalten gemäß Trend“, Szenario C „Verhaltenswandel“), um den Einfluss des Verkehrsverhaltens aufzuzeigen.

LVM VERITAS

Die drei VEP-Szenarien lassen sich wie folgt charakterisieren:

## Szenario A 2025 („Verhalten gemäß Trendentwicklung“)

„...was wäre, wenn bis zum Jahr 2025 alle Maßnahmen des Sowieso-Falls umgesetzt sind und zusätzlich vor allem das Straßennetz weiter ausgebaut, aber auch einiges für den Fuß- und Radverkehr sowie zur Verkehrsberuhigung getan worden wäre?“

## Szenario B 2025 („Verhalten gemäß Trendentwicklung“)

„...was wäre, wenn bis zum Jahr 2025 alle Maßnahmen des Sowieso-Falls umgesetzt sind und zusätzlich vor allem der Fuß- und Radverkehr sowie der ÖPNV in Stadt und Region weiter ausgebaut, der Verkehr beruhigt bzw. intelligent und innovativ gesteuert würde, aber auch einige weitere Maßnahmen im Straßennetz umgesetzt worden wären?“

## Szenario C 2025 („Verhaltenswandel“)

„...was wäre, wenn bis zum Jahr 2025 alle Maßnahmen gemäß Szenario B realisiert wären, aber sich die Menschen u. a. aus Kostengründen noch stärker für integrierte Wohnstandorte und alternative Mobilitätsangebote entscheiden würden?“

Die drei VEP-Szenarien sind nachfolgend im Einzelnen beschrieben. Eine umfassende Liste aller ca. 160 berücksichtigten Ansätze und Annahmen ist als Anlage 4 beigefügt⁵.

## Szenario A 2025

Um Szenarienwirkungen berechnen zu können, müssen zunächst Maßnahmenansätze zur Entwicklung des Verkehrssystems zusammengetragen werden. Dafür sind in den Szenarien des VEP Dresden insgesamt 125 Maßnahmen (zusätzlich zu P0 und Sowieso) zusammengeführt worden. Dabei handelt es sich insbesondere um:

Maßnahmenansätze zum Abbau festgestellter verkehrlicher oder verkehrlich-städtebaulicher Mängel (siehe Anlage 3),
bauliche und angebotsseitige Maßnahmen aus bestehenden Planungen und Beschlüssen der Stadt Dresden oder Dritter wie z. B. dem Freistaat Sachsen als Baulastträger von Teilen des Straßennetzes,
Maßnahmenansätze aus Zuarbeiten und Stellungnahmen im Rahmen der beteiligten Gremien bei der VEP-Bearbeitung (Kommunalpolitik, Runder Tisch, Verwaltung, Regionalvertreter)

⁵ Die Szenarienannahmen wurden auch in der Dokumentation „Fragen und Antworten zur Entscheidung für ein Vorzugsszenario“ vom 2.4.2012 für den Ausschuss „Stadtentwicklung und Bau“ ausführlich dargestellt.

Maßnahmenansätze, die die Gutachter aus den Erkenntnissen der Analyse und unter Berücksichtigung der Leitziele im Sinne einer zukunftsorientierten Verkehrsentwicklung eingebracht haben.

Die entwickelten Maßnahmen sind je nach Szenario verschieden, sie unterscheiden sich aber auch in ihrer Wirkung auf das Verkehrssystem. So sind reine Infrastrukturmaßnahmen (z. B. eine neue Straßenverbindung oder eine zusätzliche Stadtbahnlinie) durch ihre unmittelbare Angebotswirkung beschreibbar, während andere Maßnahmen nur summarisch abgebildet werden können (z. B. Maßnahmen der Radverkehrsförderung oder Preismaßnahmen). Es gibt auch Maßnahmen, die für die Verkehrsentwicklung wichtig sind, aber in den Szenarienberechnungen nicht direkt mit Wirkungen versehen werden können (z. B. die Erhöhung der Verkehrssicherheit oder eine verbesserte Stadtqualität bzw. Straßenraumgestaltung mit Bäumen).

Szenario A steht unter der generellen Zielstellung „Gute Erreichbarkeit mit Fokus auf Maßnahmen zugunsten des Kfz-Verkehrs“ und umfasst alle Sowieso-Maßnahmen sowie die folgenden Maßnahmen (Auszug):

Verlegung aller Bundesstraßen aus dem 26er Ring,
Entlastung Dr.-Külz-Ring durch Ableitung des Kfz-Verkehrs über den 26er Ring,
Neubau der Bahnbrücke Liebstädter Straße (Anbindung des Wissenschaftsstandorts Dresden-Ost) und Verlängerung Tiergartenstraße bis Oskar-Röder-Straße,
Bestandssanierung Blaues Wunder und ergänzende Elbquerung in Niederpoyritz,
Ausbau Wormser Straße und Durchbindung Spenerstraße zur Entlastung Fetscherplatz,
4-streifiger Ausbau der B 172 bis AS Heidenau und Neubau Querspange Sporbitz,
niveaufreier Ausbau des Knotenpunkts Stauffenbergallee/ Königsbrücker Straße (Nord-Ost-Ausrichtung),
neue Autobahnanschlussstelle Weixdorf an der A 4 und Anbindung des Gewerbegebiets Promigberg,
Durchbindung Passauer Straße – Westendring,
Verkehrsberuhigung im Stadtzentrum Dresden,
neuer S-Bahn-Halt Albertstadt und Nossener Brücke,
Einrichtung eines zentralen Busbahnhofs am Hauptbahnhof,
ÖPNV-Beschleunigung durch Verkehrsteuerung an Knotenpunkten,
Ausbau des Fuß- und Radverkehrsnetzes als „Basispaket“

# Szenario B 2025

Szenario B steht unter der generellen Zielstellung „Gute Erreichbarkeit für Alle durch Nahmobilität und Ressourcenschonung“ und umfasst alle Sowieso-Maßnahmen sowie die folgenden Maßnahmen (Auszug):

Verlegung aller Bundesstraßen aus dem 26er Ring,
Entlastung Dr.-Külz-Ring durch Ableitung des Kfz-Verkehrs über den 26er Ring,
Bestandssanierung Blaues Wunder ohne zusätzliche Elbquerungen,
bestandsnahe Sanierungen des Hauptstraßennetzes,
deutliche Verkehrsberuhigung im Stadtzentrum (26er-Ring) sowie in den Wohnquartieren,
Taktverdichtung auf den Stadtbahnlinien 3, 4, 7 und 11 auf 5 Minuten in der Hauptverkehrszeit mit Ausbau der notwendigen Infrastruktur und entsprechender Verkehrssteuerung,
Bau einer Umweltbrücke Ostragehege – Kaditz für Fußgänger- und Radverkehr und ÖPNV, um durch intermodale Effekte die Leipziger Straße in Mickten zu entlasten und die Dresdner Innenstadt besser anzubinden,
Bau von vier neuen S-Bahn-Halten (Albertstadt, Nossener Brücke, Königsbrücker Landstraße und Richard-Strauss-Platz),
Ersatz der Buslinie 61 bis Blasewitz durch eine Stadthanstrecke bzw. -linie,
Einrichtung eines zentralen Busbahnhofs am Hauptbahnhof,
Ersatz der Regionalbahn nach Ottendorf-Okrilla durch eine Stadtbahnverbindung,
Verbesserung des Regionalbusangebots in Richtung Bannewitz, Wilsdruff und Moritzburg,
Systematisierung und teilweise Verdichtung der Bahnangebote auf der linkselbischen Bahnstrecke Richtung Coswig sowie Richtung Bischofswerda (mit Ausbau am Klotzscher Berg),
preisgünstige Mobilitätsoptionen im ÖPNV (Sozialticket, erweiterte Angebote für Besucherinnen und Besucher),
Ausbau des Fuß- und Radverkehrsnetzes mit deutlichen Investitionen.

# Szenario C 2025

Szenario C steht ebenfalls unter der Zielstellung „Gute Erreichbarkeit für Alle durch Nahmobilität und Ressourcenschonung“ und umfasst sämtliche Maßnahmen von Szenario B. Während Szenario B von einem „Trendverhalten“ ausgeht, wird in Szenario C ein stärkerer „Verhaltenswandel“ aufgrund weiter steigender Energiepreise, einer Präferenz des Umweltverbundes und verstärkter Nahmobilität unterstellt. Dieser ist durch die Verkehrspolitik der Stadt Dresden jedoch nur bedingt beeinflussbar.

Szenario B + C
Szenario B: "Verhalten Trend"
Szenario C: "Verhaltenswandel"

Es wird deutlich, dass Szenario A wesentlich mehr Kfz-Maßnahmen umfasst als die Szenarien B und C (A: +24 km Straße und +16 km Straßenbahn/Stadtbahn, B/ C: +11 km Straße und +22 km Straßenbahn/Stadtbahn, jeweils im Vergleich zum Bestandsnetz). Die Maßnahmen der Szenarien B und C hingegen sind innovativer und mehr auf eine Verbesserung der Stadtqualität ausgerichtet.

Die innovativen Ansätze berücksichtigen z. B.:

die Entwicklung von Strukturen zur Nahmobilitätsförderung,
die Minderung von umwelt-, gesundheits- und klimaschädlichen Emissionen,
die Verbesserung intermodaler Verknüpfungen oder
Preis- bzw. Tarifmaßnahmen zur Erhöhung der Attraktivität des ÖPNV.

Die Ansätze zur Verbesserung der Stadtqualität umfassen beispielsweise

Verringerung verkehrlich-städtebaulicher Konflikte
Erhöhung der Aufenthaltsqualität,
Aufwertung von Platzsituationen,
weitere Verdichtung von Grünachsen zur Nutzung im Fuß- und Radverkehr,
Vermeidung von Straßenrandparken in städtebaulich sensiblen Situationen u. a.

# 3.4 Zielerreichung und Auswahl des Vorzugsszenarios

## 3.4.1 Vorbemerkungen

Die für die beiden Vergleichsfälle (P0 und Sowieso) sowie für die 3 VEP-Szenarien entwickelten Maßnahmen und die jeweils getroffenen Verhaltensannahmen sind in das in Kapitel 3.1 beschriebene überschlagliche Verkehrsmodell für Stadt und Umland Dresden eingebracht und auf diese Weise einer verkehrlichen Bewertung zugeführt worden. Damit soll gezeigt werden, welche stadtweiten verkehrlichen und sonstigen Wirkungen mit den einzelnen Vergleichs- und Szenariofällen 2025 verbunden sind und in welchem Umfang diese die Leitziele der Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung unterstützen. Zur Verdeutlichung der Ausgangssituation (Status quo) wird zusätzlich der Analysefall 2010 aufgeführt.

Ziel der vergleichenden Bewertung ist es, dasjenige Szenario zu identifizieren, welches die Leitziele am besten erfüllt und deshalb als Vorzugsszenario dem VEP Dresden zugrunde gelegt werden sollte. Dabei kann es aus verkehrsfachlichen oder strategischen Gründen sinnvoll sein, das ausgewählte Szenario um Elemente anderer Szenarien anzureichern, sofern diese eine bessere oder ausgewogene Zielerreichung ermöglichen.

## 3.4.2 Entwicklung Verkehrsaufkommen und Modal Split

Die erwartete Strukturentwicklung, die strategische Ausrichtung der Szenarien und das damit verbundene Maßnahmenprogramm spiegeln sich im Verkehrsaufkommen wider.

Wie Grafik 16 zeigt, steigt der Binnenverkehr der Stadt Dresden gegenüber heute deutlich an, je nach Entwicklungsszenario um bis zu 10 %. Davon sind die verschiedenen Verkehrsträger jedoch nicht gleichmäßig betroffen. Während das Verkehrsaufkommen im MIV eher konstant bleibt bzw. sich in den Szenarien B und C deutlich rückläufig entwickelt, nehmen ÖPNV und Radverkehr dem Trend entsprechend und wegen der spezifischen Maßnahmenprogramme (u. a. Stadtbahnkonzept 2020) zu. Besonders stark steigt der nicht-motorisierte Verkehr (auch der Fußgängerverkehr) im Szenario C, da dort ein stärkerer Verhaltenswandel aufgrund weiter steigender Energiepreise, eine Präferenz des Umweltverbundes und verstärkte Nahmobilität unterstellt wird. Durch den ausschließlichen Bezug der Grafik 16 auf den Binnenverkehr der Stadt Dresden wird deutlich, dass Szenario C einerseits zusätzliche Mobilität generiert, andererseits Fahrten, die bisher ins Umland unternommen wurden, nun verstärkt nahräumlich in Dresden stattfinden.

Die Entwicklung der Verkehrsmittelwahl der Dresdner Bevölkerung im Binnenverkehr und im Quellverkehr aus der Stadt heraus ist in Grafik 17 dargestellt. Analog zur Entwicklung des Verkehrsaufkommens sind hier je nach Szenario deutliche Rückgänge im MIV und entsprechend deutliche Zunahmen im ÖPNV (Szenario B) sowie im Rad- und Fußgängerverkehr (Szenario C) zu erkennen.

In den Szenarien B und C beträgt der Anteil des Umweltverbundes 63,2 % (Szenario B) bzw. 66,7 % (Szenario C), wobei im Szenario C der Anteil des Radverkehrs von derzeit ca. 17 % auf ca. 23 % steigt und der Anteil des Kfz-Verkehrs von ca. 41 % auf ca. 33 % sinkt. Diese Entwicklung ergibt sich wesentlich aus dem Maßnahmenschwerpunkt im Bereich der umweltfreundlichen Nahmobilität. Derzeit liegt der Anteil des Umweltverbundes nach SrV 2008 bei ca. 59 %.

Von hoher Bedeutung sind weiterhin Aussagen zum 26er Ring in Dresden, da hier eine teils problematische Überlagerung von Verkehren zwischen den Dresdner Stadtteilen und dem Quell- und Zielverkehr ins Zentrum stattfindet. Besondere Probleme bereitet hier der Kfz-Verkehr, z. B. am Dr.-Külz-Ring. Deshalb ist es wichtig und durch die Leitziele vorgegeben, das Verkehrsaufkommen in diesem Bereich möglichst zu senken und auf die Verkehrsmittel des Umweltverbunds zu verlagern. Der 26er Ring und der von ihm umfasste Stadtbereich enthalten aber Elemente des Dresdner Straßennetzes (z. B. den Straßenzug St.-Petersburger-Straße), die aus heutiger Sicht auch langfristig in ihrer derzeitigen Funktion nicht verzichtbar sind.

Grafik 17: Entwicklung des Modal Split im Binnen- und Quellverkehr der Stadt Dresden (Anmerkung: die Berechnungen basieren auf Strukturdatenprognosen von 2010 – diese wurden nachfolgend mit Sensitivitätsberechnungen mit 2011er Strukturdaten bestätigt)

Grafik 18 zeigt, dass der „reine“ Durchgangsverkehr (vom Umland durch die Stadt Dresden ins Umland) erwartungsgemäß nur einen sehr geringen Teil des Verkehrs auf dem 26er Ring ausmacht. Gleiches gilt für Binnenverkehre der Kernstadt, die teilweise über den 26er Ring abgewickelt werden. Der 26er Ring wird ganz überwiegend von innerstädtischen Durchgangsverkehren sowie von Quell- und Zielverkehren in die Kernstadt genutzt, und zwar in etwa gleichem Umfang.

Bedingt durch den Straßennetzausbau in Szenario A steigt in diesem Fall auch das Verkehrsaufkommen auf dem 26er Ring, während es im Fall der Szenarien B und C im Vergleich zum Status quo (Analyse) sinkt.

In keinem der untersuchten Szenarien sind Anzeichen zu finden, dass auf konfliktbehaftete Kern-
elemente wie die Könneritzstraße oder die Große Meißner Straße verzichtet werden könnte. In
den Szenarien B und C wird aber deutlich, dass es durchaus zu Entlastungen auf dem 26er Ring
und den dort befindlichen kritischen Knoten (z. B. Könneritzstraße/ Schweriner Straße) kommen
kann, mit der Folge eines verbesserten Verkehrsflusses auch während der Verkehrsspitze.

## 3.4.3 Entwicklung Verkehrsleistung und Streckenbelastungen

Ein wesentlicher Indikator der Auslastung des Straßennetzes ist die Kfz-Verkehrsleistung. Wie Grafik 19 zeigt, sinkt die Verkehrsleistung bereits im Prognose-Nullfall (P0) gegenüber dem Status quo (Analyse) deutlich. Von entscheidendem Einfluss sind die demografischen Effekte (jüngere, zentraler wohnende Dresdner Bevölkerung und sinkende Pendlerzahlen aus dem Umland). Die Sowieso-Maßnahmen sorgen dafür, dass die Verkehrsleistung nochmals leicht abnimmt. Dadurch wird auch deutlich, dass die Sowieso-Maßnahmen die Ausgewogenheit der Verkehrsträger berücksichtigen. Veränderungen wie beispielsweise ein Verzicht auf das Stadtbahnprogramm 2020 würde dieses Gleichgewicht aufheben.

Die Szenarien B und C mit ihrem Fokus auf ÖPNV, Fuß- und Radverkehr sowie Nahmobilität – bei gleichzeitig lediglich punktuellem Ausbau des Straßennetzes – führen nochmals zu geringeren Verkehrsleistungen, verglichen mit dem Prognose-Nullfall (P0). Demgegenüber bewirken die Maßnahmen im Szenario A mit ihrem Fokus auf den Kfz-Verkehr einen Anstieg der Verkehrsleistung gegenüber heute.

Die Analyse der durchschnittlichen Streckenbelastung des Straßennetzes in der Spitzenstunde (ohne Autobahnen) zeigt ein ähnliches Ergebnis wie die Analyse der Verkehrsleistung. Während im Szenario A die Streckenbelastung trotz Netzausbau weiter steigt (+3 %), sinkt sie im Prognose-Nullfall (P0), im Sowieso-Fall sowie bei den Szenarien B und C. Der Rückgang beträgt dabei zwischen 7 % und 13 % je nach Szenario. Ein Rückgang von ca. 7 % entspricht in etwa dem Effekt des „Ferienverkehrs“, bei dem der Verkehrsfuss im Straßennetz selbst in den neuralgischen

Bereichen deutlich bessere Qualitäten erreicht als außerhalb der Ferienzeit. Einzelheiten zeigt Grafik 20. Zu beachten ist sowohl die durch die Sperrung von einigen Netzelementen in den Szenarien B und C (z. B. Augustusbrücke) gegenüber heute weiter sinkende Auslastung des Netzes als auch der Rückgang der Streckenbelastungen zwischen den Szenarien B und C. Hier zeigen sich abermals der im Szenario C angenommene Verhaltenswandel und die Orientierung auf Nahmobilität mit der Folge deutlich sinkender Netzbelastungen.

Die Aussagen in Grafik 20 gelten für das Hauptnetz der Stadt Dresden und bilden einen Mittelwert ab. Punktuell können weiterhin Überlastungen auftreten. Diesbezüglich sind vertiefende Untersuchungen erforderlich, wie z. B. im Bereich des Blauen Wunders. Die wesentliche Aussage ist, dass insbesondere Szenario A - aufgrund der einseitigen Schwerpunktsetzungen mit der Folge steigender Verkehrsmengen und zunehmender Streckenbelastungen - kaum dazu geeignet ist, den Verkehrsfluss im Straßennetz insgesamt zu verbessern, die Erreichbarkeit im Wirtschaftsverkehr zu erhöhen oder negative Umweltwirkungen abzubauen. Nur modale Verlagerungen sind im Grundsatz geeignet, Defizite im Verkehrsablauf des Kfz-Verkehrs flächenhaft zu reduzieren.

## 3.4.4 Entwicklung Kraftstoffverbrauch und CO₂-Emissionen

Aus den Veränderungen der Verkehrsleistungen im Kfz-Verkehr im Stadtgebiet Dresden kann auf die Reduktion des Kraftstoffverbrauchs und der CO₂-Emissionen geschlossen werden. Die in Ansatz gebrachten Verbrauchs- und Emissionsfaktoren können bis zum Prognosejahr 2025 dem Handbuch für Emissionsfaktoren des Straßenverkehrs (HBEFA, Version 3.1) entnommen werden. Die Wirkungen resultieren einerseits aus der im Szenariofall erwarteten Entwicklung der Verkehrsleistung, andererseits aus der erwarteten rückläufigen Entwicklung der spezifischen Emissionen der Fahrzeuge (gerechnet über den gesamten Flottenbestand).

Vor diesem Hintergrund ist erklärbar, dass der Kraftstoffverbrauch in Szenario A trotz höherer Verkehrsleistung im Vergleich zum Status quo (2010) leicht sinkt (vgl. Grafik 21). Im Szenario C würden der Ausbau des Umweltverbundes, Elektromobilität, Kostensteigerungen für fossile Energieträger, eine noch effizientere Fahrzeugflotte und verstärkte Nahmobilität dazu führen, dass sich der Kraftstoffverbrauch im Vergleich zum Jahr 2010 fast halbiert.

Die sinkenden Kraftstoffverbräuche gehen einher mit einer Verringerung der $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Emission des Kfz-Verkehrs. Gemäß der Selbstverpflichtung der Klimabündnisstädte, zu denen auch Dresden gehört, soll eine Reduzierung der $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Emissionen über alle Emissionsbereiche (u. a. auch Kfz-Verkehr) um jeweils $10\%$ innerhalb eines 5-Jahreszeitraum erfolgen, und zwar fortlaufend bis zum Jahr 2030. Für den Zeitraum von 2010 bis 2025, der etwa der Laufzeit des VEP entspricht, bedeutet dies eine $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Reduktion aus dem Kfz-Verkehr um ca. $30\%$. Die in den einzelnen Szenarien erreichbaren Werte von $6\%$ bis zu $33\%$ $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Reduktion sind in Grafik 22 dargestellt. Die ausgewiesenen Veränderungen ergeben sich ausschließlich durch den Kfz-Verkehr. Entwicklungen im Bereich ÖPNV, etwa infolge eines verstärkten Einsatzes von Hybridfahrzeugen, konnten dabei ebenso wenig berücksichtigt werden, wie die Wirkungen aus einer verstärkten Elektromobilität. Bemerkenswert ist, dass allein die angenommenen technischen und demografischen Entwicklungen in Dresden einen Rückgang der $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Emissionen um ca. $16\%$ bis zum Jahr 2025 bewirken.

# 3.4.5 Entwicklung Investitionskosten und Kosten für Bestandserhalt

Die Auswahl verfolgenswerter Maßnahmenansätze soll – soweit es im gegenwärtigen Planungsstadium möglich ist – auch Kostengesichtspunkte berücksichtigen. Um die voraussichtlichen Maßnahmenkosten in die Wirkungsbewertung mit einzubinden, sind Kostenschätzungen durchgeführt worden. Datenquellen dafür sind u. a.

Kostenberechnungen/ Schätzungen aus bereits vorliegenden Planungen,
Zuarbeiten von Ämtern und anderen Beteiligten (Stadtverwaltung, VVO, DVB, LASuV u. a.),
Einschätzungen auf Basis von Analogiebetrachtungen.

Die Kostenschätzungen beziehen sich sowohl auf die voraussichtlichen Investitionen (inkl. Fördermittel) als auch auf Betriebskosten und evtl. Folgekosten. Ggf. zu erwartende Fördermittel Dritter (Bund, Freistaat etc.) werden ebenfalls eingeschätzt, jedoch bei der Maßnahmenbewertung zunächst nicht berücksichtigt, um die Gesamtkosten realistisch abzubilden. Die Investitionskosten werden deshalb weiter klassifiziert nach:

kommunale Investitionen in das Verkehrssystem der Landeshauptstadt Dresden,
Fördermittel für Verkehrsinvestitionen der Landeshauptstadt Dresden,
private Investitionen durch Unternehmen/ Betreiber,
Verkehrsinvestitionen durch Bund, Freistaat/ VVO, DB AG.

Grafik 23 zeigt die je nach Szenario bis zum Jahr 2025 etwa zu erwartenden Investitionskosten, differenziert nach den vorgenannten Kostenklassen. Allein die bereits in Bau befindlichen Maßnahmen (P0) erfordern Investitionen in Höhe von ca. 355 Mio. €, entsprechend ca. 27 Mio. €/ Jahr. Die ebenfalls ausgewiesenen Investitionskosten für Maßnahmen des Luftreinhalteplans (LRP) beinhalten dabei nur die Maßnahmenansätze, die auch maßgeblich den Zielen der Luftreinhaltung dienen.

Werden bis 2025 zusätzlich alle Maßnahmen realisiert, die vom Stadtrat seit 2003 mit Beschluss unterlegt sind oder von Bund bzw. Freistaat Sachsen als bis 2025 realisierbar eingeschätzt werden (P Sowieso), fallen weitere Investitionen in Höhe von ca. 535 Mio. € an (ca. 41 Mio. €/ Jahr).

Die Realisierung aller Maßnahmenansätze in Szenario A würde zusätzliche Investitionen in Höhe von ca. 295 Mio. € (inkl. Fördermittel, entspricht ca. 23 Mio. €/ Jahr) bedeuten. Szenario B bzw. Szenario C wären mit zusätzlichen Investitionen in Höhe von ca. 350 Mio. € (inkl. Fördermittel in Höhe von ca. 27 Mio. €/ Jahr) verbunden, jeweils zusätzlich zur Realisierung aller P0- und Sowie-so-Maßnahmen. Der Kostenunterschied der Szenarien A und B/ C ist vergleichsweise gering, wobei im Szenario A für die Stadt Dresden etwas höhere kommunale Investitionen anfallen als in

den Szenarien B und C (150,7 Mio. € in Szenario A zu 142,9 Mio. € in Szenarien B/ C). Im Szenario B und C dagegen wurden verstärkt externe Verkehrsinvestitionen entstehen.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Grafik 23: Geschätzte Investitionskosten je Szenario in Mio. Euro (die Investitionskosten in LRP-Maßnahmen dienen auch den Zielen des Luftreinhalteplans)

Im weitestgehenden Fall (Szenario B bzw. C inkl. aller P0- und Sowieso-Maßnahmen) fielen in Dresden bis zum Jahr 2025 Investitionskosten in Höhe von 1.240 Mio. € an (ca. 95 Mio. €/ Jahr). Zum Vergleich: in den letzten 10 Jahren wurden im Zuge von kommunalen Um-, Aus- und Neubaumaßnahmen ca. 1.255 Mio. € (ca. 125 Mio. €/ Jahr) in das Dresdner Verkehrssystem investiert. Dies sind ca. 250 € pro Person und Jahr. Die kostenintensivsten Maßnahmen sind der S-Bahn-Ausbau, die Waldschlößchenbrücke sowie der Bau der S 177.

Bei allen Szenarien wird vorausgesetzt, dass die Verkehrsinfrastruktur im Jahr 2025 mindestens die heutige Qualität aufweist (Priorität des Bestandserhalts). Nur so sind die positiven Maßnahmenwirkungen erreichbar. Grafik 24 zeigt, welche jährlichen Kosten für den Erhalt des Verkehrssystems nach derzeitiger Schätzung auf die Stadt Dresden zukommen. Dabei wird wiederum deutlich, dass die Maßnahmenansätze der Szenarien nur eine geringe Auswirkung auf die Kosten für den Bestandserhalt haben.

Die ebenfalls ausgewiesenen Kosten für den Bestandserhalt von Maßnahmen aus der Luftreinhaltung zeigen, dass der Großteil der Maßnahmenansätze auch den Zielen der Luftreinhaltung dient.

Grafik 24: Jährliche Kosten für den Bestandserhalt je Szenario in Mio. Euro

Der Bestandserhalt der vorhandenen Infrastruktur sowie der zzt. in Bau befindlichen Maßnahmen kostet die Stadt Dresden jährlich ca. 135 Mio. €. Allein das Straßennetz erfordert jährlich ca. 50 Mio. €, um die Straßen, Brücken und Steuerungssysteme zu erhalten. Der Großteil der jährlichen Kosten ist auch im Sinne der Luftreinhaltung erforderlich, denn nur ein funktionierendes Straßennetz sorgt für einen stetigen Verkehrsablauf, der durch einen leistungsfähigen ÖPNV gerade unter den Bedingungen steigender Einwohnerzahlen unterstützt wird.

Der Bestandserhalt der Maßnahmenansätze der Szenarien A bzw. B/ C erfordert demgegenüber lediglich ca. 3 – 12 Mio. € jährlich, entsprechend etwa 2 % bis 8 % der Gesamtkosten des Bestandserhalts in der Stadt Dresden.

Die hier mit Kosten bewerteten Szenarien beschreiben noch nicht die endgültigen Maßnahmen des VEP. Nach Auswahl des Vorzugszenarios und einer entsprechenden Bewertung aller damit verbundenen Maßnahmenansätze (siehe Kapitel 4ff) werden diejenigen Maßnahmenansätze herausgearbeitet, deren verkehrliche Wirkungen unter Beachtung der Kosten die Leitziele möglichst ausgewogen erfüllen. Die ausgewählten Maßnahmenansätze werden anschließend in das Handlungskonzept überführt. Dabei werden einzelne Maßnahmenansätze und ihre Kosten bei Bedarf nochmals abgeglichen und ggf. angepasst.

# 3.4.6 Auswahl Vorzugsszenario

Die Auswahl eines Vorzugsszenarios muss sich an der Erfüllung der Leitziele des Stadtrates zur zukünftigen Verkehrsentwicklung ausrichten. Gleichzeitig soll die Ausgewogenheit zwischen den Verkehrsträgern gewährleistet werden und die Umsetzung der jeweiligen Maßnahmenansätze nicht unrealistisch sein.

Als quantifizierbare und operationalisierbare Kriterien, die die Leitziele möglichst umfassend abbilden, wurden die folgenden Zielwerte abgestimmt und genutzt:

Der Anteil des Umweltverbundes am Verkehrsaufkommen in Dresden soll im Jahr 2025 größer sein als derzeit 59 %.
Die Streckenbelastungen im Dresdner Straßennetz sollen gegenüber dem Status quo (Analyse 2010) sinken.
Die Kfz-Verkehrsleistung in Dresden soll im Jahr 2025 unterhalb der des Prognose-Nullfalls liegen.
Der Kfz-Verkehr im Gebiet des 26er Rings soll bis zum Jahr 2025 um 5 % gegenüber dem Prognose-Nullfall abnehmen,
Die CO₂-Emissionen des Kfz-Verkehrs sollen bis zum Jahr 2025 gegenüber dem Status quo (Analyse 2010) um 30 % zurückgehen.

Die zuvor dokumentierten Szenarienwirkungen erlauben eine Bewertung der Szenarien in Bezug auf die zentralen Anforderungen der Leitziele. Das Bewertungsergebnis zeigt Grafik 25.

|   | Kriterium/ Ziel | Sowieso | Szenario A | Szenario B | Szenario C  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  1 | Modal-Split-Anteil des Umweltverbundes am Verkehrsaufkommen in Dresden >=59 % | + (60,7%) | + (60,0%) | ++ (63,2%) | ++ (66,6%)  |
|  2 | Sinkende Streckenbelastungen Straßennetz gegenüber Analysefall | + (-7,5%) | -- (+2,6%) | + (-4,8%) | ++ (-13,3%)  |
|  3 | Verringerung Kfz-Verkehrsleistung in Dresden 2025 gegenüber Prognose-Nullfall | 0 (-0,3%) | -- (+12,5%) | ++ (-4,9%) | ++ (-7,2%)  |
|  4 | Verringerung Kfz-Verkehr auf und im 26er Ring um 5 % gegenüber Prognose-Nullfall | + (-3,1%) | -- (+4,3%) | + (-1,7%) | ++ (-7,5%)  |
|  5 | 30% weniger CO₂ zwischen 2010 und 2025 gegenüber Analysefall | + (-16,8%) | -- (-6,1%) | + (-17,4%) | ++ (-33,1%)  |
|   |  | die meisten Ziele erreicht | die meisten Ziele verfehlt | alle Ziele erreicht | alle Ziele voll erreicht  |

Es wird deutlich, dass nur Szenario C alle Kriterien voll erfüllt. Der hier unterstellte Verhaltenswandel ist jedoch nur begrenzt durch die Stadt Dresden zu beeinflussen. Szenario C kommt deshalb der Forderung nach Umsetzbarkeit nur eingeschränkt nach.

Während Szenario A die meisten Leitziele verfehlt, weisen die Szenarien B und „Sowieso“ z.T. deutliche positive Tendenzen auf. Da Szenario B maßnahmeneseitig mit Szenario C identisch ist, wurde durch den Ausschuss für Stadtentwicklung und Bau im September 2012 beschlossen, Szenario B als Grundlage für die weiteren Überlegungen auszuwählen und um einzelne Maßnahmenansätze aus Szenario A („das Beste aus A“) sowie um ausgewählte, kommunal beeinflussbare Verhaltensansätze aus Szenario C („das Machbare aus C“) zu ergänzen. Das Vorzugsszenario umfasst damit insgesamt 147 Maßnahmen- bzw. Verhaltensansätze.

Die Maßnahmenansätze des Vorzugsszenarios werden jedoch nicht automatisch zu Maßnahmen des VEP, sondern bilden zunächst nur die Grundlage der weiteren Bearbeitung. Jeder einzelne Maßnahmeansatz muss weiter konkretisiert und ausgestaltet sowie hinsichtlich seiner verkehrlichen Wirkungen und Kosten vergleichend bewertet werden. Darauf baut dann die Prioritätenreihung auf.

# 4. Maßnahmenbewertung und Prioritätenbildung

## 4.1 Bewertungsmethodik

Die Maßnahmenansätze des Vorzugsszenarios sind bzgl. Zielstellung, Wirksamkeit, räumlicher Betroffenheit und Kosten nicht gleichwertig. Um die letztendlich verfolgenswerten Maßnahmenansätze von den sensiblen bzw. kritischen Maßnahmenansätzen unterscheiden zu können, ist eine spezifische Bewertungsmethodik entwickelt worden. Diese muss auf einer qualitativen Basis aufsetzen, da modellgestützte, quantitative Bewertungen von Einzelmaßnahmen in diesem Planungsstadium nur sehr begrenzt vorliegen. Die Bewertungsmethodik muss zudem einen klaren Bezug zu den Leitzielen des VEP herstellen sowie möglichst objektiv und transparent ablaufen.

Damit die Leitziele des VEP bewertbar werden und der Zielerreichungsgrad der einzelnen Maßnahmenansätze eingeschätzt werden kann, werden aus den Leitzielen 12 qualitative Bewertungsindikatoren abgeleitet. Dies sind:

Sicherung bzw. Verbesserung der Erschließung und Erreichbarkeit städtischer Bereiche und Funktionen durch den Umweltverbund aus Fuß, Rad und ÖPNV,
Verbesserung der regionalen und überregionalen Erreichbarkeit im Bus- und Bahnverkehr sowie barrierefreier intra- und intermodalen Verknüpfungen (P+R, B+R, P+M),
Bündelung des Kfz-Verkehrs auf einem leistungsfähigen Hauptstraßennetz und damit Verkehrsentlastung und -beruhigung in verkehrlich und städtebaulich sensiblen Bereichen,
Sicherung bzw. Verbesserung der Erreichbarkeit im Kfz-Verkehr insbesondere für den Wirtschaftsverkehr durch die Sicherung der erforderlichen Verkehrsflussqualität auf für den Wirtschaftsverkehr geeigneten Strecken im Hauptnetz,
Förderung von Innentwicklung, Nahmobilität und „kurzen Wegen“ in den Stadt- und Orts- teilzentren unterstützt durch einheitliche Wegweisung und Information,
Verbesserung der Lebensqualität, Stadtgestalt und Aufenthaltsqualität in zentralen öffentlichen Räumen und im Wohnumfeld,
Erreichen der Ziele des Luftreinhalteplans durch Berücksichtigung der dort beschriebenen Maßnahmen im VEP (in den Leitzielen bislang nicht explizit berücksichtigt),
Berücksichtigung der lokalen Klimaziele und Verringerung des Primärenergieverbrauchs,
Besondere Förderung der eigenständigen und barrierefreien Mobilität auch von Kindern, Jugendlichen, Mobilitätseingeschränkten und alten Menschen sowie von einkommensschwachen Personen,
Verbesserung der Verkehrssicherheit,
Förderung innovativer, integrierter Verkehrslösungen und Technologien, u. a. Elektromobilität, Carsharing, qualitatives Verkehrsmanagement oder dynamische Verkehrssteuerung,

Förderung multimodaler, kooperativer Logistiketten/ Citylogistik.

Zur Klassifizierung der Zielerreichung wurde ein punktebasiertes Bewertungsraster aufgebaut. In dieses Raster ist jeder einzelne Maßnahmeansatz entsprechend seines Wirkungsbeitrags und seiner Betroffenheit eingestuft worden. Der Wirkungsbeitrag unterscheidet 4 Wirksamkeitsstufen (hoch = 3 Punkte, mittel = 2 Punkte, gering = 1 Punkt, keiner = 0 Punkte). Entsprechend ist der Wirkungsbeitrag jedes einzelnen Maßnahmeansatzes des Vorzugsszenarios bezogen auf jeden der 12 Bewertungsindikatoren nach der Delphi-Methode qualitativ ermittelt worden. Der Wirkungsbeitrag wurde anschließend mit der Betroffenheit faktoriell gewichtet (Betroffenheit groß, d. h. gesamtstädtische oder regionale Wirkung = Faktor 2,5; Betroffenheit mittel, d. h. stadtteilübergreifende Wirkung = Faktor 1,5; Betroffenheit klein, d.h. lokale/nahräumliche Wirkung = Faktor 1).

Das Bewertungsergebnis (Wirkungspunkte) ergibt sich als Produkt von Wirkungsbeitrag und Betroffenheit und wurde einer von 5 Wirkungsklassen (1 = schwach bis 5 = stark) zugeordnet. Die Klassengrenzen entsprechen in etwa einer 20 %-Quantilseinteilung (≤ 15 Punkte/ ≤20 Punkte/ ≤25 Punkte/ ≤ 30 Punkte/ &gt; 30 Wirkungspunkte).

Die Höhe der Investitionskosten entscheidet über die Zuordnung jedes Maßnahmeansatzes in eine von 5 Kostenklassen, die auf Basis der Kostenschätzungen (Kapitel 3.4.5) gebildet wurden:

Kostenklasse 1: ohne Investitionskosten („nur“ strategisches Handeln)
Kostenklasse 2: bis 1 Mio. €
Kostenklasse 3: bis 3 Mio. €
Kostenklasse 4: bis 6 Mio. €
Kostenklasse 5: &gt; 6 Mio. €

Die Verschneidung von Wirkungs- und Kostenklassen bildet die Kosten-Wirkungs-Matrix (vgl. Grafik 26).

Grafik 26: Kosten-Wirkungs-Matrix

Maßnahmenansätze mit geringer Wirkung, aber hohen Kosten werden als kritisch eingestuft. Prioritär sind hingegen Maßnahmenansätze mit hoher Wirkung und überschaubaren Kosten. Sensible und sinnvolle Maßnahmenansätze stellen Zwischenstufen dar.

## 4.2 Bewertungsergebnis

Bewertungsgegenstand sind 17 Sowieso-Maßnahmen, 116 Maßnahmen des Vorzugsszenarios B und 10 zusätzliche Maßnahmen des Szenarios A.

Die Sowieso-Maßnahmen sind in die Bewertung mit eingebracht worden um zu zeigen, ob und in welchem Umfang sie zu den Leitzielen des VEP beitragen. Das betrifft alle Maßnahmenansätze, die weder bereits in Bau sind noch als Voraussetzung für Szenario-B-Maßnahmen dienen. Diese sind per Definition nicht disponibel. 25 Maßnahmenansätze in Szenario B, die erforderliches Planungshandeln oder ein Hinwirken auf bestimmte Regelungen auf Bundesebene beschreiben, sind ebenso wenig bewertbar wie die Verhaltensansätze aus Szenario C. In die Bewertung können somit insgesamt 143 Maßnahmenansätze einbezogen werden.

Das Bewertungsergebnis für die Maßnahmenansätze aus Szenario B einschließlich der bewertungsrelevanten Sowieso-Maßnahmen zeigt Grafik 27. Danach sind 86 Maßnahmen (64 %) als priorär, 37 Maßnahmen (28 %) als sinnvoll, 5 Maßnahmen (4 %) als sensibel und ebenfalls 5 Maßnahmen (4 %) als kritisch einzustufen.

## 4.3 Erkenntnisse und Entscheidungen aus dem Bewertungsprozess

### 4.3.1 Erkenntnisse

Zusammenfassend zeigt sich, dass die gewählte Bewertungsmethodik konsistente und nachvollziehbare Ergebnisse liefert, und zwar sowohl für die Szenarien A und B als auch für die Sowieso-Maßnahmen. Jeder betrachtete Maßnahmeansatz wirkt zumindest auf einen Bewertungsindikator (abgeleitet aus den Leitzielen) und ist somit zumindest teilweise zielführend. Umgekehrt wird jeder Bewertungsindikator durch mindestens einen Maßnahmeansatz unterstützt. Auch Maßnahmenansätze, die im Sinne des Luftreinhalteplans wirken, werden ganz überwiegend mit „prioritär“ oder „sinnvoll“ bewertet.

Die relativ hohe Anzahl kritischer Szenario-A-Maßnahmen verdeutlicht, dass Szenario A zahlreiche Maßnahmenansätze enthält, die einige der vorgegebenen Leitziele nicht ausreichend unterstützen. Die Anzahl kritischer bzw. sensibler Szenario-B-Maßnahmen ist demgegenüber relativ gering. Damit wird deutlich, dass im Szenario B überwiegend sinnvolle und zielführende Maßnahmenansätze im Sinne der Leitziele hinterlegt sind. Gleiches gilt für die Sowieso-Maßnahmen.

Die insgesamt sehr geringe Zahl kritischer Maßnahmen (12 von insgesamt 143) erklärt sich dadurch, dass die in den Szenarienprozess eingespeisten Maßnahmenansätze den Leitzielen nicht deutlich entgegenstehen sollten. Deshalb überrascht es auch nicht, dass am Ende des Bewertungsprozesses nur ca. 9 % aller 143 Maßnahmenansätze als „kritisch“ und weitere 4 % als „sensibel“ eingestuft werden. 87 % der genutzten Maßnahmenansätze konnten als „sinnvoll“ oder „prioritär“ eingestuft werden.

### 4.3.2 Umgang mit den als „prioritär“ oder „sinnvoll“ bewerteten Maßnahmenansätzen

Auf der Grundlage der Erkenntnisse der Maßnahmenbewertung wurde in Abstimmung mit dem wissenschaftlichen Beirat entschieden, alle als prioritär oder sinnvoll erkannten Maßnahmenansätze als Maßnahmen des VEP zu übernehmen. Dies bezieht sich ganz überwiegend auf die Maßnahmenansätze des Vorzugsszenarios B mit 123 so bewerteten Maßnahmen. Maßnahmen, die als Bestandteile des Szenarios A oder B als „sensibel“ oder „kritisch“ eingestuft wurden, sollen nochmals in einem iterativen Prozess geprüft werden (siehe Folgekapitel 4.3.3)

Neben den 123 Szenario-B-Maßnahmen werden damit auch vier als „sinnvoll“ bewertete Maßnahmenansätze aus Szenario A in den VEP übernommen. Im Rahmen einer detaillierten Bewertung konnte für diese Maßnahmen eine ausreichende Sinnfälligkeit und Passgenauigkeit zu den Leitzielen des VEP abgeleitet werden. Dabei handelt es sich um folgende Maßnahmenansätze:

W

WBS

Die Durchbindung Liebstädter Straße bis Reicker Straße und Dohnaer Straße sowie Anbindung der Tiergartenstraße an die Liebstädter Straße (Verbindung bis Oskar-Röder-Straße erst in 2. Stufe nach 2025) (Nr. 32)⁶,
Den Neubau der AS Weixdorf mit Anbindung GE Promigberg (Nr. 51),
Den Bau der Querspange Sporbitz (Nr. 55) und
Die zweistreifige Durchbindung Fröbelstraße bis Rosenstraße (Nr. 31, Aufstufung durch AG).

Die Annahme eines „5-Minuten-Taktes bei wichtigen Stadtbahnlinien“ (Nr. 66 in Anlage 5) wurde positiv (prioritär, A++) und mit Kostenklasse 1 bewertet. Dabei wurde die Kostenneutralität neuer Angebote (Nachfragesteigerung deckt Zusatzkosten) unterstellt, getragen von dem Verständnis, die Angebotsverdichtung auf nachfragestarke Zeiten und nachfragestarke Linien zu beschränken. Dieser Maßnahmenansatz ergibt sich aus dem Leitziel, die Angebote im ÖPNV und besonders das Stadtbahn-/Straßenbahnangebot zu verbessern. Als Alternative zur Takt-/ Angebotsverdichtung bieten sich ggf. auch andere kapazitätserhöhende Elemente wie Anpassungen von Fahrzeuggröße und Linienwegen an (siehe auch Nr. 41 in Anlage 6.1 sowie Kapitel 6.6.5). Eine eindeutige Kostenklasse kann den Alternativen aber nicht mehr zugeordnet werden. Aus gleichem Grund wird Maßnahme 44 (stark rabattierte Tickets für bestimmte Nutzergruppen) in Anlage 6.1 ohne Kostenklasse ausgewiesen.

Im Rahmen einer Ausgewogenheitsprüfung konnte zudem nachgewiesen werden, dass die prioritären oder sinnvollen Maßnahmenansätze:

sämtliche Bewertungsindikatoren ansprechen und damit die Leitziele des VEP voll erfüllen,
regionalen Verpflichtungen, Zusagen oder Kooperationen nicht entgegenstehen,
die sektorale und modale Integration („Verkehrsträgergerechtigkeit“) unterstützen,
die Rolle des Wirtschaftsverkehrs stärken,
positive Umweltwirkungen auslösen, beispielsweise im Bereich der Luftreinhaltung,
das Gebot der Geschlechtergerechtigkeit und Partizipation beachten.

Diese Maßnahmen werden einer Prioritätenreihung unterzogen (siehe Kapitel 4.4). Anschließend werden sie in den Teilen C (Mobilitätsstrategie) und D (Handlungskonzept) vertieft beschrieben und weiter ausgeformt.

## 4.3.3 Umgang mit den als „sensibel“ oder „kritisch“ bewerteten Maßnahmenansätzen

Die als „sensibel“ oder als „kritisch“ bewerteten Maßnahmenansätze aus den Szenarien A und B wurden vor einer abschließenden Entscheidung hinsichtlich weiterer Mitführung oder Ausscheiden aus dem VEP-Prozess einer nochmaligen Prüfung unterzogen. Da auch diese Maßnahmenansätze in den VEP-Prozess eingebracht wurden, um bestimmte verkehrliche Leitziele zu erfüllen oder erkannte Defizite zu beheben, soll in einem iterativen Prozess geprüft werden, ob das Bewertungsergebnis stabil ist oder ggf. andere Gründe (z. B. als Maßnahme mittlerweile umgesetzt) für das formale Ausscheiden bestimmter Maßnahmen im Zuge des Bewertungsprozesses verantwortlich sind.

Im Rahmen einer solchen Sensitivitätsanalyse kann beispielsweise durch Variation der Kosten die Stabilität des Bewertungsergebnisses auf Basis der bestehenden Bewertungsmethodik geprüft werden. Dieser Ansatz ermöglicht eine differenziertere Bewertung der einzelnen Maßnahmen durch folgende Spezifizierung:

Maßnahme als Bestandserhalt in den VEP übernehmen,
Maßnahme als konzeptionellen Ansatz in den VEP übernehmen,
Maßnahme mit verringertem Aufwand in den VEP übernehmen oder
Maßnahme als Langfristoption in den VEP übernehmen.

Im Ergebnis wurden folgende Maßnahmen als **Bestandserhalt** und damit nicht als direkte VEP-Maßnahme eingestuft:

Zweistreifiger Ausbau B 172 zwischen Erich-Kästner-Straße und AS Heidenau (Nr. 44),
Zweistreifiger Ausbau der Bautzner Straße zwischen Martin-Luther-Straße und Radeberger Straße (Nr. 45).

Da eine konkrete lokale Ausformung nicht möglich ist, werden folgende Maßnahmen weitgehend ohne Kostensansatz als **konzeptioneller Ansatz** berücksichtigt:

Verdichtung der Anbindung des Elberad-/ Gehweges an das Straßen- und Wegenetz (Nr. 82),
Vermeidung gemeinsamer Geh- und Radwege nach Z 240 (Nr. 84),
zusätzliche Maßnahmen auf Basis der umfangreichen fachlichen und kommunalpolitischen Diskussionsprozesse zwischen Oktober 2011 und Oktober 2012

Flächenvorhaltung für die Anbindung der Fabrikstraße an die Rampen der Nossener Brücke ggf. mit Anpassung des B-Plans 101 bzgl. des Ausbaus der Hofmühlenstraße,

Flächenvorhaltung für eine Verbindungsspange zwischen Lohmener Straße und Söbrigener Straße östlich der Dampfschiffstraße
Aufnahme der mit Stadtratsbeschluss gesicherten Trassenoptionen für die Stadtbahn als Flächenvorhaltung in den VEP,
Berücksichtigung von Ansätze zu „Radschnellwegen“ im Radverkehrskonzept,
Fragen zur Rolle der Radverkehrsverantwortung in der Verwaltung sowie
langfristige Betrachtung von Ansätzen postfossiler Mobilität in einem regionalen und integrierten Konzept.

Mit geringerem baulichen Aufwand können folgende Maßnahmen als „sinnvoll“ und damit als Maßnahme des VEP eingestuft werden:

Fußgängerquerung Albertstraße Höhe Archivplatz/ Ritterstraße mit Rückbau der Brücke aber ohne die bisher berücksichtigte Anpassung von Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn-Haltestellen (Maßnahme wichtig, da erkanntes verkehrlich-stadträumliches Defizit, die ÖPNV-Erreichbarkeit in diesem Bereich ist auch im Bestand voll gegeben) (Nr. 88),
Einrichtung eines Fern- und Regionalbusbahnhofs am Hauptbahnhof (ZOB) (Nr. 58) wenn er in einer ersten Stufe ohne hochbauliche Anlagen umsetzbar ist (Maßnahme wichtig, da die Bedeutung des Fernbusverkehrs kurzfristig deutlich steigen wird).

Wegen fehlender Realisierungschancen bis 2025 oder ungünstiger Bewertung bei gleichzeitig hoher Bedeutung bei einer dynamischen Stadtentwicklung werden folgende Maßnahmen als Langfristoption in der Flächenvorhaltung bzw. als Planungsansatz berücksichtigt:

Umweltbrücke Ostragehege mit Fuß, Rad und ÖPNV (Nr. 33),
Ausbau des Straßenzuges Zwickauer Straße – Hahnebergstraße und Durchbindung Bayerische Straße bis Rosenstraße (Nr. 46),
Rad- und Fußgängerquerung an der Westseite des Hauptbahnhofs (Nr. 102),
Zweistreifige Durchbindung Spenerstraße als Stadtstraße (Nr. 48), wenn dies die Nachher-Untersuchungen zur Waldschlößchenbrücke und eine Abwägung städtebaulicher, verkehrlicher, baurechtlicher und umweltseitiger Aspekte dies als sinnvoll erscheinen lassen,
Vierstreifiger Ausbau der B 172 zwischen Erich-Kästner-Straße und AS Heidenau (Nr. 49),
Niveaufreier Knotenpunkt Stauffenbergallee/ Königsbrücker Straße in Nord-Ost-Relation (Nr. 50),
Zweistreifige Durchbindung Bosewitzer Straße bis Pirnaer Landstraße als zweistreifige Stadtstraße (Nr. 53),
Verbesserte Anbindung Radebeuls an die A 4 (derzeit keine Trasse bekannt)

Auch diesen Maßnahmen werden in einem weiteren Schritt Prioritäten zugeordnet (siehe Kapitel 4.4). Anschließend werden sie in den Teilen C (Mobilitätsstrategie) und D (Handlungskonzept) vertieft beschrieben und ggf. weiter ausgeformt.

Wenn die Sensitivitätsanalyse der als sensibel oder kritisch bewerteten Maßnahmenansätze nicht zu neuen Erkenntnissen führt oder andere wichtige Gründe dagegen sprechen, müssen diese Maßnahmen aus dem VEP entfallen.

Folgende Maßnahmen werden aus formalen Gründen im Rahmen des VEP nicht weiter verfolgt:

Beschränkung von Lkw über 3,5 t zul. Gesamtgewicht in den wesentlichen Siedlungsbereichen der Stadt (Nr. 18), da dies bereits umgesetzt wurde,
Einige im Verkehrskonzept 2003 berücksichtigte Staatsstraßenmaßnahmen, insbesondere der Ausbau der S 58 im Bereich Marsdorf (Nr. 13), da dieser nicht mehr im Landesverkehrsplan 2025 enthalten ist,
Dosierung von Kfz-Verkehr auf der Naumannstraße, da die Verkehrswirksamkeit der Waldschlößchenbrücke das Rückstauproblem dort lösen kann (Nr. 13, siehe auch Kapitel 6.9.2),
Anpassung der Parkgebühren (Nr. 115), da diese bereits durch Nr. 108 berücksichtigt wurde,
Winterdienst auf allen Nebenstraßen im Sinne des Radverkehrs (Nr. 106), da dieser in Nr. 97 integriert ist und im Rahmen der Kostenschätzungen für Räumen, Streuen und den Abtransport des Schnees im Nebennetz Kosten in nicht-vermittelbarer Höhe entstehen,
Die Fuß- und Radbrücke Ostragehege (Nr. 103), da sie in Nr. 33 als „Umweltbrücke“ aufgegangen ist,
Die Sanierung der Bahnstrecke nach Königsbrück, da im Szenario B der Umbau als Stadtbahntrasse vorgesehen ist (Nr. 73a) und eine Sanierung so nicht sinnvoll ist,
Der Personenlift an der Brücke Budapester Straße (Nr. 89), da hier eine Umsetzung in einem anderen planerischen Zusammenhang sinnvoller ist und der Maßnahmenumfang an der Grenze zur VEP-Relevanz liegt,
Realisierung des Grünzugs „Promenadenring“ (Großer Garten – Waisenhausstraße – Marienstraße, Nr. 135), da die Einbeziehung dieser stadtgestalterisch wichtigen aber verkehrlich kaum relevanten Maßnahme in den VEP nicht zweckmäßig war.

Drei Maßnahmen entfallen durch nicht erkennbare verkehrliche Nutzen und erkanntes, hohes Konfliktpotenzial. Sie können damit weder in veränderter Form noch als Flächenvorhaltung berücksichtigt werden:

Elbbrücke bei Niederpoyritz als Ergänzungsstandort Blaues Wunder (Nr. 30),
Durchbindung der Passauer Straße zwischen Nöthnitzer Straße und Westendring (Nr. 52),
Tieferlegung der Großen Meißner Straße am Neustädter Markt (Nr. 35, siehe dazu auch Kapitel 6.9.2), die im Rahmen der Beteiligung zum Facharbeitspapier „Frühzeitige Diskussion zu zentralen Maßnahmenansätzen des VEP“ vom 20.10.2011 verworfen wurde.

## 4.4 Prioritätenreihung der Maßnahmen im VEP-Entwurf

Auf Basis der im Vorkapitel dargestellten Anpassungen wurden nun die Maßnahmenansätze zu Maßnahmen des VEP überführt und dabei differenzierter ausgeformt, priorisiert, miteinander kombiniert und beschrieben. Der VEP bezieht sich damit nun auf insgesamt 150 Maßnahmen, von denen 7 Maßnahmen bereits in Umsetzung befindliche Projekte sowie 1 Maßnahme eine als kritisch bewertete Sowieso-Maßnahme (vierstreifiger Ausbau Königsbrücker Straße) betreffen.

Für alle noch nicht im Bau befindlichen 142 Maßnahmenansätze (inkl. der kritischen Sowieso-Maßnahme) wurden die damit verbundenen Kosten (siehe Kostenkapitel 5.5) auf diese neue Konstellation angepasst.

Um den als sinnvoll oder prioritär erkannten Maßnahmen des VEP eine Prioritätenreihung zu hinterlegen, soll die bestehende Differenzierung der Kosten-Wirkungs-Matrix (siehe Grafik 26 in Kapitel 4.1) aufgegriffen und weiterentwickelt werden.

Wie Grafik 31 zeigt, ist die Einstufung in 3 Kategorien prioritärer Maßnahmen (bis A++) sowie 4 Kategorien sinnvoller Maßnahmen (bis B++ sowie C) möglich.

oben rechts: ursprüngliche undifferenzierte Kosten-Wirkungs-Matrix, entspricht Grafik 26

In der Verbindung mit den Bewertungen „sinnvoll“ und „prioritär“ entstehen auf diese Weise 7 Prioritätsstufen, und zwar in der Reihenfolge ihrer Bedeutung:

Prioritätsstufe A++
Prioritätsstufe A+
Prioritätsstufe A
Prioritätsstufe B++
Prioritätsstufe B+
Prioritätsstufe B
Prioritätsstufe C.

In einer entsprechenden tabellarischen Übersicht aller Maßnahmen des VEP-Entwurfes (siehe Anlage 6.1) werden neben der Prioritätsstufe auch:

der Themenbereich im Bericht
die Kostenklasse
die Verantwortlichkeit sowie
ein erster Vorschlag für die zeitliche Einordnung

angegeben.

Die genannten zeitlichen Maßstäbe für Maßnahmen im Handlungskonzept orientieren sich am heutigen Erkenntnisstand und zeigen dort, wo es möglich ist, konkrete zeitliche Empfehlungen im Kurz- und Mittelfristhorizont bis 2016 auf. Wenn keine Informationen vorliegen, wird die Einordnung als mittelfristig (bis 2020) und langfristig (2020 – 2025, ggf. auch später) vorgenommen. Daueraufgaben und Flächenvorhaltungen werden separat ausgewiesen.

Eine Differenzierung innerhalb der Prioritätenstufen erfolgt nicht. In der tabellarischen Darstellung in Anlage 6.1 wurde nach Prioritätenstufe, Themenbereich und zuletzt Kostenklasse sortiert.

Am Ende des Diskussionsprozesses der VEP-Maßnahmen soll ein neues Szenario berechnet werden, das dann als Szenario VEP 2025plus bezeichnet wird. Da Beschlusslagen berücksichtigt werden, sind die Sowieso-Maßnahmen unabhängig von ihrem Bewertungsergebnis stets Maßnahmen des VEP. Dies ist lediglich für den bisher geplanten Ausbaustandard für die Königsbrücker Straße problematisch, da dieser als kritisch bewertet wurde (und somit auch nicht priorisiert wird). Die Option eines bestandsnahen Ausbaus besteht ebenfalls und wird derzeit geprüft.

Die jeweiligen Ausformungen zu den Maßnahmen sind im Teil Strategie oder Handlungskonzept (bei Straßenmaßnahmen insbesondere im Kapitel 6.4.2) beschrieben.

## 4.5 Prioritätenreihung der Maßnahmen nach Beschlussfassung des VEP

Der Stadtrat der Landeshauptstadt Dresden hat in seinem Beschluss zum VEP festgelegt, dass entgegen dem VEP-Entwurf bestimmte Prioritäten nicht von Kosten abhängig sind (Beschlusspunkt 1a zur Vorlage V2476/13).

Insbesondere sollen Maßnahmen mit sehr hoher Relevanz für die Erreichung der Ziele der Verkehrsentwicklung auch bei Kosten von mehr als 1 Million Euro die höchste Priorität erhalten. Damit erhalten alle Maßnahmen der Wirkungsklassen 4 und 5 auch bei Kostenklasse IV und V (also über 1 Million Euro) die Priorität A+ bzw. A++. Sie fallen damit nicht mehr unter „sinnvoll“ sondern unter den Bereich „prioritär“. Die Prioritäten B+ und B++ entfallen damit.

Entsprechend stellt sich die neue Matrix zur Einstufung der Maßnahmen nach Prioritäten wie folgt dar:

In Anlage 6.2 werden die entsprechend geänderten Prioritäten aufgeführt. Folgende Änderungen ergeben sich durch die so angepasste Methodik:

Von der Kategorie B++ zur Kategorie A++ werden sechs Sowieso-Maßnahmen und eine weitere Maßnahme aufgestuft:

Umgestaltung und Sanierung der Albertbrücke,

# 5. Mobilitätsstrategie 2025plus

## 5.1 Vorbemerkungen

Wie bereits einleitend beschrieben, enthält die Mobilitätsstrategie 2025plus des VEP Dresden:

spezifisch Dresden betreffende, strategische Entwicklungsprinzipien auch über den Horizont 2025 hinaus,
Strategien zur Bestandssicherung für die bestehenden Verkehrsnetze,
Anforderungen an die Fortschreibung und Vertiefung von den VEP ergänzenden Konzepten,
Ansätze zur Verbesserung der Verkehrssicherheit,
wichtige Prinzipien des Verwaltungshandelns insbesondere in der Bauleitplanung,
zu vertiefende Planungsansätze und weiteren Untersuchungsbedarf,
Angaben zu notwendigen Flächenfreihaltungen und zu langfristigen Entwicklungsoptionen der Infrastruktur sowie
Ansätze für Monitoring und Evaluation des VEP.

Dabei wird stets davon ausgegangen, dass das bestehende Straßennetz sowie die Angebote des ÖPNV (Zug, S-Bahn, Stadtbahn, Stadt- und Regionalbus, Fähren) mit heutiger Qualität weiterbetrieben werden können, was unter den derzeitigen finanziellen Bedingungen bei einer gleichzeitig wachsenden Stadt bereits eine große Herausforderung darstellt. Die notwendigen Sanierungen zum Bestandserhalt müssen deshalb regelgerecht durchgeführt werden. Die Bewertung entsprechender Sanierungsplanungen der Fachämter, der DVB oder der DB Netz AG sind nicht Gegenstand des Verkehrsentwicklungsplans. Vielmehr bildet das Prinzip des langfristigen Bestandserhalts von Infrastruktur und Verkehrsangebot die Grundlage für Mobilitätsstrategie und Handlungskonzept des VEP 2025plus.

Mobilitätsstrategie und Handlungskonzept liegen weiterhin kommunale Strukturdatenprognosen zu Grunde, wie sie bereits in Kap. 2.4 beschrieben wurden.

Eine Übersicht wichtiger Maßnahmen, die auch die Mobilitätsstrategie betreffen, liegt dem Dokument tabellarisch als Anlage 6.2 bei.

# 5.2 Verkehrliche Entwicklungsprinzipien und Dresdner Mobilitätsstrategie

Die 2007 erarbeitete „Dresdner Mobilitätsstrategie“ soll im Rahmen des VEP Dresden 2025plus als strategische Grundlage und inhaltlicher Leitfaden der Verkehrsentwicklung fortgeschrieben werden. Mit dem Stadtratsbeschluss zu den „Leitzielen der Dresdner Verkehrsentwicklung“ am 24.03.2011 wurde die bestehende Mobilitätsstrategie bereits weiter ausgeformt. Diese Leitziele müssen gemeinsam mit den Anforderungen der integrierten Stadtentwicklungsplanung in die Dresdner Mobilitätsstrategie eingebunden werden.

Grundlage dafür ist der Ansatz „Vermeiden-Verlagern-Verbessern“. In diesem Sinne haben verkehrsvermeidende Stadtstrukturen - wo immer möglich - die höchste Priorität. Der so nicht vermeidbare Verkehr soll dann auf das geeignete und umweltschonendste Verkehrsmittel verlagert werden um letztlich den Transportprozess auf einem möglichst effizienten und stadtverträglichen Weg durchzuführen.

Dieser Grundlage ist auch die Dresdner Mobilitätsstrategie verpflichtet, die aus den nachfolgend dargestellten vier Bausteinen (siehe Grafik 33) besteht:

|  Stadtentwicklung und Verkehr | Verkehrs-infrastruktur  |
| --- | --- |
|  Verkehrs-management | Mobilitäts-management  |

Grafik 33: Die vier Bausteine der Dresdner Mobilitätsstrategie

Diesen 4 Bausteinen lassen sich die einzelnen Entwicklungsprinzipien der Dresdner Mobilität zuordnen:

## Baustein 1: Stadtentwicklung und Verkehr

### Verkehr dient der Stadtentwicklung in all ihren Belangen

Den verkehrlichen Wirkungen (die ggf. auch negativ sein können) sowie den teils hohen Kosten für Infrastruktur und Angebote muss immer ein adäquater wirtschaftlicher, sozialer, kultureller oder allgemeiner Nutzen der Erreichbarkeit gegenüber stehen. Ohne die Sicherung städtischer Funktionen – und hier insbesondere der wirtschaftlichen Grundlagen – ist eine Stadt nicht zukunftsfähig und verliert an Attraktivität.

# Kurze Wege und gute Funktionsmischung in den Wohnquartieren

Die Berücksichtigung des Mischungsprinzips sichert langfristig auch bei steigenden Energiepreisen eine preiswerte und sozial gerechte Mobilität aller und vermindert negative verkehrliche Wirkungen sowie Infrastrukturkosten.

# Innen- vor Außenentwicklung bei hoher Stadtqualität

Die intensive Nutzung integrierter, gut erschlossener Lagen mit urbaner Dichte sichert städtische Qualität, wirtschaftliche Entwicklung und spart gleichzeitig Kosten. Das ist nur möglich, wenn zentrale, innere Standorte insbesondere emissionsarm und per ÖPNV, Rad- und Fußverkehr erreichbar sind.

# Hohe Qualität des öffentlichen Raumes und Einbindung der Verkehrsfunktionen

Die Attraktivität zentraler Strukturen ist dann hoch, wenn die bestehenden Straßen umfeldverträglich und gut (u. a. mit Straßenbegleitgrün) gestaltet sind, mit möglichst geringem verkehrstechnischen Aufwand auskommen und dabei ein Maximum an Sicherheit und funktionaler Unterstützung des Stadtraumes bieten. Gleichzeitig muss ein stadtverträglich gestaltetes und leistungsgerechtes Hauptnetz den Privat- und Wirtschaftsverkehr mit Kfz sowie den ÖPNV aufnehmen. Die Angebote für nicht-motorisierte Verkehrsteilnehmende müssen attraktiv und sicher sein.

# Baustein 2: Verkehrsinfrastruktur

## Bestandserhalt der Verkehrsnetze

Für eine urbane Stadtentwicklung müssen bestehende Strukturen im Straßen- und Wegenetz und im ÖPNV in guter Qualität erhalten werden. Ein räumlicher Ausbau ist innerstädtisch problematisch, da mit induktiven Effekten gerechnet werden muss und die Platzverhältnisse dies meist nicht zulassen. Zudem ist der Substanzerhalt der bestehenden Netze schon heute eine große Herausforderung, von der auch die Effektivität von Neubaumaßnahmen und Netzergänzungen entscheidend abhängt.

## Netzerweiterungen im Zusammenspiel mit Qualitätszielen

Die Erweiterung von Verkehrsnetzen ist punktuell erforderlich und betrifft insbesondere Stadtbahnstrecken, Straßen sowie straßenferne Fuß- und Radwege. Maßnahmen sind aber nur dann umsetzungsrelevant, wenn sie bestehende Defizite beheben, zu verkehrlichen Entlastungen führen, Erreichbarkeiten verbessern, stadtverträglich und finanzierbar sind sowie den verkehrlichen Leitzielen entsprechen. Ganz explizit gehört dazu auch die adäquate intermodale Anbindung neu entwickelter Standorte für z. B. Wohnen, Gewerbe, Industrie, Versorgung oder Kultur mit Straße und ÖPNV sowie im nicht-motorisiertem Verkehr mit Flächen für Carsharing, Radabstellanlagen usw.

# Verstärkte Partizipation an Planungsprozessen

Qualifizierte Beteiligungsprozesse und eine direkte, frühzeitige und transparente Interessenseinbindung von Bürgerinnen und Bürgern als Erfahrungsträger, Nutzende oder Betroffene verbessert die Passgenauigkeit von Infrastrukturmaßnahmen, erhöht deren Akzeptanz und kann die Umsetzung durch lokale Identifikation vereinfachen.

# Baustein 3: Verkehrsmanagement

## Potenzialnutzung und Innovation

Innovative Konzepte müssen stärker unterstützt werden. Neue Mobilitätsformen wie Carsharing, Elektrofahrzeuge und verkehrstelematische Anwendungen sollen forciert werden, auch wenn damit neue Handlungs- und Entscheidungsmuster erforderlich werden.

## Effektive Bestandsnutzung

Mit technischen Mitteln müssen bestehende Infrastrukturen hinsichtlich der verkehrlichen Leistungsfähigkeit, aber auch der Durchlässigkeit für ÖPNV und nicht-motorisierten Verkehr optimiert werden, da Neu- und Ausbau in den derzeit besonders kritischen Bereichen und vor dem Hintergrund von Kosten und Zielen keine Handlungsoption ist.

## Information und intermodale Nutzungen

Umfassende Echtzeitinformationen in Verbindung mit intermodalen Zugangs- und Abrechnungsmedien können dafür sorgen, dass aus einzelnen Verkehrsmitteln ein integriertes Verkehrssystem wird, in dem sich Nutzerinnen und Nutzer ohne Wissens- oder Zugangshindernisse bewegen können. Dabei müssen die Grenzen zwischen individueller und ÖPNV-basierter Mobilität, einzelnen Verkehrsträgerverbünden und privatem Kfz-Besitz weitgehend entfallen.

## Emissionsminderung sowie Umwelt- und Ressourcenschutz

Minimale Emissionen durch effektive Verkehrssteuerung entsprechen nicht nur der kommunalen Luftreinhaltungsstrategie sowie dem Masterplan zur Lärmminderung, sondern können in Verbindung mit minimalem Energieeinsatz Mobilität preiswert halten und einen wichtigen Beitrag zum Klimaschutz leisten.

LVM VAS

# Baustein 4: Mobilitätsmanagement

## Betriebliches und standortbezogenes Mobilitätsmanagement

Das bestehende Mobilitätsmanagement, das sowohl bei Betrieben ansetzt als auch stark standortbezogene Komponenten enthält, soll fortgeführt und um weitere Aspekte wie z. B. der Elektromobilität ergänzt werden. Wichtig bleibt hier die Fähigkeit, durch entsprechende Kontaktpersonen besonders in der Verwaltung eine starke inhaltliche Kontinuität aufzubauen und die initiierten Maßnahmen bzw. Projekte einem Monitoring hinsichtlich der erreichten verkehrlichen Wirkungen zu unterziehen.

## Wissen, Erreichbarkeit, Kosten und Sicherheit

Die bestehenden Instrumente zum Mobilitätsmanagement, das vor allem bei Kosten, Bewusstsein und verschiedenen sozialen und monetären Anreizen (Wettbewerbe, Job-Tickets usw.) ansetzt, müssen stringent weiter ausgebaut und auf neue echtzeitbasierte und mobile Informationsquellen gestützt werden. Hilfreich für ein Mobilitätsmanagement, das den Umweltverbund präferiert, ist auch der Vorbildcharakter öffentlicher Einrichtungen oder wichtiger Multiplikatoren.

## Mobilitätsstile

Stärker individuell ausgerichtete Informationskampagnen und hohe Kostentransparenz bei Standortentscheidungen sowohl von Firmen als auch von Privatpersonen sollen dazu dienen, dass Kostenfragen des Verkehrs in Standortentscheidungen eingebunden werden. Auf diesem Wege können intermodale Mobilitätsstile gefördert werden und hinsichtlich der privaten Kfz-Nutzung die Aspekte der Verfügbarkeit von Mobilität gegenüber privatem Kfz-Besitz besser abgewogen werden.

## Sicherung von Teilhabe und Barrierefreiheit

Demografische Veränderungen, die Anforderungen an soziale Inklusion⁷ sowie die Geschlechtergerechtigkeit und der Familienarbeit müssen verstärkt berücksichtigt werden. Damit wird die Barrierefreiheit zu einem nochmals in der Bedeutung steigenden Planungsprinzip, das aber auch mit dem Aspekt weitgehend stabiler Mobilitätskosten und den notwendigen Angeboten (kurze Wege im nicht-motorisierten Verkehr, attraktiver ÖPNV) verbunden werden muss.

⁷ z. B. auf Grundlage des 2009 in Deutschland in Kraft getretene UN-Übereinkommens über die Rechte von Menschen mit Behinderungen („Behindertenrechtskonvention“) sowie die nach §8 (3) PBefG bis 2022 im ÖPNV vollständig herzustellende Barrierefreiheit

## 5.3 Besondere Herausforderungen für den Verkehr der Zukunft

Auf Grundlage der Entwicklungprinzipien der Mobilität in Dresden werden hier die besonderen Herausforderungen der Zukunft abgeleitet, auf die die Maßnahmen in Strategie und Handlungskonzept zusätzlich eingehen. Sie ergeben sich vor allem aus den wachsenden Kostenfragen für Infrastruktur und Verkehrsangebot, steigenden Energiepreisen, dem demografischen Wandel und der Sicherung von Attraktivität und Potenzial der Stadt Dresden im Sinne des Allgemeinwohls. Nur der aktive Umgang mit diesen Herausforderungen führt zu erfolgreichen Entwicklungen. Es entstehen damit vor allem Aufgaben, die objektive, wirkungsgeprüfte kommunalpolitische Entscheidungen sowie fachlich fundiertes und integriertes Planungshandeln erfordern.

## Zentrale und verkehrlich integrierte Standorte zum Wohnen und Arbeiten nutzen

Um die Effektivität vorhandener (wertvoller) Infrastruktur zu verbessern, sollten brachliegende zentrale Bereiche mit Flächenpotenzial zu attraktiven, gemischten Wohnquartieren mit Bildungs- und Versorgungseinrichtungen umgestaltet werden. Dabei muss sich die Kommune als Impulsgeber und Entwickler von Pilotprojekten einbringen, da insbesondere die negativen verkehrlichen Wirkungen aus Lärm und Luftschadstoffen solche Lagen oft unattraktiv machen. Um diese Negativspirale zu durchbrechen, sind integrierte Pilotprojekte zwischen Stadtentwicklungsplanung und Verkehrsplanung erforderlich, die z. B. an solchen Standorten preisgünstige Mobilität weitgehend ohne eigenes Auto mit kurzen Wegen sichern, aber gleichzeitig ein Wohn- und Arbeitsumfeld schaffen, das auch im öffentlichen Raum trotz Verkehrsbelastungen auch für Familien attraktiv ist.

## Koordination von Stadtentwicklung, Bauleitplanung und Verkehrsplanung

Auch wenn dieses koordinierte Handeln als Prinzip allgemein anerkannt ist, ist die Vernetzung bedingt durch die komplexen Planungsprozesse in der Praxis noch lange nicht so effektiv wie sie sein könnte. Nur bei fachübergreifender Betrachtung sind langfristig ein effektives Verkehrssystem mit kurzen Wegen zu sichern und kleinteilige Versorgungsstrukturen zu erhalten. Die Ausweisung von Mobilitätskosten für alle bestehenden Baugebiete (unter Berücksichtigung aller Verkehrsträger) erleichtert es, Gebiete mit relativ gesehen günstigen Mobilitätskosten bzw. Eignung für Mobilität ohne eigenes Kfz zu identifizieren. Dafür können in anderen Kommunen bestehende Applikationen und die entsprechenden Praxis-Erfahrungen auf Übertragbarkeit geprüft werden.

## Vereinbarkeit von Energieeffizienz, Lärmminderung, Luftreinhaltung und Klimaschutz

Hinter diesen Schlagwerten steckt die Herausforderung, mit nicht-motorisierten Verkehrsmitteln gleichzeitig sichere und attraktive Mobilität anzubieten. Nicht-motorisierte Verkehrsträger müssen dafür gemeinsam mit dem ÖPNV zu einem Umweltverbund qualifiziert werden, der mehr als nur 60 % aller Wege abdeckt. Dann sind Kostensteigerungen bei Energie deutlich weniger spürbar und es verbleibt Kaufkraft für andere Bereiche. Mobilität wird so für Menschen mit geringem Einkommen langfristig gesichert, zu denen auch verstärkt Ältere mit gebrochenen Erwerbsbiografien

und wachsender Altersarmut gehören. Gleichzeitig kann auf diese Weise Schritt für Schritt ein Szenario real werden, das weitgehend von fossilen Energieträgern unabhängig wird. Dem zukünftig weiter wachsenden Aufkommen im nicht-motorisierten Verkehr insbesondere im Radverkehr muss im Verkehrssystem gleichberechtigt und damit stärker als bislang Rechnung getragen werden. Allein Maßnahmen, die auf technische Fahrzeugentwicklung oder Verstetigungen im Verkehrsablauf setzen, greifen hier zu kurz und sind nicht wirksam genug.

## Demografische Trends, Teilhabe und Sicherheit

Auch in einer wachsenden Stadt wie Dresden steigt der Anteil älterer Menschen. In Verbindung mit den Anforderungen an ein generationen- und geschlechtergerechtes Verkehrssystem sowie an die Integration neuer Lebensstile sind die Barrierefreiheit bei Zugang und Nutzung sowie die individuelle Sicherheit besonders im nicht-motorisierten Verkehr und im ÖPNV auszubauen.

## Stadtqualität als wichtigsten Standortvorteil Dresdens begreifen

Die Qualität der Infrastruktur ist ein sehr wichtiges aber nicht das einzige Entscheidungskriterium für die Wirtschaftsentwicklung sowie für Zuzug und Wachstum. Auch in Zukunft müssen die tatsächlichen Ressourcen der Stadt – die Lage am Fluss, die Angebote im Bereich Kunst, Kultur und Bildung, die städtebauliche Situation, der hohe Grad der Durchgrünung, die Geschichte und nicht zuletzt das attraktive Umland als wesentliche Standortfaktoren angesehen werden. Infrastrukturen dürfen die eigentlichen Kernqualitäten der Stadt, die stärker als in anderen Städten neben Industrie und Gewerbe auch von Humankapitel in Forschung, Bildung, Kunst und Wissenschaft geprägt werden, nicht beeinträchtigen. Verkehr muss effektiv die städtischen Grundfunktionen sichern und dabei ein umfeldverträgliches Maß wählen. Dresden muss deshalb sowohl mit seinem kultur- und naturräumlichen Potenzial als auch infrastrukturseitigen Substanz sensibel umgehen, um die aktuellen Standortvorteile im globalen Wettbewerb zu behalten und auszubauen.

## Alternative und neue Mobilitätsstile und Anpassungen am Rechtsrahmen

Mobilität ist dynamischen Veränderungen unterworfen. Auch wenn bis 2025 die Dominanz des privaten Kfz größtenteils weiter bestehen wird, werden heutige Trends der Multimodalität mit weniger privaten Kfz-Mobilität sowie die Attraktivität urbaner Dichte deutlich mehr Raum einnehmen. Diese Trends sind im Sinne der Stadtentwicklung sinn- und wertvoll. Die Gesetzgebungen im Verkehrsbereich und deren Auslegungen vor Ort sind hier aber noch bei weitem nicht auf einem Niveau, welches neue Mobilitätsstile deutlich fördert. Zwar ist bekannt, dass Carsharing-Nutzende nur für 10 % statt 40 % ihrer Wege ein Kfz nutzen, aber das Fehlen fester Abstellplätze im öffentlichen wie im privaten Raum setzen den dynamischen und allein durch die Privatwirtschaft getragenen Entwicklungen enge Grenzen. Ähnliche Fragen entstehen bei der Infrastruktur für Elektromobilität oder im allgemein wachsenden Radverkehr, wo auch quantitative Fragen sowie Fragen des Mischverkehrs mit Kfz von steigender Bedeutung sind.

# Sicherung der Finanzierung des Verkehrssystems

Weitgehend stagnierende kommunale Einnahmen sind auch in Zukunft zu erwarten. Die größte Gefahr geht dabei von der Vernachlässigung des vorhandenen Verkehrssystems, insbesondere der Verkehrsinfrastruktur, und dem Abbau der ÖPNV-Angebotsqualität aus. Mit einer Vernachlässigung der vorhandenen Verkehrsinfrastruktur wären zum einen höhere Sanierungskosten verbunden, zum anderen wären dann Neubaumaßnahmen weit weniger effektiv. Der Bestands- und Angebotssicherung muss deshalb eine größere Rolle zukommen. Intakte öffentliche Räume sind noch stärker als Impulsgeber für private Investitionen zu begreifen. Dabei müssen perspektivisch die bestehenden Finanzierungsquellen breiter aufgestellt werden, um neben der Infrastruktur auch ÖPNV-Angebote sowie Informations- und Telematiksysteme unabhängig zu finanzieren. Auch die Infrastrukturfolgekosten und neue, nutzerfinanzierte Systeme im Kfz-Verkehr sind zu diskutieren. Im ÖPNV hingegen ist zu hinterfragen, inwieweit nicht nur die Fahrgäste für über 70 % der ÖPNV-Kosten aufkommen, sondern auch diejenigen, die allein durch die Anbindung an den ÖPNV wirtschaftliche Vorteile genießen.

# Planungskultur mit Bürgerbeteiligung verbessern und Akzeptanz erhöhen

Auch in Zukunft werden unpopuläre Entscheidungen im Verkehrsbereich fallen. Da aber langwierige juristische Prozesse und Verzögerungen teuer und ineffektiv sind, kommt es bei der zukünftigen Maßnahmenplanung darauf an, durch sehr gute, fundierte und ausgewogene Begründungen von Maßnahmen breite gesellschaftliche Akzeptanz zu schaffen. Bürgermeinungen sollten ernst genommen werden. Sie bilden wichtige Indikatoren, die es zu verstehen und zu berücksichtigen gilt. Konsensorientierte Diskussionsprozesse besonders zu umstrittenen Verkehrsbauvorhaben müssen frühzeitig einsetzen und über das momentan erforderliche formale Maß z. B. der Baugesetzgebung weit hinausgehen. Der damit verbundene höhere Aufwand wird durch sinkende Kosten bei der Umsetzung und schnellere Umsetzbarkeit vielfach kompensiert. Auch der vorliegende Verkehrsentwicklungsplan 2025plus ist in diesem Zusammenhang zu sehen. Nur breite und im Konsens gefundene, parteienübergreifende Mehrheitsbeschlüsse machen eine konsequente Umsetzung möglich. Auch deshalb soll der Runde Tisch zum VEP als Fachgremium weitergeführt werden und die Umsetzung und Evaluierung des VEP begleiten.

# 5.4 Erforderliches Verwaltungshandeln

Die strategischen und handlungsbezogenen Maßnahmenansätze des VEP sind nur umsetzbar, wenn sie durch zielgerichtetes Verwaltungshandeln gesteuert und begleitet werden. In Kap. 5.4 sind nur die Maßnahmen aufgeführt, die sich nicht direkt einem Maßnahmenbereich zuordnen lassen bzw. themenübergreifend angelegt sind. Alle weiteren Maßnahmen sind den jeweiligen Themenbereichen zugeordnet.

Die aufgeführten Maßnahmen zeigen dabei auch Handlungsfelder auf, die von der Verwaltung bereits heute aktiv und mit hohem Engagement verfolgt werden und auch schon Erfolge vorzuweisen sind. Die Erwähnung der einzelnen Maßnahmen im VEP dient vor allem dazu, dem Verwaltungshandeln auch zukünftig eine starke fachliche Basis zu geben und weitergehenden Vertiefungsbedarf anzustoßen. Im Wechselspiel mit anderen Konzepten und Strategien der Stadt (z. B. dem InSEK) können die dargestellten Ansätze des Verwaltungshandelns helfen, ein verkehrlich integriertes, fachübergreifendes Agieren zu ermöglichen.

# 5.4.1 Maßnahmen der Stadt- und Bauleitplanung sowie der Genehmigung und Beauflagung

Die Stadt- und Bauleitplanung hat eine Schlüsselstellung bei der Erarbeitung langfristig verkehrlich effizienter Strukturen mit kurzen Wegen und guten funktionalen Mischungen. Deshalb ist die Mitwirkung der Bauleitplanung im Verkehrsplanungsprozess von höchster Bedeutung. Aus derzeitiger Sicht stellen sich dabei besonders folgende Aufgaben:

Umfassende Koordination von Siedlungs- und Stadtentwicklung sowie verkehrlichen Wirkungen sowie kontinuierliche Prüfung von aufkommenden Maßnahmen auf Sinnfälligkeit im Zuge der Leitziele der Verkehrsentwicklung,
Vernetzung von verkehrlichen Fragen und Zielen der Stadtentwicklung im Zuge der Flächenutzungs- und Bauleitplanung, insbesondere der formalen Prozesse wie dem Flächenutzungsplan, seiner Beipläne und der Hauptverkehrszüge aber auch der Erarbeitung des InSEK als Leitdokument der Stadtentwicklung,
Nutzung verkehrlich integrierter Standorte und Brachbereiche insbesondere an Schienenachsen für die Ausweisung von Wohnbauflächen, öffentliche Einrichtungen, Schulen (aktuell ein besonders wichtiges Thema), gewerblichen Ansiedlungen und anderen Bereichen mit hohem Quell- und Zielverkehrsaufkommen,
Zulassen gebietsverträglicher Einrichtungen der Nahversorgung, Kinderbetreuung und Bildung in allen Wohngebieten sowie engmaschigen Durchwegungen zur Sicherung der Nahmobilität,

Berücksichtigung einer vollwertigen, direkten Erreichbarkeit auch per Fuß, Rad und ÖPNV von derzeit in Planung befindlichen großen Stadtentwicklungsbereichen mit hohem Aufkommen (z. B. Wissenschaftsstandort Dresden-Ost, Campus-Erweiterung Nöthnitzer Straße (Rahmenplan in Arbeit), Wilsdruffer Vorstadt, Kunstquartier Devrientstraße, Kulturkraftwerk Mitte, Ostrainsel, Alter Leipziger Bahnhof, HafenCity, Robotron-Areal/ Lingnerparkstadt),
Entwicklung eines Verfahrens zu Vergabe und Betrieb solcher Carsharing-Flächen an privatwirtschaftliche oder kommunale Betreiber,
Flexibilisierung der Stellplatzverpflichtungen von Bauherren in Abhängigkeit von Lage und ÖPNV-Gunst sowie von betrieblichen Mobilitätsplänen und Mobilitätsmanagement unter Nutzung der Ermessensspielräume der sächsischen Bauordnung,
Stärkung der/des Radverkehrsverantwortlichen, so dass nicht nur die kommunale Radverkehrsstrategie offensiv bei allen Planungsprozessen vertreten wird sondern zusätzlich die stärkere Förderung des Fuß- und das Radverkehr als primäres Aufgabenziel verfolgt werden kann,
Ausgestaltung eines verbindlichen „Mobilitätschecks“ in der Bauleitplanung besonders bezüglich Erreichbarkeit im ÖPNV und NMV und der zu erwartenden Mobilitätskosten im Vergleich aller Verkehrsträger,
Integration und Neuanlage von Grünbereichen und Grünachsen im Zuge von Maßnahmen der Verkehrsplanung zur Verbesserung des Stadtklimas und der Aufenthaltsqualität unter Berücksichtigung von Frischluftschneisen und Kaltluftbereichen,
Vermeidung von Eingriffen in Anlagen des Gemeingebrauchs wie Parkanlagen, Spielplätze, Kleingartenvereine, Friedhöfe und in den Straßenbaumbestand, sofern diese Eingriffe nicht von Beginn an fachlich abgestimmt sind.

In Abbildung 21 sind wesentliche Gebiete der aktuellen Stadtentwicklung und Gunstgebiete für Nutzungsverdichtung insbesondere an bestehenden und geplanten Schienenachsen (Stadtbahn, S-Bahn und Zug) dargestellt. Die Darstellungen korrespondieren mit den räumlichen Schwerpunkten der Stadtentwicklung gemäß InSEK (neuer Titel „Zukunft Dresden 2025+“, Stand Juni 2013) bezogen auf das Thema Verkehr. Hinzu kommen weiterhin die Maßnahmen aus der Nutzungsgenehmigung:

Anstreben, dass bei Großereignissen eine möglichst stadtverträgliche und emissionsarme Mobilität der Besuchenden erreicht wird (u. a. unter Einbeziehung von Radverkehr und sicheren Abstellanlagen, Park+Ride, Management des ruhenden Verkehrs, Wegweisungen sowie ÖPNV-Kombitickets oder Bonussystemen).
Prüfung inwieweit Veranstaltungsverkehre der DVB mit Kombi-Tickets im Rahmen eines jährlichen Grundangebots für Veranstaltungsagenturen attraktiver oder rechtlich verbindlich gestaltet werden können (bisher nur rein privatwirtschaftliche Vereinbarungen).

Die aktuellen Richtlinien zur integrierten Netzgestaltung verlangen insbesondere vom Straßennetz einen klaren Bezug zu Qualitäten und Anforderungen der einzelnen Netzelemente. Um hier eine Handlungsgrundlage zu schaffen, wurden die bestehenden Klassifizierungen und Kategorisierungen (Bundes-, Staats- und Kreisstraße, Hauptverkehrsstraße und Hauptsammelstraße) aus der Bauleitplanung bzw. dem Verkehrskonzept 2003 übernommen und mit den Kategorien VS II und III, HS III und IV sowie ES IV und V nach RIN bzw. RASt06 verknüpft. Dabei werden in Anlage 7 Aussagen zu folgenden Einzelaspekten getroffen:

Knotenpunktgestaltung mit dem über- bzw. untergeordneten Netz,
bevorzugte Knotenpunktgestaltung innerhalb gleicher Hierarchiestufe,
Zulässigkeit von direkten Grundstückszufahrten,
maßgeblicher Begegnungsfall,
Zulässigkeit ruhender Verkehr mit Einschränkung des Begegnungsfalles,
Regelbreite der nutzbaren Fahrbahn (RASt/ RAS-Q) bei Zweistreifigkeit,
angestrebte Fahrgeschwindigkeit (mit Halten) nach RIN,
Zulässige Höchstgeschwindigkeit,
Eignung für streckenhafte Verkehrsberuhigung bis Tempo 30,
Eignung für Verkehrsberuhigung unter 30 km/h,
Nutzung durch Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn im Straßenraum,
Eignung für Radverkehr im Mischverkehr (für zwei- und vierstreifigen Straßen) sowie
Bedeutung für Versorgung und Aufenthalt.

Die dargestellten Zuordnungen sollen in Verbindung mit dem kategorisierten Straßennetz (siehe Kapitel 6.4.3) für die jeweiligen Kategoriengruppe bzw. Verbindungsfunktionsstufe aufzeigen, welche verkehrlichen Rahmenbedingungen und städtebaulichen Funktionen überwiegen und welche baulichen und verkehrsorganisatorischen Rahmenbedingungen (Knotenpunktform, ÖPNV-Führung, Radverkehrsanlagen, Breiten, Geschwindigkeiten u. a.) dann gelten. Diese Zuordnung bildet einen Orientierungsrahmen, der das Verwaltungshandeln zukünftig bestimmen soll, von dem aber in wohlbegründeten Ausnahmefällen ggf. abgewichen werden kann.

# 5.4.3 Luftreinhaltung, Lärmminderung und Klimaschutz

Durch verschiedene Stadtratsbeschlüsse ist die Verwaltung dazu aufgefordert, bestimmte Maßgaben rahmengebender Umweltkonzepte zu erfüllen. Insbesondere die Luftreinhaltung hat hier einen hohen rechtlichen Stellenwert. Die in Kapitel 3 beschriebenen Szenarienberechnungen und -bewertungen berücksichtigen die Vorgaben entsprechend. So wurden in das Handlungskonzept des VEP keine Maßnahmen aufgenommen, die den erklärten kommunalen Zielen bei der Luftreinhaltung und Lärmminderung entgegenstehen. Im Gegenteil: fast zwei Drittel aller Maßnahmen der Strategie und des Handlungskonzepts dienen explizit auch den Zielen aus der Luftreinhaltung, Lärmminderung und dem Klimaschutz.

Im Zusammenhang mit Lärmschutz sind auch die Aktivitäten der Stadt Dresden hinsichtlich des Lärmschutzes an bestehenden Straßen bzw. Autobahnen sowie entlang von Bahnstrecken zu verstärken. Zukünftig sind steigende Fernverkehrsmengen sowohl im Kfz-Verkehr als auch im Eisenbahnverkehr zu erwarten, insbesondere Güterverkehr.

Auch wenn der VEP nie deckungsgleich mit dem Luftreinhalteplan, dem Masterplan Lärmminderung sowie dem Energie- und Klimakonzept sein kann, so greift er doch alle dort definierten Rahmenbedingungen auf und formt sie weiter aus. Bezüglich des Luftreinhalteplans wurde explizit darauf geachtet, dass jeder dort definierte Maßnahmenbereich mit seiner jeweiligen Intention Eingang in den VEP findet. Der VEP untersetzt damit die Ziele der Luftreinhaltung mit weiteren konkreten Maßnahmenvorschlägen bzw. aktualisiert vorliegende Erkenntnisse. Auch wenn derzeit bei den Szenarien und ihren Maßnahmenansätzen davon ausgegangen wird, dass die Einrichtung einer Umweltzone vermieden werden kann, ist diese Maßnahme dennoch nicht auszuschließen.

Im Zuge der Verkehrsplanung sollten zudem die Strategien zur Erhaltung der stadtklimatisch wichtigen, kühlenden Grünbereiche sowie der Frischluftzufuhr für die Innenstadt berücksichtigt werden. Dazu gehören u. a. die fachlich ausgewiesenen Frischluftschneisen aber auch das Straßenbaumkonzept sowie die vorliegenden nahräumlichen Grünordnungs- oder stadtteilbezogenen Entwicklungskonzepte.

## 5.4.4 Verkehrs- und Mobilitätsmanagement, Verkehrssicherheit und Evaluation

In diesem Bereich laufen derzeit Aktivitäten der Verwaltung, die in den jeweiligen Kapiteln des Handlungskonzeptes betrachtet werden. Effektives und zielgerichtetes Verwaltungshandeln einer mit ausgewiesenen Fachleuten besetzten Verwaltung im konstruktiven Wechselspiel mit der Kommunalpolitik ist die Grundlage für Erfolg oder Misserfolg der Verkehrsentwicklungs- und Verkehrsanlagenplanung. Wichtige Aspekte sind dabei:

Fortführung des betrieblichen und standortbezogenen Mobilitätsmanagements mit kompetenten Kontaktpersonen in der Verwaltung,
Präsenz und inhaltliche Mitgestaltung bei EU-Projekten zu Mobilität, Stadtentwicklung und Verkehr und Aufgreifen des EU-Ansatzes für „Strategic Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP)“,
Kontrolle der Umsetzung von Maßnahmen zur Erhöhung der Verkehrssicherheit und Absicherung der Bereitstellung von Daten sowie der Kontinuität des Prozesses,
Umsetzung der in Kapitel 5.9 beschriebenen qualifizierten Monitoring- und Evaluationsprozesse durch die Verwaltung.

## 5.4.5 Hochwasservorsorge

Die Hochwasservorsorge ist für Dresden essentiell und beeinflusst eine Vielzahl von Handlungsbereichen. Im vorliegenden Plan zur Hochwasservorsorge vom August 2010 werden zu 22 Stadtbereichen als sogenannte Betrachtungsgebiete (BG) Aussagen getroffen. Spezifische Wechselwirkungen zur Verkehrsplanung ergeben sich für 10 dieser Betrachtungsgebiete:

BG 1 – Innenstadt (Altstädter Seite)
BG 2 – Friedrichstadt
BG 3 – Plauen, Löbtau
BG 9 – Stetzsch, Gohlis, Cossebaude
BG 10 – Pieschen, Übigau, Kaditz
BG 14 – Neustadt
BG 15 – Pillnitz, Wachwitz, Loschwitz
BG 17 – Zschieren, Leuben, Laubegast
BG 18 – Lockwitz, Luga, Niedersedlitz
BG 22 – Blasewitz, Striesen, Johannstadt

Die baulichen Maßnahmen aus dem Handlungskonzept des Verkehrsentwicklungsplanes, insbesondere wenn sie Überschwemmungsbereiche betreffen, sollen mit dem Hochwasservorsorge-
Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus

LVM
WBS

plan abgeglichen werden. In diesem sind insbesondere die folgenden verkehrsplanerischen Ansätze benannt, die nach heutigem Stand noch Wechselwirkung mit dem VEP entfalten:

Durchbindung der Bayrischen Straße allerdings unter der Annahme einer Verknüpfung mit der Budapester Straße, was derzeit nicht mehr als möglich erscheint (Prüfbedarf im Zuge der Fortschreibung des Hochwasserschutzkonzeptes),
Befahrbarkeit des Terrassenufers bis Steinstraße auch im Hochwasserfall,
Umgang mit den hochwassergefährdeten Abschnitten auf dem Flügelweg (unter Bahnbrücke) und auf der Hamburger Straße (im Ausbaubereich am HP Cotta),
Neubau der B 6n in Cossebaude in Verbindung mit hochwassergefährdeten Teilabschnitten der B 6 Dresdner Straße in Cossebaude und deren Erreichbarkeit bei Hochwasser,
Querspange Sporbitz zur Verbesserung der Querverbindungen im Hochwasserfall,
Höherlegungen von Bestandsstraßen in Zschieren, Leuben und Laubegast sowie die
Durchbindung der Bosewitzer Straße.

An einer Vielzahl weiterer Straßen sind zur Hochwasservorsorge Um- und Einbauten erforderlich bzw. ist deren Hochwassergefährdung ab einem bestimmten Elbpegel kaum mehr abwendbar (Terrassenufer, Alttolkewitz, Pillnitzer Landstraße Laubegaster Ufer u. a.).

Generell ist die Sicherung von verkehrstechnischen Anlagen z. B. den LSA, den Steuerungsrechnern und der Vorrohrungen vor Hochwassereinwirkungen eine finanziell und organisatorisch wichtige Aufgabe. Als zentrale Maßnahme des VEP ist zudem das Verkehrsmanagement im Hochwasserfall mit den entsprechenden Umleitungsstrecken für Kfz- und Radverkehr sowie den Anpassungen der Steuerprogrammen der LSA benannt (siehe Kapitel 6.9.2 für den Bereich Terrassenufer).

Als Vorläufer zum Hochwasserschutzkonzept von 2010 weist das Verkehrskonzept 2003 ein „Rahmenprogramm Hochwasser-/Katastrophenschutz“ aus. Dabei wird vor allem auf die Erarbeitung eines „verkehrsplanerisches Hochwasser- und Katastrophenschutzkonzept“ und eine Maximierung der Flexibilität der Infrastruktur verwiesen. Ergänzend zum Hochwasserschutzkonzept 2010 wird hier auch auf den ÖPNV und dessen möglichst störungsfreien Betrieb, die Mitbenutzung von Gleistrassen durch Rettungsfahrzeuge, die wichtige Rolle von Rad- und Fußverkehr im Katastrophenfall und die Rolle von P+R-Plätzen als Aufstellbereiche für Rettungskräfte oder Hubschrauberlandeplätze eingegangen.

Diese Themen sind nach wie vor aktuell und sollten bei allen planerischen Aktivitäten berücksichtigt werden. Der VEP 2025plus sollte in die Fortschreibung des Hochwasserschutzkonzepts ebenso einfließen wie die Erfahrungen mit dem Junihochwasser 2013. Ein separates verkehrsplanerisches Dokument für den Hochwasserfall wird derzeit nicht für notwendig erachtet, da wichtige Hochwasseran-

WV
WBS

forderungen z. B. an Flächenfreihaltung, Beschilderung oder Ersatzkapazitäten für Umleitungsstrecken im VEP berücksichtigt werden und alle weiteren Aspekte in die Fortschreibung des Hochwasserschutzkonzepts aufgenommen werden können

Ein weiterer wesentlicher Aspekt der Hochwasservorsorge betrifft potenzielle Brückenstandorte. Bedingt durch Hochwasserschutztore und freizuhaltenende Überflutungs- sowie Abflussbereiche sind bestehende Planungsgedanken hier grundsätzlich zu hinterfragen (siehe Kapitel 6.9.6 zu Elbbrücken).

## 5.4.6 Weitere Felder des Verwaltungshandelns

Ein weiterer wichtiger Aspekt des Verwaltungshandelns ist auch die regionale Kooperation bei einer Vielzahl von Fragestellungen, die von Pendlerverkehren über die Lkw-Führung bis zu touristischen Radrouten reichen. Der VEP berücksichtigt diese Thematik explizit. So sind am Runden Tisch der Region alle maßgeblichen Akteure in den Prozess eingebunden. Im Kapitel 6.9.8 des Handlungskonzeptes wird explizit auf die Zusammenstellung interkommunaler Maßnahmen eingegangen.

Die Erkenntnisse zu neuen, intermodalen Mobilitätsstilen und flächensparender Formen der Verkehrsorganisation, die von deutlich mehr Flexibilität bei der Straßenraumnutzung ausgehen, sollten noch stärker als bisher in das Handeln der Verwaltung integriert werden. Dies betrifft z. B. Fragen von Carsharing-Standorten im öffentlichen Straßenraum, Ladeinfrastrukturen für Elektromobilität (besonders Elektro-Räder aber auch Kfz), Geschwindigkeitsanpassungen aus Lärmgründen oder neue Mischverkehrsführungen im Radverkehr, wo jeweils behördliches Handeln neue Kompetenzen erwerben und flexiblere Entscheidungsmuster aufbauen muss.

Um langfristig aktuelle Verkehrsthemen auf der Höhe der Zeit bearbeiten und diskutieren zu können und dabei einen gewinnbringenden kooperativen Austausch mit anderen Kommunen zu pflegen, ist die Einbindung Dresdens in verkehrliche Forschungs- und Förderprojekte von der Europäischen Union aber auch von Bund oder Land von großer Bedeutung. Dafür sind entsprechende fachliche und zeitliche Ressourcen in der Verwaltung weiterhin erforderlich. Dresden hat von dieser Einbindung in der Vergangenheit in hohem Maße profitiert.

# 5.5 Kostenstrategie für Bestandserhalt und Investitionen im Verkehrssystem

## Grundlagen und Ergebnisse

Auch wenn die Diskussion von Kostenfragen auf der strategischen Ebene eines Verkehrsentwicklungsplanes Unscharfen aufweist und Kosten für Innovationen bei einem Blick in die Zukunft kaum ermittelbar sind, so sind Kostenangaben für die Einordnung von Maßnahmen, deren Bewertung und Priorisierung hilfreich.

Das Betreiben, Unterhalten und Erweitern der Verkehrsnetze erfordert einen enormen finanziellen Aufwand, der durch die verschiedenen Träger (Stadt Dresden, Land, Bund, Bahn etc.) geleistet werden muss. Die Sicherung der bestehenden Infrastruktur mit den erforderlichen Ersatzneubauten ist bereits heute eine große finanzielle Herausforderung. Die Landeshauptstadt Dresden müsste bereits heute etwa 50 Mio. €/ Jahr alleine für den Bestandserhalt bzw. Ersatzneubau des Straßennetzes (Straßen, Brücken, Steuerungssysteme etc.) aufbringen. Bei der Kostenbetrachtung neuer Maßnahmen sind daher die jährlichen Aufwendungen für Betrieb und Erhalt des Verkehrssystems (Straße und ÖPNV) immer in die Bewertung mit einzubeziehen.

Um die Maßnahmen des VEP auch unter begrenzten finanziellen Ressourcen umsetzen zu können, bedarf es einer effizienten Kostenstrategie. Zudem ist zu beachten, dass Neuinvestitionen in die Verkehrsinfrastruktur nur dann die prognostizierten Effekte bewirken, wenn sich das Bestandsnetz in einem soliden und funktionsfähigen Zustand befindet.

Vor dem Hintergrund der zu erwartenden Bevölkerungsentwicklung in Dresden mit einem besonders ausgeprägten Zuwachs im Innenbereich der Stadt, ist die Sicherung der bestehenden Netze besonders wichtig. Dabei liegen die jährlichen Gesamtkosten der Bestandssicherung für Straßen und Stadtbahngleise (mit Ersatzneubauten für sanierungsbedürftige Infrastruktur), Fahrzeugbeschaffung im ÖPNV und das ÖPNV-Angebot selbst bei ca. 135 Mio. €/ Jahr.

Als Bezugshorizont der Kostenrechnung für Investitionen wurde für eine bessere Vergleichbarkeit auch ein jährlicher Wert zu Grunde gelegt, der den jährlichen Investitionsanteil bis zum Jahr 2025 zeigt (Investitionskosten aufgeteilt auf 13 Jahre ab Ende 2012 bis 2025).

Grafik 34 zeigt, dass allein rund 65 % der jährlichen Gesamtkosten für das Verkehrssystem (mit allen geplanten Maßnahmen) für Bestandserhalt bzw. Ersatzneubau aufzuwenden sind. Rund 20 % der jährlichen Investitionskosten entfallen auf bereits beschlossene Maßnahmen. Auf VEP-Maßnahmen entfallen rund 8 % der jährlichen Investitionskosten. Für verschiedene Maßnahmen kann aber die Stadt Dresden Fördermittel von EU, Bund oder Land einsetzen, die hier noch nicht berücksichtigt sind.

Seite 97
Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus

Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil C: Mobilitätsstrategie 2025plus

LVM

Werden die Investitionen für Maßnahmen aus dem VEP auf einen längeren Zeitraum gestreckt (z. B. das Jahr 2030), ergeben sich dafür anteilig geringere jährliche Investitionskosten, sodass z. B. der Anteil jährlicher Investitionskosten dann auf nur noch 5 % sinken würde.

Folgekosten für Betrieb und Erhalt der VEP-Maßnahmen machen rund 7 % der jährlichen Investitionskosten aus, wovon auf die Stadt Dresden nur rund 40 % entfallen. Der Grafik 34 ist die vollständige Aufteilung zu entnehmen.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Grafik 34: Jährliche Kosten des Verkehrssystems in Dresden mit Maßnahmen des VEP (in Mio. €, Quelle: Kostenschätzung und Bewertung im VEP 2025plus)

Um die Investitionen in VEP-Maßnahmen auch in der öffentlichen Diskussion rechtfertigen zu können, sollten im Verlauf der weiteren Maßnahmendiskussion und -entscheidung die Nutzen-Aspekte deutlich herausgestellt werden. Selbst ohne Berücksichtigung der 19 Maßnahmen der Flächenvorhaltung und der Innovation (weit überwiegend in Kostenklasse 1 angesiedelt) entstehen für 68 prioritäre bzw. sinnvolle Maßnahmen des VEP keine nennenswerten Investitionskosten (vgl. Grafik 35).

Grafik 35: Verteilung der VEP-Maßnahmen nach Kostenklassen
Summe: 142 Maßnahmen (ohne Maßnahmen im Bau)

Maßnahmen ohne Investitionskosten umfassen dabei zu großen Teilen strategisches Handeln, die Umsetzung planerischer Prinzipien sowie verkehrlich orientierte Rahmenvorgaben für die Bauleitplanung. Auch diese Maßnahmen sind indirekt mit Kosten verbunden, da sie davon ausgehen, dass eine Verwaltung zeitnah, kompetent und umsetzungsorientiert handeln kann und Politik dabei vor allem fachorientiert entscheidet. Gerade die strategischen Maßnahmen beeinflussen die Stadtstruktur unmittelbar und damit die erforderlichen Wege und die Effektivität des Verkehrssystems. Zwar sind auch strategische Entscheidungen ab einem bestimmten Punkt mit baulichen Maßnahmen zu untersetzen, aber allein die konsequente Orientierung an diesen Maßgaben, die vor allem in den Kapiteln zur Mobilitätsstrategie beschrieben sind, ist Voraussetzung, dass Maßnahmen überhaupt effektiv durchgeführt werden.

In Anlage 6.2 sind die Maßnahmen des VEP den in Grafik 35 dargestellten einzelnen Kostenklassen zugeordnet worden. Eine solche klassifizierte Darstellung ist im Rahmen eines strategischen Konzeptes ausreichend und ein fachlich belastbarer Weg. Absolute, maßnahmenbezogene Einzelkosten sind in dieser Phase aufgrund der langfristigen Orientierung des VEP und des teils noch sehr groben Planungsrahmens nicht fundiert möglich. Die kostenintensivsten Maßnahmen, die sich derzeit im Bau befinden, sind der S-Bahn-Ausbau sowie der Bau der S 177.

# Strategische Kostenfragen

Obwohl derzeit kein Budgetrahmen für verkehrliche Bestandserhaltung bzw. Ersatzneubauten sowie neue Investitionen bis 2025 bekannt ist, stellt sich die Frage, in welchem Umfang die Stadt Dresden in ihr Verkehrssystem zukünftig investieren kann oder will, um dieses zu erhalten bzw. zu verbessern. Diese Frage kann nicht durch den VEP beantwortet werden, muss aber im Zuge der Diskussionen und Entscheidungen des Verkehrsentwicklungsplanes thematisiert werden. Problematisch ist auch der Umstand, dass der Bestandserhalt deutlich schlechtere Fördermöglichkeiten aufweist als der Neubau. Der Bestandserhalt stellt aber bereits eine große Herausforderung dar, sodass es für die Landeshauptstadt Dresden immer wichtiger wird, bei Bund und Land auf verbesserte Fördermöglichkeiten für die Bestandssanierung von Straßen, Wegen und den kommunalen ÖPNV hinzuwirken. Investitionen in den Bestandserhalt senken gerade im ÖPNV auch die Folgekosten bei Unterhalt und Verschleiß sowie durch Vermeidung von Behinderungen und Langsamfahrstellen auch die Kosten für die Beschaffung zusätzlicher Fahrzeuge.

Ein weiteres strategisches Thema ist die Nutzerfinanzierung von Verkehr, über die derzeit in den gesetzgebenden Gremien und der Wissenschaft intensiv diskutiert wird. Während im ÖPNV derzeit schon über 70 % der Betriebskosten durch die Fahrgäste finanziert werden, sind dies im Bereich des Kfz-Verkehrs weitgehend indirekte Kostenübernahmen. Aber auch Informations- und Telematiksysteme müssen langfristig erhalten werden.

Investitionen in Straßen und/ oder ÖPNV-Angebote könnten ggf. von Nutzenden und – besonders im ÖPNV – auch von institutionellen Nutznießern einer guten Erreichbarkeit wie Betrieben und Handelseinrichtungen finanziert werden. Dafür sind Ansätze des Solidarprinzips, aber auch bauordnungsrechtliche Wege sowie Gebührenansätze denkbar. Dazu bedarf es noch intensiver, vertiefender Vorarbeiten und Aktivitäten von Seiten der Gesetzgeber in Land und Bund.

Prüfung und potenzielle Umwidmung der Bahntrasse nach Königsbrück bzw. Ottendorf-Okrilla für die Stadtbahn,
Rechtliche Sicherung und Vergabe von Stellplätzen für Carsharing im öffentlichen Straßenraum.

Eine Untersetzung der Forderungen wird in den jeweiligen Kapiteln des Handlungskonzepts vorgenommen.

## 5.7 Verkehrlicher Vertiefungsbedarf für Schwerpunkte der Stadt- und Netzentwicklung

Eine Vielzahl heute bereits absehbarer großer Entwicklungsprojekte in Dresden bedarf einer koordinierten städtebaulich-verkehrlichen Bewertung, um verkehrliche Effekte prognostisch beurteilen und erforderliche Maßnahmen benennen zu können.

In Abstimmung mit der kommunalen Bauleitplanung wurden ausgewählte Bereiche definiert und nachfolgend hinsichtlich des notwendigen Untersuchungsbedarfs beschrieben. Da in Dresden stets neue Projekte mit maßgeblicher verkehrlicher Wirkung entstehen können, muss diese Aufstellung regelmäßig überprüft und bei Bedarf fortgeschrieben werden. Hierbei müssen auch netzrelevante Fragestellungen thematisiert werden, die bestehende Defizite abbauen können. Zumeist überlagern sich derartige Fragestellungen, da Infrastrukturmaßnahmen stets das Ziel haben, Defizite bzw. negative verkehrliche Wirkungen zu vermeiden.

Im Zuge der Erarbeitung des VEP 2025plus wurden für ausgewählte zentrale stadträumliche Maßnahmenbereiche bereits Verkehrsmengenermittlungen auf Basis des Verkehrsmodells des VEP durchgeführt, deren Ergebnisse Grundlage für die Empfehlungen im Handlungskonzept sind. Dies betrifft die Bereiche:

Seite 103
Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus
Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil C: Mobilitätsstrategie 2025plus
WV
IVAS

Dreyßigplatz/ Micken,
Neustädter Markt,
Schillerplatz/ Körnerplatz/ Blaues Wunder.

Deren Ergebnisse sind in Kapitel 6.9.2 bzw. Anlage 9 als Empfehlungen zum Umgang mit zentralen stadträumlichen Defizitbereichen integriert.

Weitere Untersuchungen, die im Rahmen des VEP nicht erfolgen können, aber für weitere Planungsphasen wichtig sind, betreffen verschiedene Bereiche bzw. Maßnahmenansätze. Die aus den einzelnen Untersuchungen abgeleiteten Ergebnisse werden dann in die Evaluierung des VEP einfließen. Dies sind aus derzeitiger Sicht die folgenden Bereiche:

# Durchbindung Fröbelstraße und Durchführung bis Bayrische Straße

Die Durchbindung der Fröbelstraße als zweistreifige Stadtstraße über die Freiberger Straße bis zur Rosenstraße insbesondere für den Lkw-Verkehr wurde bisher noch nicht verkehrlich bewertet. Gemeinsam mit dieser Bewertung untersucht werden, wie sich die weitere Durchbindung bis zur Bayrischen Straße mit einer Verknüpfung der Zwickauer Straße (eine direkte Anbindung an die Budapester Straße ist baulich ausgeschlossen, zudem soll eventuelle bauliche Entwicklungen nicht behindert werden) und in Verbindung mit einer eventuellen 3. Marienbrücke als äußerer Stadtring auswirkt. Dabei sind bauliche Realisierungsoptionen (Trassenführung, Höhen, Bauwerke, Baurecht), städtebauliche Aufwertungspotenziale sowie verkehrliche Entlastungen im 26er Ring allgemein aber auch in der Wilsdruffer Vorstadt, Friedrichstadt und an der Marienbrücke/ Könneritzstraße zu betrachten. Zudem sind bei der Planung eine geringe Trennwirkung der Straßenverbindung im Bereich des Grünzugs Weißeritz (mit Geh- und Radwegverbindung) sowie mögliche Konflikte aus bestehenden Bebauungs- und Entwicklungsplanungen zu berücksichtigen bzw. abzuwägen. Aufbauend auf den Ergebnissen ist die Notwendigkeit zur Flächenvorhaltung hinsichtlich von Kosten und Nutzen nochmals zu prüfen und ggf. im Zuge der Evaluierung anzupassen.

# Anbindung Kulturkraftwerk Mitte als Veranstaltungsort und Standort der Kreativwirtschaft

Das vorliegende Mobilitätskonzept zum Kulturkraftwerk ist vor dem Hintergrund der Erkenntnisse des VEP (z. B. Durchbindung Fröbelstraße) zu prüfen. Zudem bestehen noch Defizite in der nahräumlichen Einbindung in die Friedrichstadt sowie hinsichtlich der Erreichbarkeit im Veranstaltungsverkehr. Auch die ÖPNV-Erschließung sollte besonders bezüglich der Fußwege zu den Haltestellen geprüft werden. Zudem muss das Defizit fehlender Radverkehrsanlagen auf der Könneritzstraße sowie der Schäferstraße/ Schweriner Straße diskutiert werden.

# Anbindung Wissenschaftsstandort Dresden-Ost und Durchbindung von Liebstädter Straße und Tiergartenstraße

Aufgrund der aktuellen Entwicklungen in der Hochschullandschaft (Exzellenzinitiative des Bundes) muss für den Wissenschaftsstandort Dresden-Ost im Bereich Tiergartenstraße/ Grunaer Weg eine Untersuchung zu verkehrlichen Wirkungen erfolgen. Diese sollte umfassen:

Strukturszenarien (Studierendenzahlen, Beschäftigte, Bauvolumen usw.),
intermodale Effekte der Stadtbahn 2020 und einer „Stadtbahnlinie 61“ Strehlen – Blasewitz,
Potenziale der Verkehrsberuhigung am Wasaplatz/ Altstrehlen,
die Durchbindung der Liebstädter Straße bis zur Reicker Straße und in einer zweiten Stufe zur Dohnaer Straße in Varianten (mit und ohne Versatz Reicker Straße und in Verbindung mit einer Verlegung bzw. Anbindung der Lohrmannstraße) sowie
die Verlängerung der Tiergartenstraße bis zur Liebstädter Straße und in einer zweiten Stufe bis zur Oskar-Röder-Straße

# Verkehrliche Wirkung Masterplan „Leipziger Vorstadt – Neustädter Hafen“

Der Masterplan „Leipziger Vorstadt – Neustädter Hafen“ erfährt derzeit durch die Planungen für einen Großmarkt im Bereich des Alten Leipziger Bahnhofs massive Veränderungen. Gleichzeitig wird der erste Bauabschnitt der sogenannten HafenCity gebaut. Die jetzigen Verkehrsmengen im Bereich Anton/ Leipziger Straße sind schon heute kritisch. Deshalb muss untersucht werden, wie verkehrliche Verlagerungen bestandsnah aber auch mit ergänzenden Infrastrukturelementen (z. B. Direktanbindung Hansastraße, neuen Brückenverbindungen über die Elbe, einer Verbindung Erfurter Straße – Hansastraße (ggf. bis Stauffenbergallee), intermodale Ansätze, großräumige Verlagerungen auf die südliche Elbseite) realisiert werden können. Dabei müssen die Einflüsse aller Entwicklungen in Überlagerung ihrer jeweiligen Einzelwirkungen betrachtet werden. Es ist in diesem Zusammenhang sinnvoll, die Ziele und Maßnahmenansätze aus der bestehenden Untersuchung zum Dreyßigplatz/ Mickten (siehe Kapitel 6.9.2 bzw. Anlage 9) mit zu nutzen.

# Umgestaltung der Großen Meißner Straße – Köpckestraße am Neustädter Markt

Auch wenn Untersuchungen des Stadtplanungsamtes vom Mai 2007 zeigen, dass die Augustusbrücke als Netzelement des individuellen Kfz-Verkehrs verzichtbar ist, so ist derzeit noch nicht klar, ob eine Verringerung der massiven Barrierewirkungen der Großen Meißner Straße als städtebaulich und entwicklungsseitig unerwünschte Trennlinie zwischen Altstadt und Innerer Neustadt ohne aufwändige Tunnellösungen möglich ist. Dazu sind neben bestandsnahen Umgestaltungen auch Varianten denkbar, die nur noch eine zweistreifige Fahrbahn auf der Großen Meißner Straße und der Köpckestraße vorsehen, die aber in Knotenpunktsbereichen leistungsfähig sind. Dabei sind auch begleitende bauliche oder verkehrsorganisatorische Maßnahmen im Bereich Leipziger Straße (siehe auch vorheriger Stichpunkt), Schlesischer Platz/ Hainstraße sowie zur Abwicklung des

WBS

ÖPNV im Rahmen einer verkehrsplanerischen Untersuchung zu analysieren, die auch Verlags-
rungswirkungen und gestalterische Aspekte zum Neustädter Markt mit einbeziehen.

## Prüfung potenzieller westlicher Elbbrückenstandorte

Im Kapitel 6.9.6 wird differenziert auf den weiteren Umgang mit allen Dresdner Elbbrücken eingegangen (Bestand und Optionen). Die Ergebnisse aus Analyse- und Szenarienberechnungen zeigen, dass im Betrachtungshorizont des VEP keine verkehrliche Notwendigkeit neuer Brückenstandorte besteht und die finanziellen Handlungsspielräume bereits durch die Sanierungserfordernisse bestehender Bauwerke weitgehend erschöpft sein dürften.

Für die Sicherung strategischer Optionen und der dynamischen Stadtentwicklung ist es sinnvoll, grundlegende Anforderungen und Erkenntnisse zu potenziellen Brückenstandorten gerade im Bereich westlich der Innenstadt weitgehend aktuell vorzuhalten. Dabei sind Ziele zu definieren, die sich an den folgenden Punkten orientieren sollten:

ein hohes Maß integrierter verkehrlicher Sinnfälligkeit im Zusammenhang mit
Netzelementen und Anbindungen im MIV, ÖPNV, Rad- oder Fußgängerverkehr sowie
dem Verkehrszweck (Anbindung oder Verbindung, Freizeit- und Veranstaltungsverkehre/ allgemeiner Verkehr usw.)
konkrete und stadträumlich sinnvolle Entlastungswirkungen im Straßennetz (z. B. Neustädter Markt, Schlesischer Platz, Marienbrücke, Albertplatz) ohne Neubelastung sensibler Bereiche oder induktiver Wirkungen im Kfz-Verkehr

Hinsichtlich der Vielzahl bestehender westlicher Standortideen zwischen Kötzschenbroder Straße und Uferstraße soll eine integrierte verkehrliche Bewertung aller potenziellen Standorte erfolgen und dabei auch Fährverbindungen sowie Fragen von Investitionen und Betriebskosten mit betrachten. Vorliegende ältere Machbarkeitsuntersuchungen müssen dabei ergänzt werden (z. B. zur 3. Marienbrücke) bzw. neu entwickelt werden (Brücke Erfurter Straße). Einbezogen werden sollten auch alle bestehenden aktuellen Untersuchungen zu Brückenstandorten (auch nur für Fußgängerverkehr und Radverkehr sowie den ÖPNV) sowie die aktuellen Entwicklungsabsichten in der Leipziger Vorstadt und deren verkehrliche Wirkungen. Zudem sollte das ÖPNV-Netz sowie die Netze von Rad- und Fußgängerverkehr hinsichtlich von Netzergänzungen mit betrachtet werden werden.

## Prüfung von Verkehrsführungen im Bereich Stübelallee/ Karcherallee/ Zwinglistraße

Die derzeitige Einrichtungsführung von stadtgerichtetem Kfz-Verkehr von der Zwinglistraße in die Stübelallee führt zu Problemen bei der Verkehrsabwicklung in der Gegenrichtung durch die sogenannte „kleine“ Bodenbacher Straße, die vor allem durch Wohnnutzung geprägt ist. Eine verkehrliche Untersuchung sollte zeigen, welche Optionen der Verkehrsführung geeignet sind, diese

Hauptnetzelemente verkehrlich leistungsfähig aber auch umwelt- und umfeldverträglich besser zu verbinden. Dazu gehören auch Fragestellungen der Knotenpunktausbildung Stübelallee/ Zwinglistraße und Karcherallee/ Stübelallee/ Bertolt-Brecht-Allee und die damit verbundenen Aussagen aus der Nachher-Untersuchung zur Waldschlößchenbrücke (siehe Kapitel 5.6). Auf Basis der Ergebnisse ist im Zuge der Evaluierung dann festzulegen, ob eine Umplanung langfristig vorzunehmen ist und die Straßenkategorisierung in diesem Bereich angepasst werden muss.

## Verkehrswirkung S 177 im Süden des Dresdner Hochlands

Der Straßenzug Quohrener Straße - Schönfelder Landstraße - Gönnsdorfer Straße - Cunnersdorfer Straße - Bühlauer Straße - Pirnaer Straße bewirkt durch die Inbetriebnahme der S 177 im Bereich Eschdorf/ Schullwitz Veränderungen der Verkehrsnachfrage und der Verkehrsverteilung (B 6 und S 177). Auf Grund der baulichen Gegebenheiten in den Ortslagen können ggf. verkehrliche Konflikte verstärkt werden. Deshalb sind die dortigen verkehrlichen Entwicklungen durch fachliche Analysen regelmäßig zu prüfen. Bei Erfordernis sind im Zuge der Evaluierung des VEP Maßnahmenvorschläge einzubringen, die die möglicherweise auftretenden Probleme vermeiden.

## 5.8 Flächenvorhaltung für Verkehrsinfrastruktur

### 5.8.1 Überblick

Auf strategischer Ebene müssen für bereits als erforderlich erkannte Infrastruktur, aber auch für Langfristoptionen Flächen vorgehalten und in die Bauleit- bzw. Flächennutzungsplanung überführt werden. Dies sichert die langfristige Handlungsfähigkeit der Stadt Dresden sowie in den Außenbereichen auch interkommunale Maßnahmenansätze. Dabei ist eine Differenzierung der Flächenvorhaltungen nach:

Maßnahmen mit bestehendem Stadtratsbeschluss bzw. einer absehbaren Umsetzung durch Bund, Freistaat oder der DB Netz AG bis 2025,
weiteren Maßnahmen aus dem Verkehrsentwicklungsplan sowie
Langfristoptionen auch für den Zeitbereich nach 2025.

Für Maßnahmen mit Baurecht erfolgt keine Ausweisung, da deren Flächen als gesichert gelten müssen.

Die Differenzierung erfolgt zudem hinsichtlich der Verkehrsträger Kfz-Verkehr mit dem Straßennetz und Wegeverbindungen sowie ÖPNV. Dabei ist zu berücksichtigen, dass die Flächenvorhaltung von Faktoren wie der Einordnung des Gebietes, den bestehenden Nutzungen und eventuellen Schutzgütern abhängig ist, die im Zuge des VEP-Prozesses nicht geprüft werden können.

Seite 107
Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus
Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil C: Mobilitätsstrategie 2025plus
WV
WBS

Naturgemäß ist bei allen innerstädtischen Flächenvorhaltungen und besonders bei Brückenstandorten von Standortproblemen und Schutzgut- sowie Nutzungskonflikten auszugehen. Ob eine Maßnahme aus der Flächenvorhaltung auch umgesetzt werden kann, bedarf in jedem Fall einer individuellen und kriterienbasierten Prüfung auf Basis der verkehrlichen Leitziele, sofern nicht bereits aus anderen Gründen eine Umsetzungsabsicht besteht. Jede Flächenvorhaltung sollte zudem regelmäßig auf Sinnfälligkeit geprüft werden, da sie stets auch die Interessen privater und öffentlicher Eigentümerinnen und Eigentümer berührt und Entwicklungsoptionen beeinflusst.

## 5.8.2 Verkehrliche Flächenvorhaltung im Kfz-Verkehr sowie bei Straßen und Wegen

Die verkehrliche Flächenvorhaltung bezieht sich hier auf Straßenverbindungen, Brückenstandorte sowie Wegverbindungen. Dabei werden die bereits beschlossenen Maßnahmen zum Straßennetz („Sowieso-Maßnahmen“) ebenso einbezogen wie die Maßnahmen des VEP und langfristige Entwicklungsoptionen.

## Flächenfreihaltung aus Maßnahmen mit bestehendem Stadtratsbeschluss bzw. einer bis 2025 geplanten Umsetzung durch Bund oder Freistaat

# Flächenvorhaltung als Langfristoptionen

Sicherung des Umfeldes des Blauen Wunder für Interimsquerungen im Zuge von Sanierung oder Sperrung,

Sicherung von Teilen der Übigauer Güterbahn als Radtrasse.

Die Verbindungsspange zwischen Lohmener- und Söbrigener Straße östlich der Dampfschiffstraße ist momentan bereits in der Endphase der Bebauungsplanung.

Für den ruhenden Verkehr sollten innerhalb von Wohnquartieren aber auch gewerblichen Standorten und ÖPNV-Verknüpfungspunkten (P+R) bei entsprechend nachgewiesener Notwendigkeit Flächen freigehalten werden. Dies betrifft bestehende Stadtbereiche mit hohem Parkdruck aber auch neu zu entwickelnde Bereiche. In diese Flächenfreihaltungen ist auch der Bedarf an Carsharing-Stellplätzen zu berücksichtigen.

Die einzelnen Trassen für die Flächenvorhaltung für Straßen und Wege sind in Abbildung 22 dargestellt. Im Vergleich zum Verkehrskonzept 2003 (aktualisiert 2009) wird deutlich, dass be-

Seite 109

LVM
WBS

dingt durch den aktuellen Landesverkehrsplan 2025 im Staatstraßennetz deutlich weniger Trassenoptionen eingeordnet sind. Für P+R-Anlagen siehe Kapitel 6.6.8 sowie Abbildung 14.

Auch innerhalb Dresdens wurden langfristig nur die Trassenoptionen in der Flächenvorhaltung berücksichtigt, deren Umsetzbarkeit und Zweckmäßigkeit den Leitzielen der Verkehrsentwicklung nicht grundsätzlich entgegensteht. Eine zumeist historisch gewachsene Flächenvorhaltung ohne eine aus heutiger Sicht substanzielle Begründung behindert die Stadtentwicklung. In einigen Bereichen haben auch die baulichen Realitäten sowie die Anforderungen des Hochwasserschutzes nach der Flut 2002 Trassenoptionen nahezu unmöglich gemacht (z. B. 3. Marienbrücke durch Globus und Flutschutztor). Aber auch neue Erkenntnisse zu verkehrlichen Wirkungen und Anlagen mussten hier zu Veränderungen gegenüber älteren Konzepten führen (z. B. Entfall des Brückenstandorts Thomas-Müntzer-Platz durch den Bau der Waldschlößchenbrücke im direkten Umfeld sowie kein Brückenstandort Niederpoyritz auf Grund massiver Konflikte, siehe auch Kapitel 6.9.6 zum Blauen Wunder).

## 5.8.3 Flächenvorhaltung für den ÖPNV

Im Bereich des ÖPNV bezieht sich die Flächenvorhaltung insbesondere auf den Schienenverkehr und Stadtbahntrassen sowie deren Haltepunkte und Verknüpfungspunkte. In die Flächenvorhaltung wurde der Stadtratsbeschluss für das Stadtbahnkonzept 2020 sowie die beschlossenen weiteren Optionen von Stadtbahntrassen („Prioritätenliste Straßenbahn-Neubaustrecken“, Beschluss SR/011/2010) vollständig aufgenommen und punktuell um die Ansätze des VEP ergänzt.

# 5.9 Monitoring und Evaluation

Für das Monitoring von Entwicklungen im Verkehrsbereich der Stadt Dresden sowie für die Eignungsprüfung von Maßnahmen, die über das bislang untersuchte Maßnahmenspektrum des VEP 2025plus hinausgehen, werden Verfahrensansätze benötigt, die möglichst weitgehend standardisiert ablaufen. Ziel ist es, auf möglichst objektiver Basis Wirkungen und Entwicklungen schnell zu erkennen, bei Bedarf steuernd oder beeinflussend einzugreifen und dabei die „richtigen“ Maßnahmen anzuwenden.

Entsprechend der unterschiedlichen Fragestellungen können folgende Anlässe unterschieden werden:

Eignungsprüfung neuer Maßnahmen auf Passgenauigkeit zu den Leitzielen des VEP bzw. den daraus abgeleiteten Bewertungsindikatoren sowie Eignungsprüfung bereits ausgewählter, jedoch noch nicht umgesetzter Maßnahmen auf unveränderte Passgenauigkeit (mit der Folge ggf. anzupassender Prioritätenreihung).
Kontinuierliches Monitoring von Entwicklungen im Verkehrsbereich („gehen die Wirkungen der umgesetzten Maßnahmen in die richtige Richtung“?) mit periodischer Bilanzierung („was ist erreicht worden“?, „wo stehen wir heute“?),
Anlassbezogenes Monitoring im Sinne einer Nachher-Betrachtung ausgewählter Einzelmaßnahmen („wirkt die Einzelmaßnahme an den Stellen und in dem Umfang wie erwartet?“).

Das kontinuierliche und bilanzierende Monitoring sowie die Eignungsprüfung von Maßnahmen auf Passgenauigkeit können nach individuellen, jedoch weitgehend standardisierten Regeln ablaufen. Die hierfür geeigneten Verfahrensansätze sollen soweit wie möglich:

Vorgehensweisen, die bei der Erstellung des VEP 2025plus angewandt wurden, entsprechen,
Angebots- und Nachfragekennwerte, die im Rahmen des VEP ermittelt wurden, aufgreifen und fortschreiben,
auf kontinuierlich verfügbaren Informationen aufbauen, um zusätzliche Erhebungen zu vermeiden.

Demgegenüber erfordert das anlassbezogene Monitoring einzelner Maßnahmen wegen der Unterschiedlichkeit von Art, Zielstellung und Umfang der Maßnahme eine an den jeweils betrachteten Einzelfall angepasste Monitoringmethode, z. B. als Vergleich modellmäßig ermittelter Werte mit tatsächlich gemessenen Werten. Hierfür lassen sich vorab keine standardisierten Verfahrensansätze formulieren.

# Kontinuierliches Monitoring von Entwicklungen im Verkehrsbereich

Das kontinuierliche Monitoring von Entwicklungen im Verkehrsbereich verfolgt das Ziel, eventuelle Abweichungen der realen Entwicklung von den Zielstellungen des VEP frühzeitig zu erkennen und bei Bedarf gegenzusteuern. Dazu wird ein Indikatorengerüst erforderlich, anhand dessen sich Veränderungen/Entwicklungen nachweisen lassen. Die angestrebte Entwicklungsrichtung sowie die angestrebten Entwicklungsziele benennt der VEP.

Die aus heutiger Sicht relevanten Monitoring-Indikatoren und ihre Datenquellen, Erhebungszeiträume und Anwendungsbezüge sind in Tabelle 2 aufgeführt. Die Indikatorenliste ist nicht abschließend und wird in der konkreten Anwendung fortgeschrieben. Das Monitoring unterstreicht zudem die Bedeutung einer kontinuierlichen Teilnahme von Stadt und Region Dresden am System repräsentativer Verkehrsverhaltensbefragungen (SrV) - nicht nur zur Quantifizierung zahlreicher Kriterien sondern auch zur Aktualisierung und Fortschreibung des Verkehrsmodells der Stadt Dresden. Zudem gehören dazu die regelmäßige Erhebung von Verkehrsbelastungen im Straßennetz nach Fahrzeugarten und Radverkehrsmengen und die Ausweitung der Analysen auch auf ausgewählte Nebennetzstrecken.

Entscheidend bei der Auswahl geeigneter Monitoring-Indikatoren ist eine möglichst weitgehende Abdeckung der thematischen Breite des VEP ebenso wie die Datenverfügbarkeit. Um den Monitoringaufwand in vertretbaren Grenzen zu halten, muss weitgehend auf ohnehin vorhandene Informationen zurückgegriffen werden. Diese müssen von der für das Monitoring zuständigen Stelle gesammelt, aufbereitet und ausgewertet werden. Voraussetzung ist die Kooperation der verschiedenen Dateneigner und eine periodische Datenaktualisierung. Hierfür werden Konventionen entwickelt und vereinbart.

Das Monitoring ist ein periodisch wiederkehrender, vom Zeitaufwand aber begrenzter, punktueller Prozess. Untersuchungstiefe und Aufwand des Monitorings werden zudem durch den Detaillierungsgrad des VEP begrenzt.

Diese Kontrolle der schrittweisen Umsetzung erfolgt für die Ziele der Verkehrsentwicklung anhand von Indikatoren, welche die Zielerreichung messbar machen. Diese Evaluierung ist dem Stadtrat der Landeshauptstadt Dresden zusammen mit dem Straßenzustandsbericht beginnend ab 2017 im 3-Jahres-Rhythmus vorzulegen.

Gleichzeitig kann im Sinne einer Bewertung erörtert werden, ob ggf. über neue/ modifizierte Ziele, Maßnahmenprioritäten oder Maßnahmen nachgedacht werden soll. Dabei sollte im Rahmen einer interpretierenden Bewertung allerdings versucht werden, maßnahmenbedingte Effekte von ggf. vorhandenen globalen Einflüssen (z. B. Einwohnerentwicklung über die derzeit prognostizierten Zahlen hinaus⁸, Altersentwicklung, Wirtschaftsentwicklung, allgemeine Lohn- und Preisentwicklung) so gut wie möglich zu trennen. Dies wird dadurch unterstützt, dass diese allgemeinen Entwicklungen als Rahmendaten im Kontext neben die spezifischen Entwicklungen der Indikatoren gestellt werden.

Die Dreijahresbilanz sollte (soweit verfügbar) um überregionale Vergleiche mit anderen Städten vergleichbarer Größe ergänzt werden, um die Entwicklungen in Dresden an den Entwicklungen in anderen Städten, die möglicherweise eine ähnliche, ggf. auch eine unterschiedliche Entwicklungsstrategie verfolgen, zu spiegeln. Dabei könnte insbesondere auf SrV-Daten zurückgegriffen werden.

Nicht nur das Indikatorengerüst des Monitorings, sondern auch das vorgeschlagene Monitoring- und Evaluationskonzept sollte unter Einbeziehung nationaler und europäischer Erkenntnisse überprüft und bei Bedarf fortgeschrieben werden.

# Prüfung neuer Maßnahmen auf Passgenauigkeit (Eignungsprüfung)

Die (Erst-) Bewertung neuer Maßnahmen folgt dem Verfahren der Maßnahmenbewertung und Prioritätenreihung im Rahmen des VEP 2025plus (vgl. Kap. 2.6). Hierfür steht ein speziell entwickeltes Excel-Tool zur Verfügung, welches sämtliche qualitativen Bewertungsindikatoren enthält und die Einordnung einer Maßnahme in Prioritätenklassen durch entsprechende Parametrisierungen und Verknüpfungen automatisch generiert. Die Excel-Tabelle kann bei Bedarf um zusätzliche Indikatoren erweitert werden.

Von einer möglichst großen Zahl Fachkundiger sind im Sinne der Delphi-Methode unabhängig voneinander für jede untersuchte neue Maßnahme Einstufungen in Wirksamkeits-, Betroffenheits- und Kostenklassen durchzuführen, anschließend zu plausibilisieren und ggf. zu mitteln. Solange

⁸ Im Beschluss zum Vorzugsszenario (SB/055/2012) wurde in Punkt 4 auf ein Szenario mit „mehr als 550.000 Einwohnern“ verbunden mit einer verkehrlichen Schwachstellenanalyse verwiesen, das zu erarbeiten ist – die entsprechende Schwachstellenanalyse sollte Gegenstand der VEP-Evaluierung sein, sobald solche Entwicklungen zeitlich konkret eingeordnet werden können und Entwicklungswerte konkreter zu benennen sind.

dabei die im Rahmen des VEP vorgewählten Klasseneinteilungen und Gewichtungen nicht verändert werden, sind vergleichbare Ergebnisse zu erwarten.

Entsprechend sollten von Zeit zu Zeit alle bereits ausgewählten, jedoch bislang noch nicht umgesetzten Maßnahmen auf unveränderte Passgenauigkeit zu den Zielen des VEP überprüft werden. Veränderte Rahmenbedingungen oder neuere Erkenntnisse über Maßnahmenakzeptanz oder Maßnahmewirkungen können durchaus zu einer geänderten Prioritätenreihung von Maßnahmen führen, die kurz vor der Umsetzung stehen.

# 6. Handlungskonzept 2025

## 6.1 Vorbemerkungen

Das Handlungskonzept 2025 baut auf den verfolgenswerten Maßnahmenansätzen des Vorzugs-szenarios auf und nutzt die Mobilitätsstrategie für die Auswahl von Maßnahmen, die im Zeitraum bis 2025/ 2030 umgesetzt werden sollten. Das Handlungskonzept enthält:

zentrale stadträumliche Maßnahmen des VEP mit nachgewiesener Wirkung im Sinne der verkehrlichen Leitziele der Stadt,
als priorär und sinnvoll bewertete Maßnahmen,
Pilotprojekte auf Basis der Mobilitätsstrategie sowie
bereits beschlossene und wirkungsgeprüfte Maßnahmen bis 2025.

Für die die Maßnahmenentwicklung im Handlungskonzept müssen bestimmte Grundannahmen getroffen werden, die sich zum einen aus den Leitzielen ergeben und zum anderen unabdingbare technische Notwendigkeiten darstellen, deren Infragestellung unüberschaubare Konsequenzen hätte. Daraus wird ersichtlich, mit welchem Maß an „Selbstverständlichkeit“ bestehende Netze und Angebote genutzt werden. Diese bestandsorientierten Annahmen stellen vor dem Hintergrund der erforderlichen Finanzierung große Herausforderungen dar. Ein Negativszenario mit sinkenden Netz- und Angebotsqualitäten widerspräche den Leitzielen der zukünftigen Verkehrsentwicklung.

Das Handlungskonzept baut so auf folgenden Grundannahmen auf:

Die freie Wahl des Verkehrsmittels bleibt erhalten und die Mobilität bleibt für den Großteil der Dresdner Bevölkerung bezahlbar.
Die Stadtstraßen sind in der Regel sicher durch Kfz, Rad- und Fußgängerverkehr benutzbar, der ÖPNV-Betrieb wird weiterhin zum überwiegenden Teil durch die Fahrpreiserlöse finanziert.
Die bestehende Straßeninfrastruktur (auch die der Brücken) sowie die LSA-Steuerungssysteme werden adäquat unterhalten und das bestehende Verkehrsmanagement-system wird weiter betrieben.
Das Parkraummanagement wird fortgeführt.
Es wird keine Kfz-Citymaut eingeführt und eine Umweltzone ist nicht erforderlich.
Die Finanzierungsstruktur des Dresdner Nahverkehrs ist stabil und das bestehende Stadtbahn- und Busangebot bleibt erhalten.
Die Fahrzeugbeschaffung der DVB AG kann trotz veränderter Förderrahmenbedingungen noch entsprechend der Nachfrageentwicklung (auch im Dresdner Schülerverkehr) erfolgen.

Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus
Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025

V

Investitionen in den Substanzerhalt des städtischen ÖPNV können weiter durchgeführt werden und der S-Bahn-Betrieb ist in heutiger Qualität gesichert.

Die dargestellten Annahmen waren auch Grundlage für die Szenarienberechnungen (vgl. dazu auch Kapitel 3). Eine Übersicht wichtiger Maßnahmen liegt tabellarisch als Anlage 6.2 bei. Dem Handlungskonzept vorangestellt sind Maßnahmen, für die seitens externer Planungsträger (Landesamt für Straßenbau und Verkehr, DB Netz AG u. a.) umgesetzt werden oder durch den Stadtrat in Dresden seit 2003 beschlossen worden sind. Diese werden verkürzt als „Sowieso-Maßnahmen“ bezeichnet (siehe folgendes Kapitel).

Ergänzend zu den „Sowieso-Maßnahmen“ sind die spezifischen Maßnahmen des VEP zu sehen, die sich in die bereits beschriebenen strategischen Ansätze sowie in konkrete Empfehlungen im Handlungskonzept 2025 untergliedern. Redundanzen bei der Beschreibung sind dabei nicht vermeidbar, da strategische Ansätze in vielen Fällen auch als konkrete Maßnahme in das Handlungskonzept überführt wurden. Die Maßnahmen des Handlungskonzepts sind auf einen Horizont 2025/2030 angelegt und umfassen zu einem großen Teil auch nicht-investive Maßnahmen sowie Ansätze zu Innovation, regionaler Kooperation, Verkehrssicherheit etc. Auf Grund ihres prinzipiellen Charakters sind Maßnahmen der Flächenvorhaltung sowie Innovationsansätze separat am Ende von Anlage 6.2 aufgeführt. Alle beschriebenen Maßnahmen bedürfen auf Grund des konzeptionellen Charakters des Dokuments stets einer tieferen planerischen Durcharbeitung und Prüfung sowie ggf. auch einer verkehrsrechtlichen Bewertung, die dabei jeweils lokale Ermessensspielräume einbeziehen und die beschlossenen Dresdner Leitziele der Verkehrsentwicklung berücksichtigen sollte. Zudem ist zu berücksichtigen, dass sich rechtliche, technische und formale Rahmenbedingungen auch in Zukunft verändern werden, sodass sich Sicht und Bewertung auf bestimmte Maßnahmen verändern können. Diese Prozesse sind im Zuge der Evaluierung des VEP zu berücksichtigen.

## 6.2 Extern geplante Maßnahmen bzw. Maßnahmen mit Stadtratsbeschluss

## („Sowieso-Maßnahmen“)

In Dresden sind seit der Gültigkeit des Verkehrskonzepts 2003 seitens des Stadtrats verschiedene bauliche Maßnahmen im Verkehrsbereich beschlossen, aber noch nicht umgesetzt worden. Gleichzeitig sind im aktuellen Bundesverkehrswegeplan sowie im Landesverkehrsplan 2025 Infrastrukturmaßnahmen im Dresdner Umfeld benannt, deren Umsetzung begonnen wurde oder deren Verkehrswirksamkeit im Horizont des VEP 2025 zu erwarten ist. Bauliche Maßnahmen dieser Art

sind für die kommunale Verkehrsplanung im Rahmen des VEP per Definition verbindlich,
entfalten deutliche Wirkungen auf das Verkehrssystem,
genügen den Ausgewogenheitsanforderungen des VEP und
sind teils mit hohen Kosten für die Landeshauptstadt aber auch für Bund, Land und ÖPNV-Aufgabenträger verbunden.

Diese Maßnahmen sind deshalb im VEP sowohl bei der Szenarienbildung (siehe Kapitel 3) als auch im Strategie- und Handlungskonzept berücksichtigt und werden im VEP-Prozess der Einfachheit halber zusammenfassend „Sowieso-Maßnahmen“ genannt. Maßnahmen der Verkehrssicherheit sind ebenfalls Maßnahmen, deren Umsetzung nicht zur Disposition steht. Auf diese Maßnahmen wird nochmals detailliert in Kapitel 6.9.4 eingegangen. Gleichzeitig wird bei allen Diskussionen und Darstellungen davon ausgegangen, dass die Waldschlößchenbrücke und die mit ihr zusammenhängenden Maßnahmen in 2013 wirksam werden. Die einzelnen Maßnahmen sind in Abbildung 4 als „Maßnahmen mit Stadtratsbeschluss* sowie geplante Maßnahmen externer Baulastträger“ soweit möglich dargestellt. Zudem enthält Anlage 2 in Teil 4 die jeweiligen Beschlüsse mit Titel und Beschlussnummer.

Hinzuweisen ist noch auf den Umstand, dass das Stadtbahnprogramm 2020 auf Grundlage der aktuellen Beschlusslage mit allen 3 Strecken in die Maßnahmen integriert wurde, aber derzeit nur die Förderung von 2 Strecken in Aussicht gestellt ist. Aufgrund der aktuellen stark zentrumsorientierten Stadtentwicklung und der erforderlichen Beseitigung stadträumlicher Defizitbereiche in Plauen und Johannstadt ist die gleichberechtigte Berücksichtigung aller 3 Stadtbahnprojekte von großer Wichtigkeit.

Im Einzelnen sind als „Sowieso-Maßnahmen“ mit Stadtratsbeschluss bzw. Planung und Umsetzung durch externe Akteure die folgenden Maßnahmen zu benennen:

# Vom Stadtrat beschlossene Maßnahmen im ÖPNV

Stadtbahnprogramm 2020: Stadtbahnstrecke Löbtau - Strehlen mit Anpassungen von Infrastruktur/ Angebot sowie Um- und Ausbau im Straßennetz und an der Haltestelle Tharandter Straße (Ausbau als Kfz-freie Zentralhaltestelle Kesselsdorfer Straße),
Stadtbahnprogramm 2020: Stadtbahnstrecke Johannstadt - Plauen mit Anpassungen von Infrastruktur und Angebot (u. a. im Bereich Budapester Straße) sowie Um- und Ausbau im Straßennetz unter Beibehalt bestehender Kapazitäten,
Stadtbahnprogramm 2020: Stadtbahnstrecke Bühlau - Weißig mit Anpassungen von Infrastruktur und Angebot.

# Beschlossene Maßnahmen im Fuß- und Radverkehr

Umsetzung der Fußwegekonzeption für die Dresdner Innenstadt,
Umsetzung des Radverkehrskonzepts Innenstadt von 2009,
abschnittsweiser Ausbau des Elberad- und Gehweg zwischen Blauem Wunder und Albertbrücke.

# Beschlossene Maßnahmen zur Verkehrssicherheit

Derzeit liegt ein Stadtratsbeschluss zur Umsetzung der Empfehlungen des Verkehrssicherheitskonzeptes 2010 vor, der auch finanziell hinterlegt ist. Weitere Ansätze zur Erhöhung der Verkehrssicherheit sind als Maßnahmen im Handlungskonzept (vgl. ab Kapitel 6) aufgeführt. Wichtige Bestandteile zur Verbesserung der Verkehrssicherheit sind das Gehwegprogramm des STA sowie das Radverkehrskonzept Innenstadt. Beide Dokumente enthalten eine Vielzahl von Maßnahmen, die die Verkehrssicherheit verbessern können.

# Rahmenmaßnahmen des Landesverkehrsplanung zum Eisenbahnverkehr

Die Maßnahmen zu transeuropäischen Korridoren (TEN-V), die z. B. die Aus- bzw. Neubaustrecke Berlin - Dresden - Prag aber auch Maßnahmen der Bundesverkehrswegeplanung wie z. B. der Bau der Schnellfahrstrecken Halle/ Leipzig - Erfurt - Nürnberg, Dresden - Leipzig und Dresden - Berlin, die Elektrifizierung Dresden - Görlitz sowie die Gütermagistrale Hoyerswerda - Horka haben mittelbar eine positive Wirkung auf die Erreichbarkeit Dresdens. Sie werden hier nicht vertieft betrachtet, da sie bereits in die Landesverkehrsplanung Sachsen aufgenommen wurden.

# 6.3 Fernverkehr

In Dresden konnten in den letzten Jahren deutliche Verbesserungen in Bezug auf die Fernverkehrsanbindungen erreicht werden. Sowohl im Schienenverkehr als auch bei den Bundesautobahnen wurden die Anbindungen durch Aus- und Umbaumaßnahmen verbessert. Kürzere Reisezeiten im Fernverkehr konnten dadurch vor allem für den Kfz-Verkehr und den Fernbusverkehr erreicht werden, der trotz fehlendem zentralen Busbahnhof direkte Verbindungen zu den Flughäfen in Berlin und Prag, aber auch zu anderen Zielen herstellt. Viele Ausbauprojekte im Eisenbahnbereich hingegen (z. B. die Strecken nach Leipzig, Berlin oder Nürnberg) sind starken Verzögerungen ausgesetzt.

In den Leitzielen ist die weitere Optimierung der Fernenreichbarkeit Dresdens verankert, die auch die Dresdner Brückenfunktion nach Polen und Tschechien betont. Die Maßnahmen zu transeuropäischen Korridoren (TEN-V), wie z. B. die Maßnahme einer direkten Neubaustrecke Dresden – Prag, aber auch Maßnahmen der Bundesverkehrswegeplanung wie z. B. der Bau der Schnellfahrstrecken Halle/ Leipzig – Erfurt – Nürnberg, Dresden – Leipzig und Dresden – Berlin, die Elektrifizierung Dresden – Görlitz sowie die Gütermagistrale Hoyerswerda – Horka haben mittelbar eine Wirkung auch auf die Erreichbarkeit Dresdens. Sie werden hier nicht vertieft betrachtet, da sie bereits in die Landesverkehrsplanung Sachsen aufgenommen wurden.

Dennoch sind im VEP folgende Maßnahmen im Wesentlichen als Aufgabe für Politik und Verwaltung im Sinne der Wahrnehmung Dresdner Interessen in den entsprechenden Bundes- und Landesgremien vorgesehen:

Hinwirken auf eine Beschleunigung und Verbesserung der Bahnanbindungen Dresdens in Richtung Berlin/ Flughafen BER, Leipzig, Frankfurt/ Main, Nürnberg, München, Prag und Breslau mit entsprechend hochwertigen Angeboten/ Produkten,
Erhalt der Elbe als Binnenwasserstraße 1. Ordnung mit dem Alberthafen als trimodale Schnittstelle,
Sicherung des Flughafens Dresden in seiner Bedeutung für Güterverkehr und Wirtschaft sowie Geschäftsreiseverkehr und Tourismus.

## 6.4 Straßennetz und Kfz-Verkehr

### 6.4.1 Überblick

Für das Straßennetz werden verschiedene ergänzende Maßnahmen im Handlungskonzept verankert, die auf dem Gedanken eines konsistenten und leistungsfähigen Netzes beruhen und dabei entlastende Wirkungen in verkehrlich übernutzten, defizitären Stadträumen schaffen und Verkehrsverlagern. Die Maßnahmen sind so angelegt, dass von Ihnen weitgehend keine kapazitäts-teigernde bzw. verkehrsinduzierende Wirkung für die zentralen Stadtbereiche ausgeht.

In diesem Kapitel werden alle die Maßnahmen benannt, die primär auf den Kfz-Verkehr ausgerichtet sind. Zentrale stadträumliche Maßnahmen mit verkehrlich integrierten und stadtqualitativen Ansätzen sind im Kapitel 6.9.1 dargestellt.

### 6.4.2 Netzergänzungen

Die in Umsetzung befindlichen Maßnahmen wurden als „Sowieso-Maßnahmen“ in Kapitel 6.2 bzw. Abbildung 4 bereits beschrieben. Es sind in Kurzform:

der Anschluss des Verkehrszugs Waldschlößchenbrücke ans Straßen-, Geh- und Radwegenetz mit Anpassungen im Busnetz,
der Neubau großer Teile der S 177 zwischen Pirna, Radeberg und der BAB A 4 bei Leppersdorf und
der Neubau der S191n von Goppeln bis zur B 170.

Weitere durch den Dresdner Stadtrat seit 2003 beschlossene bzw. extern geplante Maßnahmen im Straßennetz (siehe Kapitel 6.2 bzw. Abbildung 4) sind die Folgenden:

Sanierung und Verbreiterung der Albertbrücke und Ausbau der angrenzenden Knotenpunkte,
Neubau der B 6n als Ortsumfahrung Cossebaude,
Fertigstellung der S 84n Cossebaude - Meißen (bis 3. BA),
Ausbau der Königsbrücker Straße,
Lückenschluss am Emerich-Ambros-Ufer im Bereich Altcotta,
vierstreifiger Ausbau der Hamburger Straße mit ÖPNV-Verknüpfungspunk Dresden-Cotta,
Knotenpunktausbau Magdeburger Straße/ Weißeritzstraße als 1. Stufe eines vierspurigem Ausbau bis zur Bremer Straße,

VAS

Auf die genannten Maßnahmen hat der VEP keinen direkten Einfluss, da diese auch ohne den VEP umgesetzt werden würden. Die Maßnahmen wurden aber hinsichtlich Ihrer Kosten und Ihrer Wirkungen im Zuge des VEP bewertet (siehe Kapitel 4). Gerade von den Maßnahmen der Ortsumfahrung Cossebaude mit der B 6n, den Netzergänzungen im Dresdner Westen (Emerich-Ambros-Ufer) sowie der S 177 werden Entlastungseffekte für zentrale Bereiche erwartet. Sie sind zudem auch Grundlage dafür, künftig alle Bundesstraßen in Dresden außerhalb des 26er Rings führen zu können, was wiederum eine zentrale Forderung aus der Luftreinhalteplanung ist.

Weitere VEP-Maßnahmen für den Bereich Straßennetz setzen sich aus funktionalen und baulichen Maßnahmen zusammen. Schwerpunkt der Maßnahmen sind hier Verbesserungen für den Wirtschaftsverkehr. Diese sind im Einzelnen:

Sicherung und Ausbau des Kfz-Vorrangnetzes auf Basis des vorliegenden Netzes von 2003 zur Bündelung von Verkehren auf leistungsfähigen Straßenachsen und Sicherung der Erreichbarkeit im Personen- und Wirtschaftsverkehr und Anpassung der Kategorisierung des Straßennetzes unter Berücksichtigung der Kategorien aus der Bauleitplanung und der Richtlinie für integrierte Netze (RIN) – siehe dazu insbesondere Kapitel 6.4.3.
Neubau der AS Weixdorf an die A 4 und Anbindung zum Gewerbegebiet Promigberg.
Bau der Querspange Sporbitz zwischen Sporbitz (interkommunales Gewerbegebiet Dresden/Heidenau) und Luga/ S 172 (östlich Großluga) als zweistreifige Stadtstraße zur Anbindung des Gewerbegebietes an die B 172 und die A 17 (Maßnahme ist unabhängig vom nicht weiter verfolgten Bau der Ortsumfahrung Großluga).
Zweistreifige Durchbindung der Fröbelstraße bis zur Freiberger Straße und Rosenstraße zur Verbesserung der Wirtschaftsverkehrsanbindung der Gewerbegebiete Rosenstraße an die Westtangente/ Coventrystraße, teilweise Entlastung des 26er Ring zwischen Marienbrücke und Schäferstraße und zugleich städtebauliche Aufwertung im Bereich Weißeritzstraße gemäß Stadtentwicklungskonzept. Hier besteht allerdings hinsichtlich einer möglichst geringen Trennwirkung bei der Querung des Grünzugs Weißeritz sowie der verkehrlichen Wirkungen noch vertiefender Untersuchungsbedarf, der auch eine mögliche Verbindung bis zur Bayerischen Straße und ggf. eine Anbindung der Zwickauer Straße berücksichtigen muss. Ein grundhafter Ausbau der Zwickauer Straße bis zur Würzburger Straße wäre dann besonders wichtig, wenn die Stadtbahntrasse entlang der Chemnitzer Straße umgesetzt wird und Kfz-Verkehr verlagert werden soll.
Ausbau der Stauffenbergallee von der Königsbrücker Straße bis zur Radeburger Straße.
Umsetzung bestandsnaher, organisatorischer und ggf. baulicher Maßnahmen zur Vermeidung von Verkehr durch Wohngebiete im Zuge der Verkehrswirksamkeit der Waldschlößchenbrücke auf Basis fundierter Nachher-Analysen u. a. in den Bereichen Comeniusplatz, Fetscherplatz, Blasewitzer/ Fetscherstraße, Müller-Berset-Straße/ Bertold-Brecht-Allee (Ausbau am KP geplant), Wormser Straße und Marienallee.

WBS

Auch die Gestaltung des ehemaligen Güterbahnhofs Dresden-Friedrichstadt als Logistikstandort mit bimodalen Güterverkehrszentrum, der Erhalt noch bestehender industrieller Anschlussbahnflächen und der Erhalt der Elbe als Binnenwasserstraße 1. Ordnung mit dem Alberthafen als trimodaler Schnittstelle wirken mittelbar auf die Ausrichtung des Straßennetzes. Zum Wirtschaftsverkehr und der Lkw-Führung siehe Kapitel 6.5.

Die Maßnahmen im Straßennetz sind in **Abbildung 5** dargestellt.

## 6.4.3 Netzsystematik und Straßenkategorien

Für die Umsetzung von Anforderungen an Verkehrsqualität, Verknüpfungen oder Führungsformen ist es erforderlich, ein konsistentes, klassifiziertes und kategorisiertes städtisches Hauptstraßennetz auszuweisen, das mit seinen Maschen auch die Grenzen von funktionalen Stadtbereichen definiert. Mit diesem Ansatz ist auch eine Bündelung des Straßenverkehrs möglich, was der Erhaltung und Ausgestaltung der Verkehrsberuhigung in Wohnquartieren dient und zur Verstetigung des Verkehrsflusses sowie zur Verminderung von Schleichverkehr beiträgt. Die dafür erforderlichen Kategorisierungen werden in Kapitel 5.4.2 beschrieben und sind als **Anlage 7** beigefügt.

Im Zuge der Systematisierung wurden die Hauptnetzelemente teilweise angepasst, wobei auf Grund der bestehenden topografischen, stadträumlichen und verkehrlichen Strukturen (auch der Gleise der Stadt-/Straßenbahn) kein neues Netz entstehen kann, sondern vielmehr das Bestandsnetz unter Berücksichtigung von Neu- und Umbaumaßnahmen sowie erkannten Defiziten angepasst wird. Berücksichtigt ist dabei auch die Verlegung der den 26 Ring querenden bzw. tangierenden Bundesstraßen B 6, B 97, B 170, B 172 und B 173 nach außerhalb des 26er Rings zur Umsetzung der Ziele des Luftreinhalteplanes. Voraussetzung dafür ist insbesondere der Lückenschlüsse im Dresdner Westen am Emerich-Ambros-Ufer. In Kombination mit den im Vorkapitel beschriebenen Maßnahmen im Straßennetz wurden für den Horizont 2025 auf Grundlage des Verkehrskonzepts 2003 (aktualisiert 2009, Plan 21) ein entsprechend kategorisiertes und klassifiziertes Straßennetz entwickelt und in **Abbildung 6 und 7** beschrieben.

Die einzelnen Veränderungen gegenüber Plan 21 des Verkehrskonzepts 2003 sind nummeriert (Abbildung 7) und in **Anlage 8** aufgelistet. Dabei wird auch auf einzelne Strecken eingegangen, deren Kategorien von bestimmten Trassenoptionen abhängig sind. Die Umstufungen der Bundesstraßen wurden dabei wie in Plan 21 des Verkehrskonzepts 2003 (aktualisiert 2009) vorgenommen.

## 6.4.4 Ruhender Kfz-Verkehr

Für den ruhenden Verkehr weist der Verkehrsentwicklungsplan vor allem strategische Maßnahmen aus, die in einzelnen, nahräumlichen Konzepten zu vertiefen sind. Der ruhende Verkehr in Dresden umfasst aber auch den Umgang mit Berufspendlern, touristischem Busverkehr und modalen Verknüpfungen (P+R). Der Luftreinhalteplan gibt zudem verbindlich vor, die bereits großteils umgesetzte flächendeckende Parkraumbewirtschaftung konsequent auf die gesamte Innenstadt (26 er Ring) auszuweiten und das Bewohnerparken zu priorisieren. Maßnahmen des ruhenden Verkehrs sind im Rahmen des VEP die Folgenden:

Flächenhafte Bewirtschaftung des ruhenden Verkehrs im öffentlichen Straßenraum im 26er Ring und in weiteren Stadtbereichen sowie in den Ortsteilzentren zur Vermeidung von Verlagerungen in Wohnbereiche und Berücksichtigung des Bewohnerparkens mit entsprechender Berechtigung. Zzt. laufende Vorhaben beziehen sich auf Johannstadt Nord, Uniklinikum/ MPI, Schillerplatz, Innere Neustadt Ost, Innere Neustadt West, Südvorstadt und Südvorstadt Ost. Zudem sind zu prüfen: u. a. Friedrichstadt, Kesselsdorfer Straße, Mickten, Schillerplatz/ Körnerplatz.
Moderate aber kontinuierliche Anpassung von Parkgebühren in öffentlichen Bereichen unter Berücksichtigung der ÖPNV-Kosten für Park und Ride mit dem Ziel einer besseren Erreichbarkeit, höherer Verfügbarkeit und der möglichen Rückgewinnung von Straßenraum - ergänzend auch Prüfung der Effekte einer moderaten Anpassung der Verwaltungsgebühren für Bewohnerparkausweise.
Führung des Parksuchverkehrs weitgehend im Hauptnetz (Hauptverkehrsstraßen und Hauptsammelstraßen) unter Nutzung des dynamischen Parkleitsystems und der prioritären und dynamischen Einbindung von bestehenden und neu zu errichtenden Park+Ride-Plätzen und den dortigen ÖPNV-Verbindungen (siehe auch 6.6.8).
Prüfung und ggf. Umsetzung einer wegweisenden (ggf. dynamischen) Beschilderung bereits von den Autobahnen A 4 und A 17 zu bestehenden P+R-Plätzen bzw. neu zu errichtenden Anlagen "vor" dem Erreichen des 26er Rings (P+R im Bereich Kemnitz/ Cotta/ Hamburger Straße, P+R im Bereich Hansastraße/ Großenhainer Straße).
Einordnung von Carsharing-Stellplätze im öffentlichen Straßenraum und Entwicklung eines Verfahrens, wie diese Stellplätze kostendeckend und wettbewerbsgerecht vergeben und betrieben werden können.
Im Einzelfall und beschlussgestützt administrative Unterstützung von Investoren bei der Einrichtung von stadtraumverträglichen, kleinteiligen Quartiersgaragen durch Flächenfreihaltungen in der Bauleitplanung in Bereichen mit hohem Bewohnerparkdruck und nach Ausschöpfung aller Maßnahmen der Bewohnerbevorrechtigung (z. B. Hechtviertel, Äußerer Neustadt), um gleichzeitig durch Umgestaltungen im Straßenraum städtebauliche Attraktivität und Nahmobilität zu verbessern.

Sicherung des Kurzzeitparkens für Einkauf/Versorgung sowie für ggf. erforderliche Hol- und Bringfahrten (z. B. von/zu Bahnhöfen, Schulen, Kitas, Gesundheitseinrichtungen, Seniorenbegegnungsstätten) in nahräumlichen Konzepten unter Berücksichtigung der Verkehrssicherheit (Querungen, freizuhaltenende Sichtbereiche usw.).
Abbau teilräumlicher Defizite im ruhenden Verkehr auf Basis vertiefender Untersuchungen, insbesondere in Stadtteilen mit starkem Entwicklungsdruck (z. B. im Bereich Südvorstadt/ HTW/ TUD, Nöthnitzer Straße (Entwicklungsgebiet der TUD), Wilsdruffer Vorstadt, Innere Neustadt, Leipziger Vorstadt).
Berücksichtigung des Parkverhaltens von Reisebussen und Stadtrundfahrten in der Verkehrsorganisation in touristischen Bereichen (Innenstadt, Loschwitz, Äußere Neustadt, Innere Neustadt u. a.) mit dem Ziel der Minimierung der Belastung für die Bewohnerinnen und Bewohner.
Sicherung der Nutzbarkeit der vollen Kapazität des Busparkplatzes Pieschener Allee an der Marienbrücke besonders auch in saisonalen Spitzenzeiten (an diesem Standort derzeit häufige Beschränkung der Nutzung durch Zirkus und Volksfeste).
Inhaltliche Vertiefung und Fortschreibung des bestehenden P+R-Konzeptes in Verbindung mit aktuellen, empirischen Pendleranalysen der Verkehrsströme und der Verkehrsmittelwahl zu einem integrierten Besucherverkehrs- und Pendlerkonzept (siehe Kapitel 5.6) unter Berücksichtigung von Ansätzen zu Parken und Mitnehmen⁹ und der Fortschreibung der P+R-Maßnahmen (siehe auch *Abbildung 14*) zu P+R, auch vor dem Hintergrund des geplanten Entfalls des P+R-Platzes Bühlau).

Eine Darstellung mit bestehenden bzw. zu prüfenden Bereichen mit Anwohner- und Gebührenparken in *Abbildung 8* beigefügt.

## 6.4.5 Verkehrsberuhigung

Bereits heute sind 94 % des Dresdner Straßennebennetzes verkehrsberuhigt. In Gebieten, die aufgrund des räumlichen Gesamteindrucks (z. B. überbreite Straßenräume) nur schwer als Bereiche mit verkehrsberuhigenden Regelungen erkennbar sind, sollten gestalterische Maßnahmen (z. B. Baumpflanzungen) oder organisatorische Maßnahmen diese Situation verbessern. Zudem sind punktuell verstärkte Aktivitäten zur rechtlichen Durchsetzung der Verkehrsberuhigung erforderlich.

⁹ Ein Teilkonzept zu P+M im Zuge des LRP wird im Juni 2013 erwartet.

Seite 129
Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus
Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025

LVM

Zu solchen Maßnahmen gehören z. B. städtebaulich gestaltete Einfahrtsbereiche mit Einbauten, Aufpflasterungen, Einordnung von Straßenrandparken oder Engstellen. Die notwendigen Gestaltungsprinzipien sollten nach konsistentem Muster entwickelt werden, aber auch eine Anpassungsmöglichkeit an die jeweiligen nahräumigen Verhältnisse enthalten. Auf verkehrstechnische Regelungen sollte in diesen Straßenräumen nach Möglichkeit vollständig verzichtet werden.

Weitere wichtige Maßnahmen der Verkehrsberuhigung beziehen sich auf die touristisch (und damit wirtschaftlich) wichtigen zentralen Stadtbereiche rund um Semperoper, Zwinger, Schloss und Frauenkirche, die vor allem vom Umweltverbund angebunden werden sollen. Die erkannten Defizite hier müssen insbesondere durch Verkehrsberuhigung angegangen werden. Dazu gehören:

Sperrung der Augustusbrücke für individuellen Kfz-Verkehr zur Erhöhung von Aufenthaltsqualität und Verkehrssicherheit insbesondere für den Fußgängerverkehr und Gäste der Stadt – die damit eintretenden Verkehrsverlagerungen von ca. 5.500 Kfz/Tag betreffen großräumig alle Dresdner Brückenstandorte und sind verträglich abwickelbar,
Verstärkte Verkehrsberuhigung in touristisch besonders wichtigen Bereichen (u. a. Schlossplatz, Theaterplatz, Sophienstraße, Taschenberg, Terrassenufer, Seestraße, Schillerplatz/Körnerplatz) durch angepasste bauliche und organisatorische Maßnahmen zur Minderung bestehender verkehrlicher Konflikte und Unverträglichkeiten durch eine hohe Zahl querender Fußgängerinnen und Fußgänger, die zudem häufig Gäste und damit weitgehend ohne Ortskenntnis sind,
Freihalten von Laufachsen von Fußgängerinnen und Fußgängern sowie Sicherung notwendiger Sichtbeziehungen und
Vermeidung von touristischem Busverkehr durch Wohngebiete.

Bereiche, die sich für eine Systematisierung und Eingliederung in die bestehenden Tempo-30-Zonen eignen, sind in **Abbildung 9** dargestellt. Für den Wirkungsbereich des beschlossenen verkehrlichen Rahmenplans „Äußere Neustadt“ ist eine Umwandlung von bestehenden Tempo-30-Zonen in Tempo-20-Zonen vorgesehen. Der Ansätze aus dem Lärmminderungsplan Hechtviertel zur Verkehrsberuhigung sollten genutzt werden, insbesondere zum Bischofsplatz, der nach dem Ansatz der „Begegnungszone“ geprüft werden kann (siehe Kapitel 6.8 und 6.10).

Weitere Maßnahmen der Verkehrsberuhigung sind aufgrund der übergreifenden Themenstellung den Kapiteln zu zentralen stadträumlichen Maßnahmen (6.9.2) sowie zum Fußgängerverkehr (6.8) zugeordnet worden.

# 6.5 Wirtschaftsverkehr

Der Sicherung bzw. Verbesserung der Erreichbarkeit im Kfz-Verkehr insbesondere für den Wirtschaftsverkehr wird durch die Verankerung in den Leitzielen¹⁰ ein hohes Gewicht gegeben.

Durch die erheblichen Auswirkungen des Lkw-Verkehrs auf die Stadtverträglichkeit insbesondere durch die Lärm- und Schadstoffemissionen sowie der Straßenbelastung kommt der Betrachtung des straßengebundenen Güterverkehrs innerhalb städtischer Verkehrskonzepte eine besondere Bedeutung zu.

In Dresden wird bereits mit Erfolg ein Lkw-Führungskonzept praktiziert, welches das Ziel hat, zur Vermeidung der negativen Auswirkungen den Lkw-Verkehr soweit wie möglich auf das Lkw-Vorrangnetz zu verlagern.

Dies ist mit einer darauf bezogenen Wegweisung und der Implementierung in Navigationssystemen für Lkw zu forcieren. Auch der Lkw-Stadtplan und Hinweise auf der Internetpräsenz der Stadt Dresden tragen dazu bei.

Im Rahmen der Umsetzung des Luftreinhalteplans wurde eine Beschränkung von Lkw über 3,5 t zul. Gesamtgewicht in wesentlichen Siedlungsbereichen der Stadt erlassen und die Zufahrt nur auf Quell- und Zielverkehr sowie Wohnmobile mit Ausnahme bei Autobahnumleitungen beschränkt. Problematisch ist allerdings, dieses Verbot wirkungsvoll zu kontrollieren. Dazu sind vermehrte – auch symbolische – Anstrengungen erforderlich.

Zudem sollten durch gezielte „Awareness-“ (zu Deutsch Aufmerksamkeits-) Kampagnen auf eine „intelligente Citylogistik“ hingewirkt werden, die möglichst viele unnötige Transportwege vermeidet, das optimale Verkehrsmittel wählt und gezielt auf eine Zusammenfassung von Lieferungen/Abholungen hinarbeitet. Dadurch können Ressourcen geschont, Emissionen gemindert und die Transportkosten gesenkt werden. Zur Koordination und Vermarktung kann die Einrichtung eines „Round Table Citylogistik“ gute Beiträge leisten.

Zur Sicherung der Ziele des Wirtschaftsverkehrs wird im VEP eine Vielzahl an Maßnahmen zur Umsetzung empfohlen:

Kontinuierliche Fortschreibung des bestehenden Lkw-Führungskonzeptes Dresden sowie Ergänzung um ein fortgeschriebenes Schwerverkehrskonzept (Schwerlasttransporte) in Rückkopplung mit der Gewerbeflächenentwicklung (Gewerbeflächenkonzept in Fortschreibung) und konkreten Anforderungen von Baulastträgern, Verkehrsorganisation, Stadtgestaltung, Wirtschaftsförderung u. a.,

Installation und Weiterentwicklung einer Software für das Lkw-Routing im Rahmen von privat-öffentlichen-Projekten (private-public-partnership – ppp) für gängige Navigationssysteme in Kooperation mit Nachbarkommunen und Kreisen (onboard-Navigationstechnik),
Abwicklung des Lkw-Verkehrs auf kurzen Wegen durch möglichst autobahn- und stadtnahe Gewerbeanlagen als auch Schaffung von attraktive Anbindungen im ÖPNV und Radverkehr für Beschäftigte sowie Kundinnen und Kunden dorthin,
Gestaltung des Güterbahnhofs Friedrichstadt und Stärkung des Logistikstandorts mit trimodalem GVZ (Güterverteilzentrum Bahn, Straßenbahn, Lkw) als Garant für die Anbindungen im Wirtschaftsverkehr per Bahn und Sicherung noch bestehender industrieller Anschlussbahnflächen,
Erhalt der Elbe als Bundeswasserstraße 1. Ordnung (Klasse Va) mit dem Alberthafen als trimodaler Schnittstelle,
Sicherung von Anschlussbahnflächen für gewerblich-industrielle Standorte, um die Erreichbarkeit per Bahn noch offen zu halten.

Durch neue Straßennetzelemente mit Lkw-Eignung wird die Erreichbarkeit für den Wirtschaftsverkehr gesichert und ausgebaut. Gleichzeitig wird das Lkw-Vorrangnetz erweitert. Dazu sind folgende Ergänzungen und Änderungen im Straßennetz (siehe auch Kapitel 6.4.2) vorgesehen:

Querspange Sporbitz zwischen Gewerbegebiet Sporbitz und der B 172 östlich von Großluga – damit entsteht eine direkte Erreichbarkeit der B172 und der AS Heidenau der A 17 aus dem interkommunalen Gewerbegebiet heraus,
Neubau der S 177 - Nutzung der S 177 in Rossendorf als Direktanbindung an die Autobahn sowie in Richtung Radeberg,
Bau der Anschlussstelle Weixdorf – Verbindung der AS mit dem Gewerbegebiet Promigberg,
Ausbau der Königsbrücker Straße Nord und Stauffenbergallee West – Verbindung der Lkw-Routen,
Verbesserte Anbindung von Radebeul und der Gewerbebiete in Radebeul-Ost an die A 4, wobei derzeit eine Linienbestimmung nicht vorliegt – Ziele sind dabei u. a. die Entlastung der Rankestraße und die konfliktfreiere Erreichbarkeit der A 4 von den Gewerbegebieten aus,
Ausbau der Hamburger Straße und des Emerich-Ambros-Ufers – damit Verlegung und Verknüpfung des Lkw-Vorrangnetzes möglich,
Direktanbindung der Fabrikstraße an die Rampen der Nossener Brücke und ggf. Anpassung des B-Plans 101 bzgl. des Ausbau der Hofmühlenstraße – Rücknahme der Tharandter Straße aus dem Lkw-Vorrangnetz und Verbindung mit den Gewerbestandorten an der Rosenstraße,
Neubau der B6n OU Cossebaude – Entlastung der Ortslage Cossebaude/ Wasserschutzgebiet Stausee,

Neubau der S 84n bis Meißen als 3. BA– Anbindung an das interkommunale Gewerbegebiet in Kötitz – Entlastung der Meißner Straße in Radebeul,
Neubau der S 191 – Verbindung gewerblicher Ziele aus dem Dresdner Südosten/ Dohnaer Straße auf direktem Weg, Entlastung in Goppeln,
Durchbindung der Fröbelstraße bis zur Rosenstraße – Verbesserung der Anbindung des Lkw-Verkehrs an die Coventrystraße und die A 17, zudem Flächenvorhaltung für eine Verbindung bis zur Bayerischen Straße.

Die Bahnquerung Liebstädter Straße und die Anbindung der Tiergartenstraße wären verkehrstechnisch für Lkw nutzbar, sollen aber erst nach einer entsprechenden Evaluierung in das Lkw-Führungskonzept einbezogen werden.

Alle räumlich darstellbaren Maßnahmen sind in der **Abbildung 10** dokumentiert. Anpassungen im Vorrangnetz sind dabei immer von der Realisierung der entsprechenden Maßnahmen abhängig.

## 6.6 Öffentlicher Personennahverkehr

### 6.6.1 Vorbemerkungen

Da sich die Mobilitätsbedürfnisse der Bevölkerung nicht auf städtische oder regionale Verkehre beschränken, ist eine durchgehende Beförderung mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln zu garantieren. Im Stadtgebiet Dresden müssen dazu geeignete und aufeinander abgestimmte Übergänge zwischen schienengebundenem Nah- und Fernverkehr sowie dem regionalen und lokalen Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn- und Busverkehr angeboten werden. Diese durchgehende Beförderung bedient gleichermaßen lokale, regionale und kreisübergreifende Verkehre und berücksichtigt dabei die Ansprüche aller Zielgruppen und Fahrzwecke. Der Anspruch auf einen attraktiven ÖPNV ergibt sich dabei sowohl aus der Daseinsvorsorge als auch aus der deutlich besseren Stadt- und Umweltverträglichkeit des ÖPNV im Vergleich zum Kfz-Verkehr. Aufgrund der vorhandenen Nachfrageumfänge sind die Berufspendler- und Ausbildungsverkehre von besonderer Bedeutung. Daraus ergeben sich folgende Herausforderungen:

Verbesserung der Zuverlässigkeit und Pünktlichkeit,
Stärkung der Verbindungsfunktionen,
Bereitstellung ausreichender Beförderungskapazitäten auf nachfragestarken Relationen,
langfristige Sicherung der ÖPNV-Finanzierung.

Der ÖPNV in Dresden ist zu mehr als 70% nutzerfinanziert. Der Anteil der Nutzerfinanzierung liegt damit im üblichen Rahmen vergleichbarer Großstädte mit einem attraktiven Angebot und vergleichsweise hoher ÖPNV-Nutzung. Da die Nutzerfinanzierung den Aufwand nur zu einem

großen Teil, jedoch nichtvollständig abdeckt, ist auch der Dresdner ÖPNV auf Zuschüsse angewiesen, die wiederum Gegenstand politischer Diskussionen sind. Auf Grund der politisch gewollten weiter ansteigenden Nachfrage, dem prognostiziertem Wachstum der Stadt und voraussichtlich weiter steigender Energiepreise wird der Zuschussbedarf des ÖPNV tendenziell weiter zunehmen. Allein der Erhalt der heutigen ÖPNV-Qualität stellt bereits eine große Herausforderung dar und Bedarf konzertierter Maßnahmen zur Sanierung und Modernisierung von Betriebsmitteln, Infrastruktur und Zugangsstellen.

Aufgabe des VEP ist es daher, aufzuzeigen, dass durch eine ausreichende finanzielle Absicherung der Leistungsangebote des ÖPNV ein hoher Nutzen für das gesamte Verkehrssystem und für die Mobilität aller Bürgerinnen und Bürger entsteht. Besondere Nutznießer sind Auszubildende, Berufstätige, Touristinnen und Touristen, Familien, alte Menschen und Bevölkerungsgruppen, die nicht bzw. nicht regelmäßig auf Fahrrad oder Pkw zurückgreifen können.

In den letzten Jahren hat auch der Aspekt der Barrierefreiheit an Bedeutung gewonnen. Besonders durch die Umsetzung der UN-Behindertenrechtskonvention in deutsches Recht und die damit in Zusammenhang stehende Regelung in §8 (3) des novellierten PBefG, bis zum 01. Januar 2022 eine vollständige Barrierefreiheit im ÖPNV herzustellen, hat sich der Handlungsbedarf erheblich verstärkt. Derzeit sind nur 45 % der Dresdner Haltestellen tatsächlich barrierefrei. Besonders wichtig für die Barrierefreiheit ist die Schnittstelle zwischen Fahrzeug und Infrastruktur. Angesichts verschiedener Anbieter im ÖPNV sind hier verbindliche Standards erforderlich, durch Form und Größe auch Auswirkungen auf die Gestaltung des Straßenraumes haben können. Haltebuchten im Busverkehr werden allein aus Platzgründen wegen des zu erreichenden Anfahrwinkels nur in Ausnahmefällen möglich sein. Kaphaltestellen werden sich deshalb verstärkt zur Regellösung entwickeln.

Auch die Forderungen aus der EU-Rahmengesetzgebung und des Personenbeförderungsgesetzes nach mehr Transparenz bei Beauftragung und Finanzierung des ÖPNV werden zukünftig auch in Dresden eine stärkere Rolle spielen.

Aufbauend auf den Erkenntnissen der Mängelanalyse und auf einigen bereits seit geraumer Zeit in Dresden diskutierten Planungsüberlegungen wurde ein Maßnahmenpaket mit dem Ziel entwickelt, dieses innerhalb des VEP zu prüfen und weiterzuentwickeln. Grundgerüst der Weiterentwicklung und Förderung des ÖPNV als eine der tragenden Säulen des Umweltverbundes sind das Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnprogramm 2020, Maßnahmen im SPNV und im Busverkehr gemäß der Stadtratsbeschlüsse seit 2003 sowie Maßnahmen von Bund, Freistaat Sachsen und VVO als Sowieso-Maßnahmen (siehe Kapitel 6.2). Dies sind im Einzelnen:

Anpassungen im Busnetz (Linien 64 und 74) im Zuge der Eröffnung der Waldschlößchenbrücke (Durchbindung der Linie 64 über die Elbe ab 2013) und veränderte Führung im Bereich Striesen über Augsburger Straße/ Tittmannstraße),

viergleisiger Ausbau und Trennung S- u. Fernbahn auf der Strecke Dresden-Neustadt - Coswig inkl. S-Bahn-Takt-Verdichtung der Linien S1 auf 15 Min. in der Hauptverkehrszeit, barrierefreien Haltestellen und barrierefreier Neugestaltung aller Haltepunkte mit Verlegung des S-Bahn-Haltepunkts Trachau,
Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnstrecke Löbtau – Strehlen mit Anpassungen von Infrastruktur und Angebot sowie Aus- und Umbau im Straßennetz und an Haltestellen sowie Ausbau des Verknüpfungspunkts am Haltepunkt Strehlen,
Stadtbahnstrecke Bühlau – Weißig mit Anpassungen von Infrastruktur und Angebot,
neue Zentralhaltestelle auf der Kesselsdorfer Straße (bisher Haltestelle Tharandter Straße) mit Kfz-Zufahrtsbeschränkung der Kesselsdorfer Straße östlich der Reisewitzer Straße,
Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnstrecke Johannstadt – Plauen mit Anpassungen von Infrastruktur (u. a. Budapester Str.) und Fahrplanangebot sowie Aus- und Umbau des umgebenden Straßennetzes unter Beibehaltung bestehender Kapazitäten,
S-Bahn-Haltepunkt Bischofsplatz.

Die Attraktivität des ÖPNV ist in erster Linie durch eine gute Erschließungsqualität bestimmt. Je kürzer der Weg zur Haltestelle ist und je häufiger diese bedient wird, umso leichter ist der Zugang zum ÖPNV. Damit kann gleichzeitig ein Beitrag zu einem günstigen Reisezeitverhältnis im Vergleich zu konkurrierenden Verkehrsmitteln wie etwa dem Pkw geleistet werden.

Der Nahverkehrsplan¹¹ sieht folgende Mindeststandards der Erschließung vor (vgl. Tabelle 3):

## Einzugsbereich der Haltestellen

Es besteht der Anspruch, das gesamte bebaute Stadtgebiet der Landeshauptstadt Dresden mit den in Tabelle 3 genannten Einzugsbereichen der Haltestellen vollständig zu erschließen. Demnach sollte das kommunale ÖPNV-Netz in Dresden von jedem Gebiet der Stadt aus in maximal 300 bis 400 m Luftlinie erreichbar sein. Für Haltepunkte des SPNV wird ein Erschließungsradius von ca. 600 m angesetzt (vgl. Tabelle 3).

|  Gebietskategorie | Bus | Straßen-/ Stadtbahn | SPNV  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  hohe Nutzungsdichte | 300 m | 300 m | 600 m  |
|  mittlere Nutzungsdichte | 300 m | 400 m | 600 m  |
|  geringe Nutzungsdichte | 300 m | 400 m | 600 m  |

## Bedienungshäufigkeit

Tabelle 4 zeigt die geforderte Anzahl Linienfahrten pro Stunde und Richtung, differenziert nach Verkehrszeiten. Der Tagesverkehr (Tag) umfasst die Zeit von 6.00 bis 19.00 Uhr (Montag – Frei-

## Bedienungszeitraum

Der Bedienungszeitraum beschreibt die Anzahl Stunden pro Tag, an denen Haltestellen im Stadtgebiet Dresden durch den ÖPNV bedient werden sollen (vgl. Tabelle 5).

|  Gebietskategorie | Bedienungszeitraum  |
| --- | --- |
|  hoher Nutzungsdichte | 24 Stunden  |
|  mittlere Nutzungsdichte | 24 Stunden  |
|  geringe Nutzungsdichte | 20 Stunden  |

Tabelle 5: Bedienungszeitraum für Haltestellen in der Stadt Dresden
(Quelle: Nahverkehrsplan VVO 2011)

## Beförderungsgeschwindigkeit

Der Nahverkehrsplan fordert, Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn und Bus in der Stadt Dresden beschleunigt zu führen, und gibt als Zielwerte die folgenden systembezogenen Geschwindigkeiten an: Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn: 21,4 km/h, Bus 22,4 km/h (entsprechende Zielwerte für den Regionalverkehr finden sich im Nahverkehrsplan). Eine Beschleunigung kann durch räumliche Trennung (verschiedene Straßen, eigener Bahnkörper) und/oder funktionell (LSA-Beeinflussung) erreicht werden.

Die vorgenannten Zielwerte bzw. Mindeststandards gelten auch für den VEP. Vor diesem Hintergrund sind im VEP Maßnahmen in folgenden Bereichen vorgesehen:

Allgemeine Verbesserung von Zuverlässigkeit, Komfort und Reisegeschwindigkeit,
Bauliche Maßnahmen (Haltepunkte) bei S-Bahn/ SPNV,
Bauliche Maßnahmen (Strecken und Haltepunkte) im Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnverkehr,
Angebotsverbesserungen Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn,
Angebotsverbesserungen Bus,
Regionale Anbindungen mit Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn als weitere Maßnahme,

Seite 136

Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025
WV
WBS

Regionale Anbindung mit Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn als Flächenvorhaltung.

Alle Maßnahmen des VEP zum ÖPNV sind in der **Abbildung 11** dargestellt. Sie werden unterschiedlichen Maßnahmenbereichen zugeordnet und in den folgenden Kapiteln aufgeführt. Auf ergänzende Maßnahmen im Bereich intermodaler Angebote wie z. B. Bike+Ride wird in Kapitel 4.3.6 vertieft eingegangen.

## 6.6.2 Konzeptionelle Maßnahmen

Die Entwicklung des ÖPNV ist nicht nur von der Stadt Dresden zu beeinflussen. In die Förderung von Infrastrukturvorhaben sowie in die Finanzierung von ÖPNV-Fahrzeugen war in der Vergangenheit auch der Freistaat Sachsen intensiv eingebunden.

Da der Kostendeckungsgrad des kommunalen ÖPNV in Dresden mit über 70 % zzt. noch erfreulich hoch ist, können verbleibende Defizite zzt. noch durch den steuerlichen Querverbund innerhalb der städtischen Holding TWD ausgeglichen werden. Die finanzielle Leistungsfähigkeit der Stadt Dresden ist damit jedoch erschöpft. Aus diesem Grund sind weiter Verhandlungen mit dem Freistaat über die Anpassung der Landes-ÖPNV-Zuschüsse für angebotsorientierten Betrieb des ÖPNV und die Beschaffung von modernen ÖPNV-Fahrzeugen notwendig. In diesem Zusammenhang ist die anteilige Finanzierung der Flottenmodernisierung von Bus und Straßen-/ Stadtbahn wichtig, um Einsatzkosten und Emissionen zu vermindern (insbesondere im Busbereich hinsichtlich der Luftreinhaltung).

Zudem erfordert die verträgliche Abwicklung der regionalen Pendlerverkehre nicht nur innerhalb der Stadt Dresden, den schienengebundenen Verkehr (SPNV und Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn) sowie den regionalen Busverkehr weiter zu stärken und die entsprechenden Regionalisierungsmittel dafür auch zukünftig bereitzustellen. In diesem Zusammenhang spielen auch Fragen des Ausbaus der nördlichen Bahnanbindung eine Rolle, da hier infrastrukturelle Engpässe entstanden sind.

Neben den bereits erwähnten Herausforderungen im Rahmen der Herstellung vollständiger Barrierefreiheit bis 2022 ergeben sich weitere Herausforderungen aus den in der Stadt Dresden stark steigenden Schüler- und Auszubildendenzahlen. Die erwarteten Entwicklungen im Schülerverkehr müssen bei den Maßnahmevorschlägen zur Netzgestaltung und Fahrplanung ebenso berücksichtigt werden wie bei der Finanzierung des Nahverkehrs in Stadt und Region Dresden.

Die Weiterführung bzw. Ergänzung attraktiver ÖPNV-Tickets für Besucherinnen und Besucher, P+R-Nutzende, ältere Menschen und Familien erfordert Finanzierungsspielräume, die im Zuge der Budgetverhandlungen mit den betroffenen Aufgabenträgern ausgehandelt werden müssen. Auch dem möglichen Entfall des Semestertickets für Studierende sollten innovative Alternativen

VVO
IVAS

gegenüber gestellt werden. Politisch diskutiert und im Rahmen der Bewertungsprozesse des VEP als sinnvoll erachtet wird auch eine um die Geringverdiener erweiterte, preisgünstige Mobilitätsoption wie z. B. das Sozialticket.

Weiterhin sind die besonderen Anforderungen von Frauen und Kindern an die Gestaltung des ÖPNV zu berücksichtigen, um einem Unsicherheits- oder Bedrohungspotenzial an Haltestellen und in den Fahrzeugen entgegenzuwirken. Auch muss den Bedürfnissen aller Nutzerinnen und Nutzer im Hinblick auf zuverlässige, leistbare, sichere und leicht zugängliche Verkehrsmittel entsprochen werden. Auch dem unterschiedlichen Nutzungsverhalten von Frauen und Männern im Hinblick auf Mobilitätsintensität und Verkehrsmittelwahl sowie verfügbares Einkommen, Betreuungsaufgaben oder Arbeitszeiten ist verstärkt Rechnung zu tragen.

Die Radmitnahme im ÖPNV innerhalb des Tarifgebietes des VVO ist sowohl im Alltags- als auch im Freizeitverkehr wichtig, auch um die Bedürfnisse von Fahrgästen mit weiteren Zu- und Abgangswegen oder Bewohner im Bereich der Höhenlagen anzusprechen. Kapazitätsengpasse zur Hauptverkehrszeit und Konflikte mit der Mitnahme von Rollstühlen, Kinderwagen und Gehhilfen treten bereits regelmäßig und besonders bei Schlechtwetter auf (insbesondere an Bergstrecken des Stadtbusses z. B. der Linien 61 sowie 62, 63 und 66). Die Mitnahme von Rollstühlen und Kinderwagen wird dann, wenn nötig, priorisiert. Da die Mitnahme von Rädern, Rollstühlen, Kinderwagen und Gehhilfen weiter steigen wird, stellt dies Herausforderungen in der Fahrzeugbeschaffung im Bus- und Bahnsektor dar. Längere Fahrzeuge (Bus) bzw. größere Fahrzeugbreiten (Bahn) können mithelfen, diese Situation zu verbessern.

Durch die fünf ÖPNV-Aufgabenträger in der Region Dresden (Stadt Dresden, Landkreise Bautzen, Meißen und Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge für den straßengebundenen ÖPNV sowie der Verkehrsverbund Oberelbe für den SPNV) entstehen bei den erforderlichen Abstimmungen an den Schnittstellen nicht unerhebliche Reibungsverluste, die durch verstärkte kooperative Ansätze beseitigt werden könnten.

Der ÖPNV repräsentiert auf absehbare Zeit den mit deutlichem Abstand größten Anteil der Elektromobilität in Dresden. Deshalb ist dort die Umstellung auf regenerative Energien besonders sinnfällig, um so die Abhängigkeit von den Energiepreisen zu verringern und die Klimafreundlichkeit weiter zu erhöhen.

## 6.6.3 Erhöhung der Beförderungsgeschwindigkeiten

Durch die verbesserte Beförderungsqualität infolge einer kontinuierlichen Modernisierung des Fahrzeugparks sowie durch eine nutzergerechte Ausgestaltung und Ausstattung der Haltestellen und Verknüpfungspunkte sowie durch Einhaltung von vereinbarten Qualitätsstandards kann die Attraktivität des ÖPNV weiter gesteigert werden. Hierzu gehört der Ausbau der Verkehrsinfra

WBS

struktur durch konsequente Umsetzung von ÖPNV-Beschleunigungsmaßnahmen. Die Anschlusssicherung, zuverlässige Versorgung der dynamischen Fahrgastinformationssysteme mit Ist-Daten sowie eine innovative LSA-Steuerung fördern nochmals die Tür-zu-Tür-Reisegeschwindigkeit für die Nutzenden und den Komfort. Im Einzelnen sind folgende Maßnahmen innerhalb des VEP vorgesehen:

Optimierung der Lichtsignalanlagen für die Beschleunigung des ÖPNV an Knotenpunkten mit schlechter Verkehrsqualität mit dem Ziel, eine Erhöhung der Beförderungsgeschwindigkeit der Straßenbahn/Stadtbahn zu erzielen. Dazu gehören:

eine ÖPNV-Priorisierung nach Fahrplanlage,
die zeitgerechte LSA-Freigabe (nur solange, wie erforderlich)
die Berücksichtigung von Fußgängerzuläufen und ÖPNV-Anschlüssen

Die ÖPNV-Priorisierung bzw. zeitgerechte Signalfreigabe betrifft insbesondere folgende Knotenpunkte:

Albertplatz, Ammon/Freiberger Straße, Bautzner/Rothenburger Straße, Georgplatz, Könneritz/Jahnstraße, Könneritzstraße/Ostra-Allee, Könneritz/Schweriner Straße, Lennéplatz, Nürnberger Platz, Pirnaischer Platz, Rathenauplatz, Schillerplatz, Schlesischer Platz, Schweriner/Löbtauer Straße, Straßburger Platz, Tharandter/Kesselsdorfer Straße, Tolkewitzer/Kretschmerstraße, Wasaplatz, Weißeritz/Friedrichstraße und Weißeritz/Jahnstraße.

Dabei sind die Belange aller Verkehrsteilnehmerinnen und -teilnehmer hinsichtlich von Verhältnismäßigkeit und Sicherheit zu prüfen und auch ergänzende Maßnahmen im Umfeld einzubeziehen.

Verstärkte Nutzung echtzeitbasierter Fahrgastinformation zur Anschlusssicherung, zur Prognose der Halteposition und zur Verkürzung von Umsteigewegen sowie Aufbau eines einheitlichen Wegweisungssystems zu wichtigen Schnittstellen des ÖPNV (siehe Kapitel 6.6.7),
Barrierefreier Standard bei Zugängen, Umsteigestellen, Fahrzeugen und Informationsübermittlung sowie Weiterführung der Bemühungen zum Electronic-Ticketing,

## 6.6.4 Bauliche Maßnahmen im Bereich S-Bahn und SPNV

Im SPNV/S-Bahn-Verkehr, der insbesondere die Verbindung in die Region und die Erreichbarkeit der Stadt Dresden aus dem Umland sicherstellt, sind im Interesse einer weiteren Angebotsverbesserung neue Haltepunkte und Taktverdichtungen empfehlenswert:

Seite 139

Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025
WV
WBS

Umsetzung der S-Bahn-Haltepunkte Bischofsplatz, Albertstadt (Linie S2) und Nossener Brücke (Linie S3), die als „Sowieso-Maßnahme“ bereits fest eingeplant sind und barrierefreie Ausstattung des HP Dresden-Industriegelände (Aufzüge),
Ergänzende Realisierung zweier S-Bahn-Haltepunkte im Bereich
Königsbrücker Landstraße (Linie S2, Umsteigepunkt Stadtbahn/ S-Bahn insbesondere bei Verlängerung der Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn nach Ottendorf-Okrilla bzw. Königsbrück, siehe Kapitel 6.6.5)
Richard-Strauss-Platz (Linien S1 und S2 wegen Andienung Stadion und Entwicklungsgebiet Nürnberger Platz/ HTW, siehe Abbildung 21)
Umsetzung dieser Haltepunkte jeweils nach Inbetriebnahme der Haltepunkte Bischofsplatz, Albertstadt und Nossener Brücke,
Bedienung der linkselbischen Bahnstrecke Dresden – Coswig über Friedrichstadt im 30-min.-Takt in Überlagerung mit bestehenden und zusätzlichen Regionalverkehrsangeboten,
Ausbau der Nordanbindung auf der regionalen Bahnstrecke Richtung Bischofswerda durch eine Systematisierung weitgehend bestehender Angebote (S-Bahn, RB/ RE) zu einem regelmäßigen attraktiven Takt (teilweise drittes Gleis erforderlich) und einer Elektrifizierung,
Bau des Verknüpfungspunkts Dresden-Cotta im Zuge des Ausbaus der Hamburger Straße,
Prüfung einer regelmäßig durchgehenden Bahnverbindung Dresden – Altenberg im Zuge des Nahverkehrsplans.

Aus Abbildung 12 werden die Verbesserungen in der Raumerschließung und die angestrebten Angebotsverdichtungen deutlich. Maßnahmen, die bereits durch geltende Stadtratsbeschlüsse abgesichert sind, und ihre Erschließungswirkungen werden in Blau dargestellt, VEP-Maßnahmen und ihre Erschließungswirkungen in Rot.

## 6.6.5 Verbesserungen bei Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn und Stadt-/ Regionalbus

Die nachfolgende Aufstellung zeigt die vorgeschlagenen Maßnahmen des VEP im Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn- und Busverkehr. Sie sind zusätzlich in Abbildung 11 grafisch dargestellt und stehen unter dem Vorbehalt der ggf. erforderlichen Absprache mit benachbarten Aufgabenträgern sowie planrechtlichen, technischen und wirtschaftlichen Prüfungen:

## Haltestellen Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn und Busverkehr

Definition und Aktualisierung von wichtigen Maßen und Abständen für Haltestellen von Bus und Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn zwischen Baulastträger und Verkehrsunternehmen unter dem Aspekt der vollständigen Barrierefreiheit bis 2022.
Sukzessiver barrierefreier Umbau bisher nicht-barrierefreier Haltestellen (mit Fortschreibung des Standard-Haltestellen-Projekts).

# Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn

Anforderungsgerechte Verdichtung des Angebots im Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnnetz durch geeignete Maßnahmen wie:
eine nachfrageorientierte und wirtschaftlich tragfähige Angebotsverdichtung (z. B. durch Linienüberlagerung oder Taktverdichtung auf unter 10 Minuten),
Einsatz breiterer Fahrzeuge (verbunden mit dem entsprechend erforderlichen Gleisachsabstand von 3 m im Sinne einer Kapazitätserhöhung des ÖPNV),
das Fahren in Doppeltraktion mit 60 m-Zügen auf ausgewählten Strecken,
die Einrichtung neuer Linien im Zuge des Stadtbahnprogramms 2020,
um den anstehenden verkehrlichen, demografischen und umweltseitigen Herausforderungen gerecht zu werden.

Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnbau in der Relation Tiergartenstraße – Gruna – Striesen – Blasewitz als Ersatz für Buslinie 61. Dadurch verbessert sich auch die Anbindung des Wissenschaftsstandorts Dresden-Ost an die Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn. Die Maßnahme ergänzt die neue Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnstrecke Löbtau – Strehlen (vgl. Stadtbahnprojekt 2020) und ist erst nach deren Umsetzung sinnvoll. Aufgrund der städtebaulichen und straßenräumlichen Situation sind innovative bauliche und gestalterisch hochwertige Lösungen erforderlich. Zudem muss eine Variantenbetrachtung zur Linienführung den bestehenden Korridor konkretisieren.
potenzielle Nutzung der Bahnanbindung vorhandenen Bahntrasse nach Königsbrück für eine Straßenbahn-/ Stadtbahnanbindung von Ottendorf-Okrilla (ggf. auch Königsbrück) über Hermsdorf nach Dresden bei gleichzeitiger Entlastung der Bahntrasse zwischen Klotzsche und Dresden-Neustadt,
Prüfung der folgenden Aspekte bei der Neubeschaffung von Fahrzeugen:
Komfortverbesserung durch Klimatisierung,
Erhöhung der Kapazität durch breitere Fahrzeuge (Erhöhung der Platzkapazität für Personen und die Mitnahme von Fahrrädern, Rollstühlen, Kinderwagen oder Gehhilfen) sowie
innovative Energieversorgung (z. B. Prüfung induktiver Stromaufnahme der Straßenbahn auf Teilstrecken aus städtebaulichen Gründen).

Durchbindung der Buslinie 64 über die Waldschlößchenbrücke (nach deren Verkehrswirksamkeit 2013) und Anpassung der Linienführung zur verbesserten Erschließung im Bereich Tittmannstraße sowie Verbesserung der Erschließung am Jägerpark durch Linie 74,
Einrichtung eines Fern- und Regionalbusbahnhofs am Hauptbahnhof (ZOB) mit Anbindung in alle Verkehrssysteme und insbesondere auch den Bahnverkehr am Hauptbahnhof,
Nachfrageabhängige Verdichtung der Busangebote der Linie 94 von Cossebaude bis Cotta und Prüfung einer Vermeidung von Parallelverkehr mit der Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn,

Neues Busangebot im 60-Min.-Takt zwischen Cossebaude und Radebeul über Elbbrücke Niederwartha in Abstimmung mit dem Landkreis Meißen,
Durchbindung der Zschertnitzer Straße für Bus, Rad und Fußgängerverkehr zur Verbesserung möglicher tangentialer Busverbindungen z. B. entlang der Nöthnitzer Straße mit dem sich dort weiter entwickelnden Campusgelände der TU,
Prüfung der Komfortverbesserung durch Klimatisierung bei der Neubeschaffung von Bussen.

## Regionalbus

Verbesserung der regionalen Busanbindung von Moritzburg und Bannewitz durch Verkürzung der Reisezeit und eine Taktverdichtung zur Verkehrsspitze,
Prüfung von direkten, über die Autobahn geführten Regionalbusverbindungen zu autobahnnahen Gemeinden ohne attraktive ÖPNV-Anbindung nach Dresden (z. B. Nossen, Radeburg u. a.). Die Prüfungen könnten im Zuge der Fortschreibung des Nahverkehrsplans erfolgen.

## Flächenvorhaltung

Flächenvorhaltung für eine Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahntrasse Gompitz – Kesselsdorf sowie
Flächenvorhaltung für alle beschlossenen Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnoptionen, die nicht Bestandteil der VEP-Maßnahmen sind (dies betrifft auch den Standort einer Umweltbrücke Ostragehege für ÖPNV, Rad und Fuß, deren Umsetzung bis 2025 nicht realistisch ist – die Verbindung soll deshalb zunächst durch eine Fährverbindung hergestellt werden).

Die Maßnahmen im Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn- und Stadt-/ Regionalbusverkehr sind ebenfalls in Abbildung 11 dargestellt, die Erschließungswirkungen der VEP-Maßnahmen können Abbildung 12 entnommen werden.

## 6.6.6 Maßnahmen im Fernbus-Linienverkehr

Durch die Liberalisierung des Fernbusverkehrs wird dieser mittelfristig weiter an Bedeutung gewinnen. Um attraktive, sichere und verkehrlich integrierte Abfahrtsstellen zu schaffen und gleichzeitig die verkehrlichen Belastungen durch Busverkehr zu minimieren, sind Angebotsumfang, Perspektiven und Bedürfnisse des Fernbuslinienverkehrs in die Aktualisierung des Reisebuspark/-leitsystems zu integrieren. Auch Fragen der Erreichbarkeit im ÖPNV und der Barrierefreiheit sind hier mit zu erörtern, da es sich auch um Schnittstellen mit dem ÖPNV handelt.

Der momentane Zustand der Abfahrtsstellen nationaler und internationaler Fernbusse am Hauptbahnhof (ohne Haltekanten, ohne ausreichende Aufstellräume und nahezu ohne Ausstattung) ist verkehrlich und stadtplanerisch unhaltbar. Der zu beobachtende Trend der Diversifizierung der Abfahrtsstellen privater Anbieter (Elbepark, Bahnhof Neustadt) ist Ausdruck dieser desolaten Si

tuation. Deshalb wird die Einrichtung eines Fern- und Regionalbusbahnhofs am Hauptbahnhof (ZOB) weiterhin als sehr wichtig angesehen. Kostenseitig wurde die Umsetzung des ZOB ohne weitere hochbauliche Anlagen auch in der Maßnahmebewertung berücksichtigt. Es ist zu prüfen, wie diese vereinfachte Lösung durch stärkere private oder öffentliche Beteiligung aufgewertet werden kann.

Wichtig ist auch die intermodale Einbindung des ZOB als intermodale Schnittstelle und der Bezug des ZOB zum Hauptbahnhof. Mit letzterer ist die enge Verknüpfung durch einen in bisherigen Planungen vorgesehenen niveaufreien Bahnsteigzugang im westlichen Bereich der Bahnsteighalle in Verbindung mit dem „Königspavillon“ verbunden.

## 6.6.7 Wichtige ÖPNV-Schnittstellen

Eine wichtige Komponente für die Qualität des ÖPNV sind die Schnittstellen bzw. Verknüpfungspunkte zwischen den Verkehrsmitteln des ÖPNV. Ziel ist es, hier die Umsteigezeiten und -wege möglichst kurz und attraktiv zu gestalten.

**Abbildung 13** zeigt den Bestand und die Entwicklung wichtiger ÖPNV-Schnittstellen im VEP. In Abhängigkeit von der Verkehrsbedeutung der Schnittstellen ist hierbei folgende Kategorisierung verwendet worden:

Kategorie 1: zentraler Verknüpfungspunkt (Fernverkehr mit SPNV/ÖPNV, SPNV mit ÖPNV, übrige Verknüpfungspunkte mit derzeit ≥ 5.000 Umsteigenden¹² pro Tag),
Kategorie 2: wichtiger ÖPNV-Verknüpfungspunkt innerhalb des Dresdner Stadtgebiets mit derzeit 2.000 bis unter 5.000 Umsteigenden pro Tag,
Kategorie 3: wichtiger ÖPNV-Verknüpfungspunkt an Straßenbahn-Endästen innerhalb des Dresdner Stadtgebiets mit Verknüpfung zu Busverkehr sowie Standorte P+R.

Aus den Maßnahmen des Handlungskonzepts (beispielsweise durch Netzerweiterung bei Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn oder neue Haltepunkte der S-Bahn) ergeben sich **neue Verknüpfungspunkte**:

Albertstadt (neuer HP der S-Bahn),
Bischofsplatz (neuer HP im Zuge S-Bahn-Ausbau S1),

Fetscherstraße/ Pfotenhauer Straße (Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn und neue Busverbindungen über die Waldschlößchenbrücke),
HP Dresden-Cotta (Ausbau der Stadtbahn-Haltestelle zur Verknüpfungsstelle, auch Angebotsverdichtung Zug),
Königsbrücker Landstraße (neuer HP der S-Bahn),
Nossener Brücke (neuer HP der S-Bahn),
Richard-Strauss-Platz (neuer HP der S-Bahn).
Weißig (Stadtbahnausbau). und Verknüpfung Bus)

Durch die Netzerweiterung bei Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn oder durch die Angebotsverdichtung im regionalen Schienen- und Busverkehr wird die Bedeutung folgender bestehender Haltestellen auch als Umsteigepunkte deutlich zunehmen, was in der Gestaltung zu berücksichtigen ist.

Altpieschen/ Pieschener Winkel (in Verbindung mit einer ggf. neuen Fährverbindung zum Ostragehege),
Bergmannstraße (wegen Umordnung Busnetz im Zuge Waldschlößchenbrücke),
C.-D.-Friedrich-Straße (wegen Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnausbau),
Chemnitzer Straße (wegen Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnausbau)
Fetscherplatz (wegen Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnausbau),
HP Dresden-Strehlen (wegen Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnausbau),
HP Dresden-Trachau (wegen S-Bahn-Ausbau mit Verlegung des HP),
Nürnberger Platz (wegen Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnausbau),
S-Bahn Dresden-Plauen (wegen S-Bahn und Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnausbau),
Sachsenallee (wegen Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnausbau),
St.-Benno-Gymnasium (wegen Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnausbau),
Stauffenbergallee (wegen S-Bahn-Ausbau),
Technische Universität (wegen Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnausbau in Verbindung mit Stadt- und Regionalbusverkehr),
Waldschlößchen (Neubau Waldschlößchenbrücke mit Anpassungen im Busnetz).

Die vorgenannten wichtigen ÖPNV-Schnittstellen sind in Abbildung 13 dargestellt. Für diese Schnittstellen ist ortsabhängig eine stadtweit einheitliche Beschilderung erforderlich, da insbesondere die S-Bahn-Stationen etwas abseits der funktionalen Zentren liegen (z. B. Trachenberger Platz/ S-Bahn-Haltepunkt Pieschen). Es sollte zudem geprüft werden, ob sich Schnittstellen des ÖPNV als Carsharing-Standorte eignen und dort geeignete Flächen zur Verfügung stehen. Hinweise zu Bike+Ride befinden sich in Kapitel 6.7.4 sowie in Abbildung 17.

## 6.6.8 Park+Ride

Aus Sicht der Nutzenden verknüpft Park+Ride (P+R) die Vorteile des individuellen Kraftfahrzeuges als Zubringerverkehrsmittel mit der schnellen, sicheren und bequemen Beförderung im ÖPNV. Aus der Sicht der Stadt Dresden soll P+R insbesondere dazu dienen, das Straßennetz von Zielverkehr zu entlasten und dadurch Kapazitätsengpässe abzubauen sowie Lärm- und Schadstoffbelastung in der Stadt Dresden zu vermindern. Andererseits sind die Kosten für einen P+R-Platz pro Nutzenden relativ hoch, u. a. weil der Fahrzeugumschlag auf P+R-Plätzen meist sehr gering ist.

Das bestehende P+R-Konzept in Dresden soll deshalb zu einem integrierten Pendler- und Besucherkonzept weiterentwickelt werden, einschließlich der dafür dringend benötigten empirischen Analysen. Dabei muss vermieden werden, Verkehre aus dem Umland bis an den Stadtrand von Dresden oder sogar bis in die Nähe des Stadtzentrums zu führen. Regionale Verkehre sollen vielmehr wohnortnah zu einer P+R-Anlage am nächstgelegenen Bahnhof geführt werden. Hier besteht ein wichtiger Ansatz für interkommunale Kooperation, besonders an den bestehenden Bahnachsen Richtung Coswig/ Meißen, Pirna, Freital/ Freiberg, Radeberg/ Bischofswerda sowie Königsbrück.

Für die Stadt Dresden bestehen trotz der erforderlichen regionalen Ausrichtung der P+R-Strategie Handlungsbedarf auf dem Stadtgebiet, die besonders einer besseren Abwicklung des Einkaufs- und Veranstaltungsverkehrs und weniger dem Berufs- und Ausbildungsverkehr dienen.

Da die AS Dresden-Neustadt eher selten für Fahrten in die City genutzt wird, dort jedoch bereits ein großer P+R-Platz mit 190 Stellplätzen eingerichtet wurde und zudem eine gute und direkte ÖPNV-Anbindung besteht, sollte geprüft werden mit welchen Maßnahmen eine verbesserte Nutzung zu erreichen ist.

Im Nordosten (Bühlau) und Norden (Klotzsche/ Langebrück) sind die P+R-Anlagen mit unter 100 Stellplätzen oft vollständig ausgelastet bzw. bereits überlastet. Da aktuell der sehr gut angenommene P+R-Platz in Bühlau überbaut werden soll, sollten zeitnah ergänzende Flächen gefunden werden. Auch die entlang der geplanten Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnstrecke nach Weißig neu entstehen. P+R-Anlagen tragen (in begrenztem Maß) zur Entlastung des Blauen Wunders und der Bautzener Landstraße/ Bautzener Straße vom Kfz-Verkehr bei.

Im Bereich Klotzsche kann dennoch die Erweiterung des vorhandenen P+R-Angebotes sinnvoll sein. Besondere Vorteile ergeben sich hier aus der attraktiven Taktüberlagerung (S-Bahn S2, Regionalbahnen und Regionalexpress-Bahnen), die weiter außerhalb nicht gegeben ist.

Stark diskutiert werden auch weitere P+R-Angebote im Bereich der Zufahrten von der A 4 in den Bereichen AS Hellerau und AS Altstadt. Während Angebote von der AS Hellerau aus strukturellen Gründen derzeit als wenig zielführend angesehen werden, ist im Bereich der AS Altstadt insbe

WBS

sondere durch die Veranstaltungsverkehre zum Ostragehege ein stark freizeitorientiertes Angebot ergänzend zum „klassischen“ P+R sinnvoll.

Innerhalb des Pendler- und Besucherkonzeptes der Stadt Dresden sollten folgende Bereiche bzgl. einer Neuanlage oder Erweiterung von P+R-Plätzen mit hoher Priorität untersucht werden:

Bühlau/ Weißig
Kemnitz/ Cotta/ Friedrichstadt
Klotzsche/ Industriegelände.

Darüber hinaus besteht Untersuchungsbedarf in:

Niederwartha/ Cossebaude
Coschütz/ Zschertnitz
Niedersedlitz/ Zschachwitz
Weixdorf/ Grenzstraße

Die bereits bzgl. des ruhenden Verkehrs beschriebene Prüfung und ggf. Umsetzung einer wegweisenden (ggf. dynamischen) Information von den Autobahnen A 4 und A 17 zu bestehenden P+R-Plätzen bzw. zu neu zu errichtenden Anlagen "vor" dem 26er Ring unterstützt die Wirksamkeit von Park+Ride auch im Fernverkehr.

Das bestehende P+R-Konzept ist bislang primär auf Berufspendler ausgerichtet, sollte aber durch die beschriebenen Ansätze zukünftig noch besser auch für den Veranstaltungsverkehr nutzbar sein (z. B. Großveranstaltungen im Ostragehege, Messen, Sportveranstaltungen, Stadtfeste, Striezelmarkt, verkaufsoffene Sonntage usw.).

Auf Grund der möglichen Substitution von Verkehrsleistungen im ÖPNV durch nahe an Dresden liegenden P+R-Plätze sollte das P+R-Verhalten Gegenstand des Monitorings und der Evaluation im VEP sein (vgl. Kap. 5.9).

Abbildung 14 zeigt die bestehenden Anlagen, potenzielle Standorte an Haltestellen von S-Bahn und Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn sowie die Bereiche mit Untersuchungsbedarf.

## 6.6.9 Fähren und Bergbahnen

Die bestehenden Fähren sind wichtige Elemente, um insbesondere im Fuß- und Radverkehr aber auch im Kfz-Verkehr möglichst kurze Wege ohne Umwege und Reisezeitverlängerungen zu gewährleisten. Alle bestehenden Dresdner Fährstandorte sind zu sichern. Der Fährbetrieb in Dres

Seite 146
Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus
Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025

den muss aber angesichts der Bedeutung des Dresdner Landschaftsraumes für die Stadt, der besonderen Erlebbarkeit und der Situation „Stadt und Leben am Fluss“ auch stärker unter qualitativen Gesichtspunkten gesehen werden.

Im Vergleich zu den Folgen von Brückenverbindungen wird deutlich, dass es gerade die nahräumliche Wirkung der Fährstandorte ist, die es ermöglicht, direkte Verbindungen ohne negative verkehrliche Wirkungen herzustellen. Dabei liegen deren Kosten selbst bei geringerem Kostendeckungsgrad weit unter denen von Brückenverbindungen.

Im VEP Dresden wird als Maßnahme im Fährbereich die Prüfung und Einrichtung einer neuen Fährverbindung zwischen Ostragehege und „Pieschener Winkel“ (Altpieschen) mit entsprechender Zuwegung als Vorstufe einer erst deutlich nach 2025 denkbaren Brückenverbindung für ÖPNV, Rad und Fuß empfohlen. Die Einrichtung einer solchen Fährverbindung sollte dabei unter dem Aspekt innovativer, kostengünstiger Betriebskonzepte als ein Beitrag zur gezielten Entlastung des Dreyßigplatzes geprüft werden.

Die Notwendigkeit dieser Fährverbindung ergibt sich aus den Impulsen der Stadtentwicklung im Ostragehege, der Friedrichstadt und im Stadtentwicklungsgebiet Kaditz sowie im Bereich der Pieschener HafenCity. Auch das steigende Besucheraufkommen der Messe Dresden und deren nur einseitige Erreichbarkeit im ÖPNV und im Kfz-Verkehr mit teils großen Rückstaueffekten unterstreichen die Sinnhaftigkeit einer solchen Fährverbindung.

Der Standort am Pieschener Winkel/ Altpieschen ermöglicht zudem die sehr gute Verknüpfung mit 3 Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahnlinien (Linien 4, 9 und 13) sowie mit dem rechtsseitigen Elberad- und -wanderweg.

Zählungen während des Probebetriebs einer Fähre am weniger günstigen Standort Moritzburger Straße nach Ende des Evangelischen Kirchentages 2011 haben ein höheres Fahrgastaufkommen ergeben, als auf der bereits bestehenden Fähre in Niederpoyritz. Der Einrichtung einer Fährverbindung kommt auch deshalb hohe Bedeutung zu, weil der Bau einer Fußgängerbrücke (Stand 12/2012) eher kritisch eingeschätzt wird (Beauflagungen, Umweltschutz, Höhenentwicklung, Kosten usw.).

Die Bergbahnen haben sowohl im Alltagsverkehr als auch im touristischen Verkehr ihre Berechtigung und sollen deshalb in der heutigen Form gesichert werden. Optimierungen sind anlagenseitig bei der Radmitnahme sowie allgemein bei der tariflichen Einbindung denkbar.

# 6.7 Radverkehr

Der VEP Dresden 2025plus soll der wachsenden Rolle des Radverkehrs gerecht werden. Er kann allerdings kein gesamtstädtisches Radverkehrskonzept ersetzen, da die dafür erforderliche kleinteilige Bearbeitungstiefe hier nicht erreicht wird. Im Bereich Radverkehr wird sich der VEP deshalb auf:

konzeptionelle Maßnahmen (z. B. der Verkehrssicherheit)
baulich-organisatorische Kernaussagen für Bereiche mit dringendem Handlungserfordernis
ein Netz von Radkorridoren
Prinzipien für Radabstellanlagen in Kernbereichen
Schnittstellen mit dem ÖPNV (Bike+Ride) und
Innovationsansätze

konzentrieren. Diese Grundlagen sollen bezüglich einer weiteren nahräumlichen Durcharbeitung als Aufgabenstellung für das gesamtstädtische Radverkehrskonzept und weiteren vertiefenden Untersuchungen dienen. Der Nationale Radverkehrsplan mit seiner Netzmethodik kann für das zu erstellende Radverkehrskonzept Teil der methodischen Grundlage sein.

# 6.7.1 Konzeptionelle Maßnahmen

Für eine Verbesserung des Radklimas in der Stadt und als Voraussetzung für bauliche Maßnahmen mit hohem Nutzen sind verschiedene konzeptionelle Ansätze im Radverkehr zielführend:

verstärkte Konzentration auf Verkehrssicherheit und richtliniengerechte Gestaltung von Radwegen und Knotenpunkten, umfeldgerechte Geschwindigkeitsregelungen und Berücksichtigung von Kapazitätsgrenzen durch steigende Nachfrage,
Etablieren einer konzertierten Kampagne, das Radfahren auf Gehwegen planerisch zu vermeiden und dies StVO-gerecht konsequent durchzusetzen (Gehwege weitgehend ohne Radverkehr als Planungsprinzip, mit Einzelfallprüfung und entsprechender Abstimmung mit der Straßenverkehrsbehörde, Berücksichtigung im Radverkehrskonzept)
sinngemäße Umsetzung des Radverkehrskonzepts Innenstadt aus dem Jahr 2007 sowie die Aktualisierung von ausgewählten Maßnahmen und Ansätzen,
Erarbeitung und Realisierung eines integrierten Radverkehrskonzeptes für die Gesamtstadt unter Einbeziehung der Vorgaben des VEP 2025plus, des bestehenden Radverkehrskonzeptes Innenstadt 2007 und den bestehenden Nord/ Süd bzw. Ost/ West-Routen,
Festlegung von geeigneten Schulradrouten für alle Dresdner Schulen im Zuge der Konzeptionen im Radverkehr bzw. der Schulwegeplanung,

Tariflicher und fahrzeugtechnischer Erhalt bzw. Verbesserung der Radmitnahme im ÖPNV,
Stärkung der/des Radverkehrsverantwortlichen, sodass nicht nur die kommunale Radverkehrsstrategie offensiv bei allen Planungsprozessen vertreten werden sondern zusätzlich die starke Förderung des Fuß- und das Radverkehr als primäres Aufgabenziel verfolgt werden kann,
fachliche Prüfung, inwiefern Radverkehr im Mischverkehr an verkehrsabhängigen LSA detektiert werden kann und Aufzeigen von Lösungen, falls dies nicht möglich ist.

Die langfristige Flächenvorhaltung ist für folgende Bereiche erforderlich:

Trassensicherung von Teilen der ehemaligen Übigauer Güterbahn für eine Radverbindung Junge Heide - Forststraße (Radebeul) - Kaditzer Flutrinne - Elbe als Ergänzung des rechtselbischen Elberad- und -wanderweges in Kooperation mit der Stadt Radebeul,
Flächenvorhaltung für den Bau einer Fußgänger- und Radverbindung an der Westseite des Hauptbahnhofs zur Verbindung der Südvorstadt mit der Prager Straße/ Reitbahnstraße,
Flächenvorhaltung für eine Elbquerung als Umweltbrücke (Fuß/ Rad/ ÖPNV) zum Ostragehege im Bereich Kötzschenbroder Straße als dauerhafte Alternative zu einer Fähre.

## 6.7.2 Baulich-organisatorische Maßnahmen

Auf Grundlage der konzeptionellen Ansätze sind die nachfolgenden baulichen Maßnahmen im Sinne einer Förderung des Radverkehrs in der Verkehrsentwicklung wichtig:

Prüfung und bedarfsgerechte Errichtung straßenbegleitender Radverkehrsanlagen oder Schutzstreifen an Hauptverkehrsstraßen unter Berücksichtigung von Verkehrsmengen, Geschwindigkeiten, ruhendem Verkehr, Leistungsfähigkeit und Sicherheit (siehe auch Anlage 7), z. B. auf folgenden Straßen:

Am Walde, Antonstraße, Bautzner Straße/ Bautzner Landstraße, Dresdner Straße/ Meißner Landstraße, Cossebaude, Fetscherstraße, Franz-Liszt-Straße/ Wasastraße/ Lockwitzer Straße, Gerok/ Blasewitzer/ Loschwitzer Straße, Große Meißner Straße/ Köpckestraße, Hansastraße/ Schlesischer Platz/ Hainstraße, Kesselsdorfer Straße, Königsbrücker Straße, Magdeburger Straße/ Bremer Straße, Schäferstraße, Schillerplatz/ Körnerplatz/ Grundstraße, Stauffenbergallee, Strehlener Straße., Stübelallee (Richtung Straßburger Platz), Zellescher Weg (Beidrichtungsradwege) – in Umsetzung befinden sich derzeit Albertbrücke/ Sachsenplatz, Schandauer/ Borsbergstraße und Teile der Bautzner Straße.

Prüfung der bestandsnahen Umgestaltung ausgewählter vierstreifiger Querschnitte zu überbreiten oder zweistreifigen Querschnitten mit Schutz- oder Radfahrstreifen bei überwiegender

LVM VERITAS

Beibehaltung der bestehenden Kapazitäten im Kfz-Verkehr an den Knotenpunkten - z. B. Bürgerweise/ Parkstraße, Winterbergstraße oder Wigardstraße.

Abschnittsweiser Ausbau des Elberad- und -wanderwegs
zwischen Blauem Wunder und Albertbrücke (Ausbau des Bestandes und Trennung Fuß/ Rad linkselbisch, Oberflächenverbesserung Körnerweg rechtselbisch),
im Bereich Flutrinne Washingtonstraße (Alternative zur Trasse über den Elbepark) sowie
Entwicklung alternativer Führungen zur Entlastung bestehender Wege im Rahmen des Radverkehrskonzeptes.

Komplettierung des Radwegs im "Grünzug Weißeritz" (derzeit Führung der Deutschlandroute D4 über Löbtauer Straße – Weißeritzstraße).

Komplettierung des rechtselbischen Elberad- und -wanderwegs durch den Bau eines elbna- hen, straßenfernen Weges zwischen Loschwitz und Pillnitz.

Kurzfristige Verbesserungen der Radverkehrsbeziehungen am Postplatz z. B. zwischen Ostraallee und Wilsdruffer Straße sowie Marienstraße und Ostraallee durch minimale Anpassungen bei provisorischen Einbauten, Beschilderung und weiteren Einzelelementen, um den Radverkehr zu kanalisieren und die Fußgängerbereiche zu schützen¹³.

Einrichtung einer Fußgänger- und Radfahrerfahre zum Ostragehege im Bereich Altpieschen und Sicherung attraktiver Wegeanbindungen dahin (Vorstufe zu einer möglichen Brückenverbindung für ÖPNV, Rad und Fuß).

Umgestaltung bzw. Ertüchtigung wichtiger innerstädtischer Brückenköpfe für direkte Radanbindungen (z. B. Rampen und Querungen sowie Transport- und Schiebehilfen), insbesondere an der Marienbrücke und an den nördlichen Brückenköpfen von Augustus- und Carolabrücke.

Ausstattung der Augustusbrücke mit ebenen Bereichen zur Führung des Radverkehrs im Straßenraum zur Konfliktvermeidung mit Fußgängerinnen und Fußgängern.

Ausbau bzw. Ausweisung permanenter, sicherer und komfortabler Ausweichstrecken für den Elberad- und -wanderweg bei Veranstaltungen sowie bei Hochwasser in den Bereichen Altstadt/ Königsufer, Terrassenufer, Flutrinne im Ostragehege und Festplatz Marienbrücke - insbesondere die Strecken Leipziger Straße - Große Meißner Straße - Köpckestraße - Wigardstraße - Carusufer - Bautzner Straße und Wilsdruffer Straße - Postplatz - Ostraallee - Magdeburger Straße - Bremer Straße - Hamburger Straße.

Berücksichtigung der Belange des Radverkehrs durch Öffnung von Einbahnstraßen, Beschilderung bzw. Durchfahrbarkeit von Sackgassen, bei Baustelleneinrichtungen und temporären Sperrungen (Wegweisung und sichere sowie komfortable Alternativen).

Sukzessive Anpassung aller bis dato nicht-richtliniengerechten Radverkehrsanlagen im Bestand auf Basis einer Prioritätenliste des zu erarbeitenden Radverkehrskonzeptes, insofern

das finanzierbar und nicht durch Sanierungen abgedeckt ist bzw. im zu erarbeitenden Radverkehrskonzept auch gefordert wird.

Ausbau der regionalen Anbindungen im Radverkehr entlang des Elbtals (Radebeul, Heidenau/ Pirna und auch Gemeinde Klipphausen mit den OT Wildberg, Constappel und Gauernitz) sowie nach Norden (Radeberg) und Süden (Bannewitz, Freital, Kesselsdorf/ Wilsdruff) durch Kooperation mit den Nachbarkommunen bei der Erarbeitung und Umsetzung von Radnetz-konzeptionen.

Ausgewählte, darstellbare Maßnahmen im Radverkehr sind als **Abbildung 15** beigefügt.

Im Rahmen des VEP wird vorgeschlagen, im Einklang mit der aktuellen Beschlusslage im Stadtrat das allgemeine Ziel einer Verbesserung der Ganzjahresnutzbarkeit wichtiger Elemente des Radnetzes unter Berücksichtigung wirtschaftlicher und umweltseitiger Gesichtspunkte zu verfolgen. Dabei sind sowohl Fragen der Finanzierung als auch der praktischen Umsetzung weiter zu diskutieren. Zudem können auch kostenneutrale Maßnahmen wie (z. B. optimierte Ablageplätze für Räumgut außerhalb von Radnetzelementen und Rampen) bereits zu Verbesserungen bei der Ganzjahresnutzbarkeit führen. Der Themenkomplex bleibt vor dem Hintergrund der modalen Entwicklung (Trend zu mehr Radverkehr) sowie den Leitzielforderungen zur Radverkehrsförderung und zur Verkehrssicherheit weiter fachlich aktuell.

# 6.7.3 Radkorridore

Als auszuformende Grundlage für das Radverkehrskonzept wurde ein Netz wichtiger Radkorridore erarbeitet. Sie sollen vor allem einen verbindenden und bündelnden Charakter haben, der sich an den folgenden Strukturen orientiert:

bestehende zentralräumliche Struktur der Stadt (nach InSEK und Zentrenkonzept),
weitere Schwerpunkte des Wohnens,
ausgewählte wichtige funktionale Ziele (Arbeit, Bildung, Kultur, Einkauf, Freizeit u. a.),
Vernetzungen mit dem Umland im Elbthal sowie außerhalb des Elbtals sowie
naturräumliche Strukturen (Topografie, Elbquerungen, Talbereiche).

Die Vorgaben des Verkehrskonzepts 2003 (Plan 25) wurden aufgegriffen und im Sinne einer konzeptionell-organisatorischen Vorarbeit für das Radverkehrskonzept Dresden aggregiert und angepasst fortgeschrieben. Konkrete Anlagetypen oder Straßenräume sowie Fragen der feinräumlichen Erschließung können auf Ebene des VEP noch nicht betrachtet werden. Allerdings ist anzumerken, dass für das Radnetz größtenteils auf bestehende Straßen und Wege sowie die beschilderten Hauptrouten (Nord-Süd/ Ost-West) zurückgegriffen werden muss, wenn der Radverkehr seine Stärke bei der nahräumlichen und direkten Verkehrsverbindung behalten soll.

Das Netz der Radkorridore Dresden ist als **Abbildung 16** beigefügt, wobei Änderungen durch die Dresdner Debatte im Bereich Südhöhe und Münchner Straße aufgenommen wurden. Abbildung 16 wird aktualisiert, sobald das Dresdner Radverkehrskonzept vollständig beschlossen vorliegt.

Das zu erarbeitende Radverkehrskonzept mit seinen Bestandteilen soll die Radkorridore weiter untersetzen und dabei weitere Rahmenplanungen wie z. B. das SachsenNetzRad und die Hochwasserschutzkonzepte einbinden. Das Radverkehrskonzept soll auch zeigen, auf welchen der dargestellten Radkorridore bei besonders hohem Nachfragepotenzial „Radschnellwege“ ausgewiesen werden könnten, die eine besonders attraktive Ausstattung aufweisen. Als Kriterien für „Radschnellwege“ werden international die folgenden Ansätze genutzt:

ebene Oberflächen und attraktive Breiten,
niveaufreie oder kreuzungsarme Führung in Verbindung mit festen Reisezeitanforderungen,
grüne Welle für Radverkehr,
Haltegriffe und Wartezeitanzeigen vor unvermeidbaren Knotenpunkten oder LSA,
prioritärer Winterdienst,
günstige Verknüpfungen mit dem weiteren Radnetz,
ausreichend Abstellanlagen im Umfeld und wegweisende Beschilderung.

Seite 152
Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus
Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025
LVM VERITAS

Als „Radschnellwege“ sollten u. a. die bestehenden Ost-West- oder Nord-Süd-Routen oder eine bahnparallele Achse aus Heidenau zum Stadtzentrum/ Elberad- und -wanderweg geprüft werden.

Im Radverkehrskonzept soll auch geprüft werden:
ob ein Alternativradweg im Altelbarm Lauben/ Laubegast sinnvoll ist,
unter welchen Bedingungen die Einrichtung von Fahrradstraßen (mit Kfz-frei) möglich ist und
welche Verkehrsqualitäten und Kapazitäten im Radverkehr zukünftig erforderlich sind.

Geprüft werden soll auch, ob ein Grünpeil für Radfahrer an LSA sicher und sinnvoll ist.

## 6.7.4 Radabstellanlagen und Schnittstellen mit dem ÖPNV (Bike+Ride, Park+Bike)

Die Förderung intermodaler Angebote muss besonders die Schnittstelle Radverkehr/ ÖPNV betrachten, um hier Synergien zu nutzen (Mitnahmemöglichkeiten) aber auch den tatsächlichen Umstieg forcieren, um Kapazitätsprobleme der Fahrradmitnahme bei akzeptablen Kosten verringern zu können. Aber auch das zielnahe und sichere Abstellen von Fahrrädern ist für die Attraktivität des Gesamtsystems Fahrrad essentiell. Maßnahmen in diesem Bereich sind:

Einrichtung von attraktiven und ausreichend dimensionierten Bike+Ride-Anlagen an den S-Bahn-Stationen und Bahnhöfen sowie Fahrradabstellanlagen an allen Stadtbahnhaltestellen und Endstellen (als Standard, von dem in begründeten Einzelfällen abgewichen werden darf), an Fähren sowie Bergbahnen – auch mit dem Ziel, aus Kapazitätsgründen Zubringer- und Abbringerfahrten per Rad zur Haltestelle gegenüber der Radmitnahme im ÖPNV zu fördern.
Prüfung von Bike+Ride auch an wichtigen Busrouten.
Prüfung und ggf. Ausweisung geeigneter Plätze für das Parken von Kfz und Weiternutzung des mitgebrachten Fahrrades (Park+Bike).
Umsetzung des Planungsprinzips zur Anordnung von Radabstellanlagen außerhalb des Verkehrsraums für Fußgänger und Sicherung einer ausreichenden Gehwegbreite auch für mobilitätseingeschränkte Personen.
deutlicher Ausbau der Abstellanlagen im Radverkehr an öffentlichen Einrichtungen (Universitäten, Hochschulen, Bibliotheken), Kultureinrichtungen, Einkaufsschwerpunkten, Krankenhäusern, Freizeitzielen oder Bahnhöfen u. a. durch das zielnahe Aufstellen von einer ausreichenden Anzahl von Radbügeln sowie auch überdachter Anlagen und weiterer Serviceangebote (z. B. Helmfächer) auch unter Einbindung privater Betreiber und der lokalen Wirtschaft.
Unterstützung privater Akteure bei Einführung bzw. Betrieb eines flächendeckenden und systematischen Angebots von öffentlichen Lehrrädern in der Innenstadt, an ÖPNV-Verknüpfungspunkten, Parkierungsschwerpunkten und ausgewählten Stadtteilzentren unter Einbindung in weitere Formen multimodaler Mobilität (z. B. ÖPNV, Carsharing).

WBS

Motivation von Arbeitgebern, im und am Standort Abstellanlagen sowie Serviceeinrichtungen für Radfahrerinnen und Radfahrer anzubieten sowie verstärkte Berücksichtigung von Radabstellanlagen als Vorgabe in der Bauleitplanung.
Aufbau von Radstationen mit geeigneten Betriebskonzepten am Hauptbahnhof sowie am Bahnhof Dresden-Neustadt.

Bei der Umsetzung ist zu berücksichtigen, dass große Radabstellanlagen vor bestimmten Formen der Langzeitnutzung (Stichwort „Schrotträder“) geschützt werden müssen. Vermieterinnen und Vermieter und Besitzerinnen und Besitzer von Wohnimmobilien sollten zudem dazu angehalten werden, ausreichend viele, sichere und attraktive Radabstellanlagen im Wohnumfeld vorzuhalten.

In Abbildung 17 sind Standorte von Bike+Ride nach Kategorien unter Berücksichtigung der Planungen im ÖPNV dargestellt. Aus Gründen der Übersichtlichkeit wurden nicht alle Stadtbahnhaltestellen dargestellt.

## 6.8 Barrierefreiheit und Fußgängerverkehr

Der Fußgängerverkehr ist die umwegempfindlichste Mobilitätsform. Für die Attraktivität Dresdens als Wirtschafts- und Tourismusstandort aber auch für die tägliche Mobilität der Bevölkerung ist der Fußgängerverkehr ein oft unterschätztes aber essentielles Element. Die Fragen des Fußgängerverkehrs sind stets verbunden mit Anforderungen an die Barrierefreiheit und damit auch an Inklusion, Demografiefestigkeit und Geschlechtergerechtigkeit von Mobilität. Insbesondere die seit 2009 in Deutschland verbindliche UN-Behindertenrechtskonvention setzt hier hohe Anforderungen, denen nicht nur der VEP Dresden 2025plus genügen muss sondern auf die bereits der:

aktuell erarbeitete „Aktionsplan zur Umsetzung der UN-Behindertenrechtskonvention“,
die Neuaufstellung des Personenbeförderungsgesetzes (PBefG) bzw. die Nahverkehrsplanung im ÖPNV sowie
die Umsetzung laufender Programme (z. B. das Gehwegprogramm des STA)

eingehen. Auf bestimmte stadträumliche Defizitbereiche wie:

Fußgängerübergang im Bereich Prager Straße/ Waisenhausstraße/ Dr.-Külz-Ring,
Schillerplatz/ Körnerplatz sowie
Neustädter Markt/ Augustusbrücke

wird zudem in Kapitel 6.9.2 eingegangen.

V

Aufgrund der Kleinteiligkeit der Maßnahmen im Fußgängerverkehr bestehen diese im VEP - bis auf bestimmte Ausnahmen durch besondere räumliche Problemlagen - aus strategischen und planerischen Anforderungen und Innovationen, die in der nahräumlichen Verkehrsplanung (z. B. durch verkehrliche Rahmenpläne oder teilräumliche Verkehrskonzepte) sowie im Zuge verkehrlicher Planungen und Anordnungen umgesetzt werden müssen. Eine Vielzahl dieser Maßnahmen ist bereits in vorliegenden (aber noch nicht umgesetzten) Konzepten wie den teilräumlichen Lärmaktionsplänen bereits benannt worden.

# Konzeptionelle Maßnahmen

Konzeptionelle Maßnahmen sind Voraussetzung für effektive bauliche Maßnahmen. Von besonderer Bedeutung sind dabei Intensivierung, Fortführung bzw. Berücksichtigung folgender Aspekte:

Gleichberechtigte, flächenhafte und integrative Berücksichtigung der Belange des Fußgängerverkehrs bei Maßnahmen im öffentlichen Verkehrsraum unter Berücksichtigung aktueller Vorgaben und einer Erhöhung von Qualität und Sicherheit (z. B. Beidseitigkeit der Anlagen bei entsprechender Baustruktur, größtmöglicher Freiraum für Gehwege als Planungsprinzip, ebene Oberflächen und gute Sichtbeziehungen).
Sicherung der Nahmobilität durch die Erarbeitung eines stadtweiten „Netzkonzepts Fußverkehr“ und Umsetzung bzw. Aktualisierung teilräumlicher Verkehrskonzepte¹⁴ mit besonderer Berücksichtigung von:
anforderungsgerechten Querungsstellen der Hauptverkehrsstraßen und Gleistrassen unter Berücksichtigung von Netzdichte und Ortsteilzentren,
der rechtlichen Sicherung von Durchwegungen in Stadtquartieren bzw. dem zeitnahen Ausbau bereits geplanter Durchwegungen (Durchgängigkeit von Gebieten für Fußgänger und Radfahrer als Standard weiterverfolgen).
Berücksichtigung der Fußgängerbelange im Vorfeld wichtiger Ziele wie Haltestellen, Bahnhöfe, Gesundheitseinrichtungen, Seniorenbegenungsstätten, Verwaltungen, Schulen, Kitas, Bildungseinrichtungen, Kultureinrichtungen usw. durch ausreichende Dimensionierung und Gestaltung der Anlagen, Gehwegvorstreckungen sowie Schutz gegen ruhenden Kfz- und Verkehr.
Berücksichtigung der Anforderungen mobilitätseingeschränkter Personen sowie von Personen mit Kinderwagen u. ä. bei Ausbau und Sanierungen defizitärer Gehwege und Querungen durch z. B. durchgehend erschütterungsfrei überrollbare Flächen auch auf den Zuwegungen zum ÖPNV oder den Elbfahren sowie Freihalten von Hindernissen wie abgestellten Fahrrädern sowie weiteren Einbauten.
Verdichtung sicherer Querungsmöglichkeiten für den Fußgängerverkehr z. B.

¹⁴ derzeit liegen teilräumliche Verkehrskonzepte oder Lärmaktionspläne bereits für den 26er Ring, Striesen-Ost/ Blasewitz, Äußere Neustadt und die Friedrichstadt vor – diese sind aber teilweise noch nicht beschlossen bzw. umgesetzt

durch ausreichend breite Mittelinseln auf stark belasteten innerstädtischen Straßen (Abstand der Querungen in angebauten Bereichen ca. 200 m) sowie
den verstärkten Einsatz von Zebrastreifen.

Vermeidung langer Wartezeiten für Fußgängerinnen und Fußgänger an LSA, u. a. durch wartezeitoptimierte Signalisierung bei reduzierten Umlaufzeiten sowie die weitgehende Vermeidung von Anforderungstastern.
Etablieren familien- und seniorenfreundlicher Ansätze zur Querungsgeschwindigkeit unter Ausnutzung des vollen Ermessensspielraums der jeweils aktuellen Richtlinien.
Nutzung aktivierbarer „Dunkel-Dunkel-LSA“ für Fußgängerinnen und Fußgänger außerhalb von Knotenpunkten und Ausstattung von verkehrlich geeigneten LSA mit Alles-Grün-Regelungen für den Fußgängerverkehr (siehe hierzu auch Kapitel 6.9.7 „Innovationen im Verkehrsbereich“).
Vermeidung von Radfahren auf Gehwegen als Planungsprinzip entsprechend aktueller Richtlinien mit Anpassungen in den betroffenen Straßenräumen.
Berücksichtigung der Belange von Fußgängerverkehr und behinderten Menschen bei Baustelleneinrichtungen und temporären Sperrungen.

# Baulich-organisatorische Maßnahmen

Die konzeptionellen Ansätze bei Barrierefreiheit und Fußgängerverkehr können durch verschiedene bauliche Einzelmaßnahmen weiter unterstützt werden, wobei im Rahmen eines VEP nur größere Maßnahmen aufgeführt werden können:

Einrichtung einer ebenerdigen Fußgängerquerung Albertstraße Höhe Archivplatz (Ritterstraße) und Rückbau der Überführung,
Teilrückbau der Überführung Königsbrücker Straße/ Haltepunkt Industriegelände (Beschluss liegt vor) und Ausbau der Fußgängerquerung (ggf. auch für Radverkehr nutzbar).
Realisierung der im Fußgängerkonzept Innenstadt benannten wichtigen Maßnahmeansätze für die Sicherheit von Querungen im Bereich Metzer Straße/ Hauptstraße, Palaisplatz und südliche Querung des Albertplatzes.
Konfliktvermeidung bzw. -minderung zwischen Fußgängerverkehr und Radverkehr auf touristisch stark genutzten Brücken (Augustusbrücke, Blaues Wunder) durch attraktive Radverkehrsführungen bzw. -angebote außerhalb der Gehwegbereiche.
Verbesserung der Querungen bzw. konsequente Verkehrsberuhigung in touristisch wichtigen Bereichen der inneren Altstadt (z. B. Augustusbrücke, Schlossplatz, Theaterplatz, Sophienstraße, Taschenberg, Terrassenufer, Seestraße) durch Prüfung und Umsetzung geeigneter baulicher und verkehrsorganisatorischer Maßnahmen (z. B. auch Tempo 30) sowie Umgestal-

tung des Knotenpunktes Theaterplatz/ Terrassenufer und Verbesserung der Querungssituation.

Prüfung ausgewählter Bereiche der Innenstadt und der Stadtteilzentren für eine barrierefreie Nutzung nach dem derzeit in Entwicklung befindlichen Ansatz von "Begegnungszonen":
Tempo-20-Zone mit besonderer Berücksichtigung von Barrierefreiheit und Fußgängerquerungen, z. B. mit niedrigen Borden, guten Sichtbeziehungen, Verzicht auf LSA und Vorfahrtrregelungen und weitgehend Rad-Mischverkehr im Straßenraum,
zudem besondere Berücksichtigung von Straßenbahnverkehr und den daraus erwachsenden Anforderungen.
Freihalten von Laufachsen von Fußgängerinnen und Fußgängern sowie Sicherung notwendiger Sichtbeziehungen.
Leichte Anpassungen der provisorischen Hochbeete am Postplatz, um den Radverkehr zu kanalisieren und die Fußgängerbereiche zu erweitern und zu schützen¹⁵.
Weitere Verdichtung der Anbindungen des Elberad- und Gehweges an das Straßen- und Wegenetz.
Prüfung des Einsatzes von Restzeitanzeigen bei Fußgänger-LSA bzw. Signalgebern.

Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung des Fußgängerverkehrs sind eine stadtweite Aufgabe. Soweit die genannten Maßnahmen im Fußgängerverkehr konkreten Stadtbereichen zuzuordnen waren, wurden sie in Abbildung 18 dargestellt.

## 6.9 Integrierte bzw. ressortübergreifende Maßnahmen

## 6.9.1 Stadtqualität und Verkehr

Der Gesamtprozess der Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung ist zwar in der Überlagerung aller Maßnahmen als integrierter Prozess angelegt. Einzelne Maßnahmen lassen sich allerdings bestimmten Verkehrsträgern zuordnen, da sie vor allem dort ihre Wirkungen entfalten. Die hier dargestellten Maßnahmen lassen sich aber keinem einzelnen Verkehrsträger zuordnen, sondern beschreiben multimodale, integrierte, qualitative oder raumbezogene Prozesse.

Die Stadtqualität ist ein äußerst heterogenes und umfassendes Themenfeld. Durch den Ansatz, Verkehr als dienendes Element der Stadtentwicklung zu definieren, konnten Maßnahmen beschrieben werden, die eine Schnittstelle zwischen Verkehrs- und Stadtraum und damit Verkehrs- und Stadtplanung schaffen. Eine besondere Rolle spielt dabei das „Leben mit Verkehr“ der in vertretbarem Maß und durch geeignete Mobilitätsformen Ausdruck einer lebendigen und prosperierenden Stadt ist. Als konzeptionelle Ansätze zur Umsetzung dieser Strategie sind geeignet:

Rückgewinnung von durch ruhenden und fließenden Verkehr belegten Straßenräumen zur Erhöhung der Wohn- und Aufenthaltsqualität insbesondere in der Innenstadt und in den Stadtteilzentren,
Erhöhung der Grünanteile in der Stadt im Rahmen von Umbau- oder Sanierungsmaßnahmen zur Verbesserung des Stadtklimas unter Berücksichtigung des Straßenbaumkonzeptes aber auch unter Berücksichtigung der erforderlichen Breiten der Seitenräume für Fußgängerverkehr, Geschäfts Nutzung oder Aufenthalt (z. B. durch Festsetzung von straßenbegleitenden Grünachsen).
Umsetzung der baulichen und modalen Maßnahmen des Masterplanes Lärmminderung sowie der bestehenden teilgebietlichen Pläne zur Lärmminderung und zur Luftreinhaltung in Dresden, u. a. Tempo 100 zur Minderung von Emissionen auf der Autobahn A 4 im Bereich von Siedlungsgebieten im Stadtgebiet.

Bei der Diskussion um den Zusammenhang von Stadtqualität und Verkehr ist auch die St.-Petersburger-Straße zu benennen. Mit der Entwicklung des Promenadenrings der Innenstadt sollen die immensen Trennwirkungen durch starke Verkehrsströme und enorme Raumwiderstände teilweise gemindert und die Aufenthaltsqualität verbessert werden. Ein ggf. denkbarer kompakter Umbau der Verkehrsanlage (etwa von Carolapalatz bis Georgplatz) müsste jedoch vor dem Hintergrund der verkehrlichen Bündelungsfunktion zwingend mit der Wahrung der Leistungsfähigkeit für Kfz-Verkehr, ÖPNV und Radverkehr in der heutigen Größenordnung verbunden sein. Verkehrlicherseits besteht derzeit kein Anlass zum weiteren Umbau des Straßenzuges, weshalb der VEP auch keine entsprechende Maßnahme enthält.

Bisher in der Stadtentwicklung nicht ausreichend berücksichtigt sind Fragestellungen der mit hoher Nutzungsdichte durch Wohnen, Arbeiten oder Dienstleistung versehener großstädtischer Magistralen. Wie in der Analyse erwähnt (siehe Kapitel 2.2.4) hat Dresden bedingt durch die Kriegsschäden von 1945 eine Vielzahl seiner charakteristischen großen Straßenzüge verloren. In weiter außen liegenden Stadtteilen haben sich noch einige großstädtische Straßenräume erhalten, die aber durch hohe Verkehrsmengen und starke Belastungen des Umfeldes mit Lärm, Staub und Trennwirkung problematisch sind. Als solche „großstädtische Magistralen“ werden Straßen bezeichnet, auf die folgendes Muster zutrifft:

Kategorie Hauptverkehrsstraße oder Hauptsammelstraße nach Flächennutzungsplan, Beiplan Verkehr,
beidseitig direkt und mehrgeschossig angebaut (größtenteils geschlossene Bebauung) mit Mischnutzung aus Wohnen, Dienstleistung, Gewerbe und/oder Einzelhandel,
Straßenbahn/Stadtbahn in Mittellage (Bestand oder Planung),
DTV &gt;10.000 Kfz/24 h (Stand 2011) und einheitliche Charakteristik auf mindestens 500 m.

Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus
Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025

LVM VERITAS

An diesen Magistralen ist auch langfristig von Verkehrsmengen auszugehen, die mit über 10.000 Kfz/Tag auch absehbar nicht denen einer Wohnstraße entsprechen. Da in diesen Bereichen überwiegend keine Verlagerungsalternativen im Netz bestehen, wird dort auch in Zukunft das Prinzip „Leben mit Verkehr“ gelten. Aufgabe der Stadt- und Verkehrsplanung ist es dabei, ein hohe Verträglichkeit zwischen allen Nutzungsansprüchen zu schaffen. Verbunden mit dem Vorteil hoher Erschließungsgunst im ÖPNV und der guten Versorgungssituation müssen innovative und zukunftsfähige Lösungen erarbeitet werden, die diese wenigen noch vorhandenen großstädtischen Straßenräume Dresdens sichern und sowohl für Handel und Gewerbe als auch für Wohnen attraktiv machen. Eine umfassende Verträglichkeit von Stadtqualität und Verkehr ist nur dann gegeben, wenn auch diese besondere Problemstellungen gelöst sind und eine Stadt sowohl ihr „Gesicht“ erhält und gleichzeitig die erforderliche Mobilität und eine umfeldgerechte Verkehrsabwicklung gewährleistet. Zu den Gestaltungsansätzen für großstädtische Magistralen gehören:

eine attraktive Straßenraumaufteilung als Kompromiss zwischen verkehrlicher und räumlicher Funktion,
intensive Begrünung und hochwertige Gestaltungen mit ortsüblichen Materialien,
Gestaltung von lokalen, geschützten „Rückzugsbereichen“ (kleinteilige Aufenthaltsbereiche mit Sichtschutz, Begrünung und Sitzmöbeln),
intelligente Nutzungskonzepte, die verkehrlichen Emissionen einbeziehen,
Berücksichtigung des Fußgänger- und Radverkehrs (Abstellen, Queren, ausreichende Breiten) sowie einer sehr guten Erreichbarkeit im ÖPNV,
Berücksichtigung von ruhendem Verkehr, Liefern und Laden,
Sicherung der gewerblichen und dienstleistungsbezogenen Funktionen auch mit entsprechend dimensionierten Randbereichen,
Maßnahmen der Lärmvorsorge und
ein hohes Maß an Verkehrssicherheit.

Dafür müssen Stadtentwicklungsplanung und Verkehrsplanung weiter dauerhafte Kooperationsprozesse forcieren und dabei stets externe verkehrs-, stadt- und freiraumplanerische Fachbeiträge einbeziehen. So sind diese verkehrlich integrierten Lagen langfristig und multifunktional zu erhalten bzw. zu entwickeln. Im Sinne von Leben mit Verkehr und Nutzungsverträglichkeit betrifft das u. a. folgende Straßen:

Bautzner Landstraße zwischen Plattleite und Ullersdorfer Platz,
Bautzner Straße zwischen Albertplatz und Radeberger Straße (Teile derzeit im Bau)
Blasewitzer Straße zwischen Fetscherstraße und Königsheimplatz,

Seite 159
Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus
Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025

LVM VERITAS

Borsbergstraße und Schandauer Straße zwischen Fetscherplatz, Pohlandplatz und Altenberger Straße (Teile derzeit im Bau)
Großenhainer Straße zwischen Pestalozziplatz und Dorothea-Erxleben-Straße,
Kesselsdorfer Straße zwischen Tharandter Straße und Julius-Vahlteich-Straße,
Königsbrücker Straße zwischen Albertplatz und Stauffenbergallee,
Leipziger Straße zwischen Alexander-Puschkin-Platz und Rankestraße (umfassende Sanierung ist erfolgt) und
Nürnberger Straße zwischen Nürnberger Platz und Chemnitzer Straße.

Teilweise betrifft die Fragestellung von Magistralen – bezogen auf andere bauliche Arrondierungen z. B. auch die Bereiche:

Körnerplatz/ Schillerplatz,
Altcotta,
Mickten,
Hubertusplatz,
Trachenberger Platz,
Fetscherplatz und
Wasaplatz.

Zwar trifft auf diese Stadtplätze bzw. Knotenpunkte das Längenkriterium nicht zu, die Nutzungsproblematik und die verkehrlichen Konflikte sind hier aber in ähnlichem Maße vorhanden.

Zu erwähnen ist hier auch der Straßenzug Schäferstraße/ Schweriner Straße, obwohl hier die Blockränder teilweise nicht geschlossen sind. Im Zuge vorliegender Sanierungsplanungen soll dort die verkehrliche Bedeutung besonders im Kfz-Verkehr sinken. Eine solche Entwicklung erscheint aber unter Berücksichtigung erwartbarer Effekte im Verkehrsnetz derzeit als noch nicht absehbar.

Eine Darstellung der Bereiche großstädtischer Magistralen und der Plätze ist als **Abbildung 20** beigefügt.

# 7.9.2 Handlungsansätze für zentrale stadträumliche Defizitbereiche

Für die in Anlage 3 in 3 Gruppen beschriebenen zentralen stadträumlichen Defizitbereichen (siehe dazu auch Kapitel 3.3) wurden mögliche Handlungsansätze beispielhaft entwickelt, die durch Anpassungen im Umfeld aber auch im Problembereich selbst die Defizite beseitigen oder zumindest mindern können.

In Abbildung 19 sind alle Stadtbereiche mit besonderem Handlungsbedarf aufgrund verkehrlich-stadträumlicher Konflikte grafisch dargestellt. Dabei wurde in besagte 3 Gruppen unterschieden, wobei Gruppe 1 die Bereiche beschreibt, die durch schon geplante bzw. beschlossene Maßnahmen abgedeckt werden und dabei eine Umgestaltung erfahren (siehe auch 7.2).

Für die 8 Bereiche der Gruppe 2, wo eine Verbesserung nur durch neue Maßnahmen zu erreichen ist, wurden im Zuge des VEP erste Planungsvorstellungen und Lösungsprinzipien entwickelt. Diese stehen unter einem planerischen und rechtlichen Vorbehalt. Sie müssen deshalb weiter geprüft und entwickelt werden, enthalten aber wichtige Hinweise und Grundlagen aus Sicht der Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung. Die Entwicklung konkreter Handlungsansätze ist im Rahmen des VEP von Bedeutung, da auch eine zielkonträre Maßnahmenentwicklung denkbar ist. Diese sollte im Sinne der dem VEP zu Grunde liegenden verkehrlichen Leitziele und der erkannten stadträumlich-verkehrlichen Defizite aber vermieden werden. Da es sich hier um erkannte zentrale Defizitbereiche mit Beispielcharakter handelt, ist eine detailiertere Darstellung von Handlungsansätzen auch im Zuge eines strategischen Dokumentes wie des VEP angebracht.

Auf Grundlage verschiedener Abstimmungen sind mögliche Handlungsansätze für zentrale stadträumliche Defizitbereiche als Anlage 9 beigefügt. Sie wurden im Beschluss des Stadtrates zur Kenntnis genommen und sollen weiter geprüft werden. Sie sind damit nicht als feste Maßnahmen des VEP zu verstehen. Es handelt sich dabei um die Bereiche:

26er Ring/ Könneritzstraße/ Weißeritzstraße
Dreyßigplatz/ Leipziger Straße
Neustädter Markt/ Augustusbrücke
Sophienstraße/ Theaterplatz/ Altmarkt
Terrassenufer zwischen Steinstraße und Landtag
Schillerplatz/ Körnerplatz/ Blaues Wunder
Waisenhausstraße/ Dr.-Külz-Ring/ Prager Straße
Wasaplatz/ Kreischaer Straße/ Rayskistraße.

Auch für die in Gruppe 3 betrachteten Bereiche („weitere stadträumliche Defizitbereiche“) werden Handlungsansätze zum Abbau der erkannten Defizite in Anlage 9 beschrieben.

# 6.9.3 Verkehrstechnik und -management

Verkehrsinformations- und Verkehrsleitsysteme, wie das dynamischen Wegweisungssystem (Verkehrsleitsystem), das Verkehrsinformationssystem (Informationstafeln) und das dynamische Parkleitsystem können in hohem Maße dazu beitragen, den Kfz-Verkehr möglichst störungsfrei, sicher und auf möglichst kurzen Wegen zu führen.

Das Verkehrsinformationssystem beispielsweise zeigt den Autofahrenden auf 7 Displays aktuelle Informationen über Staus auf den Straßen sowie überfüllte Parkhäuser, Tiefgaragen und sonstige Parkplätze an. Weiterhin informiert es über mögliche Alternativen, z. B. staufreie Fahrtrouten, freie Parkplätze oder die Umsteigemöglichkeiten auf den ÖPNV an P+R-Plätzen. Displays in der Nähe eines P+R-Platzes zeigen deshalb auch immer die Abfahrtszeit der nächsten Straßenbahn/Stadtbahn in Richtung Stadtzentrum an. Ziel ist es, die Autofahrenden so zu informieren, dass sie Fahrtroute, Fahrtziel oder sogar das Verkehrsmittel an die aktuell vorherrschende Verkehrssituation anpassen können. Das Verkehrsmanagementsystem VAMOS II in der 2. Ausbaustufe ist derzeit bereits in Umsetzung. Wichtiger Bestandteil ist das Elbbrückeninformationssystem EBIS mit zzt. 3 Standorten.

Die im Luftreinhalteplan geforderte Verstetigung des Verkehrsflusses an bestimmten Strecken unter Nutzung von Pförtner-LSA wird derzeit untersucht. Ziel ist die Entwicklung der dynamischen Verkehrsbeeinflussungssysteme hin zu einer optimierten, intermodalen Netzbeeinflussung, die auch ein flächendeckendes Baustellen- und Veranstaltungsmanagement sowie Hochwassersituationen umfasst.

Informationen über die aktuelle Position der ÖPNV-Fahrzeuge und ein kontinuierlicher Datenausstausch zwischen dem Betriebsleitsystem des ÖPNV und der LSA-Steuerungszentrale ermöglichen eine innovative LSA-Steuerung. Dabei werden aus Sicht des ÖPNV folgende Zielstellungen verfolgt:

Fahrplanabhängige Bevorrechtigung des ÖPNV in mehreren Stufen (keine erhöhte Priorität bei Verfrühung, jedoch erhöhte Priorität bei Verspätung),
LSA-seitige Unterstützung von dynamischen Anschlüssen (abhängig von der Fahrplanlage) zur Erhöhung der Zuverlässigkeit und für eine verlässliche Halteplatzprognose,
Geschwindigkeitsempfehlungen zur Realisierung energiesparender Fahrweisen und zur Vermeidung unnötiger Halte an LSA.

Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus

Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025

W

Weitere Bestandteile im Bereich Verkehrstechnik und -management sind:

Der Bedarfsgerechte, integrierter Ausbau des Verkehrsmanagementsystems in Dresden und Entwicklung einer innovativen, langfristigen Finanzierungsstrategie für den Unterhalt der Verkehrsleit- und Informationssysteme.
Die Umsetzung von strategisch erforderlichen Erweiterungen bestehender Managementkomponenten.
der Ausbau der Steuerungssysteme an LSA im Bereich komplexer, überstauter Knotenpunktfolgen, auch unter Berücksichtigung von Pünktlichkeit und Umsteigebeziehungen im ÖPNV und der ÖPNV-Beschleunigung als erweiterte intermodale Verkehrsmanagementstruktur zwischen öffentlichem und individuellem Verkehr.
Die verstärkte Integration von Grünen Wellen im Sinne einer Verstetigung des Verkehrsablaufs unter Berücksichtigung intermodaler Effekte bei der LSA-Steuerung.
Die verstärkte Berücksichtigung von wiederkehrenden Straßensperrungen durch Hochwasser andere Ereignisse nicht nur in der Verkehrslenkung sondern auch in den LSA-Steuerungen zur Vermeidung von Leistungsfähigkeitsdefiziten durch sich verlagernde Verkehrsströme.
Die Einbindung der Bedürfnisse des Radverkehrs in telematische Steuerungen sowie in Verkehrsinformations- und -leitsysteme (Nutzung von Unterwellen, Steuerung der LSA sowie Informationen zu reisezeitoptimierten Radrelationen mit minimalen Wartezeiten).
Die Fortführung der Datenerhebungen im fließenden Verkehr im Hauptnetz (Kfz und Rad) und Ausweitung von Analysen auf ausgewählte Teile des nachgeordneten Straßennetzes.

## 6.9.4 Verkehrssicherheit

Die Erhöhung der Verkehrssicherheit in Dresden ist erklärtes Ziel der strategischen Verkehrsentwicklung in Dresden und durch den Beschluss des Verkehrssicherheitskonzeptes 2011 nochmals verstärkt Handlungsauftrag der Stadt Dresden. Dazu gehört entsprechend der verkehrlichen Leitziele in besonderem Maße die Förderung eigenständiger und sicherer Mobilität von Kindern, Jugendlichen und alten Menschen sowie die Erhöhung der Sicherheit aller Verkehrsteilnehmenden durch Umbau bzw. Umgestaltung sicherheitskritischer Verkehrsanlagen. Dabei wird in Dresden die Halbierung der Zahl der Verletzten und die Vermeidung von Verkehrstoten angestrebt. Die Stadt Dresden ist bei den zzt. vorliegenden Unfallstatistiken im Vergleich mit anderen deutschen Großstädten im ungünstigen Bereich platziert¹⁶.

¹⁶ Die entsprechenden Quelldaten des 2011 beschlossenen Verkehrssicherheitskonzeptes stammen aus dem Jahr 2004 und müssen fortgeschrieben werden. Die „ungünstige“ Situation in Dresden benennt der entsprechende Beschluss (SB/035/2011) in der Begründung explizit.

Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus

Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025

^{}[]

Die Maßnahmen des VEP in Strategie und Handlungskonzept sind deshalb darauf angelegt, nach aktuellen fachlichen Erkenntnissen bei allen Maßnahmen die Verkehrssicherheit im Sinne der Nutzenden positiv zu beeinflussen.

Zur Erhöhung der Verkehrssicherheit sollten folgende Maßnahmen umgesetzt bzw. folgende Ansätze weiter verfolgt werden:

Vollständige Umsetzung der Empfehlungen des Verkehrssicherheitskonzeptes Dresden sowie Fortschreibung bzw. Monitoring und Evaluation der diesbezügliche Entwicklungen.
Berücksichtigung einer Bewertung des Sicherheitspotentials von Straßen nach ESAS (Empfehlung für die Sicherheitsanalyse von Straßen, Ausgabe 2002) sowie nach ESN (Empfehlung für das Sicherheitsaudit von Straßennetzen, Ausgabe 2003) bei Analysen zur Verkehrssicherheit.
Verstärkte Konzentration auf Verkehrssicherheitsaspekte bei der Knotenpunktgestaltung.
richtliniengerechte Gestaltung der Rad- und Gehwege sowie von Querungen.
Anordnung umfeldgerechter Geschwindigkeitsregelungen, auch auf Hauptverkehrs- und Hauptsammelstraßen.
Minimierung von Kfz-Hol- und Bringdiensten zu Kitas und Schulen zur Verbesserung der eigenen Verkehrskompetenz von Kindern sowie zur Vermeidung von Unfällen.
Weiterführung der Maßnahmen der Schulwegsicherung (u. a. Fortschreibung der Schulwegpläne für Grundschulen) und der Verkehrserziehung in Kitas und Schulen.
Etablieren einer aktiven Zusammenarbeit der verschiedenen Akteure bei der Verkehrssicherheit (Polizei, ADAC, ADFC, Verwaltung, Schulen) durch Aufbau entsprechender Strukturen.
Absicherung der fachlichen Arbeit der Unfallkommission sowie der Verkehrsüberwachung.
Integration neuer Fortbewegungsarten in die Verkehrssicherheitsbetrachtung wie z. B. Pedelecs, Elektrofahrzeuge, Boards.

Besonders geeignet zur Erhöhung der Verkehrssicherheit sind Maßnahmen im nicht-motorisierten Verkehr (siehe Kapitel 6.7 und 6.8) sowie zur Verkehrsberuhigung (siehe Kapitel 6.4.5).

## 6.9.5 Mobilitätsmanagement

Mit sogenannten „weichen“ Maßnahmen kann das Verkehrsverhalten im Sinne einer ressourcenschonenden und emissionsarmen Mobilität beeinflusst werden. Dabei sind es vor allem Angebote und weniger Restriktionen, die hier greifen. Im Vergleich zu Kosten für zusätzlichen Infrastrukturausbau sind alle für das Mobilitätsmanagement erforderlichen finanziellen Anreize oder Aufwendungen sehr gering und damit äußerst kosteneffizient.

Um Entscheidungen zum eigenen Mobilitätsverhalten oder die im Einzelfall sinnvolle Verkehrsmittelwahl treffen zu können, werden stets qualifizierte Informationen über bestehende bzw. zu erwartende Verkehrslagen/-situationen benötigt. Besonders im ÖPNV ist die Kenntnis von Linien, Abfahrtszeiten und Fahrzeiten von hoher Bedeutung. Dies wird heute durch Hotlines, Internet, Multimedia-Terminals, mobile Applikationen, Handyticketing sowie durch Flyer oder Infohefte geleistet. Diese Ansätze sind auch intermodal zu verstärken und dem technischen Fortschritt anzupassen (z. B. Weiterentwicklung von Applikationen, Echtzeitinformationen für Umstiege, Fahrzeugreihenfolge an Doppelhaltestellen, Routenvorschläge bei Behinderungen im Straßennetz, Information über alternative Verkehrsmittelnutzung und Verkehrsmittelkombinationen auf dem Weg von A nach B u. a.).

Im Zuge des Mobilitätsmanagements sind weiterhin folgende Maßnahmen wichtig bzw. weiter zu verfolgen:

Ausweitung des betrieblichen Mobilitätsmanagements zur Förderung neuer Mobilitätsangebote als Alternativen zum Kfz-Verkehr, zur Herstellung der Transparenz über die Mobilitätskosten im Berufsverkehr für Unternehmen sowie zur dauerhaften Information und Beratung durch Mobilitätsmanagerinnen und -manager oder ein „Mobilitätsteam“.
Weitere Etablierung von standort- bzw. gebietsbezogenem Mobilitätsmanagement als Ergänzung zum betrieblichen Mobilitätsmanagement.
Ausweitung der Aktivitäten des städtischen „Mobilitätsteams“ auf das gesamte verwaltungsinterne Mobilitätsmanagement sowie als dauerhafter Ansprechpartner für große Verkehrserzeuger in der Stadt zur Sicherung der Kontinuität der Projekte und Maßnahmen sowie deren Wirksamkeitskontrolle (Monitoring).
Nutzung von Erkenntnissen aus Sonderaktionen auf kommunaler und Landesebene (z. B. Kopf an – Motor aus, Brems dich – Rette Leben, Aufgepasst! usw.).
Ausweitung von Jobtickets im ÖPNV um mindestens 8.000 zusätzliche Nutzerinnen und Nutzer (Maßnahme M39 des LRP, geplant ab 2011), insbesondere Beschäftigte von Landesbehörden und der Hochschulen aber auch im Rahmen des standort-bezogenen Mobilitätsmanagements.

Fortführung des Semestertickets für Studierende, da die Mitgliedschaft in den studentischen Vertretungen nicht mehr verpflichtend ist.
Ausweitung von Initiativen zur Förderung des Radfahrens im Berufsverkehr, auch unter Nutzung der Potenziale von Pedelecs sowie durch Schließfächer für Gepäck und Fahrradhelme an geeigneten zentralen Stellen.
Information und Schaffung neuer Angebote und Anreize zur multimodalen Verkehrsmittelnutzung (z. B. Carsharing, Radverleihsysteme, Park+Ride, Bike+Ride, Park+Bike).
Entwicklung und Umsetzung von innovativen Lösungen für zielgruppenspezifische ÖPNV-Tickets wie z. B. Jobticket als Parkberechtigung, verstärkte Nutzung von Kombitickets oder Kombitickets für Parkhaus- und ÖPNV-Nutzung in der Innenstadt.
Hinwirken auf die Veranstaltungsagenturen bei Großereignissen, eine möglichst stadtverträgliche und emissionsarme Mobilität der Teilnehmenden zu erreichen (u. a. unter Einbeziehung des Radverkehrs und sicherer Abstellanlagen für Fahrräder, Park+Ride, Management des ruhenden Verkehrs, Wegweisungen sowie ÖPNV-Kombitickets oder Bonussysteme für die Anreise per Fahrrad oder ÖPNV). Diese Aspekte sollten bereits bei dem zzt. in Bearbeitung bzw. Umsetzung befindlichen Mobilitätskonzept Ostragehege berücksichtigt werden.
Erarbeitung von integrierten Mobilitätskonzepten für Veranstaltungsorte und deren Umsetzung gemeinsam mit den jeweiligen Veranstaltungsagenturen.

## 6.9.6 Strategischer Umgang mit den Dresdner Elbbrücken

Obwohl in Dresden die Zahl der Elbbrücken im Verkehrsnetz im Vergleich zu den ca. 400 Brücken insgesamt eher gering ist, sind sie wegen ihrer baulichen Dimension, der verkehrlichen Bedeutung und ihres landschaftlichen Bezugs zum Elbthal von hohem Interesse in der Öffentlichkeit. Aus diesem Grund werden hier die im VEP enthaltenen Maßnahmen bzgl. der Elbbrücken für den allgemeinen Verkehr (mit Ausnahme der Eisenbahnbrücken) zusammengefasst dargestellt und Planungsansätze sowie deren Zusammenhänge beschrieben.

## Herausforderungen des Bestandserhalts bis 2025

Des Handlungskonzept des VEP Dresden 2025plus verweist für den Horizont bis 2025 auf die Herausforderungen des Bestandserhalts. Nachdem die Waldschlößchenbrücke im Jahr 2013 als wichtiger Bestandteil eines großen Verkehrszuges verkehrswirksam ist, müssen sich künftige Investitionen bei Elbbrücken zunächst auf den Bestandserhalt konzentrieren. Dazu gehören:

Die Sanierung der Albertbrücke ab 2015 mit einem vierstreifigen Querschnitt für den Kfz-Verkehr, Gleisen für die Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn sowie Anlagen des Fußgänger- und Radverkehrs.

Seite 166
Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus
Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025
WV
WBS

Die Sanierung der **Augustusbrücke** als wichtigste Brücke für die Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahn in Dresden mit 3 Linien und ihrer besonderen Bedeutung für den Tourismus sowie den Fußgänger- und Radverkehr. Für die Augustusbrücke sieht der VEP zudem die Verlagerung des vergleichsweise geringen individuellen Kfz-Verkehrs von der Brücke vor, um im Bereich der historischen Innenstadt (insbesondere Sophienstraße) aber auch auf der Brücke selbst durch mehr Verkehrsberuhigung die Erlebbarkeit und Attraktivität insbesondere für Besucherinnen und Besucher zu erhöhen. Außerdem soll im Zuge der Sanierung zur besseren Verträglichkeit die getrennte Führung von Fußgänger- und Radverkehr attraktiver gestaltet werden.
Die Sanierung der Seitenbereiche der **Carolabrücke**.
Die Erarbeitung eines Konzepts zum Umgang mit dem **Blauen Wunder** nach 2025. Bis dahin gilt dessen Standfestigkeit unter den heutigen Beschränkungen (Tempo 30, max. 12 t zulässiges Gesamtgewicht) als gesichert.

Aus der Verkehrswirksamkeit der **Waldschlößchenbrücke** ergeben sich zudem Veränderungen im Verkehrsnetz, welche wiederum Maßnahmen auf der Fetscherstraße/ Fetscherplatz sowie der Blasewitzer Straße nach sich ziehen. Zu den verkehrlichen Wirkungen ist zudem eine Nachher-Untersuchung geplant, aus deren Ergebnis sich wiederum Notwendigkeiten für weitere Veränderungen im Straßennetz ergeben können. Damit die im Zuge der Waldschlößchenbrücke neuen Busnetzangebote eine ausreichende Wirksamkeit entfalten können, sind weitere Maßnahmen wie die Sanierung der Augsburger Straße und der Tittmannstraße. Weitere Maßnahmen betreffen Anpassungen der zuführenden Wege für den Fußgänger- und Radverkehr.

## Strategischer Umgang mit dem Blauen Wunder

Das Blaue Wunder hat eine herausgehobene städtebauliche und verkehrliche Bedeutung für Dresden. Verkehrliche Betrachtungen u. a. im Zuge der Erarbeitung des VEP haben hier gezeigt, dass eine Brücke am vorhandenen Standort langfristig erforderlich und sinnvoll ist. Durch die Verkehrswirksamkeit der Waldschlößchenbrücke wird sich dabei die Verkehrsbelastung in den Bereichen Körnerplatz/ Blaues Wunder/ Schillerplatz insgesamt um ca. 2,2 % verringern¹⁷. Zudem ist der bestehende Standort der einzig logischen im Verkehrsnetz im Bereich Striesen/ Loschwitz/ Blasewitz.

Vor dem Hintergrund der langfristig absehbaren Ermüdungserscheinungen der Brücke bei gleichbleibender verkehrlicher Notwendigkeit für Kfz-Verkehr, ÖPNV, Rad- und Fußgängerverkehr sind deshalb bautechnologische, städtebauliche, denkmalschutzrechtliche und naturschutzfachliche Untersuchungen und Abstimmungen anzustoßen, wie eine Sanierung bzw. Anpassung des Blauen Wunders im Bestand möglich ist. Für Interimsquerungen während einer möglichen Sanierung

¹⁷ Die Verkehrsmengen am Körnerplatz sinken dabei um ca. 4,7 % und auf dem Blauen Wunder um 11 % während sie am Schillerplatz durch steigende elbparallele Verkehre um ca. 0,3 % ansteigen. Auf dem Blauen Wunder ist dann mit ca. 30.000 Kfz/ Tag zu rechnen.

Seite 167
Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus
Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025
WV
WBS

nach 2025 müssen alle Optionen von Standorten für Intermis-Fuß- und -Radbrücken und ggf. für eine Intermis-Brücke für alle Verkehrsarten im Umfeld des Blauen Wunders geprüft werden wie eine Sanierung unter Verkehr, Umleitungsoptionen des Kfz-Verkehrs sowie ein leistungsfähiger Fährbetrieb.

Querungsalternativen im Umfeld des Blauen Wunders können nach den vorliegenden baulich-/verkehrlichen Untersuchungen (Stand 2013) auf Grund der topografischen Gegebenheiten der Grundstraße sowohl den Körnerplatz als auch den Schillerplatz (elbparalleler Kfz-Verkehr und Straßenbahn) nur teilweise von Verkehr entlasten, sodass deren Charakter als verkehrlich dominierte Stadtplätze erhalten bleibt. Zudem ist davon auszugehen, dass selbst bei einer Sperrung des Blauen Wunders für Kfz-Verkehr weiterhin Lieferfahrzeuge, ÖPNV (derzeit ca. 540 Linienbusfahrten am Tag) sowie Rettungsdienste und auch Anlieger dieses nutzen müssen und dafür 2 Fahrspuren erforderlich sind. Eine Nutzung als reine Fußgänger- und Radverkehrsbrücke ist somit nicht sinnvoll bzw. möglich.

Auf die gezielte Sicherung eines ergänzenden Brückenstandortes in Niederpoyritz kann verzichtet werden, da dort und in Laubegast die Verkehrsmengen bei Einordnung einer Straßenbrücke unverträglich anwachsen würden sowie Verkehrssicherheit und verkehrliche Leistungsfähigkeit der zuführenden Straßen durch die beengten Querschnitte in Niederpoyritz nicht gegeben sind. Ein solcher Standort ist zudem kein Ersatz für das Blaue Wunder. Zudem entsteht ein verkehrlicher Verlagerungseffekt von der S 177 (Elbbrücke Pirna) auf eine solche Querung und Verkehrsrelationen von und zur B6 als lokaler Durchgangsverkehr. Die grundsätzliche Flächenfreihaltung ist aus Gründen des Hochwasserschutzes sowie des Landschaftsschutzes ohnehin gegeben.

# Empfehlung zur Prüfung von Elbbrücken

Bis zum Jahr 2025 und teilweise darüber hinaus (Blaues Wunder) müssen die Anstrengungen zur Sanierung und Sicherung der bestehenden Brücken höchste Priorität haben. Somit sind Überlegungen zu neuen Elbquerungen mittels komplexer und dauerhaft kostenaufwändiger Ingenieurbauwerke eher dem strategischen Zeithorizont nach 2025 zuzuordnen. Deren planerische Vorbereitung und Diskussion muss dabei auf klaren Zielen hinsichtlich Verkehr und Stadtqualität sowie der modalen und damit verkehrsträgerspezifischen Wirkung aufbauen. Eine losgelöste Betrachtung einzelner Brückenoptionen ist auf Grund der vielfältigen Wechselwirkungen nicht zielführend.

Als Planungsziele bei der Bewertung potenzieller Standorte sollten deshalb gelten:

ein hohes Maß integrierter verkehrlicher Sinnfälligkeit im Zusammenhang mit
Netzelementen bzw. Anbindungen im MIV, ÖPNV, Rad- oder Fußgängerverkehr sowie
dem Verkehrszweck (Anbindung oder Verbindung, Freizeit- und Veranstaltungsverkehre/ allgemeiner Verkehr usw.)
konkrete und stadträumlich sinnvolle Entlastungswirkungen im Straßennetz ohne Neubelastung sensibler Bereiche oder induktiver Wirkungen im Kfz-Verkehr
Berücksichtigung besonderer baulicher Anforderungen (insbes. Hochwasserschutz, Umweltschutz, Blickbeziehungen usw.)
Tragfähigkeit der kommunalen Folgekosten (Unterhalt, Betrieb, Verkehrstechnik usw.)

Auf Grund dieser komplexen Fragestellungen wurde im Kapitel 5.7 der Vorschlag einer integrierten verkehrlichen Prüfung für alle relevanten westlichen Brückenstandorte zwischen Kötzschenbroder Straße und Uferstraße in die Mobilitätsstrategie eingebracht. Dazu würden dann auch

eine mögliche reine Fußgänger- und Radverkehrsbrücke (z. B. am Pieschener Winkel)
die im VEP langfristig empfohlene Umweltbrücke Ostragehege zwischen Kötzschenbroder Straße und der Pieschener Allee (siehe auch Anlage 9, Bereich Dreyßigplatz)
der Verkehrszug Erfurter Straße mit Elbbrücke sowie
der Verkehrszug Hansastraße – Weißeritzstraße mit 3. Marienbrücke

gehören. Die Ergebnisse sollen dann in eine Evaluierung des VEP einfließen. Es ist nicht davon auszugehen, dass bis 2025 eine solche Brückenverbindung realisiert werden kann.

## Weitere Hinweise zur Flächenfreihaltung für Elbbrücken

Auf Grund der verkehrlichen Überlastungen am Dreyßigplatz und dem hohen Entwicklungsdruck im Bereich Pieschen/ Leipziger Straße enthält der VEP bereits Empfehlungen zu verkehrlichen Verbesserungen im westlichen Stadtbereiche auch bezüglich der Elbquerungen. Neben der benannten Umweltbrücke Ostragehege für ÖPNV, Fußgänger- und Radverkehr¹⁸ im Zusammenspiel mit dem linkselbischen Neubau der S 84 und der B 6 wurde für das Handlungskonzept als erster Schritt die Wiedereinrichtung einer Fährverbindung am Pieschener Winkel empfohlen. Diese verbessert auch deutlich die Anbindung des Ostrageheges und ist kostenseitig deutlich

¹⁸ Kfz-Verkehr soll diese Brückenverbindung nicht nutzen, da eine Straßenverbindung an dieser Stelle nicht in das Straßennetz einbindbar ist (insbesondere rechtselbisch im Bereich Kötschenbroder Straße) und eine Anbindung an den 26er Ring im Bereich Magdeburger Straße kapazitätsmäßig sehr problematisch ist.

günstiger als eine Brückenverbindung. Ein weiterer Schritt wäre ggf. eine reine Fußgänger- und Radbrücke an diesem Standort.

Im Zuge der Flächenvorhaltung (siehe Abbildung 22) ist auch eine Brückenverbindung in Verlängerung der Erfurter Straße zwischen Leipziger Straße und Magdeburger Straße sowie die Straßenverbindung Großenhainer Straße – Hansastraße in Höhe Erfurter Straße benannt. Diese soll im Zusammenhang mit den gesamten Entwicklungen im Bereich der Leipziger Straße geprüft werden. In diese Prüfungen kann wiederum auch die Option einer 3. Marienbrücke als Alternative zur Erfurter Straße eingebracht werden.

Mit einer 3. Marienbrücke wären aufwändige Anpassungen der umgebenden Infrastruktur zwischen Hansastraße, Großer Meißner Straße und Weißeritzstraße verbunden, die aber auch zu deutlichen Entlastungen an anderen Stellen im Netz (z. B. Große Meißner Straße, Schlesischer Platz) führen könnten. Da durch eine solche Verbindung potenziell positive verkehrliche Effekte vor allem im Gebiet der Inneren Neustadt möglich sind, sollte sie als planerische Option in entsprechende verkehrliche Betrachtungen mit einbezogen werden. Auf Grund fehlender grundlegender Untersuchungen zur baulichen Machbarkeit (Flächenverfügbarkeit, Anbindungen, Rampen, Verknüpfungen, Hochwasserschutz) kann noch keine Flächenvorhaltung in Abbildung 22 dargestellt werden. Die Klärung dieser Fragen ist dahingehend vordringlich, da sie in Konflikten mit städtebaulichen Zielvorstellungen steht (z. B. Bereich Globus). Die Untersuchungen können im Ergebnis auch dazu führen, eine solche Option abschließend aufzugeben. Diese Ergebnisse sollten dann über den Evaluierungsprozesses in den VEP zurückließen.

Für alle weiteren Brücken sind derzeit keine planerischen Maßnahmen erforderlich. Die Brücke in Niederwartha wird dann an Bedeutung gewinnen, wenn der Neubau der S 84 sowie der B6 im Bereich Cossebaude abgeschlossen ist.

Die Flügelwegbrücke zeigt, dass hier in Verbindung mit dem Ausbau des Knotens der Hamburger Straße sowie dem Ausbau am Emerich-Ambros-Ufer insbesondere für den Kfz-Verkehr ein sehr gutes Angebot entstanden ist bzw. entstehen wird. Es ist hier zu diskutieren, wie der ÖPNV von der augenscheinlich hohen Nachfrage in dieser Relation besser profitieren kann.

## 6.9.7 Innovationsansätze im Verkehrsbereich

Die verkehrlichen Herausforderungen der Zukunft (siehe Kapitel 5.3) erfordern innovative Ideen zur Verkehrsentwicklung. Auch wenn nicht hinter jeder Innovation ein ausgearbeitetes Konzept steht, so sind sie Anregungen, wie Verkehr intelligent, ressourcenschonend und maximal nutzbringend weiter entwickelt werden kann. Gerade in einer wachsenden Stadt, deren wirtschaftliche Entwicklung direkt mit der Attraktivität und Erlebbarkeit seiner Stadträume verbunden ist, sind Maßnahmen erforderlich, die über klassische Formen hinaus gehen und neue Akzente setzen.

WBS

Die Nutzung nationaler und internationaler Netzwerke als Ideengeber und Diskussionsplattform zum Erfahrungsaustausch sind auch Grundvoraussetzung für die erforderliche Anwerbung von Fördermitteln zur ersten Umsetzung innovativer Ideen.

Die meisten der hier dargestellten Maßnahmen sind in den jeweiligen Kapiteln bereits benannt worden, sollen aber hier im methodischen Zusammenhang nochmals aufgeführt werden. Alle hier dargestellten innovativen Maßnahmen sind vor ihrer Umsetzung intensiv und ämterübergreifend zu prüfen und erfordern dabei einen kooperativen und lösungsorientierten Umsetzungsprozess. Ort und Umfang der vorgeschlagenen Pilotprojekte können und sollen im Zuge des Prüfprozesses im Sinne optimaler Wirkungen angepasst werden.

# Ansätze zur Verbesserung intermodaler Angebote und zur Emissionsvermeidung

Eine Stärkung der Intermodalität ist eine Schlüsselfunktion für effektive Verkehrsstrukturen. Maßgebliche Ansätze für Dresden sind:

Öffentlichkeitsarbeit und effektive Awareness- (Aufmerksamkeits-) Kampagnen zum persönlichem Mobilitätsstil mit dem Ziel der Förderung intermodaler Mobilität und Priorisierung von Rad, ÖPNV und Carsharing sowie Elektromobilität (z. B. Radexkursionen mit Vertretern von Politik und Verwaltung),
Förderung "Innovativer Mobilität" durch Wohnnutzungen auf innerstädtischen Brachbereichen in integrierten Lagen unter Nutzung von Elektromobilität, Carsharing, Radstation, ÖV, multimodalen Infosystemen und nahräumlichen Strukturentwicklungen,
Verbesserung der Führung des Kfz-Verkehrs zu intermodalen Schnittstellen (P+R) durch Datenbereitstellung für on-board-Navigationssysteme sowie Verbindungs- und Tarifinformationen in Echtzeit,
Erweiterung der Angebote von Verkehrsinformationen für die Öffentlichkeit in Echtzeit (Verkehrsmengen und -zustände, ÖPNV-Abfahrten, Auslastungen im ruhenden Verkehr usw.),
Prüfung der Ausweitung umweltfreundlicher Citylogistik mit der Güterstraßenbahn, Elektrofahrzeugen und Elektro-Fahrrädern bzw. vernetzten Radlieferdiensten („E-Delivery“) - besonders im Bereich Tourismus, Einkauf und Kultur (Theaterlogistik) sowie wenn möglich in der Krankenhaus- und Baustellenlogistik,
Impulssetzung für neue, vernetzte Radlieferdienste mit Elektrorädern in der Innenstadt oder den Stadtteilzentren,
Etablierung einer Mobilitätskarte als integriertes Zugangs- und Abrechnungsmedium für multimodale Nutzungen (ÖPNV, Radverleih, Parktickets usw.) sowie verstärkte Nutzbarkeit von Smartphone-Anwendungen für intermodale Nutzungen (z. B. Parktickets per NFC/ QR-Code)

Seite 171
Verkehrsentwicklungsplan Dresden 2025plus
Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025
LVM VERITAS

Implementierung von Halteplatzfestlegungen durch Markierungen an den Haltekanten und in der dynamischen Fahrgastinformation an Doppelhaltestellen zur besseren Orientierung wartender und zusteigender Fahrgäste,
Stärkung der Elektromobilität bei Bussen des ÖPNV entsprechend dem technischen Fortschritt, insbesondere auf Linien, die überwiegend der inneren Erschließung von Wohngebieten dienen,
Kleinteilige Einrichtung von Ladestationen für Elektro-Kfz und Pedelecs im Straßenraum z. B. aber auch in gekennzeichneten Läden, Gaststätten oder öffentlichen Einrichtungen,
Umstellung des städtischen (Kfz-) Fuhrparks auf emissionsarme Fahrzeuge sowie deutlich verstärkte Nutzung von Carsharing und Pedelecs auch im Sinne einer kommunalen Vorbildfunktion,
Verminderung der Emissionen im Reisebus- und Stadtrundfahrtsverkehr sowie bei Taxen und Lieferfahrzeugen durch Kooperation, Information und ggf. monetärer Anreize,
Prüfung von induktiver Stromversorgung der Stadt-/ Straßenbahn bei Neubeschaffung, um auf Teilstrecken aus stadtgestalterischen Gründen oberleitungsfrei verkehren zu können.

# Finanzielle Ansätze zur Sicherung von Infrastruktur und zur Attraktivierung des ÖPNV

Verkehrliche Infrastruktur muss langfristig gesichert sein, da sonst ein hoher Wertverlust droht. Dabei müssen auch eine größere Unabhängigkeit von externen Zuschüssen und die Finanzierung von Folgekosten berücksichtigt werden:

Verbreiterung der Basis von unabhängigen Finanzierungsquellen für Infrastruktur sowie Informations- und Telematiksysteme in Dresden durch Nutzerentgelte, Gebührenansätze oder Umlagen, die aber gleichzeitig einen Mehrwert z. B. durch Informationsvernetzung, Routenoptimierung und barrierefreie Nutzbarkeit mit einheitlichen Zugangsmedien bieten
Mitwirkung bei Forschungen und bundesweiter Aktivitäten (z. B. Deutscher Städtetag) zur langfristigen Absicherung der ÖPNV-Finanzierung und zu Steuerungseffekten von angebotsabhängigen ÖPNV-Abgaben durch Anlieger und sonstige institutionelle Nutznießer (z. B. Handelseinrichtungen oder Firmen) und deren potenziellen positiven wie negativen Wirkungen in Dresden,
Entwicklung von Angeboten für günstige Wohnstands- oder Einwohnertickets nach dem Solidar- bzw. Umlageprinzip in Zusammenarbeit mit externen Akteuren wie Wohnungsunternehmen, Verkehrsverbund und Stadt.

# Innovationsansätze im Radverkehr

Da der Radverkehr ein stark wachsendes Verkehrssegment ist, sollten auch hier verkehrliche Innovationen eingebracht werden. Momentan bestehen dazu folgende Ansätze:

Integration von Radverkehrsinformationen in das Elbbrückeninformationssystem (EBIS) an geeigneten Standorten bzw. weitere dynamische Verkehrsinformationssysteme im Sinne der Förderung intermodaler Ansätze
Aufstellen von Schließfächern für Gepäck und Fahrradhelme an geeigneten zentralen Standorten in Kombination mit Standorten von Radverleihsystemen,
Prüfung geeigneter Standorte für Park+Bike (Radmitnahme im Kfz bis zum Stadtrand, Weiterfahrt per Rad),
Aufstellen saisonal-temporärer Fahrradbügel auf Pkw-Stellplätzen in zentralen Bereichen mit hoher Nachfrage (z. B. im Zuge von Stadtteilfesten o. ä.),
Anlassbezogenes Aufstellen mobiler Fahrradabstellanlagen als Service der Stadt Dresden bei Veranstaltungen u. ä.,
Vorbereitung eines Pilotprojekts "ElbeRadLift" an einem Brückenkopf (z. B. südlicher Brückenkopf Marienbrücke), der hochwasserfest für eine direkte Verbindung zwischen Elberad- und -wanderweg und Brückenkopf sorgt,
Bau von kleinen Fahrradparkhäusern im öffentlichen Raum bzw. in Baulücken insbesondere in Bereichen studentischen Wohnens,
Prüfung und Einrichtung von Vorbeifahrstreifen für den Radverkehr an geeigneten Knotenpunkten sowie des Einsatzes von Grünpfeilen für Radverkehr an LSA.

# Innovationsansätze bei Barrierefreiheit und Fußgängerverkehr

Fußgängerinnen und Fußgänger erleben Straßenräume am intensivsten und sind aber gleichzeitig von negativen Wirkungen und von Umwegen am direktesten getroffen. Die folgenden innovativen Ansätze sollten deshalb für Dresden geprüft und dann ggf. im Sinne einer Verbesserung im Fußgängerverkehr sowie der Barrierefreiheit umgesetzt werden:

Prüfung bzw. Erprobung von aktivierbaren „Dunkel-Dunkel-LSA“ für den Fußgängerverkehr (außerhalb von Knotenpunkten), an denen nur die Verkehrsteilnehmenden ein Signal anfordern, für die sonst keine sichere Querung möglich ist – in Schwachlastzeiten und bei Lücken im Pulk kann sofort gequert werden, da die LSA erst im Anforderungsfall aktiviert wird und so zum einen „sinnloses“ Warten samt „Rotlaufen“ vermieden wird und zum anderen der Kfz-Verkehr nicht ohne Grund unterbrochen wird – für unsichere Verkehrsteilnehmenden funktioniert dieser LSA-Typ wie eine normale Fußgänger-LSA mit einem modifizierten (blin-

kenden) Anforderungstaster sowie der Beschilderung „bei Bedarf Grün anfordern“ (Beispiele in Karlsruhe) – der ÖPNV kann dabei in die Steuerung eingreifen,

Prüfung bzw. Erprobung der Ausstattung von verkehrlich geeigneten LSA mit Alles-Grün-Regelungen.

## 6.9.8 Regionale und interkommunale Maßnahmen

Die Kooperation mit Dresdens Nachbarkommunen ist im Prozess der Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung verankert. Eine Vielzahl der in Strategie und Handlungskonzept dargestellter Maßnahmen bezieht sich auf kooperative Prozesse zu verkehrlichen Verknüpfungen mit dem Umland. Im Folgenden sind aus dem Maßnahmenpool des VEP Dresden nochmals die Maßnahmen herausgestellt, die eine besondere regionale Bedeutung haben:

## Straßennetz und Kfz-Verkehr

Fertigstellung der S 177n Pirna - Radeberg - BAB A 4 durch den Freistaat Sachsen bis 2025,
Neubau der S 191n von Goppeln bis zur B 170 durch den Freistaat Sachsen bis 2014,
Fertigstellung der S 84n Cossebaude - Meißen als elbnahe Variante in Coswig durch den Freistaat Sachsen bis 2025,
Neubau der AS Weixdorf an die A 4 und Anbindung zum Gewerbegebiet Promigberg,

Beschlussfassung Stadtrat vom 20.11.2014, Teil D: Handlungskonzept 2025
LVM VERITAS

Ausbau der Nordanbindung auf der regionalen Bahnstrecke Richtung Bischofswerda durch eine Systematisierung weitgehend bestehender Angebote (S-Bahn, RB/ RE) zu einem regelmäßigen 30-Minuten-Takt (teilweise 3. Gleis erforderlich),
Verbesserung der regionalen Bus-Anbindungen von Moritzburg und Bannewitz durch Verkürzung der Reisezeit und Taktverdichtung zur Spitzenzeit im Rahmen der Nahverkehrsplanung,
Neues Busangebot zwischen Cossebaude und Radebeul über die Elbbrücke Niederwartha im 60 Min.-Takt in Absprache mit dem Landkreis Meißen,
Prüfung von direkten, über die Autobahn geführten Regionalbusverbindungen zu autobahnnahen Gemeinden ohne attraktive ÖPNV-Anbindung nach Dresden (z. B. Nossen, Radeburg u. a.) im Zuge der Fortschreibung des Nahverkehrsplans,
Flächenvorhaltung für eine mögliche Straßenbahn/ Stadtbahntrasse von Kaditz nach Radebeul-Ost entlang der Kötzschenbroder Straße (Riegelplatz bis Spitzhausstraße),
Flächenvorhaltung für eine mögliche Stadtbahntrasse von Gompitz nach Kesselsdorf.

## Radverkehr

Ausbau der regionalen Anbindungen im Radverkehr entlang des Elbtals (Radebeul, Heidenau/ Pirna und auch Gemeinde Klipphausen mit den OT Wildberg, Constappel und Gauernitz) sowie nach Norden (Radeberg) und Süden (Bannewitz, Freital, Kesselsdorf/ Wilsdruff) durch Kooperation mit den Nachbarkommunen bei der Erarbeitung und Umsetzung von Radnetzkonzeptionen.
Trassensicherung von Teilen der ehemaligen Übigauer Güterbahn für eine Radverbindung Junge Heide - Forststraße (Radebeul) - Kaditzer Flutrinne - Elbe als Ergänzung des rechtselbischen Elberad- und -wanderweges in Kooperation mit der Stadt Radebeul.

## Konzeptionelle Ansätze

Zusammenarbeit mit den Nachbarkreisen und Kommunen bei Rendezvous-Parkplätzen (Pendlerparkplätze) an Autobahnanschlussstellen (P+M) und Integration entsprechender Maßnahmen und Erkenntnisse in das integrierte Besucherverkehrs- und Pendlerkonzept.
Erarbeitung eines regionalen und integrierten Konzeptes zum schrittweisen aber konsequenten Umstieg in das Zeitalter postfossiler Mobilität mit dem Ziel der langfristigen Mobilitätssicherung in Dresden und Umgebung u. a. unter Berücksichtigung optimierter Prozess- und Wegestrukturen sowie räumlich anders ausgeprägter Verflechtungen.

Die darstellbaren Maßnahmen wurden als grafische Zusammenfassung in **Abbildung 24** übernommen.

# 6.10 Pilotprojekte

Mit Hilfe von Pilotprojekten können neue Techniken erprobt, Anstöße zur Optimierung von Abläufen erarbeitet oder beispielhafte Planungen von der Öffentlichkeit wahrgenommen und bewertet werden. Zudem besteht die Möglichkeit, weitere Fördergelder für Pilotprojekte aus verschiedenen Quellen zu akquirieren. Unter strategischen Gesichtspunkten kommt den Pilotprojekten besondere Bedeutung zu. Sie leiten sich aus ausgewählten Ansätzen zur Innovation (siehe Kapitel 6.9.7) ab und werden teilweise dort bereits erwähnt. Im Rahmen der Beschreibung als Pilotprojekt sollen relativ zeitnah umsetzbare Ansätze räumlich und inhaltlich konkretisiert werden.

Folgende Pilotprojekte aus dem Maßnahmenpool des VEP Dresden sollten geprüft und weiter ausgearbeitet werden:

Initiierung eines kommunalen Pilotprojektes "Innovative Mobilität" zur autoarmen Mobilität und Nutzung von Elektro-Mobilität, Carsharing, Radstation, ÖV, multimodalen Infosystemen und nahräumlichen Strukturentwicklungen im Bereich Weißeritzstraße/ Schweriner Straße/ Bahnhof Mitte,
Innovationen im Fußgängerverkehr durch Prüfung und Umbau von 5 ausgewählten Fußgänger-LSA außerhalb von Knotenpunkten als „Dunkel-Dunkel-LSA“ mit Anforderung und Aktivierung durch Fußgängerinnen und Fußgänger sowie Prüfung und Einrichtung von Alles-Grün-Regelungen für Fußgängerinnen und Fußgänger an ausgewählten Knotenpunkt-LSA unter wissenschaftlicher Begleitung,
Systematische Neueinrichtung von Fußgängerüberwegen an geeigneten Stellen im Stadtgebiet auf Basis einer entsprechenden Netzanalyse und unter Prüfung der Veränderungen bei Querungs- und Konfliktverhalten,
Prüfung der Einrichtung von „Begegnungszonen“ auf 5 ausgewählten Dresdner Straßen- oder Platzbereichen (u. a. Bischofsplatz), auch unter besonderer Berücksichtigung von Straßenbahnverkehr,
Prüfung und Einrichtung von Schutzstreifen für den Radverkehr an 5 ausgewählten Hauptverkehrsstraßen (jeweils begleitet von Sicherheitsaudit und Monitoring), und zwar dort, wo:

die Verkehrsmengen dies nach den einschlägigen Empfehlungen und Richtlinien zulassen,
andere Radverkehrsanlagen räumlich oder aufwandsseitig nicht geeignet sind,
ruhender Verkehr sowie Liefern und Laden nur untergeordnete Bedeutung haben bzw. die Straßenbreiten derartige Nutzungen zusätzlich ermöglichen und
reiner Mischverkehr ohne Markierungen aufgrund der Verkehrsmengen keine Alternative ist.

Zu prüfende Bereiche sind z. B. Magdeburger/ Bremer Straße, Winterbergstraße, Terrassen- ufer, Parkstraße/ Bürgerweise, Schäferstraße, Blasewitzer Straße, Wigardstraße, Grundstraße, Antonstraße oder Schillerplatz/ Körnerplatz.

Start einer Kampagne für mehr Carsharing-Stellplätze unter Nutzung privater (Brach-)Flächen mit Unterstützung von Unternehmen und Kommunen hinsichtlich Erreichbarkeiten und Beschilderung,
Initiierung von Kampagnen zur Förderung der Multimodalität und des Umweltverbundes als Modellvorhaben der Stadt Dresden mit ÖPNV-Unternehmen, Verkehrsverbund, TU etc.,
Modellversuche mit verstärktem IT-Einsatz, wie z. B. Smart-City (Umsetzungsprüfung mit der Wirtschaftsförderung), Mobilitäts- und Verkehrsmanagement, intermodale Navigations- und Auskunftssysteme, individualisierte Stadtführungen mit Elektro-Fahrzeugen, Awareness- und Weiterbildungskampagnen.

Im Rahmen einer Bekanntmachung in der Öffentlichkeit (Awareness-Kampagnen) sind prägnante Namen für die Pilotprojekte hilfreich (z. B. „Mobil mit Pfiff“ oder „fischelant mobil“).

Stadtrat (SR/025/2011)

Sitzung am: 24.03.2011 Beschluss zu: V0811/10

## Gegenstand:

Ziele für die künftige Verkehrsentwicklung der Landeshauptstadt Dresden für den Zeithorizont 2025 und darüber hinaus

## Beschluss:

Der Stadtrat der Landeshauptstadt Dresden beschließt die am Runden Tisch „Verkehrsentwicklungsplan 2025plus“ erarbeiteten Ziele, einschließlich Änderungen gemäß Anlage, und bestätigt diese als Grundlage und Bestandteil des Verkehrsentwicklungsplanes 2025plus.

Helma Orosz Vorsitzende

## Präambel

Verkehr ist kein Selbstzweck! Er dient der Mobilität der Bürger und der Sicherung der urbanen Wirtschaft. Beides setzt die freie Wahl der Verkehrsmittel voraus.
Die Erhaltung der Mobilität – bezahlbar, sicher und umweltschonend – ist eine gesamtgesellschaftliche Aufgabe ersten Ranges. Sie sollte im Konsens und unter weitestgehendem Verzicht auf dirigistische Maßnahmen umgesetzt werden.
Das Recht auf körperliche Unversehrtheit sowie die Gleichstellung aller Menschen ist Verfassungsgrundsatz. Auch die Verpflichtung, auf die Gleichwertigkeit der Lebensverhältnisse hinzuwirken, ist in der Verfassung des Freistaates Sachsen verankert. Beides sind essentielle Leitlinien für die heutige und künftige Verkehrsentwicklung.
Die Entwicklung von Mobilität und Verkehr ist mehr denn je globalen Einflüssen (Konjunkturschwankungen, begrenzte fossilen Energieressourcen und steigenden Energiepreisen sowie Klimaveränderungen) unterworfen. Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung muss darauf Antworten finden.
Gleiches gilt für die Auswirkungen des demografischen Wandels, woraus veränderte Lebens-, Verkehrs- und Mobilitätsbedürfnisse erwachsen.
Die Verkehrsinfrastruktur muss unter besonderer Beachtung des Kosten-Nutzen-Verhältnisses erhalten und entwickelt werden.
Nationale und europäische Gesetze und Verordnungen geben essentielle Rahmenbedingungen für die Verkehrsentwicklungsplanung vor. Die Stadt Dresden wird diese aktiv mitgestalten.

# 26er Ring/ Könneritzstraße/ Weißeritzstraße

## Ziele:

Entlastung des 26er Rings zwischen Marienbrücke und Schäferstraße von Kfz-Verkehr zur Verminderung von Trennwirkungen und zur Verbesserung der Verkehrsqualität.
Verbesserung der Anbindungen der Gewerbegebiete Rosenstraße/ Fabrikstraße.

## Ansatz:

Neubau einer direkten, zweistreifigen Durchbindung der Fröbelstraße bis zur Freiberger Straße und Rosenstraße unter Berücksichtigung des Grünzugs Weißeritz,
Diese Verbindung stellt zudem eine direkte Anbindung an die Coventrystraße dar,
Verknüpfung der Freiberger Straße mit der Ammonstraße in allen Fahrbeziehungen,
Potenziell können ggf. im Bereich Weißeritzstraße/ Könneritzstraße gemäß Stadtentwicklungskonzept städtebauliche Aufwertungsmaßnahmen greifen (insbesondere an den Knotenpunkten Schäferstraße/ Weißeritzstraße und Schweriner Straße/ Könneritzstraße),
Es besteht vertiefender Untersuchungsbedarf zur detaillierten verkehrlichen Wirkung, die auch die Variante einer Durchbindung bis zur Bayrischen Straße (mit Anbindung Zwickauer Straße) aus der Flächenvorhaltung und ggf. die 3 Marienbrücke berücksichtigen sollte und dann auf den ggf. notwendigen Ausbau der Zwickauer Straße/ Hahnebergstraße eingeht,
Zudem sind die Umfeldentwicklungen wie das Kulturkraftwerk Mitte und seine nahräumliche Anbindung zu berücksichtigen,

# Dreyßigplatz/ Leipziger Straße

## Ziele:

Entlastung der Lommatzscher Straße und Leipziger Straße im Bereich Dreyßigplatz und Pieschener Winkel vom Kfz-Verkehr, da dort starke verkehrlich-städtebauliche Konflikte auftreten und die Kapazitäten erschöpft sind aber gerade entlang der Leipziger Straße und in Pieschen weitere Entwicklungen wie z. B. die „HafenCity“ oder „Globus“ erwartet werden,
Für diesen Bereich sind intermodale, modellbasierte Untersuchungen durchgeführt worden.

## Ansatz:

Da im Umfeld aus räumlichen Gründen und im Sinne der Leitziele eine Kapazitätserweiterung des Straßennetzes nicht möglich ist, muss ein intermodaler Ansatz entwickelt werden,
Durch integrierte Verkehrsmodellierungen wurde deutlich, dass der Ausbau der linkselbischen Verbindungen der B 6n und der S 84n in Verbindung mit dem Ausbau von Hamburger Straße und der Durchbindung des Emerich-Ambros-Ufers zu Entlastungswirkungen auch auf der Leipziger Straße in der Größenordnung von 1.500 – 2.000 Kfz/ 24 h führen kann,
Durch den Bau einer Umweltbrücke für ÖPNV, Fuß- und Radverkehr im Bereich Pieschener Winkel/ Ballhaus Watzke, einer neuen Stadtbahnverbindung Kaditz – Ostragehege – Stadtzentrum und dem Ausbau direkter Radanbindungen aus Kaditz und Radebeul in Richtung Zentrum könnten bis zu 3.000 Kfz/ 24 h von der Leipziger Straße verlagert werden,
Der bauliche Aufwand insbesondere für Elbquerungen ist aber sehr hoch, sodass diese Maßnahmen nicht im Horizont 2025 umgesetzt werden kann und damit nicht ins Handlungskonzept eingeht – sie wird deshalb als Flächenvorhaltung ÖPNV berücksichtigt (Abbildung 23),
durch Elberadweg und eine gute ÖPNV-Verbindung bestehen aber schon heute Alternativen
Für die Verbesserung der Fußgänger- und Radverkehrsverbindung wird zusätzlich die Prüfung bzw. Einrichtung einer Elbfähre zum Ostragehege (als Vorstufe einer potenziellen Brückenverbindung) als ÖPNV-Maßnahme des VEP benannt.

# Neustädter Markt/ Augustusbrücke

## Ziele:

Verbesserung der Verbindung und Erlebbarkeit der Altstadt und der Inneren Neustadt und Erhöhung der touristischen und städtebaulichen Attraktivität der Dresdner Altstadt,
Verbesserung der wirtschaftlichen Basis für die Innere Neustadt (derzeit sinkende Fußgängerzahlen auf der Augustusbrücke).

## Ansatz

Bau einer ebenerdigen Fußgängerquerung im Bereich Neustädter Markt mit Rückbau der Fußgänger-Unterführung (derzeit planerisch in Bearbeitung),
Erhalt der Großen Meißner Straße – Köpckestraße als ebenerdige Straßenverbindung (eine Tieferlegung der Großen Meißner Straße wurde im Zuge der Abstimmung zum Facharbeitspapier „Frühzeitige Diskussion zu zentralen Maßnahmenansätzen des VEP“ vom 20.10.2011 sowie aus Hochwasser- und Kostengründen (Schätzung STA 30 Mio. €) verworfen,
Einschränkung für Kfz-Verkehr auf der Augustusbrücke, da nach Öffnung der Waldschlößchenbrücke nur ca. 4.500 Kfz/ 24 h (derzeit ca. 8.800 Kfz/ 24 h) zu verlagern sind – der verlagerte Verkehr verteilt sich auf fast alle Dresdner Brücken (Quelle: Verkehrsmodell),
Erhalt der Befahrbarkeit durch Stadtbahn (3 Linien) und Radverkehr sowie evtl. nach entsprechender Prüfung auch Stadtrundfahrt, Kutschen oder Taxen in angepasster Geschwindigkeit,
Führung des Radverkehrs auf der Augustusbrücke getrennt vom Fußgängerverkehr auf ebenem Belag, um Konflikte mit Fußgängerinnen und Fußgängern zu vermeiden,
Weitgehender Erhalt der Bordführung und der Aufteilung, da weiterhin 3 Stadtbahnlinien sowie Stadtrundfahrtsbusse, Kutschen und Radverkehr die Brücke queren,
Verbesserung der Haltestellensituation Neustädter Markt (Umstieg zwischen den Linien 8 – Linie 4/9 ermöglichen, besserer Zugang zur Hauptstraße von der Halstestelle Linie 8 aus),
In weiteren Schritten ist eine Zweistreifigkeit des Straßenzuges Hainstraße – Große Meißner Straße – Carolapplatz verkehrsplanerisch zu untersuchen,
Die derzeit laufenden Planungen sollten mit diesen Ansätzen gegengeprüft werden.

# Sophienstraße/ Theaterplatz/ Altmarkt

## Ziele:
Verbesserung der Erlebbarkeit, der Verkehrssicherheit und der Aufenthaltsqualität in der Altstadt.

## Ansatz:

# Terrassenufer zwischen Steinstraße und Landtag

## Ziele:

Implementierung wiederkehrender Ereignisse im Verkehrssystemmanagement und der Verkehrssteuerung (Veranstaltungen, Hochwasser) und Anpassung der Straßenraumorganisation an die touristischen Anforderungen.

## Ansatz:

Ausstattung des Straßennetzes im Einflussbereich von Sperrungen des Terrassenufers mit temporären Wegweisungen und gesonderten LSA-Steuerprogrammen, die die veränderten Verkehrsverteilungen in den Bereichen Magdeburger Straße/ Weißeritzstraße und an der Albertbrücke berücksichtigen sowie die Verkehrsführung Wilsdruffer Straße einbeziehen,
Ausweisung und verkehrsorganisatorische Gestaltung alternativer Routen im Radverkehr zur sicheren und auch touristisch geeigneten Umfahrung des Elberadwegs bei Hochwasser und Veranstaltungen z. B.
rechtselbisch über die Leipziger Straße - Große Meißner Straße - Köpckestraße - Wigardstraße - Carusufer - Bautzner Straße und
linkselbisch über die Wilsdruffer Straße - Postplatz - Ostraallee - Magdeburger Straße - Bremer Straße - Hamburger Straße.
Verstärkung der intermodalen Angebote im Hochwasserfall,
streckenhafte Tempo-30-Regelung zwischen Theaterplatz und Steinstraße entsprechend Radverkehrskonzept Innenstadt sowie Anordnung der dort beschlossenen beidseitigen Schutzstreifen,
Berücksichtigung touristischer Belange bei Querungen im Bereich des Terrassenufers mit Umgestaltung des Knotenpunktes zum Theaterplatz.

Teilweise sind die beschriebenen Ansätze in Grafik 4 dargestellt.

# Schillerplatz/ Körnerplatz/ Blaues Wunder

## Ziele:

Verbesserungen in der Stadtraumqualität an Schillerplatz und Körnerplatz durch Verkehrsverlagerung und Verbesserung der Radverkehrsführung im Knoten- und Brückenbereich ohne gravierende Nachteile im Kfz-Verkehr,
für diesen Bereich werden derzeit vertiefte verkehrsplanerische, modellbasierte Untersuchungen sowie mikroskopische Verkehrssimulationen erstellt.

## Ansatz:

Umgestaltung des Blauen Wunders im Bestand, da dessen Stabilität bei weiterer Lkw-Sperrung &gt;12t gesichert bis 2025 gegeben ist und derzeit keine Ersatzmaßnahmen geplant sind bzw. eine Querungsalternative im Umfeld problematisch ist,
Nutzung der Verkehrsverlagerungen und -verringerungen durch die Verkehrswirksamkeit der Waldschlößchenbrücke und durch modale Effekte aufgrund neue Angebote im Radverkehr und im ÖPNV (Verlängerung Stadtbahn nach Weißig),
Sicherung der Kfz-Verkehrsqualität und der ÖPNV-Abwicklung im bestehenden Querschnitt ohne Gehwegeinengung,
Beibehaltung einer zweistreifigen Befahrbarkeit für Kfz bzw. ÖPNV zwischen Grundstraße und Schillerplatz,
Prüfung der Markierung überbreiter Fahrspuren in stadtwärtiger Richtung bei gleichzeitiger Einordnung von Schutzstreifen und/ oder Radstreifen zwischen Schillerplatz und Körnerplatz sowie auf der Naumannstraße,
Verkehrsberuhigung in der Hüblerstraße (ggf. Gestaltung als „Begegnungszone“) und Freigabe für Radverkehr in beiden Richtungen mit signalisierter Ausfahrt zum Schillerplatz/ Blaues Wunder und Verbesserung der Querungssituation für den Fußgängerverkehr.

Die dargestellten Ansätze müssen in weiteren, vertiefenden Planungen bearbeitet und ausgeformt werden. Die Maßgabe des Luftreinhalteplans, 10 % weniger Kfz-Verkehr in den Bereichen Schillerplatz und Körnerplatz abzuwickeln, wird allein durch die Verkehrswirksamkeit der Waldschlößchenbrücke nicht erreicht. Die ebenfalls im Luftreinhalteplan angedachte Pförtnerung der Naumannstraße ist nach der Verkehrswirksamkeit der Waldschlößchenbrücke vorr. nicht mehr erforderlich, da durch eine neue Aufteilung der Linksabbieger und Geradeausfahrer in der Zufahrt Naumannstraße die Rückstaulängen und Verlustzeiten in der Spitzenstunde deutlich sinken.

Zur Langfriststrategie am Blauen Wunder sind im VEP-Dokument weitere Hinweise enthalten.

# Waisenhausstraße/ Dr.-Külz-Ring/ Prager Straße

## Ziele:

Verringerung der Konflikte mit dem Fußgängerverkehr in der Fußgänger-Achse Prager Straße - Altmarkt) durch Verringerung des kfz-Verkehrs auf dem Dr.-Külz-Ring/ Waisenhausstraße,

## Ansatz:

Verkehrsverlagerung des Kfz-Verkehrs Budapester Straße – Dr.-Külz-Ring – Georgplatz – Lennéplatz auf die Relation Ammonstraße – Wiener Straße in beiden Richtungen unter Nutzung der noch bestehenden Kapazitäten des Tunnels Wiener Platz,
Nutzung der bereits bestehenden Rampen und ggf. Ergänzung eines direkten Abbiegers Wiener Straße – Budapester Straße in Richtung Plauen über die nordöstliche Rampe,
Gleichzeitig Verringerung des Querschnitts der Budapester Straße bis zur Marienstraße auf je 1 Richtungsfahrbahn außerhalb der Knotenpunkte,
Erhalt der erforderlichen Leistungsfähigkeit an den Knotenpunkten sowie in den Verflechtungs- und Aufstellbereichen (Marienstraße, Karstadt),
Das Verkehrsmodell des VEP hat gezeigt, dass im Bereich Budapester Straße sowie Waisenhausstraße/ Dr.-Külz-Ring die Verkehrsmengen durch die Maßnahme um ca. 5.000 Kfz/ 24 h sinken können – in Verbindung mit den weiteren Veränderungen im Prognosehorizont 2025 können die Verkehrsmengen in diesem Bereich von heute 21.000 Kfz/ 24 h auf dann nur noch 13.000 Kfz/ 24 h sinken, was zu positiven Effekten führt,
es kommt durch die Maßnahme nicht zu maßgeblichen Verlagerungswirkungen auf das Wilsdruffer Straße oder das Terrassenufer bzw. in die Wohnbereiche der Wilsdruffer Vorstadt,
eine im Zuge des VEP diskutierter direkter Linksabbieger aus dem Wiener Tunnel zur Sidonienstraße/ St.-Petersburger-Straße hat nur eine geringe Verkehrswirksamkeit (Quelle: Verkehrsmodell VEP), die den baulichen Aufwand nicht rechtfertigt – die Umfahrung über die Strehlener Straße ist ausreichend, wenn die LSA attraktive Fahrzeiten ermöglichen,
für die Relation Wiener Straße – Gellertstraße ist eine Kapazitätsbetrachtung durchzuführen.

Anbindung des Wissenschaftsstandortes Ost an Straße und ÖPNV und Umgestaltung der Wintergartenstraße zur Radroute in Richtung Großer Garten.

## Ansatz:

Prüfung bestandsnaher Ansätze zur Entlastung von Kfz-Verkehr am Wasaplatz im Zusammenhang mit dem Stadtbahnprogramm (Strecke Löbtau – Strehlen) wie z. B. Durchbindung der Hugo-Bürkner-Straße zur Teplitzer Straße und Verkehrsberuhigung am Wasaplatz),
Mittelfristig zweistreifige Führung des Kfz-Verkehrs durch eine neue Bahnunterführung in Verlängerung der Liebstädter Straße bis zur Reicker Straße und in einem 2. Abschnitt weiter bis zur Dohnaer Straße (2. Abschnitt für Ziel „Entlastung Wasaplatz“ von hoher Bedeutung),
Zweistreifige Verlängerung der Tiergartenstraße zur Liebstädter Straße mit Anbindung des Wissenschaftsstandorts Dresden-Ost und in 2. Stufe (nach 2025) bis Oskar-Röder-Straße,
Umgestaltung der Winterbergstraße und vollständige Ausstattung mit Radverkehrsanlagen,
Verkehrsberuhigung im Bereich Altstrehlen und Abstufung zur Hauptsammelstraße,
Langfristig bis 2025 ergänzende Umsetzung einer Stadtbahnlinie „61“ zwischen Wasaplatz - Zwinglistraße – Schillerplatz mit Anbindung des Wissenschaftsstandorts Dresden-Ost im Bereich Tiergartenstraße oder Grunaer Weg,
Es besteht vertiefender Untersuchungsbedarf zur verkehrlichen Wirkung der Maßnahmen unter Berücksichtigung der strukturellen Auswirkungen des neuen Wissenschaftsstandorts Dresden-Ost sowie einer Durchbindung der Liebstädter Straße bis zur B 172.

# Umgang mit weiteren stadträumlichen Defizitbereichen

Die weiteren stadträumlichen Defizitbereiche der Gruppe 3 (siehe Anlage 3) berücksichtigen 15 Stadtbereiche mit stadträumlichen Defiziten (besonders auch in den Ortsteilen). Verbesserungen sind hier durch Maßnahmen weitgehend im Bestand zu erreichen bzw. es liegen Planungen vor, den Bestand anzupassen. Teilweise bestehen auch nur in zwei Kategorien Konflikte.

Im Folgenden werden erste Lösungsideen beschrieben:

Albertstraße/ Archivplatz: als VEP-Maßnahme im Kapitel zum Fußgängerverkehr verankert,
Bautzener Landstraße/ Weißer Hirsch/ Bühlau: Verkehrsmengen werden perspektivisch nicht deutlich sinken, Umgestaltungen im Rahmen der Straßensanierung,
Bautzner Straße zwischen Hoyerswerdaer Straße und Martin-Luther-Straße: umfassende Sanierung als zweistreifige Stadtstraße, stadträumliche Aufwertung und Verbesserung der Querungssicherheit (wird als Umbaumaßnahme in 2013 umgesetzt),
Bautzner Straße zwischen Martin-Luther-Straße und Radeberger Straße: Sanierung im Nachgang des ersten Teilstücks von der Hoyerswerdaer Straße, zweistreifige, stadtverträgliche Gestaltung sinnvoll, neben der Kfz-Verbindungsfunktion spielen vor allem die Belange der Querungen zur Elbe sowie des ÖPNV und Radverkehrs eine wichtige Rolle,
Bischofsplatz: Sanierung erfolgt im Zusammenhang mit dem S-Bahn-Ausbau (HP Bischofsplatz, derzeit in Planung) – besondere Berücksichtigung des Querungsbedarfes und der Umgestaltung der großen (nutzlosen) Verkehrsflächen,
Blasewitzer Straße: Umgestaltungen im Rahmen der Bestandssanierung, Einfluss der Waldschlößchenbrücke auf die Verkehrsmengen (Nachher-Untersuchungen) sind geplant,
Borsbergstraße/ Schandauer Straße: umfassende Sanierung und Aufwertung ist in 2013 geplant,
Carolapatz: Umgestaltung und Aufwertung erforderlich, Sanierung der Haltestellen, Kompaktierung der Verkehrsanlage,
Fetscherplatz/ Fetscherstraße zw. Blasewitzer Straße und Stübelallee: umfassende Sanierung der Straße mit Haltestellen und Radverkehrsanlagen ist im Nachgang der Verkehrswirksamkeit der Waldschlößchenbrücke vorr. in 2015/2016 geplant – die Verkehrsmengen werden durch die Waldschlößchenbrücke in diesem Bereich tendenziell ansteigen, sodass grundlegende Veränderungen im Querschnitt zu Gunsten von Randbereichen kaum möglich erscheinen,
Hansastraße/ Schlesischer Platz/ Hainstraße: Oberflächensanierung, räumliche Aufwertung, Verbesserung der Querbarkeit, Verbesserung der Radführungen, Prüfung von veränderten Kfz-Abbiegebeziehungen im Zusammenhang mit Veränderungen an der Großen Meißner Straße,

# NeutralPath – Dresden as a pioneer on the way to becoming a climate-neutral city

## Summary NeutralPath

The Smart City project NeutralPath of the City of Dresden focuses on the urban heat and energy transition, especially the building sector with locations in the city districts of Leuben and Loschwitz. Altogether there are five cities that form the consortia network: Together with Zaragoza, Dresden is a frontrunner city that demonstrates feasible PCEDs, in close cooperation with the three follower cities Ghent, Istanbul and Vantaa. The EU is funding the project through the Horizon Europe program in the period 2023-2027 with around €19.6 million, of which around €7.7 million will go to the local demonstration project in Dresden alone. The city administration is investing over €1.3 million in this project.

## Project goal

The aim is to develop and demonstrate energy-positive, climate-neutral urban districts (Positive Clean Energy Districts (PCEDs) in Dresden (Germany) and Zaragoza (Spain) and the follower cities Ghent (Belgium), Istanbul (Turkey) and Vantaa (Finland). The project focuses on the building sector, specifically the decarbonization of the heat supply, the expansion of the use of renewable energy sources and the increase in the energy efficiency of buildings ("heat transition"). Electromobility and sector coupling are being addressed as integrated topics.

By demonstrating practical and affordable solutions for a future-proof energy and heat supply and by supporting cities in reducing CO2 emissions more quickly and setting up environmentally friendly innovation centers, we are making an important contribution to the development of a modern and sustainable city.

In parallel, paths are being developed to replicate, scale and embed PCEDs in the municipal administration and local housing sector in order to enable the long-term goals in NeutralPath for optimal climate protection in housing construction, energy supply and urban mobility.

The most important measures of the project are listed here:

Demonstration of climate-neutral neighborhoods (Positive Clean Energy Districts) in Dresden
Installation of photovoltaic systems and heat pumps to increase local energy production and optimise consumption
Construction of a low-temperature heating network as a prerequisite for the integration of renewable energies in Leuben
Energy-efficient renovation and modernization of existing residential buildings as well as installation of innovative insulation solutions in Pillnitz-Hosterwitz
As of 04.09.2024

DRESDEN 2030 NEUTRALPATH

Monitoring and performance monitoring of the installed systems in parallel: Establishment of innovation centers for PCEDs ( Climate -Neutral Labs) in Dresden

# Project areas and measures

The Positive and Climate-Neutral Energy Districts (PCEDs) initiative in Dresden integrates two pilot sites in Leuben and Loschwitz into an energy balance, which are particularly suitable due to their special potential to be repeated and expanded in Dresden. The exact locations in Jessener Straße and Pillnitzer Landstraße / Van-Gogh-Straße are shown in the thematic city map:

# Location A – Jessener Straße (Leuben district)

Jessener Strasse is located in Leuben, a district in the east of Dresden, near the inner city park Grosser Garten. The picture here is dominated by high-rise buildings that are typical of the residential complexes built in the 1970s. There is a supermarket and a kindergarten in the area, which enrich the everyday lives of the residents. The high-rise buildings on Jessener Strasse are connected to SachsenEnergie's district heating network, which has so far been operated primarily with fossil fuels. However, in cooperation with Vonovia and SachsenEnergie, an innovative project is being pushed forward to gradually make the district climate-neutral. This includes installing photovoltaic systems to make renewable energies available to residents. Vonovia is investing over two million euros in the project to transform the district into a model example of CO2-free living. Charging stations for electric vehicles are also planned so that residents can actively participate in the energy transition. These developments make Jessener Strasse an ideal test field for the integration of modern and environmentally friendly heating solutions. The project is supported by NeutralPath and jointly driven by SachsenEnergie and Vonovia. These measures make a decisive contribution to the decarbonization of the energy system in Dresden.

# Planned measures

Decarbonisation and flexibilisation of the district heating network: Connection to the central district heating network of SachsenEnergie, which is to be completely decarbonised by 2035
Expansion of thermal storage capacities: Additional storage capacities for flexible compensation of fluctuations in renewable energies
Local solar systems and tenant electricity model: Use of solar energy to operate heat pumps and other electrical heating equipment (sector coupling)
E-mobility concept: installation of fast charging stations and introduction of dynamic pricing models
As of 04.09.2024

DRESDEN 2030 NEUTRALPATH

# Location B – Pillnitzer Landstrasse/Van-Gogh-Strasse/Weberweg (Hosterwitz/Pillnitz district)

The site is a quiet residential area on Pillnitzer Landstrasse and has a loose development structure with two-storey apartment buildings of an older design. The district is not connected to the district heating network and is of central importance in municipal heat planning. The surrounding area is characterized by a good structural situation. The property with existing buildings from the 1950s and 1960s, some of which have been renovated, offers plenty of green space, a pleasant living atmosphere and extremely good conditions for piloting a PCED without a district heating connection. A large part of the energy required is to be generated and used directly on site with renewable supply systems. A local low-temperature heating network is to be installed in order to ensure an almost CO2-neutral heat supply and to achieve a positive energy balance in the district throughout the year. This location has the potential to become a model for sustainable building and living and to inspire other districts in Dresden and beyond to follow suit.

## Planned measures

Renovation of old buildings and new construction: renovation of existing buildings to zero or plus energy standards and new construction of energy-efficient residential buildings
Low-temperature heating network ("LowEx"): Implementation of a local low-temperature heating network to reduce CO2 emissions
Integration of renewable energies: Use of solar energy and other renewable sources to meet energy needs

# NeutralPath – Dresden als Vorreiter auf dem Weg zur klimaneutralen Stadt

## Was ist NeutralPath?

Das Smart City-Vorhaben „NeutralPath“ der Stadt Dresden hat den Fokus auf die urbane Wärme- und Energiewende, vor allem den Gebäudesektor mit Standorten in den Stadtteilen Leuben und Loschwitz. Fünf Städte bilden hier das Innovationsnetzwerk ab: Gemeinsam mit Zaragossa demonstriert Dresden als Vorreiterstadt machbare PCEDs, in engem Austausch mit den drei „Nachahmerstädten“ Ghent, Istanbul und Vantaa. Die EU fördert das Projekt über das Horizon Europe Programm im Zeitraum 2023-2027 mit rund 19,6 Millionen €, davon entfallen rund 7,7 Millionen € allein auf das lokale Demonstrationsvorhaben in Dresden. Die Stadtverwaltung investiert im Rahmen dieses Projekts über 1,3 Millionen €.

## Projektziel

Ziel ist die Entwicklung und Demonstration von energiepositiven, klimaneutralen Stadtquartieren (Positive Clean Energy Districts/PCEDs) in Dresden und Zaragossa als Modellstädte und Ghent (Belgien), Istanbul (Türkei) und Vantaa (Finnland) als Multiplikatoren bzw. Nachahmerstädte. Das Vorhaben hat den Fokus auf den Gebäudesektor, konkret die Dekarbonisierung der Wärmeversorgung, die Ausweitung des Einsatzes erneuerbarer Energiequellen und die Steigerung der Energieeffizienz von Gebäuden („Wärmewende“). Elektromobilität und Sektorenkopplung werden als integrierter Themen bearbeitet.

Durch das Vorführen praktischer und bezahlbarer Lösungen für eine zukunftssichere Energie- und Wärmeversorgung sowie die Unterstützung von Städten bei der schnelleren Verringerung von CO2-Emissionen und dem Aufbau umweltfreundlicher Innovationszentren leisten wir einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Entwicklung einer modernen und nachhaltigen Stadt.

Parallel werden Pfade zur Replizierung, Skalierung und Verankerung von PCEDs in der städtischen Verwaltung und hiesigen Wohnungswirtschaft ausgearbeitet, um die langfristigen Ziele in NeutralPath für optimalen Klimaschutz beim Wohnungsbau, bei der Energieversorgung und urbanen Mobilität zu ermöglichen.

Hier sind die wichtigsten Maßnahmen des Projekts aufgelistet:

Demonstration klimaneutraler Quartiere (Positive Clean Energy Districts) in Dresden
Installation von Photovoltaikanlagen und Wärmepumpen zur Erhöhung der lokalen Energieerzeugung und optimierten Verbrauch
Aufbau eines Niedertemperatur-Wärmenetzes als Voraussetzung der Integration von Erneuerbaren Energien in Leuben
Energetische Sanierung und Modernisierung bestehender Wohngebäude sowie Anbau der innovativen Isolierungslösungen in Pillnitz-Hosterwitz
As of 04/09/2024

DRESDEN 2030 NEUTRALPATH

Monitoring und Performanceüberwachung der installierten Systeme parallel dazu: Einrichtung von Innovationszentren für PCEDs (Climate-Neutral Labs) in Dresden

# Projektgebiete und Maßnahmen

Die Initiative *Positive und klimaneutrale Energiedistrikte* (PCEDs) in Dresden integriert zwei Pilotstandorte in Leuben und Loschwitz in eine Energiebilanz, die wegen ihres besonderen Potenzials, in Dresden wiederholt und ausgeweitet zu werden, besonders geeignet sind. Die genauen Standorte in der Jessener Straße und Pillnitzer Landstraße / Van-Gogh-Straße werden im Themenstadtplan angezeigt:

# Standort A – Jessener Straße (Stadtteil Leuben):

Die Jessener Straße befindet sich in Leuben, einem Stadtteil im Osten von Dresden, nahe dem Großen Garten. Hier prägen Hochhäuser das Bild, die typisch für die in den 1970er Jahren errichteten Wohnkomplexe sind. In der Umgebung gibt es einen Supermarkt und einen Kindergarten, die den Alltag der Bewohner bereichern. Die Hochhäuser an der Jessener Straße sind ans Fernwärmenetz von SachsenEnergie angeschlossen, das bisher überwiegend mit fossilen Brennstoffen betrieben wird. In Zusammenarbeit mit Vonovia und SachsenEnergie wird jedoch ein innovatives Projekt vorangetrieben, um das Quartier schrittweise klimaneutral zu gestalten. Dazu werden unter anderem Photovoltaikanlagen installiert, um erneuerbare Energien für die Bewohner nutzbar zu machen. Vonovia investiert über zwei Millionen Euro in das Projekt, um das Quartier in ein Vorzeigebeispiel für CO2-freies Wohnen zu verwandeln. Geplant sind auch Ladestationen für Elektrofahrzeuge, sodass die Bewohner aktiv an der Energiewende teilnehmen können. Diese Entwicklungen machen die Jessener Straße zu einem idealen Testfeld für die Integration moderner und umweltfreundlicher Heizlösungen. Das Projekt wird von NeutralPath unterstützt und von SachsenEnergie und Vonovia gemeinsam vorangetrieben. Diese Maßnahmen tragen entscheidend zur Dekarbonisierung des Energiesystems in Dresden bei.

# Geplante Maßnahmen

Dekarbonisierung und Flexibilisierung des Fernwärmenetzes: Anbindung an das zentrale Fernwärmenetz von SachsenEnergie, das bis 2035 vollständig dekarbonisiert sein soll
Erweiterung der thermischen Speicherkapazitäten: Zusätzliche Speicherkapazitäten zum flexiblen Ausgleichen von Schwankungen bei erneuerbaren Energien
Lokale Solaranlagen und Mieterstrommodell: Nutzung von Solarenergie für den Betrieb von Wärmepumpen und anderem elektrischen Heiz-Equipment (Sektorenkopplung)
E-Mobilitätskonzept: Einrichtung von Schnellladestationen und Einführung dynamischer Preismodelle
As of 04/09/2024

DRESDEN 2030 NEUTRALPATH

# Standort B – Pillnitzer Landstraße/Van-Gogh-Straße/Weberweg (Stadtteil Hosterwitz/Pillnitz)

Der Standort umfasst ein ruhiges Wohngebiet an der Pillnitzer Landstraße und weist eine lockere Bebauungsstruktur mit 2-geschossigen Mehrfamilienhäusern älterer Bauart auf. Das Quartier ist nicht ans Fernwärmenetz angebunden und hat zentrale Bedeutung bei der kommunalen Wärmeplanung. Die Umgebung ist von einer guten baulichen Situation geprägt. Das Grundstück mit Bestandsgebäuden aus den 1950er und 1960er Jahren, teilweise saniert, bietet viel Grünfläche, eine angenehme Wohnatmosphäre und äußerst gute Bedingungen für die Pilotierung eines PCED ohne Fernwärmanschluss. Dabei soll ein Großteil der benötigten Energie direkt vor Ort mit regenerativen Versorgungssystemen erzeugt und genutzt werden. Ein lokales Niedertemperatur-Heiznetz soll installiert werden, um eine nahezu CO2-neutrale Wärmeversorgung zu gewährleisten und im Quartier über das gesamte Jahr hinweg eine positive Energiebilanz zu erreichen. Dieser Standort hat das Potenzial, sich zu einem Vorbild für nachhaltiges Bauen und Wohnen zu entwickeln und andere Stadtteile in Dresden sowie darüber hinaus zur Nachahmung zu inspirieren.

## Geplante Maßnahmen

Altbausanierung und Neubau: Sanierung bestehender Gebäude zu Null- oder Plusenergie-Standards und Neubau von energieeffizienten Wohnhäusern
Niedertemperatur-Heiznetz ("LowEx"): Implementierung eines lokalen Niedertemperatur-Heiznetzes zur Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen
Integration erneuerbarer Energien: Nutzung von Solarenergie und anderen erneuerbaren Quellen zur Deckung des Energiebedarfs

# 1 Introduction

In view of the rapidly advancing global climate change and the serious consequences of global warming, including for the health and prosperity of people in Dresden, the City Council of the City of Dresden declared climate protection to be a top-priority task for the provision of services of general interest by the city and municipal holding companies in 2020. This was accompanied by a mandate to the administration to revise the existing energy and climate protection strategy and to develop actions for climate protection together with relevant stakeholders and interested parties in urban society. Particular emphasis was placed on the social compatibility of all actions.¹

Climate protection is not a mandatory municipal task in Germany. Nevertheless, global warming, extreme weather events and resource scarcity are fundamental challenges that influence municipal action and pose a particular challenge to cities as places with high population, building and economic densities. Added to this are political and social developments such as wars, pandemics and economic crises, which cause additional burdens. In times of profound change and uncertainty, the city's most important mission is to guarantee the provision of municipal services for all citizens and to create a liveable, resilient and crisis-proof city of the future. Climate protection and adaptation is part of this mission.

The Saxon City of Dresden, located in the border triangle of Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland on the banks of the Elbe, has already undergone radical transformation processes in recent decades. Heavily destroyed in the Second World War, parts of the city were rebuilt as a model socialist city. Historic buildings were neglected and new residential areas were built using prefabricated housing. The political changes of 1990 brought further far-reaching changes: buildings were renovated and refurbished on a large scale and the (transport) infrastructure and technical equipment were modernised. Energetically advantageous structures such as the polycentric layout of the city with a good mix of uses, the extensive public transport network and the district heating supply in combined heat and power generation were retained and further developed. This urban structure makes it easy to transfer city-wide actions to individual sub-areas. Individual urban areas, in turn, correspond to the typology of large European cities, so that approaches are mutually transferable and a lively exchange between both eastern and western European cities characterised by their culture takes place and is further developed. In the mid-1990s, there was a switch from coal to natural gas for heating and district heating. Dresden has one of the most modern district heating systems in Germany. It is over 400 kilometres long and supplies over 125,000 Dresden flats as well as numerous public facilities and commercial properties.

Today, Dresden is an important European city of culture. Its economy and population are developing dynamically. Also known as the "Gateway to Central Europe", it maintains close, historically grown relations with the neighbouring states to the east. It has the densest network of research institutions in Europe, is home to the only German university of excellence in the new federal states and is Europe's most important chip centre. Dresden is also an important location for "greentech" in Europe. A total of over 360 players in the state capital are involved in green technologies. These include around 70

research institutions and more than 270 companies: From start-ups, university spin-offs and SMEs to internationally active corporations. A greentech cluster that has already produced numerous internationally recognised technologies that also pay off economically: Double-digit increases in turnover are not uncommon in the local environmental technology companies. And in view of the diverse climatic challenges, strong growth can also be expected for greentech from Dresden in the coming years.

## Developments to date in the area of climate protection at CoD:

Climatic conditions in Dresden have changed significantly since the 1980s. The 30-year average annual temperature rose from 8.9 degrees Celsius (1961 to 1990) to 9.8 degrees Celsius (1991 to 2020). Since 1988, all but two years have been warmer than the average value of the climate reference period. The highest average annual temperatures measured have occurred in the extremely short period of time since 2014 from a climatic perspective. The average annual temperature exceeded eleven degrees Celsius for the first time in 2018, and since then this has been the case in the three other years 2019, 2020 and 2023. The warming trend can be observed in all seasons, albeit to varying degrees. It is strongest in summer at +1.3 degrees.

As early as 2008, the Federal Government provided a political framework for climate adaptation in Germany with the adoption of the German Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (DAS). From 2008, the City of Dresden therefore analysed and developed possible climate change adaptation measures with numerous regional stakeholders as part of the REGKLAM research project. Options and strategies for climate adaptation were developed in the agricultural and commercial sectors as well as in urban planning issues (e.g. building equipment, green space design). The project, which was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (2008 to 2013), created an Integrated Regional Climate Adaptation Programme (IRKAP) for the model region of Dresden, which is now gradually being put into practice. Dresden can now draw up and implement the climate change adaptation strategy that is currently being developed on the basis of this comprehensive programme.

Climate protection played an important role in Dresden even before 2013. By joining the Climate Alliance of European Cities in 1994 and signing the Aalborg Charter in 1995, Dresden set ambitious goals early on, such as reducing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions by at least $20\%$ by 2005. The city council adopted the first municipal climate protection programme as early as 1998, which was regularly updated with reports. A decisive step was the establishment of the climate protection office in 2010, which took over the coordination of actions. The strategic framework for a sustainable climate policy was further consolidated with the creation of the Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Plan (IEuKK) in 2011. The Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan (IEuKK) was developed as a pioneering instrument and played a decisive role in understanding the challenges of climate protection in Dresden and tackling them in an integrated approach. The IEuKK set a target for Dresden to reduce GHG emissions by $10\%$ every five years from 2005 to 2030. In addition, activities and actions in the area of sustainability increased. Since 2019, urban development has been increasingly geared towards the 2030 Agenda, the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The Integrated Urban Development Concept (INSEK) - the city's key planning instrument - is underpinned by the sustainability goals.

In 2020, the Dresden City Council instructed the Mayor to update and adapt the existing Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Plan from 2013 and to update it with new findings in its resolution (SR/007/2020) "Updating the climate protection goals of the City of Dresden". The City Council resolution also stipulated that "draft resolutions, in particular on construction projects, transport and energy

supply, must be examined for their impact on greenhouse gas emissions and the urban climate from 1 June 2020 and the results presented in the submission". The Environmental Agency (responsible for the area of urban climate) and the Climate Protection Unit (responsible for the topic of greenhouse gas emissions) have developed an assessment scheme accordingly and documented it in template V0657/20 "Climate impact assessment in draft resolutions".

The Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Plan (IEK) was presented in January 2024. This was confirmed by the top management on 20 February 2024 and has now been submitted to the newly elected City Council on 9 June 2024 for political decision-making. In addition to the IEK, the City Council adopted the statutes for a new Climate Advisory Board of the City of Dresden at its meeting on 18 April 2024. The Climate Advisory Board will advise the City Council, its committees and the Mayor on all issues relating to climate protection and adaptation to climate change in the City of Dresden. It will be made up of representatives of the City Council as well as knowledgeable citizens from various relevant stakeholders in Dresden.

## Participation in global or European initiatives and programmes

International networking has always played a key role in local development. Early on after the political change in 1990, Dresden orientated itself towards the most important inter-municipal European and international networks. In 1992, Dresden became a member of the ICLEI network, which promotes sustainable development in municipalities. In 1994, the state capital joined the Climate Alliance. Since 2004, the City of Dresden has been a member of the EUROCITIES and POLIS city networks. In 2010/2011, Dresden held the presidency of POLIS. The regional transport association Oberelbe is also a member of the international network UITP. EUROCITIES, ICLEI, Climate Alliance and UITP are members of NetZeroCities.

In 2020, Dresden joined many POLIS partners in committing to the European climate targets in the transport sector. In 2020, Dresden was one of the signatory cities of the "Pledge Letter", a declaration of intent for the local implementation of the "Green Deal". This was presented to the Vice-President of the European Commission, Frans Timmermans. With the POLIS Pledge Letter, the cities reaffirmed that the climate protection targets and the 55 Percent reduction in emissions required by 2030 can only be achieved if the transition to sustainable urban mobility is accelerated and substantial changes are implemented at many levels. On 21 March 2019 in Brussels, the EU Commissioner for Transport, Violeta Bulc, awarded the City of Dresden second place (together with Basel) in the "SUMP Award", the European prize for sustainable mobility. Dresden had applied for this award with its transport development plan and its multimodal priorities. Back in 2015, the City of Dresden was recognised for its strategic transport development planning with an emphatic award from the EU Commission for Transport. The Commissioner for Transport of the European Union, Ms Violeta Bulc, also honoured the work done in drawing up the transport development plan (VEP) of the City of Dresden and its contents in Brussels.

The CoD has been a member of the Covenant of Mayors since 2016 and reports via the MyCovenant platform as part of the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP). This takes into account Dresden's integrated plans for climate protection, climate change adaptation and a secure, sustainable and affordable energy supply. As part of the current updates of the climate protection concept and the climate change adaptation concept, a joint report (SECAP) will be uploaded to MyCovenant for the end of 2024.

In January 2022, the Dresden City Council voted in favour of participating in the EU Green City Accord. With the Landscape Plan, the Integrated Urban Development Concept (INSEK), the Clean Air and Noise Action Plan, the Waste Management Concept and others, the City of Dresden has adopted and in some cases already implemented key resolutions that correspond in principle to the objectives of the Green City Accord and now reports regularly to the EU as part of the EU Green City Accord monitoring programme.

Dresden has already successfully participated in European collaborative projects in the past. As one of four Horizon 2020 Lighthouse Cities in Germany, Dresden has demonstrated its expertise in the development and transfer of smart city solutions at local and European level in the EU project MAtch-UP. In the new funding period, the CoD was also able to successfully acquire further EU projects from HorizonEurope and other EU programmes.

At the beginning of 2022, the City of Dresden successfully applied for the EU city mission "100 climate neutral and smart cities by 2030". Participation in the EU city mission is a continuation of efforts to combine, test and implement innovation-driven approaches at local and international level. Existing potential is to be fully utilised and, together with partners from the public, science and business, key projects and decisive steps towards climate neutrality are to be taken.

The city's goal of climate neutrality is not an end in itself. The consequences of global warming and climate change are also being felt in Dresden. By reducing greenhouse gases, protecting and strengthening the local ecosystem, expanding renewable energy and reducing dependence on gas, the city of Dresden aims to be robust and resilient for the future.

# 2 Goal: climate neutrality by 2030

## 2.1 The city's climate neutrality target for 2030

The objective of the Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Plan (IEuKK) adopted by the City of Dresden (CoD) in 2013 was to reduce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in the city by 41 Percent between 2005 and 2030. Formally, the Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Plan (IEuKK) from 2013 represents the current climate protection decisions of the City of Dresden (BAU scenario).

A city council resolution on 30 January 2020 initiated the update of the Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan (IEuKK) from 2013.² This city council resolution set the goal of climate neutrality well before 2050 and thus formulated a concrete target for greenhouse gas neutrality for the first time and thus a political mandate for achieving green house gas neutrality over time. In 2022, a citizens' petition by Dresden Zero called for the 2035 target for Dresden's climate neutrality. The Dresden City Council recognised the urgency and commissioned the administration to present the goal of climate neutrality by 2035 (alternatively 2040) as part of the adopted revision of the Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan of the City of Dresden (IEK) when updating the Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan and to align the corresponding action portfolio with this goal.³ (However, this does not constitute a resolution).

The IEK includes targets for energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. Two target scenarios (2035, 2040) and a reference scenario (2045 in accordance with the Climate Protection Act) were analysed for the IEK and converted into corresponding reduction paths on the basis of concrete potential studies, some of which were specific to buildings and locations. Cost scenarios were also drawn up for the Fields of action of building energy and the expansion of renewable energies, which provide an initial orientation on the necessary financial framework conditions. The area of mobility, for which the VEP 2025plus transport development plan is currently being updated in the form of the Dresden Mobility Plan (DMP) 2035+, is a special case in point. As the development of specific scenarios and actions based on the Integrated Transport Model (IVM) is reserved for the DMP 2035+, the IEK includes a target for achieving GHG-neutrality for the mobility sector.

As a result of the IEK, GHG-neutrality by 2040 is proposed as a minimum target in accordance with the reduction path of the 2040 target scenario. The background to this is that achieving the pre-defined GHG-neutrality target by 2035 is not feasible even in the 2035 target scenario.

This is due to

Skilled labour capacities,
already foreseeable industrial settlements and the

attributable.

By setting the target year 2040, there is still sufficient leeway to achieve GHG-neutrality. Nevertheless, in view of the resolution on the Dresden Zero citizens' petition, all urban actions should be accelerated as much as possible in order to achieve GHG-neutrality as early as possible. In the mobility sector, a separate target pathway is assumed, which is based on the scenarios used in the DMP 2035+ and envisages GHG-neutrality by 2045. Specific interim targets are also proposed in order to maximise the binding nature of the target year 2040 and to ensure sufficient speed of implementation. These are also based on compliance with a paris-compliant residual budget. The expansion path according to the 2035 target scenario is proposed for tapping the potential for renewable energies, particularly in the areas of wind energy and photovoltaics (PV). This is backed up with specific annual generation targets. For the EU urban emissions and the target year 2030, an interim target was defined in the IEK that corresponds to an  $80\%$  reduction in the city's energy-related GHG from 1990 to 2030. Complete GHG-neutrality (with unavoidable  $5\%$  residual emissions) is to be achieved by 2040 according to the proposed resolution in the IEK.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 1Reduction pathway to reduce greenhouse gases for Dresden by 2030 (interim target), achievement of GHG-neutrality according to Dresden's definition (95% reduction) by 2040

The interim targets mentioned serve to ensure a sufficient reduction in greenhouse gases to limit global warming in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement and to take into account the requirements of the Dresden Zero citizens' initiative with a high level of ambition in achieving GHG-neutrality.

The reduction in greenhouse gases shown here is still subject to a decision by the city council. The path is therefore to be regarded as subject to this decision.

Table 1: Overview of the interim targets of the reduction path of the target to achieve GHG-neutrality in Dresden

|  Year (Interim) target | Reduction compared to (rounded)4 | target 1990 | Specific target value for energy-related emissions in tCO2 eq/a | Electricity from RE plants in GWh/a  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  2027 |  | -70 % | 2.885.300 | 365  |
|  2030 |  | -80 % | 1.586.900 | 680  |
|  2035 |  | -90 % | 944.700 | 1.440  |
|  2040 |  | -95 % | 329.900 | No specification  |

The target pathway also takes into account that further commercial and industrial development is expected to lead to an increase in energy and resource requirements and the resulting GHG emissions. The developments known at the time the IEK was created were integrated into the potential analyses and the reduction pathway. Dresden was selected as the location for TSMC's first European semiconductor plant. The construction of this semiconductor factory will not only further strengthen Dresden and thus the largest microelectronics cluster in Europe, Silicon Saxony, but will also drive forward Saxony as an economic and technology centre as a whole and provide a significant boost to growth. This will create both opportunities and challenges for the city.

On the one hand, this involves investments totalling billions and the creation of numerous new jobs - both directly and indirectly, including for skilled trades and SMEs - and is of great importance for the region. On the other hand, it is currently of crucial importance for the city of Dresden to lay the foundations for a needs-based infrastructure for the north of Dresden, which not only includes the supply and disposal of water, but also guarantees a stable energy supply and efficient transport infrastructure and mobility. In addition, sufficient commercial space must be provided for the supply industry, for example. The expected creation of many new jobs is associated with an influx to cover the demand for labour. This will lead to increased demand for adequate housing and facilities such as daycare centres, schools and medical care.

All of these developments are caught between the conflicting priorities of climate-neutral and resource-conserving development. Not least because of this, Dresden is a unique testing ground in Europe for the compatibility of central European objectives: Strengthening technological competitiveness and security of supply while simultaneously implementing the Green Deal and a climate-neutral smart Europe.

Further and more detailed information on the climate protection strategy can be found in the Action Plan and in the CCC's Investment Plan.

# 2.2 Additional benefits for the city through increased climate protection measures

Climate protection aims to minimise the negative effects of climate change as far as possible. In the context of urban development, the goal of a climate-robust and resilient city takes centre stage. A city that not only withstands the challenges of climate change, but is also sustainable and adaptable, offers a variety of additional benefits. These include an increased quality of life, improved public health and the creation of attractive green and recreational spaces. In addition, sustainable urban design helps to reduce maintenance and flood protection costs. A particular focus here is on the city of Dresden, where targeted climate protection measures can both save costs and improve environmental and living conditions in the long term. The most important benefits and associated cost and savings potentials are presented in more detail below. The costs and cost savings mentioned relate to Dresden.

|  Advantages | Description of the  |
| --- | --- |
|  Avoidance of CO2 costs | All players in the city already have to pay costs for the emission of greenhouse gases. A distinction must be made between European and national emissions trading. Certificate prices in European emissions trading are expected to rise from 2027. A forecast by SachsenEnergie AG estimates the CO2 price for 2045 at 208 EUR/t, albeit with major uncertainties. This forecast serves to illustrate possible savings for Dresden if GHG-neutrality is achieved. This would mean an annual reduction of 3.2 million tonnes of CO2 compared to 2018 and potentially save costs of around EUR 668 million per year.  |
|  Reduction of climate impact costs - ecological benefits according to the damage cost approach | The damage cost approach published by the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) estimates the amount of damage caused to society by GHG emissions and the resulting climate change. For GHG emissions emitted in 2022, this damage cost rate is estimated by the UBA at 237 euros/t CO2 and for 2050 at 286 euros/t CO2, but with a higher weighting of the prosperity of current generations compared to that of future generations (time preference 1 Percent). If the prosperity claim were weighted equally (0 Percent time preference), the cost rate for 2050 would rise to 865 Euro/t CO2. This clearly shows that not only the achievement of GHG-neutrality itself, but also the total emissions still emitted until GHG-neutrality is achieved cause considerable damage and must therefore be included in the analysis. Based on the damage cost rates for a higher weighting of the current level of prosperity (time preference 1 Percent) and in comparison between the target and the reference scenario, the acceleration of the federal target to achieve GHG-neutrality in 2045 alone results in a reduction in the damage amount of around 3.2 billion euros by achieving GHG-neutrality in 2040 and meeting the CO2 budget for the 1.75 °C target.  |
|  Financial benefits and increased self-sufficiency | In addition to the benefits from Dresden's overall perspective, the operation of private renewable energy systems, such as PV roof or  |
|   | energy systems, is also a key factor in the development of GHG. This is because the energy system is not only the source of energy, but also the source of energy. This is because the energy system is not only the source of energy, but also the source of energy. This is because the energy system is not only the source of energy, but also the source of energy. This is because the energy system is not only the source of energy, but also the source of energy. This is because the energy system is not only the source of energy, but also the source of energy.

|  (from an individual perspective) | balcony systems, can help to reduce energy costs for tenants or building users and thus contribute to a financial advantage. Ideally, companies can also reduce their energy costs by utilising renewable energy systems on their buildings or areas compared to full grid procurement. In addition, supplying their own decentralised energy and possibly storage systems represents a certain degree of self-sufficiency, which can contribute to local security of supply. To summarise, it can be stated at this point that investments in Dresden's GHG-neutrality not only make an important contribution to achieving climate protection targets, but also bring several important additional benefits.  |
|  Regional added value | Another sustainable benefit from an economic perspective is the increase and strengthening of regional added value for Dresden and the region. This is because a large proportion of relevant investments not only take place in Dresden, but are also realised by regional companies from planning to construction. The fact that the additional plants and infrastructure have to be maintained and serviced also leads to long-term orders and jobs for the regional economy. Furthermore, Dresden will significantly reduce its energy imports and thus also the outflow of financial resources.  |
|  Location advantage | Climate protection is playing an increasingly decisive role as a location factor for municipalities, particularly in terms of attracting large companies. Companies are attaching more and more importance to sustainable business practices and favour locations that offer a future-proof, climate-friendly infrastructure. Municipalities that pursue clear climate protection strategies and implement actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are signalling a willingness to innovate and a sense of responsibility. This can help to strengthen their image as an attractive business location and increase their competitiveness in global competition. Companies also benefit from sustainable location development, as it makes it easier for them to achieve their own climate targets and sustainability requirements. By creating climate-friendly framework conditions, a municipality not only secures its ecological future in the long term, but also attracts investors and companies that are active in sustainable growth markets.  |
|  Increasing the security of supply | Dresden is currently over 95 Percent dependent on fossil fuels, especially natural gas, for its heat supply. This dependence on imports harbours financial and supply-related risks. Even if Dresden will continue to be dependent on energy imports, the aim is to increase resilience to external shocks through reduction and diversification. The IEK's proposed target path envisages reducing the dependence on  |

|  Advantages | Description of the  |
| --- | --- |
|   | natural gas imports to supply heat to buildings to around 25 Percent through hydrogen imports and low electricity imports. CHP plants and heat pumps help to reduce dependence on electricity imports by generating and utilising electricity and heat efficiently.  |
|  Democratisation of the energy supply | The energy transition has the potential to make the energy supply more democratic at both an individual and international level. At an individual level, depending on individual circumstances, it can expand the opportunities for participation in the energy supply, although not everyone can benefit equally. This can increase the self-efficacy of individual groups and thus also the acceptance of actions. Internationally, this can reduce inequalities between countries and reduce dependencies on fossil resources. While the energy transition does not bring about complete democratisation in the political sense, it does make various aspects of energy supply more democratic.  |
|  Health and quality of life | Last but not least, climate protection and climate change adaptation measures have an impact on the health, mortality and quality of life of the urban population. As a result of global warming, heat stress in the summer months is increasing enormously for residents in densely populated neighbourhoods. In order to prevent health consequences, the City of Dresden is currently drawing up a heat action plan. This takes into account comprehensive intervention measures for health protection. Behavioural and situational preventive actions are intended to reduce heat stress and UV exposure and prevent damage to health. Dresden is working on a heat action plan for this purpose.
Increasing weather changes and natural disasters also have an impact on the quality of life and health of the city's inhabitants. Climate protection is intended to mitigate the effects of climate change as far as possible.  |

# 3 Strategic priorities or key measures

The strategic priorities and key measures can be found in defined Fields of Action, which are outlined in the Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan. Some of these can also be implemented in several fields of action. (This is made clear by the numbers in Table 3.2).

# 3.1 Fields of action

There are nine Fields of action in the urban climate protection strategy. The Fields of action define strategic priorities with corresponding topics for action. These also include non-energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, for which initial actions have been identified in the IEK as far as possible, but for which no detailed analyses have yet been carried out.

|   | Fields of action (FoA)  |
| --- | --- |
|  1 | Building energy supply  |
|   | In the Fields of action of building energy supply, the focus is on actions for climate-neutral heat supply, as the heat supply of buildings plays a decisive role in the overall balance of GHG emissions. This area currently accounts for around 1 million tonnes of greenhouse gases, or around 27 per cent of Dresden's GHG emissions. At the same time, the building sector offers considerable potential for utilising renewable energies directly at the consumer level. A climate-neutral heat supply seems possible by 2040. This is essentially based on decarbonised district heating in densely populated urban districts and the use of ambient heat potentials by means of heat pumps in less densely populated urban areas, as well as small amounts of biomass and direct electric heating. The central planning instrument for an affordable, secure and climate-neutral heat supply is municipal heat planning. The decarbonisation strategy and the heat transformation plan of SachsenEnergie AG based on it for a GHG-neutral district heating supply in the future as well as the expansion and densification of the existing district heating area are closely related to this.
In addition, the city has the potential to generate around 715 GWh of electricity per year from PV systems on buildings. Data on the suitability of roofs and façades can be viewed publicly in the CoD's thematic city map.  |
|  2 | Expansion of renewable energies in the area  |
|   | The Fields of action "Expansion of renewable energies in the area" includes concrete potential analyses, in particular for PV systems and wind turbines, in order to increase generation from renewable energies. The corresponding analyses revealed potentials of 409 GWh/a for PV independent of buildings and 315 GWh/a for the use of wind energy. The building-independent PV potential is made up of photovoltaic systems on open spaces, car parks, agri-PV (combined use of agricultural land for farming and electricity generation) and floating PV (PV systems on bodies of water).  |
|  3 | Mobility  |
|   | For the transport sector (Fields of action: mobility), which accounts for around 24 Percent of Dresden's GHG emissions, an in-depth analysis of potential, including the necessary  |

|   | development of measures, will be carried out as part of the Dresden Mobility Plan 2035+ (DMP 2035+). The necessary link between the two concepts will be ensured via a target for the transport sector in the reduction pathway of the IEK, which will be incorporated into the development of the DMP 2035+.  |
| --- | --- |
|  4 | Industrial processes and product utilisation  |
|   | In the Fields of action Industrial processes and product use, both the topic of energy consumption for industrial processes and the aspect of greenhouse gases generated in the production processes are relevant. This Fields of action also includes non-energy-related emissions from product use, which are not solely attributable to industrial processes.  |
|  5 | Agriculture, forestry and other land use  |
|   | The Fields of action Agriculture, forestry and other land use focus on non-energy GHG emissions from livestock farming, cultivation of fields, forests and other areas, which account for a relatively small proportion of total urban emissions. In addition, the forests and green spaces on the CoD's territory serve as natural carbon sinks, but are not included in the GHG emissions balance.  |
|  6 | Waste and wastewater management  |
|   | In the Fields of action of waste and wastewater management, energy-related emissions in connection with transport and treatment are relevant. On the other hand, non-energy-related GHG emissions are generated as part of aerobic or anaerobic decomposition processes and incineration processes. A comprehensive data basis already exists in the area of wastewater management and a significant reduction in greenhouse gases has been achieved since 2005. The development of wastewater management poses a challenge due to the establishment of new production sites and the associated sharp increase in wastewater volumes. In the area of waste management, CoD is only responsible for part of the waste itself. It is therefore planned to draw up a secondary balance sheet for the waste sector in order to obtain a better data basis. In addition, the avoidance and reduction of greenhouse gases will be taken into account as part of the updating of the waste management concept.  |
|  7 | Grey energy, construction, consumption and nutrition  |
|   | The topics described in the Fields of action grey energy, construction, consumption and nutrition are not themselves sources of emissions and are therefore not recorded as a separate category in the GHG inventory. However, they have a considerable sphere of influence and offer considerable room for manoeuvre for Dresden's residents.  |
|  8 | Technical GHG sinks  |
|   | There will also be unavoidable residual emissions in the future. The remaining GHG emissions must then be offset by "negative emissions", which are located in the Technical GHG sinks Fields of action.  |
|  9 | Overarching organisation and control  |
|   | On the one hand, the Fields of action of overarching organisation and control include proposals for effective climate protection work in the city administration. For example, the coordination centre approved by the city council will in future bring together issues relating to the city's  |

The Fields of action also show how the city administration can implement its own, more ambitious target for achieving GHG-neutrality by 2035, which will also be fulfilled by the city's associated companies.

## 3.2 Priorities

The following priorities for the city's climate protection strategy emerge from a consideration of the relevant initial and political framework conditions:

|  Five priorities | FOA  |
| --- | --- |
|  1. the conversion of the energy and heat supply to renewable energy sources for the supply of buildings: decarbonisation of district heating, conversion of decentralised heating systems to renewable energies, expansion of PV on and around buildings | 1  |
|  2. the expansion of renewable energies for power generation in co-operation between urban and surrounding rural areas | 2  |
|  3. the adaptation of Dresden's transport system towards sustainable, climate-neutral and flexible mobility | 3  |
|  4. the GHG-neutral city administration | 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9  |
|  5. increased cooperation and coordination of the city's climate protection measures | 9  |

The strategic priorities are characterised by the fact that they have the greatest impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the city. At the same time, they must be implemented quickly in order to achieve short-term reductions. The necessary planning and implementation periods must be taken into account, particularly in the case of infrastructural changes.

## 3.3 Key measures

Over the next two to three years, the following key measures will be realised or their implementation will begin:

|  Key measures  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  1 | Building energy supply  |
|  2023-2025 | Municipal heat planning  |
|   | With municipal heat planning, CoD has set itself the goal of making the complex transformation process towards an affordable, secure and climate-neutral heat supply manageable and creating the highest possible degree of planning security for all stakeholders involved. Based on the local conditions, municipal heat planning  |

O

|   | should show how the heat supply can be gradually converted to the use of renewable energies or unavoidable waste heat in the future. The transition to a climate-neutral heat supply should be described as specifically as possible for each location.  |
| --- | --- |
|  2023-2027 | Energy self-sufficient urban neighbourhoods: implementation of EU project NEUTRAL PATH  |
|   | The EU project NEUTRALHPATH is developing "Positive Clean Energy Districts" (PCED), energy self-sufficient and energy-positive urban districts that are designed and implemented according to participatory and end-customer-centred principles. The project focuses on the building sector, specifically decarbonising the heat supply, expanding the use of renewable energy sources and increasing the energy efficiency of buildings ("heat transition"). Electromobility and sector coupling are being addressed as integrated topics. Pilot locations in Dresden are the districts of Leuben and Loschwitz. (For further information, see Action Plan).  |
|  2024-2026 | Municipal energy counselling (energy pilot and EU pilot project EnAct4CleanCities)  |
|   | A municipal energy counselling service (energy pilot) is being introduced as a service for citizens, property owners and companies in Dresden. The energy pilot will serve as a central point of contact for questions on the status of municipal heat planning, the provision of digital information and referral to appropriate advice centres. Implementation has started and is being carried out in close cooperation with partners such as the consumer advice centre, SAENA, SachsenEnergie and energy consultants. In addition, the development of the energy pilot is being supported by the NetZeroCities "Pilot Cities Programme". The particular focus here is on providing building owners with relevant information that is as individual and comprehensive as possible and on optimising the way in which the target group is addressed in the context of energy advice.  |
|  2 | Expansion of renewable energies in the area  |
|  2023-2027 | Expansion of ground-mounted PV and PV offensive  |
|   | The prerequisite for the development of the wind energy potential in Dresden is the creation of the necessary legal planning basis as well as the information and participation of the population to create acceptance. In addition, a feasibility study on urban wind energy is planned by the Dresden Sports Facilities Authority. The Eigenbetrieb Sportstätten manages over 70 sports facilities (buildings, some with several outdoor sports facilities) in the City of Dresden, where small urban wind turbines could potentially be installed to contribute to the energy supply at the sports facilities. The installation of PV systems on municipal open spaces will also be promoted as part of the city's PV campaign. Among other things, pilot projects in the field of agri-PV are to be examined as part of the leasing of municipal land to third parties.  |
|  3 | Transport (Fields of action: mobility)  |
|  2023-2026 | Further development and finalisation of the Dresden Mobility Plan 2035+ (DMP35+)  |

|   | The Dresden Mobility Plan 2035+ is a strategy for mobility and transport development in Dresden and continues the Transport Development Plan 2025plus adopted by the City Council in 2014. It is intended to be the roadmap for the future to enable safe, flexible, convenient and climate-friendly mobility. The forward-looking plan is being developed for the entire city and combines a wide range of concepts and resolutions passed by the city council. These include the integrated climate protection concept, the clean air plan and the cycling concept. In addition, the concept is being drawn up with extensive public participation.  |
| --- | --- |
|  6 | Waste and wastewater management  |
|  2024-2030 | Planning and construction of thermal waste treatment and recycling plant (RING 30)  |
|   | Residual waste from Dresden is transported an average of 150 kilometres, even though waste has a high energy value. Incineration currently takes place mostly in inefficient plants, far away from sufficient heat customers. RING30 will decarbonise around 16% of Dresden's district heating. The application for approval is scheduled for the end of 2024 for the Hammerweg site. The plant is scheduled to go into operation by 2030 at the latest. It will sort and process the approximately 75,000 tonnes of residual waste currently generated in Dresden every year. Non-recyclable waste is to be thermally utilised and the waste heat fed into the district heating network.  |
|  9 | Overarching organisation and control  |
|  2024 | Political resolution for the city's Integrated Energy und Climate Protection Plan (IEK)  |
|  2024 | Election of the city's newly established Climate Advisory Board  |
|  2024 | CCC levy as part of the EU city mission  |
|  2025 | Communication and participation strategy  |

# Key stakeholders:

In order to achieve the goal of green house gas neutrality, the city administration is dependent on many players and their cooperation. As the operator of the district heating network in Dresden, SachsenEnergie AG and SachsenNetze for the gas and electricity network are involved with the aim of dovetailing infrastructure planning as closely as possible in the process of creating the IEK and municipal heat planning. The involvement and integration of a large number of other important players (stakeholders) is also relevant. These include the city council and city districts as well as local councils, companies, banks, representatives from industry and trade, representatives from the scientific community, trade unions, associations, initiatives, the housing sector, property owners, energy cooperatives, banks and citizens. These stakeholders are already involved in a wide range of formats, processes and structures in the City of Dresden (see action plan). As part of the CCC and future climate protection work in Dresden, existing participation formats with stakeholders in the city of Dresden will be docked onto, further networked and made visible. The focus is on cooperation with stakeholders who are expected to have the greatest potential for CO2 savings.

# 4 Process and principles in the CCC

# 1. Strategy integration

As an overall framework document, the CCC describes the city's current climate protection efforts. The content is based on the Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Concept (IEK) as the overarching climate protection strategy of the City of Dresden. The Climate Protection and Adaptation Unit is responsible for the IEK. Findings and information are integrated from other city plans, the exchange with other city stakeholders and the inter-municipal exchange at national and European level. Various governance mechanisms such as the steering group or the Climate Advisory Board (see Action Plan) ensure horizontal steering and increased democratic participation in the administration. The iteration of the CCC will also be organically integrated into the (planning) processes and procedures of the CoD and build on existing reports and publications.

# 2. Co-operation

Climate protection can only succeed together. The City of Dresden is already working with selected stakeholders in the city on climate protection in a variety of forms and on a project basis in various areas. Examples include formats such as the sustainability round table of Dresden's business community, the Culture for Future sustainability process of Dresden's cultural sector and the participation committee for the Dresden Mobility Plan MOBIdialog 2035+. These processes are to be systematised and embedded in an overarching city-wide climate protection participation strategy, whereby the stakeholder-specific approach will continue to be pursued and expanded. With the IEK/CCC and the process for gaining commitments for the CCC, a framework has been established that contributes to activating the urban ecosystem for climate protection. Three different stakeholder groups are differentiated within the CCC.

O

The adoption of the IEK and the creation of the CCC are closely linked. A crucial point here is that public relations work on the climate protection strategy and the CCC can only begin once the IEK has been officially adopted by the city council. The first step is to involve relevant stakeholders before the actions are presented to the wider public. Following the resolution, a targeted campaign will be launched in order to obtain further, low-threshold commitments from the urban community (Level C - supporters). These actions are planned for the update of the Climate City Agreement in 2026. Further contributions and commitments from other stakeholders (core team, cooperation partners) are also expected.

# 3. Evaluation and monitoring

As part of the further development of the monitoring and controlling concept of the City of Dresden, a set of indicators is being developed that enables a continuous and concrete review of the development of individual areas and is based on the indicators of the CCC and goes beyond the previous GHG inventory. The energy and GHG inventory already provides important indicators, especially when broken down into the commercial, industrial and private household sectors. This enables a detailed analysis of developments per consumer group, but must be further developed to include additional building blocks for describing green house gas neutrality in terms of the territorial principle. In the IEK, this topic is already described in the "Monitoring and controlling" package of measures. It states that monitoring and controlling must above all be systematised and transformed into a clear, continuous and consistent process. The indicators are updated annually together with the preparation of the GHG inventory and other monitoring and reporting instruments (e.g. resolution controls). This also includes digitising the monitoring of measures using a web-based climate protection platform.

# 4. Transparency

Transparency of climate protection measures and their effectiveness is an important tool for increasing knowledge about and acceptance of climate protection measures. The City of Dresden is already working with various digital tools to make the effects of climate change (heavy rainfall) visible to the public in the city's digital city map. A web-based climate protection platform is intended to present the implementation status of climate protection actions in a low-threshold and transparent manner. This should also have a steering effect and ensure timely readjustment.

# 5. Multi-level governance

The CoD already works with the state and federal government in various forums and at various levels. Specifically, the CoD is active in the German Association of Cities and also in Saxon municipal associations and representative bodies. There is informal cooperation with the other German mission cities via the mission process, with regular jour fixe meetings. The German mission cities appear together under the label "stronGERcities". As a mouthpiece for the EU and federal level, this cooperation between the mission cities is to be stabilised. In addition, Dresden and Leipzig are already exchanging information with the state level on an informal level in order to jointly process experiences and findings from the European city mission process and make them effective for Saxony.

# 6 Learning and capacity building
#

Dresden. Dc2qcu

#

The transformation to a climate-neutral and resilient city of the future is a mammoth task. This requires expertise and knowledge, the search for new solutions and the acquisition of new knowledge about data, impacts, systems, players and new business models. In addition to an internal training programme, which is increasingly focusing on climate protection and climate change adaptation, the City of Dresden is also involved in intensive learning and capacity building as part of various European projects. In the EU project Neutral Path, the City of Dresden is an active partner in the capacity building programme. Through the EnAct4CleanCities pilot project, Dresden is actively exchanging ideas with the other Saxon mission city of Leipzig in order to exchange information on the modalities, challenges and possible solutions in the field of municipal heat planning. An exchange of knowledge with Saxon and international municipalities/cities is also planned as part of this pilot project. Acquired knowledge from the work on climate protection and within the framework of the EU City Mission will also be passed on in exchange with Ukrainian pilot cities as part of the Horizon Europe project U_CAN. These diverse exchange platforms enable extensive learning and adaptation of own solutions and strategies.

# 7 Iteration and further development

The CCC is a living document, just like the framework for action set out in the Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Programme. Once it has been adopted, it will be expanded into a more comprehensive programme of climate protection actions in a permanent process and integrated with the requirements of the CCC. In concrete terms, the iteration of the CCC for 2026 means that only changes compared to the first submission status in September 2024 will be reported. In addition, further commitments will be collected and stakeholders activated for structural urban climate protection work. The aim of the iteration is to enrich the climate protection strategy and the systemic approach through a deeper understanding of the framework conditions and necessary adjustments and to close current gaps.

|  Novaled GmbH | The installation of PV systems on the existing roof areas in the order of 180 kWp by 12/2025 is planned for full self-consumption. A further 136 kWp are to be installed on carports yet to be built as so-called solar carports. After full commissioning, this action will lead to a total reduction of approx. 127 tCO2/a from 2028. GHG savings of at least 5%/year are already being achieved within energy management compared to the average (2020-2023). Compared to the base year 2020, 194 tonnes of CO2 have already been saved in Scope 1 and 2. Further actions have already been taken and are in line with our values. As part of Dresden's industrial landscape, Novaled is committed to supporting the important topic of climate protection as part of sustainability and the associated energy transformation. We have supported the Dresden Sustainability Round Table from the very beginning and have been happy to share our experiences, plans and ideas with the other industrial partners. This network is an important communication forum because we can only accomplish this mammoth task together. As a research institution and leading provider of organic materials developed in-house and innovative technologies for premium OLEDs for displays, luminaires and OSCs, we see it as our duty to not only focus on the performance of the end product right from the start of its life cycle, but also to accompany its manufacturing process from the laboratory specification through to production. We see our responsibility as extending beyond the factory gate and also take this into account in our supply chain. Novaled and our suppliers and business partners are equally committed to protecting the environment and the climate. This is anchored in our Code of Conduct. Natural resources are to be used sparingly and conserved wherever possible. The use and consumption of resources during production and the generation of waste of any kind, including water and energy, must be reduced to the necessary level or avoided. The use of natural resources shall be reduced through practices such as material conservation and substitution, sharing, maintenance, reuse, remanufacturing and recycling or upcycling. In addition, Novaled and its suppliers are committed to the continuous development and use of environmentally and climate-friendly products, processes and technologies. Applicable laws and regulations regarding the prohibition and restriction of certain substances in production must be strictly adhered to, and labelling for recycling and disposal must be carried out.

What we expect of ourselves is therefore passed on to the upstream supply chain and monitored on site - also in an international context
to ensure that our values are adhered to. Our customers have the same expectations of us.

A lot can be done for sustainability, even with small things. We offer our employees the Job Ticket or the Germany Ticket as benefits, but bike leasing is also possible. Anyone who comes to work by bike will not only find a lockable bike garage, but also an air pump and tools for a small repair. There are automatic water dispensers for sparkling water in the tea kitchens, so there is no need for crates of water. Milk alternatives are also available for coffee drinkers. If anything needs to be printed, it is done on recycled paper.

These actions are already in place and therefore do not lead to any further savings.

We have been ISO 14001 certified since May 2024.  |
|  Kommunale Immobilien Dresden GmbH &CO Kg | The various KID properties are home to several bee colonies. In addition, the roof of the Kraftwerk Mitte theatre and the Stadtforum has been greened.
The sedum plants on the theatre building are currently in full bloom and also provide the bees with a new food source.
A green roof converts harmful carbon dioxide into oxygen and binds dust and pollutants from the air. This provides plants and animals with a new habitat and increases biodiversity.
Furthermore, the service life of a roof can be extended by several years because the plants shield it from the heat of the sun and UV rays. This protects the material accordingly.
Another advantage is the sound reflection to the outside and inside. PV systems are already in operation on the roofs of KID properties or are in the planning stage.

|   | In planning: Kulturpalst Dresden approx. 200 kWp PV system on the flat roof of the Kulturpalast consisting of 580 monocrystalline glass-glass modules with black frames,

The new city forum on Ferdinandplatz is currently being completed. Experts are currently installing a large photovoltaic (PV) system consisting of 376 module elements on the roof.

The Stadtforum PV system and the planned Kulturpalast Dresden PV system each produce around 118,628 kilowatt hours of electricity per year, 100 per cent of which is used in the building. This saves around 43.5 kilograms of CO2 per location every year. This corresponds to CO2 emissions of approx. 18,310 litres of petrol burned, 244,100 kilometres driven by car (with a consumption of 7.5 litres per 100 kilometres) and the CO2 binding capacity of 3,470 trees.

|  Theaterpädagogisches Zentrum Sachsen e.V. | The key foundation and driving force behind our work is the promotion of participation. This value includes the promotion and safeguarding of diversity, sustainability and democracy. Participation of all people, regardless of age, gender identity, sexuality, origin, physical characteristics, health or social status, abilities and religion, means taking responsibility for diversity. Securing this in the long term - not only in an ecological sense, but also for society as a whole - is a requirement of sustainability. And democracy is not possible without participation, and participation is inconceivable without the participation of all in the joint shaping of life and society.

In addition to the content-related component of our work, we also pay attention to ecological sustainability. For example, we purchase most of our office materials from the provider MEMO AG, our printed materials are printed almost exclusively on recycled paper in Germany and we use the TeilAuto car-sharing scheme.

We have been a signatory to the Dresden Charter for Sustainability in the Cultural Sector since 2022.

Participation also includes the topics of gender sensitivity and gender equality, which we actively address. As a cultural education institution with a high proportion of collaborations with schools, we follow the recommendations and guidelines of the Saxon State Ministry of Culture when it comes to gender-equitable spelling.

However, we also favour solutions in the area of digitality that ensure participation, require and enable participation, promote self-determination and justice and, last but not least, are transparent and sustainable. The software we use is almost exclusively open source and non-proprietary, available to everyone free of charge, accessible and respects privacy. This applies to the operating systems of our office computers (Linux). This also has the additional effect of saving costs, as there are no expensive licences or fees. This also applies to our digital exchange platform, a managed Nextcloud with a server location in Germany, our website and email hosting, our research software (here, too, the server location is in Germany), the platform for schools and teachers (TaskCards, a Thuringian start-up) and our conference tool, a BigBlueButton instance on the server of the data security initiative "Senfcall".

As transparency, data protection and self-determination are important to us, we only use services that are EU GDPR-compliant and do not have a business model based on the accumulation and use of private data. This is another reason - along with many other more ethical considerations - why we are not represented on social networks such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.  |

|  Ostrale - Zentrum für zeitgenössische Kunst e.V. | Mobility: Our employees, artists, etc. are expressly encouraged to cycle, walk or use public transport such as buses and trains for their daily commute. This not only promotes their health, but also helps to reduce their ecological footprint. For business trips, we place particular emphasis on using the train or bus instead of your own car or plane wherever possible in order to promote a more environmentally friendly and sustainable method of travelling. In this way, we contribute to climate protection and support the transport revolution.

Exhibition logistics: In order to increase efficiency and conserve resources, we prefer to use groupage transport instead of individual private/DHL shipments. Although we endeavour to implement this practice consistently, the use of DHL shipments outside Europe cannot be avoided in every case. Our aim is to reduce the environmental impact and optimise logistics processes by bundling shipments.

Waste and waste water: All employees and visitors to the biennials are required to separate waste conscientiously in order to ensure an effective recycling rate. Organic waste is disposed of in our in-house compost, which not only helps to reduce waste, but also to produce valuable compost for our green spaces. These actions promote the sustainable use of resources and support our efforts to protect the environment and avoid waste.

Sustainable use of resources and building materials: We attach great importance to reusing objects that are no longer suitable for the exhibition. We creatively remodel these objects and give them a second life. A good example of this is old partition walls, which we use to make planters or seating. These actions not only help us to reduce waste, but also significantly extend the useful life of the materials. This is in line with our philosophy of sustainable resource utilisation and promotes the responsible use of our building materials.

Regional procurement: We are increasingly favouring local suppliers over large platforms such as Amazon. We pay particular attention to purchasing materials from the region in order to support the local economy and ensure short transport routes. An outstanding example of this is our long-standing partnership with "Holzmüller Sachsen", which supplies us with high-quality wood and at the same time emphasises our sustainable procurement strategy.

Green infrastructure: As part of our sustainability initiative, we have rainwater collection points on all gutters and small roofs on the site. Our garden is intentionally planted with a variety of crops to promote biodiversity and support sustainable nutrition. These plants are watered exclusively with collected rainwater, which we obtain through our rainwater harvesting systems. In  |

|   | addition, the energy required for irrigation is provided by solar power to further minimise our ecological footprint. In the entrance area of our premises, we have created a bed planted with endangered (red list) plants from our native Elbe meadows. Some of these plants are endangered and important for our local ecosystem diversity and find a protected environment here to develop and flourish. Visitors can discover these special plants and learn about their importance for nature conservation. Education and communication: We organise regular interactive workshops for kindergarten groups, school classes and students in our garden and greenhouse as well as guided tours as part of the biennials, which deal intensively with the topics of sustainability. We also offer special workshops for senior citizens, where they can share, expand and exchange their ecological knowledge with us. These educational initiatives not only promote an understanding of ecological issues among the youngest participants, but also create a valuable platform for intergenerational dialogue and learning from one another. Education and communication: We have set up a comprehensive educational trail on our site, consisting of 11 informative panels. These panels are dedicated to a variety of important topics, including the hedgehog hotel, the importance and promotion of biodiversity, regional diversity and the preservation of old cultivated plants. The educational trail has been designed to familiarise our visitors with these complex and important topics and to raise their awareness of environmental protection and sustainability. Each panel provides detailed information and illustrative examples to promote understanding and interest in nature conservation. We take selected topics of this complex content to the Biennale sites to inform visitors about these important aspects of our natural environment in a vivid and interactive way.  |

|  SG Dynamo Dresden e.V. | SG Dynamo Dresden is clearly committed to sustainability and has adopted a sustainability strategy for this purpose.
At the same time, individual sustainability criteria that are required for the licensing of the respective leagues are being developed and implemented. In this context, the focus is clearly on regional anchoring, i.e. all projects and goals should have a sustainable impact on the city of Dresden and the surrounding area.  |
|  TRICERA energy GmbH | Climate protection and sustainability are of central importance to TRICERA. One of our main focuses is on the materials to be used and the associated resource cycles to make them more sustainable. One of our core strategies is to utilise batteries that are no longer used in their actual application. This includes surplus or discarded 1st-life batteries as well as 2nd-life batteries from the automotive sector, which can continue to be used in stationary applications for many years before they are finally recycled.

If TRICERA nevertheless uses new stationary batteries, the company relies on lithium iron phosphate technology, which makes it possible to dispense with rare earths from crisis regions, as environmental and human rights standards can only be met to a limited extent in such regions.

When selecting products, we endeavour to achieve a high proportion of local value creation and production in the European Union and, above all, in Germany, where they are manufactured by suppliers in accordance with the high applicable environmental protection standards.  |

|   | Consistent qualification of suppliers ensures that production is carried out in accordance with applicable labour and safety standards and that neither child nor forced labour is used.

Even small things can make a big difference. For this reason, TRICERA implements many actions internally in line with its goals. We have actively decided against personal company cars and use the few company cars collectively. If more cars are needed, we use the e-car fleet of car-sharing service providers wherever possible.

We are also mindful of sustainable standards in our consumption. For example, we only buy organic and fair trade products (coffee, cow's milk, oat milk, tea, other drinks) for our employees. In addition, the company only finances vegetarian and vegan meals from regional suppliers for internal and external meetings, whether company celebrations or business meetings. Employees cannot be charged for meals that contain meat from factory farming, for example.  |

As a "very small" association, we can only carry out climate protection actions to a limited extent - within the scope of our possibilities. These are difficult to compare with large cultural players in the city of Dresden. The following actions have been an integral part of our work since the beginning of the association's activities:

T-shirts and clothing for the children involved are sourced from suppliers using organically and fairly produced materials
Sheet music management: the printing of sheet music for teachers and participants must continue to be done conventionally on paper, we reuse the sheet music material after the end of each production (five a year). It is stored, filed in a Musaik sheet music library and reused for future productions. We ensure that we use environmentally friendly and FSC-certified paper.
Instruments: We almost exclusively use donated instruments. We refrain from buying new instruments (if possible). Our instrument repairs and instrument hire are carried out by regional suppliers.
Electronic devices: We pay very close attention to energy efficiency when purchasing new electronic products. Where possible, we avoid buying new equipment and purchase second-hand devices (e.g. "hardware like new")
Transport routes: Short transport routes determine our everyday life and are carried out by a borrowed cargo bike
Catering: When it comes to food for participants and teachers, we pay attention to sustainable organic certification, sensible packaging and regionality
Electricity: We purchase our electricity from electricity providers that work with renewable energies.
Thematic productions: At least once a year, there is a production with a significant theme/area of the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g. water, climate, flight and food)
Employees: We pay attention to fair remuneration and work-life balance for our employees.  |
|  SOLARWATT GmbH | When SOLARWATT was founded in 1993, making an active contribution to climate protection was not only one of our company's main motivations, but ultimately even our business purpose.

|   | For decades, these have been producing environmentally friendly electricity, most of which is also consumed locally. This not only saves enormous amounts of CO2 in power generation, but also means less strain on the entire power grid.

Thanks to smart energy management in the household (the SOLARWATT Manager), we ensure that controllable devices such as air conditioning systems, pool pumps, electric cars or heat pumps only ever consume exactly the energy that is being generated by the solar system. This saves our customers a lot of money and the environment a lot of CO2.

But we don't just want to manufacture environmentally friendly products, we also want to produce them as environmentally friendly as possible. SOLARWATT switched its entire factory to green electricity back in 2017. With energy certification in accordance with ISO 50001, we continue to reduce our ecological footprint from year to year.

In the latest product generation, the production of our SOLARWATT Panel vision photovoltaic modules requires only half the CO2 compared to standard market modules. We take the entire supply chain into account.

SOLARWATT is also committed to sustainable action locally. We support our employees with JobRad and JobTicket, place insect hotels in our green spaces, inform visitor groups of all ages about solar power and sustainability and reward internal suggestions for improvement for less resource consumption and more circular economy.

In the Dresden region, SOLARWATT now has its own consulting and installation team and offers the entire service from production, quotation preparation and system planning to the installation of a photovoltaic system or heat pump solution from a single source.  |

|  VON ARDENNE Holding SE & Co KGaA | Implementation of energy efficiency measures at the Weißig campus from 2024 - 2026. The following actions will be implemented during this period.
Modernisation of process cooling HW18/ HW8 / HW1
Expansion of PV, incl. feed-in and charging stations for cars
Conversion of hall lighting HW1 & HW8 to LED, incl. lighting control
Expansion of metering concept
Optimisation of heat pumps
By implementing the packages of measures 1-8, VON ARDENNE can achieve final energy savings of 1,430,110 kWh/a on the Weißig campus, which corresponds to 43.7% of the baseline. In addition, CO2 savings of 608.59 tonnes per year can be achieved, which corresponds to 48.9% of the baseline. The CO2 saving is higher in percentage terms due to the change in energy source for heating and the favoured emission factor for this. According to DIN276, investment costs totalling €2,255,638 net are estimated for the implementation.
VON ARDENNE has received an approved grant from the Sächsische Aufbaubank for the realisation of the project.
The realisation of the project will be ensured by an investment company of the VON ARDENNE Group - regenery GmbH. With this participation, we could gain many years of expertise in the field of energy consulting and the implementation of energy efficiency projects, especially in the industrial environment. We are also happy to offer this service to all other companies.

|  Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau | Communication & participation:
All areas of action are organised in cooperation between HSE, Facility and Sustainability Coordination. The people in charge regularly take part in networking meetings in the region, such as the IHK-Umwelttreff or DD-Stammtisch "Nachhaltigkeit", for further training and dialogue. At the Climate Neutrality Network, Deutsche Werkstätten works with other companies to learn all about preparing their own GHG inventory.
Internally, the individual departments are specifically sensitised in order to be able to optimally implement targeted actions.

Energy efficiency:
In the area of energy efficiency, Deutsche Werkstätten is focussing on the conscious use of energy. The solar panels on the building enable a proportionate, environmentally friendly consumption of electricity for production and the offices. Consumption is regularly reported and evaluated so that concrete recommendations for action can be made. For example, the production hall is being converted to so-called "intelligent" ceiling lighting - this means that the light is controlled by sensors and only partially. Fundamental attention is being paid to keeping the machinery modern and therefore energy-efficient.

Waste & recycling:
Waste disposal is based on conscientious waste separation, whereby care is taken to feed as much material as possible into recurring recycling loops, such as aluminium and various plastics. Any wood waste is thermally utilised directly on site and used for heating. Cardboard scraps are perforated so that they can be used as filling material for packaging and thus reduce polystyrene consumption.

Mobility:
Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau is building on the increased use of public transport for commuting and business trips. The offer of railcards and the combined DVB job ticket with the Germany ticket are an integral part of more resource-efficient mobility. There is also a widely used range of job bikes.  |

background
The initiative to create a comprehensive sustainability vision and strategy for the United Nations system began at the meeting of the Senior Officials of the United Nations Environment Management Group in 2018 and was reinforced by the Secretary-General's call for increased internal efforts to address climate change. Phase I of the Sustainability Management Strategy, introduced in 2019, concentrated on environmental sustainability in management. Phase II of the Strategy, endorsed in 2021 seeks to implement environmental and social sustainability in United Nations system policies, programming and support functions. UNU-FLORES was involved in the development of the strategy and is dedicated to being a role model for integrating environmental and social sustainability considerations across its work. UNU-FLORES is committed to reducing its environmental footprint and striving for sustainability in all functions and procurement activities within the institute.

procurement
Before requesting a purchase, the purchase's necessity must be carefully considered and discussed with the respective supervisor. Once approved, the requestor is responsible for finding potential suppliers and checking the social and environmental impacts of the product. Providers that are regularly used are listed. Aspects that should be considered, depending on the available information:
Environmental Impact: Evaluate the product's lifecycle footprint from raw materials to disposal.
Resource Efficiency: Choose products that reduce resource use, waste, and energy consumption.
Materials: Opt for materials from renewable or responsibly managed sources.
Emissions Reduction: Select low-emission products and suppliers, e.g., vegan/vegetarian catering.
Social Responsibility: Ensure suppliers practice ethical labour, fair wages, and safe conditions.
Supply Chain Transparency: Verify social and environmental claims through supply chain transparency.  |

|   | - Local Sourcing: Favour local suppliers to cut transportation emissions and support the local economy.
Certification and Standards: Seek certifications or Eco-labels for sustainability verification.
End-of-life: Prefer durable, repairable items and sustainable waste disposal options.
For advice on purchases and suppliers' sustainability efforts, the sustainability focal point of the Institute shall be consulted. When requesting a purchase, information on the sustainability of providers should be mentioned. The following rules apply:
Non-debatable: -
Vegan/vegetarian and organic catering for events
Local drinks and tap water for meetings
No single-use items (e.g., straws, paper cups)
No banners or printed materials used for a single event
No merchandise products branded for single events
Avoid procurement if the item is available for rent
Strongly recommended: -
Local food whenever possible
Local companies for services and procurement
Products made from recycled or upcycled materials
If water bottles are necessary (field trip), a sustainable brand must be used

laptops
UNU-FLORES purchases laptops with the maximum extended warranty period offered by the provider, including incidental damage insurance and worldwide next-business-day support. That way laptops can be used and maintained by the manufacturer until the end-of-life period according to the standards published by UNU's IT. Given frequent travels, the reliability and worldwide coverage of the warranty justify replacing laptops after the extended warranty period expires. Beyond the 5-year period, laptops that are in good shape shall be retained as spare laptops for temporary assignments, for colleagues that work exclusively from within the duty station (e.g., non travels), or as shared computers in meeting rooms. Otherwise, laptops are sold internally or donated to external organisations for a second life. The purchase of modular laptops is explored and supported.  |

|   | 4. travel
aspects to be considered for the travel planning:
From both a sustainability and cost perspective, virtual engagement should be preferred over travelling whenever feasible and effective.
The number of participants required to travel should be minimised.
Selecting the appropriate transport mode can significantly impact travel’s environmental footprint. Efficient and sustainable travel options should be prioritised. Trains should be considered the primary choice whenever possible. For flights, preference should be given to direct routes and economy class over business class. Even if more time or money is needed, choosing a train over a flight should still be considered and discussed with the supervisor.
To raise awareness about the climate impact of travel and facilitate emission compensation data collection, travellers must calculate and complete their CO2 emissions in a provided table. Confirmation of this information in the travel request is mandatory. Travel requests lacking this data will not be approved.  |
|   | 5. waste disposal
UNU-FLORES follows the German system for waste separation. As the respective signs show, the following waste streams are separated in the office:
Paper and Cardboard: This category includes newspapers, magazines, cardboard packaging, and other paper-based materials. Only clean paper should go into that bin - plastic must be removed. Used paper towels and greasy paper belongs to the residual waste.
Packaging Waste: Packaging materials such as plastic, metal, and Tetra Pak cartons are separated and collected for recycling.  |

|   | - Biodegradable Waste / Residual Waste: Due to the limited selection of available waste bins in the building these categories are collected together. This category includes organic waste such as food scraps and compostable materials as well as non-recyclable or residual waste that cannot be sorted into other categories, including used paper towels.
Glass (Glas): Glass is sorted into colour categories: clear glass, green glass, and brown glass. These are collected separately in designated containers. All glass waste must be personally disposed of in one of the numerous glass containers around the city.

CO2 Emissions - Emission Offsetting
UNU-FLORES endeavours to reduce its environmental footprint wherever possible. Emissions that are unavoidable will be offset annually through financial contributions to external decarbonisation efforts. Specifically, the office's energy emissions and those associated with business travel will be offset. The amount allocated and selection of projects will be decided during a management meeting at the beginn  |

With regard to our product portfolio, we are sustainability experts. We give used Airbus passenger aircraft a second life by converting them into cargo aircraft, thereby extending the product life cycle by up to 15 years. Our lightweight panels are not only lightweight, but above all highly optimised for the respective application scenario. They are characterised by material efficiency and therefore contribute directly to the conservation of resources. At the same time, weight-optimised aircraft components result in lower fuel consumption, which in turn leads to lower emissions and thus environmental pollution.

We conduct research into a wide range of circular economy topics and are in constant dialogue with local and international partners.

We are particularly proud of our initiative, which has been in place since 2021, whereby a tree is planted in Saxon forests for every freight tonne converted by EFW. Together with the Forest Foundation, around 2,500 young trees have already been planted. As a company, we are currently preparing for the implementation of CSRD reporting obligations. In this context, the existing voluntary commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (-50% by 2030) is being reviewed and harmonised with the climate protection and sustainability strategy currently being developed.

We greatly appreciate the dialogue with representatives of the City of Dresden on sustainability issues to date, but also see opportunities for further intensification. We look forward to discussing specific topics and projects.  |

Climate protection starts locally and has a global impact. Our electrolysers generate green hydrogen from renewable energies, which replaces fossil fuels such as coal, oil or natural gas. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions and makes a direct contribution to climate protection.
We have been using 100% certified green electricity for our company sites in Dresden since 2022.
We are actively driving forward the energy transition and are committed to strengthening Germany as a centre of technology and business, for example through our membership of associations. This secures and creates new sustainable jobs in the maturing hydrogen economy - in Dresden, Saxony, Germany and Europe.
Dresden is the centre of our research and development activities for the continuous improvement and further development of our innovative electrolysis technologies for the production of renewable hydrogen.  |
|  GlaxoSmithKline Standort Dresden | - 100% of imported electricity is to come from renewable energy sources by 2025.

|  Industrie- und Handelskammer Dresden | The Dresden Chamber of Industry and Commerce is planning to install a photovoltaic system in 2025, which should enable a degree of self-sufficiency of 20 to 40 Percent. The exact size of the system depends on the final decisions of the Dresden Chamber of Industry and Commerce's general assembly. At the same time, the existing vehicle fleet will be converted to e-mobility, for which a corresponding charging infrastructure will be installed on the premises. In addition to our own climate protection measures on the premises, we provide our member companies in Dresden with comprehensive support in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable energies. A particular highlight of our offer is the IHK climate protection coaching programme. In this practice-oriented programme, we work together to develop concrete and tailor-made actions that not only reduce CO2 emissions, but also save costs in the long term. Our aim is to competently support companies in the region on their path to greater sustainability and climate neutrality and to provide them with practical solutions to minimise their ecological footprint.  |
|  DAS Environmental Expert GmbH | Since its foundation, DAS has been supporting companies in the semiconductor industry in their climate protection efforts to dispose of process gases safely and in a climate-friendly manner after their utilisation. It is a matter close to our hearts to decarbonise our product range ourselves and to develop further services for our semiconductor customers to protect the climate.
Of course, our corporate activities themselves should also take another big step towards climate friendliness. We design our infrastructure to save energy and use renewable energies as a source of electricity. We encourage our employees to travel to work by public transport using job tickets or by bicycle. The safe footpath built by the city from the bus stop to the factory gate helps us in this regard, as does the bicycle-friendly nature of the city of Dresden. We now largely dispense with combustion vehicles in our company fleet. We are happy to participate in the development of a climate-friendly mobility concept together with the city of Dresden.
As an environmental company, DAS Environmental Experts GmbH sees itself as part of the community that is committed to climate protection.  |

|  Ev.-Luth. Kirchenbezirk
Dresden Mitte | The climate protection activities of the two Dresden church districts reflect our commitment to the integrity of creation. We are actively contributing to the fight against climate change with a variety of initiatives and are committed to a sustainable energy supply. Each parish examines for itself which actions can be implemented effectively.

**BUILDING AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY:**
Some parishes are already using solar energy (through roof-mounted systems or balcony power plants) or are investigating its use. However, this often poses difficulties due to monument protection regulations.
Energy-saving concepts are mainly implemented in connection with events in the community centres. In particular, actions such as reducing the room temperature, proper ventilation and coordinated room utilisation are used.

**WASTE AND WASTEWATER:**
Waste is consistently separated in most municipalities. At events, drinks from returnable bottles are preferred.

**PROCUREMENT:**
Purchasing according to ecological and social criteria is regulated in the regional church by the 2018 procurement guidelines. Many congregations apply parts of this guideline. Procurement regulations are currently being drawn up in individual congregations with the aim of strengthening or more consistently implementing eco-fair criteria in purchasing.
In addition, recycled paper is used in some municipalities for publication purposes (parish newsletters/church news) or in administrative operations.
Green electricity is also used in some cases.

**EDUCATION:**
Working groups or committees for sustainability are active in ##[number] municipalities. They are committed to the development and implementation of more consistent sustainability and climate protection measures.
In the future, there will also be a climate coordination organisation for the two church districts, which will bundle and effectively coordinate the climate protection efforts of the individual parishes.  |

|   | One of our central events is the Ecumenical Energy Day. This annual event brings together representatives from various parishes, experts and committed parishioners to discuss current developments and innovative solutions in the field of renewable energy for the parishes.
Another key component is the active solar working group. This working group is made up of volunteer members who are intensively involved in the use and promotion of solar energy. The Solar-AG organises regular information events, advises church communities on the planning and installation of solar systems and organises tours of existing solar systems in order to clearly demonstrate their benefits and how they work.

We also support the development of the climate protection concept of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Saxony (EVLKS). In cooperation with other church and external partners, comprehensive actions and targets are being developed to reduce CO2 emissions within the regional church (the EKD Synod adopted a directive for all member churches in 2022 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2035). Particular emphasis is placed on promoting energy efficiency, switching to renewable energies and raising awareness of climate-friendly behaviour among parishioners.  |

As part of a series of workshops, employees from each department have defined their action goals in regular meetings. -Within the company, there is a Green Team consisting of the theatre management and individual department heads, who are currently working on a concept of measures. The sustainability officer of the Saxon State Theatres will take up her duties in mid-October. The Staatsschauspiel Dresden and the Semperoper together form the Saxon State Theatres. We also focus on networking within the city through network meetings and internationally through the Green Theatre Committee of the European Theatre Convention (ETC).
A theatre garden was planted in the inner courtyard of the Schauspielhaus.
Through a pilot project with the ETC and Renew Culture, 3 productions are being monitored this season using the Theatre Green Book under sustainability points and their carbon footprint is being documented.Preamble to the sustainability mission statement of the Staatsschauspiel Dresden:

|   | processes. Sustainability is to be incorporated into the theatre's artistic work as well as becoming a cross-cutting theme throughout the entire company. Staatsschauspiel Dresden's sustainability mission statement is based on the 2030 Agenda, which was agreed by the international community (UN) in 2015 in the form of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Staatsschauspiel considers seven of these goals to be a particular responsibility for its specific sphere of activity: health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, fewer inequalities, sustainable consumption and production, actions to protect the climate and partnerships to achieve the goals. We want to focus on these topics within our company and at the same time think in terms of society as a whole. We understand sustainability holistically - socially, ecologically and economically. On this basis, we will continuously reflect on and systematically improve our actions in a multi-year process. On the way to climate-friendly work at all levels, this paper forms a guideline both for the employees of the Staatsschauspiel Dresden and for guests who work for our theatre. It is also intended to be the basis for collaboration with external partners and a source of inspiration for our audiences. The ETC: ETC is the largest network of publicly funded theatres in Europe with 63 members in 31 countries. They organise a wide range of activities to create brilliant new theatre, support and promote theatre makers and fight for the European theatre sector in a political context. These activities are open to member theatres, theatre makers, artists across the continent and the theatre-going public. Green Theatre Committee of the ETC: The Green Theatre Committee is working to become a climate-neutral network by 2030. Founded in 2021, the Green Theatre Committee is made up of experts from the ETC network (including Joachim Klement, Staatsschauspiel Dresden) and external experts and contributes to the development of knowledge, analyses and guidelines on sustainability. It plays a key role in realising the ETC's ambitious goal of becoming a climate-neutral network by 2030, as set out in the ETC Sustainability Action Code. An important step in this sustainability journey is the creation of the ETC Theatre Green Book, a collaboration between ETC, Renew Culture and the renowned Theatre Green Book initiative. The ETC Theatre Green Book is a new version of the tool that guides theatres step by step towards net zero emissions - for their productions, buildings and operations. The ETC Theatre Green Book was tested and refined in the 2023/24 season by 9 ETC theatres from 7 countries. These "Focus Group" theatres were:  |

|  Veolia Umweltservice Ost GmbH | Dear Sir or Madam, In the following text, we explain our desire and actions within the framework of a desired cooperation on the Dresden Climate City Agreement. At present, Veolia does not yet have a partnership with the city of Dresden that is explicitly dedicated to climate protection, but we would like to accompany the city of Dresden in its efforts towards climate neutrality as a partner. At a global level, we at Veolia, including our German subsidiaries, have committed to reducing our direct and indirect emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 50% and Scope 3 emissions by 30% by 2032. Our long-term goal is to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, which includes reducing greenhouse gases by 90% and offsetting the remaining emissions. In Germany and Europe, we are focussing on phasing out coal-fired power generation by 2030 and investing EUR 1.6 billion in renewable energies and energy efficiency measures across the Group. Further steps include reducing emissions in our waste management and increasing the share of renewable energies. The global and Germany-wide targets are being implemented at the locations with different actions. In Dresden, our focus is primarily on helping our customers to achieve their sustainability goals. We support our customers in contributing to the circular economy with the recycling of various material flows and help them to utilise their maximum potential through training. Furthermore, we are currently not only a waste disposal partner of SG Dynamo Dresden, but are also working on their carbon footprint in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. The aim is to map the CO2 footprint for the year 2023, recognise reduction potential and jointly define actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The aim is for this to result in similar regional commitments.  |

|   | We also benefit from the actions of other Veolia sites in Germany and from the nationwide targets. For example, we are implementing a strategy at Group level in Germany to build photovoltaic systems on our buildings that we use ourselves in order to reduce our Scope 2 emissions. The first expansion stage of the PV system in Lengede has already been successfully completed and is expected to produce around 1 gigawatt hour of electricity per year. We primarily use this electricity ourselves and feed surplus energy into the public grid.

Throughout Germany, we are pursuing the goal of making our own electricity production increasingly climate-neutral. For new buildings, we are planning appropriate roof areas for PV systems and are also considering the installation of ground-mounted photovoltaic systems. Our nationwide ambitions can be measured by a certified energy management system in accordance with DIN EN ISO 50001:2011, which covers 94 per cent of our business activities. This system ensures a continuous reduction in energy consumption and an increase in energy efficiency in order to actively contribute to climate protection.

With our subsidiary ÖKOTEC Energiemanagement, we specialise in energy efficiency and climate protection measures. With the further development of the energy efficiency software EnEffCo® and our "Energy Self Sufficiency" programme, we achieved a self-sufficiency rate of 37 Percent from renewable energies in 2023. "We also answer our customers' questions about how much CO2 is produced by the disposal and recycling of their waste. Precise emission values are not only important for optimising a company's carbon footprint - they are also part of the statutory reporting obligations of many companies, and the trend is rising. The Veolia ECO2CHECK, a specially created tool for calculating emissions, creates full transparency and sustainable prospects. This is part of our campaign "Co2untdown - Less is more. Achieving emission targets with Veolia", with which we offer our customers targeted and results-oriented services in the field of decarbonisation in the areas of waste management, water and energy.

We are working to actively protect and promote biodiversity at our sites. We have set ourselves the goal of ending the use of pesticides by 2027. Similarly, all sites with more than one hectare of green space are to complete a charter for green space management, in which concrete actions for the protection and promotion of the diversity of habitats and species are agreed. This goes hand in hand with our comprehensive education and training strategy to reinforce our commitment to sustainability and compliance. Our internal Veolia Learning platform offers a wide range of training courses, both globally and specifically tailored to local needs.  |

|   | A training catalogue accessible online bundles important offerings, including courses on compliance, data protection and sustainability. In addition, individual topics, e.g. with content and tips on ecological management of green spaces at locations, are shared specifically with our locations.

In our annual employee appraisals, we identify individual training needs and create customised training plans. We prioritise and measure our progress as a company by the average number of training hours per employee.

At Veolia, we are passionate about promoting sustainable technologies through active research and development. An outstanding example of this is our Pontes Pabuli cooperation project, which is led by Veolia Klärschlammverwertung Deutschland and supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. This project focuses on the recovery of phosphorus from sewage sludge ash with the aim of converting it into high-quality fertiliser granules. The effectiveness of these granules is being carefully tested both in greenhouses and in field trials.

We see ourselves as a reliable partner for the city of Dresden and the region and are delighted to be making a contribution to the Climate City Agreement.

|  tjg. theater junge generation | The tjg. theatre junge generation has been working on climate protection for many years and has already implemented many actions in full and some in part.

No concrete goals have been formulated to date, as we are trying to improve sustainability wherever we can do so independently as an organisational unit of the City of Dresden.

In terms of mobility, the first step towards an emission-free fleet has already been taken, as 2 of the 6 vehicles now have an electric drive, meaning that the majority of inner-city journeys can be made electrically. In addition, an electric cargo bike was purchased several years ago and another is being planned. There is also a desire among employees for a bicycle parking garage so that they can also park high-quality bicycles with a clear conscience and thus motivate more colleagues to cycle to work. The use of public transport is already prioritised for  |

The reuse of props, costumes and set parts has also long been standard practice. The expansion of the costume and furniture stock (in particular air-conditioned rooms for better durability) has been partially implemented. Cooperation with other theatres for the exchange of materials and decorative elements is currently underway. There are still legal hurdles to overcome in terms of product and producer liability. Thanks to good cooperation with our landlord (KID), we succeeded last year in removing all the pebbles from the flat roofs of Kraftwerk Mitte and installing a green roof instead. There is also an attempt to extend the green roof with potted plants.
An important aspect of the tjg's work is education. We mainly work for or with young people. In our theatre academy, we work directly with children and young people and implement various projects and workshops that deal with sustainability, diversity and inclusion, among other things. There are also working groups on all three topics at the theatre, which collect ideas and initiate various changes.
For example, a process for better waste separation was launched and a project for a more sustainable diet was implemented in collaboration with our canteen operator.
In addition, there was a full workshop day for all tjg. employees in 2022, which focussed on the topics of communication, sustainability and diversity.
In our workshop, we traditionally work with polystyrene for sculptures. As this material is extremely environmentally unfriendly, we have been in contact with various institutions for some time to look for an alternative. The first results have been published by the Landesbühnen Sachsen and the TU Dresden in collaboration with the Munich Residenztheater.  |

## 6.1.1 Statistics on the submitted commitments:

In order to provide a quick overview of the submitted commitments, the following diagrams have been added to the tables above. These show the distribution of the cooperation partners across the area of activity and legal form, as well as the type of climate protection declaration and the areas of action addressed by their own actions (multiple answers possible).

It can be seen that the companies and organisations that participate in the CCC with their commitment and support the city's climate protection efforts cover a wide range of activities.
