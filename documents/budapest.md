# Summary

The world is at a crossroads, where the actions taken in the next few years can have lasting impacts on our future. Global warming is accelerating at an alarming rate, with the global average nearing 1,2°C¹ increase compared to pre-industrial levels. To curb further warming, the Paris Agreement was adopted at the COP21 in 2015, with the goal to keep the global average annual temperature increase below 2°C above pre-industrial levels - an increase that could trigger irreversible processes - with efforts to limit the increase to 1,5°C. For the world to be able to decelerate global warming, however, it is imperative that everyone takes responsibility for combating climate change and contributes to the mitigation of carbon emissions.

The European Commission launched its 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 Mission with the aim of enabling participating cities to act as innovation hubs for pursuing climate neutrality and to empower all European cities to follow suit by 2050. The project focuses particularly on cities as they are responsible for more than 70% of global emissions and are home to 75% of EU citizens.

Out of the 100 EU and 12 additional pioneering cities, Budapest is one of the largest, which puts it in a prime position to spearhead climate action. The capital, being the economic, scientific, cultural and transport centre of Hungary, also serves as an example for other Hungarian cities to follow, highlighting the importance of Budapest's climate-neutrality ambition. The purpose of this Action Plan is to lay the groundwork for realizing this ambition and outline the path to a carbon-free Budapest.

The document starts with an overview of the context the city operates in with both barriers and opportunities considered. It includes a greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory and policy analysis, followed by a stakeholder mapping that describes the starting point of the city towards climate neutrality and provides the basis for the impact pathways and actions needed to mitigate emissions. The project portfolio builds on strategic documents such as the city's Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) and Integrated Urban Development Strategy (IUDS) which serve in general four main objectives:

Reducing transport need through sustainable and smart city design and developments, and by promoting affordable housing
Electrifying public transport and providing comprehensive support for active mobility to promote climate-friendly means of transport
Increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and accelerating the use of renewables in urban areas, with a special focus on residential homes
Enhancing climate dialogue with key stakeholders, such as businesses, districts and the government.

To support the implementation of the action portfolio, governance and social innovation tools were gathered that respond to the specific barriers and opportunities of the city and that can be scaled up and used to accelerate the transition.

The Action Plan was developed together with local ecosystem members, paying special focus to involving private companies and civil organisations, who have a considerable influence on awareness-raising, mobilizing residents and encouraging green investments.

The document builds on the Commitments document and establishes the basis for the Investment Plan. It is developed through an iterative process and will be reviewed and modified biannually to account for missing sectors and to respond to the changes in the political, social, economic, and technological aspects of the city's ecosystem.

# 1 Introduction

## Budapest in context

Budapest, the capital of Hungary, is the country's most populous city with the highest population density. It is home to over 1,7 million people and is a key political centre with many decision-making and administrative functions based here. Its economy is dominated by the pharmaceutical, chemical, gas, and oil industries, with the service sector also being a major contributor. Additionally, Budapest plays a leading role in education, research, and development, and has a population with relatively high income and education levels compared to the country's average, providing favourable conditions to pioneer climate action.

As a major transport and economic hub, Budapest grapples with significant environmental pressures. The city is the centre of a radial system of railways and roads and the country's international airport is located there. The extensive space required for traffic and parked cars, as well as the high proportion of paved surfaces, hinders efforts to mitigate GHG emissions in the city. Moreover, due to COVID and growing suburbanization, the modal split has changed, i.e. the proportion of public transport, cycling, walking, and individual transport has also shifted in favour of private car use.

The large number of old and non-energy efficient, obsolete buildings as well as the capital's disorderly rental housing system also contributes to the growing environmental pressure on Budapest. Since the end of communism in 1989, there has been a notable rise in private homeownership, a trend that continues to this day. Subsequently, the number of social rented housing units owned by the municipality is low, and few new rented housing units have been built recently. In the private rental sector, rent in Budapest is nearly one and a half times the national average. As housing prices rise, a growing number of households find it unaffordable to live in the capital and decide to move outside the city, fuelling suburbanization. As a result, commuting and motorization are increasing, causing transport difficulties, and further escalating environmental pressures in Budapest. Meanwhile, the rapidly expanding suburban towns face infrastructure and supply problems and social tension due to their fast growth.

The city's dual self-government system, wherein the Municipality of Budapest coexists with the independent local governments of the city's 23 districts, adds another layer of complexity to the provision of infrastructure and public services. Despite belonging to the same geographical entity, Budapest and its metropolitan districts function independently from an administrative standpoint, further complicating coordination and optimization efforts.

Additionally, the capital's heavy reliance on fossil fuels impedes the city's ability to mitigate GHG emissions. Domestic electricity production is largely based on hydrocarbons, with the share of renewable energy sources remaining low despite the city's favourable characteristics for harvesting solar and geothermal energy. Due to these factors, Budapest faces several environmental challenges including extreme heat waves, long droughts, and flash floods, which pose serious health and economic risks to the city and its residents.

As climate change is affecting all of us and a shift is inevitable, staying passive and bearing the consequences is not an option – we need to fundamentally transform the way our city operates.

# Budapest's climate neutrality target and scope

To start out on this journey, in 2008, the Municipality of Budapest joined the Covenant of Mayors and prepared Budapest's Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP), in which the city aimed to reduce CO₂ emissions by at least 21% by 2020. After the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, Budapest also joined the Under 2 Coalition, which aims to keep global warming below 2°C and greenhouse gas emissions below 2 tonnes per capita per year by 2050. By signing the Memorandum of Understanding, Budapest has also committed to reduce its GHG emissions by at least 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels or to reduce local GHG emissions to less than 2 tonnes per capita per year by 2050. With the submission of the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) in 2022, Budapest committed to a 40% reduction in CO₂ emissions by 2030 compared to the 2015 base year.

To raise this ambition and accelerate the transition towards climate neutrality, in 2022 Budapest applied to the European Commission's 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 Mission and by joining the Mission committed to preparing the city's Climate City Contract (CCC) together with its local stakeholders. The aim of the CCC Action Plan is to build on the measures of the SECAP to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, i.e. to define the actions necessary to achieve a net 100% emission reduction in Budapest. Besides the SECAP, the CCC Action Plan was prepared in line with the city's other environmental and developmental concepts and action plans. Its strategic objectives reflect them and include:

Reducing transport need through sustainable and smart city design and developments, and by promoting affordable housing
Electrifying public transport and providing comprehensive support for active mobility to promote climate-friendly means of transport
Increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and accelerating the use of renewables in urban areas, with a special focus on residential homes
Enhancing climate dialogue with key stakeholders, such as businesses, districts and the government.

Budapest's 2030 climate neutrality target covers the entire administrative territory of the city. However, in terms of emission sources, exclusion areas include Emission Trading System (ETS) participants, aviation, national railways (suburban trains are included), coaches and water-borne transportation due to the complexity of data collection. In terms of GHGs, only CO₂ emissions are accounted for currently. Future iterations will attempt to address these gaps and provide a more accurate emission inventory for the city.

# Work process of developing the Action Plan

Budapest has a long history of environmentally conscious city operations and has been building a strong mandate for climate protection since 2008. It has developed various strategies and programmes to set strategic objectives and directions for urban development. In 2019, the newly elected City Council pledged to build a green, opportunity-rich, and democratically functioning city. Affirming its vision, the city has identified three strategic pillars, including creating a green Budapest, integrating climate protection into the municipality's operation.

The City's three main pillars:

Empowering Budapest: ensuring affordable housing for all segments of society, improving the health and living conditions of the people of Budapest.

The transition of Budapest towards a climate-neutral future is a complex challenge, however, that requires stakeholders from the entire local ecosystem to collaborate. The Action Plan was developed by the Mission Team, an internal core group of people within the Municipality supported by the Mission Group – a governance structure involving the Municipality, private and public companies, academia, and the civil sector. A more detailed description of the work of the City's Mission Team and Mission Group can be found in Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions.

The process began with onboarding important stakeholders and mobilizing the Mission Group. This was followed by an extensive data collection process to understand the systems the city operates in. Data about the environmental status of Budapest has been gathered every year since 2011 and used for the Environmental Status Assessment Report, which not only provides the public with professional and reliable information on the trends that emerge year by year, but also forms the basis for the next period of Budapest's environmental programme, and for the development of other environmental strategies and measures. For the creation of the CCC, additional data was collected through the Economic Model process.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

For designing the action portfolio, Mission Group members were consulted, and existing strategic documents were reviewed to ensure the CCC aligns with the city's and its actors' key strategic objectives and builds on actions already in progress. Special attention was paid to involving private companies, civil organizations and research hubs in the process as they play a key part in providing expertise across various sectors of urban systems, awareness-raising, mobilizing residents and encouraging green investments. The Municipality has organised several workshops for them to collect their input, develop rapport and engage them in the Mission.

Not part of the team but still key in enabling the transition are citizens that the city government – supported by the Mission Group – informs and mobilizes. A particularly important aim of the city leadership is to actively include citizens in decision-making and planning processes. For this reason, the Municipality of Budapest has multiple deliberation initiatives and participatory processes encouraging citizens to share their ideas and make decisions regarding climate mitigation and adaptation actions. Initiatives since 2020 have included:

Community planning of the parks in Budapest: The design and development of Budapest's parks are done through community planning, whereby the public can share their opinions through a consultation procedure, and a questionnaire.
Citizen assemblies: In September 2020 Budapest held its first citizen assembly, whereby a group of randomly chosen local residents gathered at the Budapest City Hall to discuss the issue of climate change and propose solutions to tackle it. Since then, a citizen assembly was held on the topic of Budapest in Europe, and air pollution from transport as well.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Participatory budgeting: The citizens of Budapest can decide on the allocation of 1 billion Forints annually. One of the categories where people can send in their ideas is called Green Budapest, giving green projects priority in the process.
Citizen involvement in traffic calming projects: Instead of immediate, expensive and permanent interventions, the Municipality of Budapest tested traffic calming ideas with temporary solutions in a series of pilot projects, giving the city's residents time to get used to and evaluate their effects. After a trial period of a few months, the Municipality asked residents for their opinions and suggestions.
Renewal of the Civil Regulation of the Municipality of Budapest: The new regulation, which was adopted in 2021, makes it easier for civil society organisations to be involved in the decision-making processes of the capital and facilitates dialogue with the relevant professional units of the City Hall.

## Outlook and iterations

The Action Plan builds on the Commitments document and establishes the basis for the Investment Plan. It is an iterative document that will be reviewed and modified biannually to account for missing data and sectors and to respond to the changes in the political, social, economic, and technological aspects of the environment. Stakeholder engagement activity started as part of the CCC process will continue with the hopes of mobilizing more private, public and civil actors to find synergies, build rapport, and strengthen the city's commitment to climate neutrality.

GHG Emissions Baseline inventory

The total volume of energy used was 28 611 223 MWh and the volume of related $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalent emission was 6 351 443 tons in Budapest in the base year of 2022. The inventory covers the entire administrative boundary of the city. Exclusion areas include ETS participants, aviation, national railways (suburban trains are included), coaches and water-borne transportation due to the complexity of data collection. In terms of GHGs, only $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions are accounted for currently. Future iterations will attempt to address these gaps and provide a more accurate picture of the emissions in the city.

For the establishment of the inventory, the Economic Model was used. Due to the nature of the model, municipal waste is all shown under Scope 3 and Electricity is shown as a separate emission source. Budapest's SECAP and the inventory uploaded to MyCovenant are structured differently, and the amount of electricity used for buildings, transport and others, along with their related emissions can be seen separately there.

The establishment of the GHG inventory was preceded by extensive data collection from the SECAP, municipally owned utility companies (Budapest Public Utilities, BKK Centre for Budapest Transport), the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, and HungaroMet (Hungarian Meteorological Service). As most data was available in 2022, it was chosen as the baseline year of the inventory.

For the Action Plan, the BAU scenario is used to define the emission gap. The Economic Model utilizes a number of assumptions for the establishment of the BAU inventory. Some of the assumptions include:

Transportation need assumed to increase at the same rate as the expected population increase
ICE improvements (incl. hybrids) for new vehicles according to EU fleet-wide targets
Increased efficiency of ICE buses as the bus fleet is replaced by Euro VI buses (100% by 2030)
The total building stock is assumed to increase at the same rate as the population growth
Renovation rate continues its current trend
Total electricity demand until 2030 assumed to increase at the same rate as the expected population increase
The total amount of waste collected is assumed to increase at the same rate as the expected population increase
Packaging materials are assumed to reach at a minimum EU's recycling targets for packaging waste by 2030

# Buildings and heating

Based on the inventory, the largest portion of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions can be linked to the heating of buildings, representing 43% of total emissions. Within buildings, the consumption of residential homes is responsible for the largest portion of emissions, due to the high proportion of obsolete buildings, and residents' high energy consumption as a consequence of artificially low utility prices.

According to data for the year 2022⁷, 28% of dwellings in Budapest are heated by district heating, with the number of district-heated dwellings increasing by 10,6% in 11 years. Among dwellings using local heating, 89% rely exclusively on natural gas, while the share of those heated by electricity is only 7%. Wood heating accounts for 2%, with the number of wood-only households decreasing considerably in recent years.⁸

According to a survey⁹ conducted among 2000 owner-occupied households in 2023, 70-80% of the respondents were not considering any type of intervention (be it energy-related or not) even if they had enough money. Contrary to expectations, even changes in the energy price structure at the end of 2022 seem to have had a low impact on renovation assumptions. The explanation lies in the way the new price structure was implemented. Family houses have been much more affected by the gas price increase (most probably due to their larger floor area and external envelope), but most of the housing stock (about 80%) in Budapest consists of multi-family apartment buildings, the residents of which did not experience substantial change in their costs for gas in the 2022/2023 heating season. As a result, they were not encouraged to implement energy-efficient interventions to reduce costs. This underlies the importance of resident incentives, awareness-raising and technical as well as managerial help when it comes to renovations and energy efficiency interventions.

# Electricity

Electricity is the second largest emission source in Budapest, being responsible for 26% of total emissions. The amount of electricity transmitted in Budapest in 2022 was 7,12 million MWh, 2,8% higher than in 2021 and 5,4% higher than in 2015.¹⁰ This number is expected to grow as electrification increases.

A significant share (34%) of domestic electricity generation relies on hydrocarbons, while nuclear energy and renewables account for 43% and 22% of electricity generation, respectively.

The electricity network covers the entire area of Budapest so that the supply to consumers can be considered as practically complete; they also have reserves to meet demand. These reserves are complemented by local electricity generating installations, which include small power plants with an installed capacity of between 500 kW and 5 MW (15-20 units), gas-fired power generation units (5-10 units) and small household-scale power plants, including solar and wind power (around 200 units).¹¹

# Transport

The third largest emitter is transport, accounting for 25% of total emissions. This is partly due to the growing suburbanization of Budapest, which has led to the rise of daily trips across the city boundary as

people move to the metropolitan area while jobs, schools, institutions and other travel destinations remain in the capital. About 1,2 million people cross the border of Budapest in both directions every day, of which 202 000 travel on the high-speed railway lines, 47 000 on local railways, 198 000 on intercity buses, and 755 000 by car.¹² This means that almost two-thirds of commuter traffic happen by car.

The modal split data within the capital show a more favourable picture. Active mobility modes (walking, cycling) and public transport dominate intra-city transport. About 2300 public transport vehicles depart every day, carrying approximately 3,3 million passengers to 4631 stops across the city. Trams on lines 4 and 6 alone, which are among the busiest tram lines in Europe, are used 330-350 000 times on an average working day.¹³

Besides public transport, cycling is becoming an increasingly prominent mode of transport thanks to the complex cycle-friendly improvements to the capital's main cycling network. The city also has a public bike-sharing system, better known as MOL Bubi, that has been operating, expanding, and developing for a decade now. In 2023, passengers used the system more than 3,4 million times and travelled 7 million kilometres, according to the BKK Centre for Budapest Transport.¹⁴ The number of pick-up points exceeded 200, 400 new bicycles were added, and tens of thousands of new users joined the system.

In addition to MOL Bubi, a number of community-based bike-sharing and other micro-mobility services have emerged in Budapest in recent years (Donkey Republic, Lime, Bird, Tier, etc). The capital is also seeing a steady expansion of car-sharing services. The scheme was launched in 2016 with electric vehicles from GreenGo Kia, followed by MOL-Limo and Share Now (currently WIGO) in 2018.

Despite these improvements, road traffic still accounts for 35%¹⁵ of intra-city trips, weakening the city's liveability and causing conflicts over public space due to the need for parking space. While there are a number of initiatives to stop motorization, the number of passenger cars in the capital has been rising steadily since 2013, with a pre-pandemic increase of around 2-4% per year.¹⁶ From 2020 onwards this intense growth has slowed down but did not stop. Although the number of electric and hybrid vehicles has been continuously growing, they still account for a small portion of passenger vehicles, ultimately leading to high emissions from transport.

# Waste

From 1st July 2023, the concession company, MOHU took over the municipal waste management services for solid waste in Hungary by law. Over the next 35 years, MOHU will be responsible for providing domestic waste management services including the handling and treatment of waste as well as undertaking related investments.

Despite significant infrastructure improvements in the area of selective waste collection over the past decades (e.g. door-to-door service provided by Budapest), the proportion of recyclable waste collected has stagnated at an unsatisfactory 10-20% across various waste fractions and most of the municipal waste collected in Budapest still ends up in landfill or is incinerated.¹⁷ To address this issue and reduce emissions from waste management, the current wasteful lifestyle of society ("buy - use - throw away - buy new") needs to be replaced by a more-conscious, circular approach to material use.

# Others

Emissions from IPPU and AFOLU are negligible, accounting for less than 1% of total emissions.

## 2.2 Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

The highest body of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed in June 1992, is the Conference of the Parties (COP), which is held annually. The third COP adopted an additional protocol to the Convention in Kyoto in 1997, in which Hungary committed to a 6% reduction compared to its average emissions in the period 1985-1987. At the COP21 in Paris in 2015, a new global climate agreement (Paris Agreement) was concluded. The main target of the agreement is to keep the global average annual temperature increase well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5°C.

On the national level, the primary domestic policy document on climate change is the Second National Climate Change Strategy, which has two main objectives: 'sustainable development in a changing world' and 'understanding our capabilities, opportunities and constraints'.

The strategy identifies four thematic sub-objectives:

Decarbonisation (low carbon economy, reducing GHG emissions, promoting carbon sinks).
Climate vulnerability assessment (spatial data system to support decision-making and planning).
Adaptation and preparedness (resource conservation, resilience building).
Climate partnership (partnerships, awareness-raising, leading by example).

Closely related to the Second National Climate Change Strategy is the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), whose key objective is to promote energy sovereignty, strengthen energy security, maintain energy price subsidies, and the decarbonisation of energy production, which – according to the NECP – is deemed possible through a combination of nuclear energy and renewable energy sources. As a priority of energy policy, the strategy identifies the need to reduce energy import dependency, and as a strategic objective, aims to decrease the share of natural gas in the energy mix. Additionally, energy independence is sought to be realised through demand reduction and energy

efficiency improvements, diversification and use of alternative energy sources, and electrification measures.

The national objective is to ensure that the largest share of Hungary's electricity generation comes from two sources: nuclear and renewable energy, the renewables mainly from solar power plants. With the combination of solar and nuclear energy,  $90\%$  of Hungary's electricity production could be carbon-free by 2030. While the two national policies are in line with global targets, the commitments made are not followed up by meaningful climate action as opposed to Budapest, where climate protection has been made one of the key pillars of the Municipality's work.

In support of global goals, national strategies and local climate objectives, Budapest has joined international initiatives aiming to support taking actions to combat climate change and achieve climate neutrality. To start out on this journey, in 2008, the Municipality of Budapest joined the Covenant of Mayors and prepared Budapest's Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP), in which the city aimed to reduce  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions by at least  $21\%$  by 2020. After the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, Budapest also joined the Under 2 Coalition, which aims to keep global warming below  $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and greenhouse gas emissions below 2 tonnes per capita per year by 2050. By signing the Memorandum of Understanding, Budapest has also committed to reduce its GHG emissions by at least  $80\%$  by 2050 compared to 1990 levels or to reduce local GHG emissions to less than 2 tonnes per capita per year by 2050.

Beyond the international initiatives and national strategies, the Municipality developed its comprehensive, horizontal strategic planning document as well. Budapest's Environmental Protection Programme for the period 2021-2026 aims to protect and improve the environment of the capital and,

ensure that sustainability aspects are considered in the development of the city. The programme outlines 5 main objectives¹⁸:

Ensuring a healthy, safe environment, which means managing natural resources (soil, water, air) with as little environmental impact as possible and improving climate resilience.
Protecting the city's natural assets, including halting the loss of biodiversity and maintaining the quality of natural assets.
Creating sustainable resource management, whereby optimizing the city's management and operations would enhance well-being while also reducing carbon emissions and negative impacts on the environment.
Implementing environmentally friendly governance to ensure that the decisions of the Municipality are guided by environmental considerations.
Enhancing environmental awareness to promote sustainable consumption habits and environmentally conscious attitudes.

In line with the Environmental Protection Programme, several sector-specific strategies were developed including Budapest's Green Infrastructure Development and Maintenance Action Plan, SUMP, and Noise Attenuation Action Plan. These relate and contribute to the city's climate-neutrality ambition by outlining tasks necessary to mitigate carbon emissions by either improving urban green infrastructure or promoting environmentally friendly transport modes and reducing traffic. The city's urban development documents, the Budapest 2030 Long-Term Urban Development Concept, and the Integrated Urban Development Strategy 2027, as well as other urban planning instruments also include climate protection and energy efficiency in their objectives. Because of the city's dual self-government system, the 23 districts of the capital also have their own green, climate strategies, SEAPs/SECAPs, development concepts and regulations.

Up until now, the city's main emission reduction document had been the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan of Budapest, in which the city committed to a 40% reduction in CO₂ emissions by 2030 compared to the 2015 base year. The cornerstones of the plan were that:

Major energy refurbishment is realized in 1/3 of the apartments in Budapest,
the total photovoltaic capacity in Budapest increases to 1 500 MW,
district heating uses at least 50% renewable energy, 50% waste heat, 75% cogenerated heat or 50% of a combination of such energy and heat,
the proportion of car users is reduced at least to 30%,
the per capita size of green areas grows by 1m²,
the size of protected natural areas of local importance grows by 350 ha.

The aim of the CCC is to build on the measures of the SECAP to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, i.e. to define the actions necessary to achieve a net 100% emission reduction in Budapest. The CCC was prepared in line with the Budapest Environmental Programme and the other environmental and development concepts and action plans of the capital. The strategic documents are, therefore, included in the calculation of the emission gap addressed in this action plan.

## 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

To have a clear and more complex picture of the starting point of Budapest, different challenges, and opportunities of the urban systems relevant to the city's climate neutrality target were considered. Barriers and opportunities have been collected before in different strategic documents such as the SECAP, the SUMP and the Environmental Status Assessment Report in Budapest. The section below summarizes the key findings of these documents and describes the inputs from our Mission Group discussions. An overview of the emission domain and system-specific barriers and opportunities can be found in the Annexes.

## General barriers to achieving climate neutrality in Budapest:

### High degree of fragmentation

Arguably, one of the biggest hindering factors in the transition to climate neutrality in Budapest is the high degree of vertical and horizontal fragmentation of competences within the city.

As Budapest has been governed by the political opposition since 2019, achieving coordination and cooperation poses some challenges between the Municipality and the Government of Hungary. The political conflict and the reluctance to work together on the shared concern of climate change can not only set back long-term planning, jeopardize funding, and slow down implementation but can also lead to conflicting measures within the city. Therefore, it would be crucial that climate and environment protection is not politicized to facilitate effective and collective action against climate change.

Fragmentation is also visible horizontally, which can be attributed to the legal, institutional, and regulatory context not supporting sensible cooperation between actors. This is most vividly illustrated by the inefficient coordination of urban and peri-urban transportation institutions in Budapest, whereby public transport in the city is managed by the municipality-owned BKK Centre for Budapest Transport, while the railway, suburban train, and long-distance bus networks in and around Budapest are managed by the state-owned organization, MÁV-VOLÁN. The coexistence of the two institutions leads to the inevitable duplication of some services, hinders modern development, and causes operational problems.

Horizontal fragmentation is also brought about by the dual self-government system in Budapest, wherein the Municipality of Budapest coexists with the independent local governments of the city's 23 districts. This means that the General Assembly of Budapest and the district bodies of representatives are equal in terms of their basic rights, with no hierarchic relationship between them. While a division of labour has emerged between the capital and the district governments, due to the lack of hierarchy, it is hard to implement city-wide initiatives. The Municipality of Budapest can make suggestions and requests when it comes to, for example, new constructions or interventions planned on district-owned grounds, however, districts have the authority to decline them. Collaboration is particularly difficult with districts led by the political opposition, who can veto any projects planned on district-owned grounds. Subsequently, for the complete implementation of the Action Plan, it is crucial that the support of district municipalities is secured.

## Regulatory framework

Besides the lack of cooperation between some district governments and the Municipality of Budapest, another significant challenge arising from the dual self-government system of Budapest regarding
BUDAPEST

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

climate neutrality is the co-existence of different regulations and strategies across the city. Counting all regulations including the Building Code Regulations of the districts, the specific rules on visual environment of settlements, and the Townscape Image Handbook (TIH), we arrive at over 100 distinct regulations in Budapest solely concerning buildings. Similar fragmentation exists with regard to regulations on taxation of buildings and motor vehicles, as well as in the powers to regulate or act as public authority - in matters such as trees and use of environment or public spaces, housing matters, parking by locals -, while a great part of legislative and official power relevant to mitigation and adaptation is held by central government itself. This is a significant obstacle to implementing city-wide initiatives and makes planning extremely unpredictable.

A concrete example that accurately illustrates the problem of multiple, non-universal regulations across districts is the regulations around installing solar panels. Two districts (districts VIII. and XVI.) prohibit installations on flat roofs, while district X. allows installations on a maximum of 15% of the surface area. District XIX. only prohibits installations at Wekerletelep (a residential area with relatively old houses), while district XX. requires mandatory professional consultation of the chief architect before any installation. With such divergent regulations existing parallel to each other, integrated urban planning, strategy building, and implementation are evidently difficult. This issue persists beyond just solar panels, extending to parking regulations and building requirements as well.

While the multitude of different regulations poses a significant challenge to achieving climate neutrality, the regulatory framework, in general, is also not ideal for the implementation of green actions. This issue is particularly prominent in urban planning, notably concerning buildings as there are strict regulations governing the renovation of heritage sites and protecting the cityscape. Staying with the solar panel example, in the regulations of each district, it is a special rule that no solar collectors or solar panels can be installed on a listed building or heritage building. The wording in the Budapest TIH covers a significant area, which means large parts of the most densely built-up inner districts on both sides of the Danube are subject to the restriction. The solar ban covers 4 555 684 m² (plus 111 710 919 m² in the buffer zone) of roof area, and 63 556 kW (plus 92 487 kW in the buffer zone) of solar PV generation potential. In addition to the Budapest TIH, several districts have introduced similar regulations on the visibility of solar panels in smaller and larger areas, thereby diminishing the renewable energy generation potential of the city. Strict regulations are also a problem when it comes to the insulation of historic buildings that make up most of the inner city and would be most in need of energy retrofitting. Conversely, the absence, inflexibility, and leniency of the regulatory framework can also hinder mitigating efforts. Some examples include lenient parking regulations for residents and inflexible regulations regarding energy communities.

## Financial barriers

Another significant challenge of the city's climate-neutrality mission is the lack of financial resources available for green investments. This is mainly due to the challenging financial situation of the Municipality of Budapest (mainly brought about by the reduction in business tax revenues and the increase in the so-called solidarity tax to be paid to the central government by municipalities with good business environment and relatively vivid economy producing relatively high net annual turnover), the unpredictable flow of EU funds and the lack of private investments. Because of these reasons, the predictability and availability of resources allocated to tasks and developments are highly uncertain. Resources often arrive at the last minute, making long-term planning extremely difficult. The impact of the economic crisis, exacerbated by geopolitical uncertainty and energy insecurity, is further worsening financial conditions for both public and private green investments. Given that the Municipality of Budapest has direct control of only about 5% of total emissions, the encouragement of private climate investment would be of utmost importance. While the recent energy crisis can be a catalyst of change, with inflation soaring high and the cost of living going up, the pace of green investments is unpredictable.

A more detailed description of financial barriers is included in the Investment Plan's Barriers to Climate Investment chapter.

## Increasing suburbanization

Another barrier for Budapest to become climate-neutral is the continuous sprawling of the city, which puts immense pressure on the existing infrastructure and creates an ever-growing demand for energy, water, and motorization.

Suburbanization around Budapest gained momentum in the 1990s and has continued ever since due to the growing desire of people for a more pleasant living environment, better housing, and lower living costs. This phenomenon is well-illustrated by the population shift from the city centre to the outer circles of Budapest, with some inner districts showing an over 20% decline, and many outer districts seeing an almost 10% growth in their population since 2000.¹⁹ Additionally, sprawling of the city has also been fuelled by urbanization and the influx of people moving to the capital from other parts of the country, contributing to a considerable 58% rise in the agglomeration's population between 1990 and 2022.²⁰

The migration of people into the outer districts and the agglomeration zone is causing mainly infrastructural problems and transport difficulties, with increasingly negative environmental consequences. The biggest challenge in terms of our climate-neutrality goal is that people living in suburban areas generally take up more space, have a higher energy and water use and mainly use individual motorization to move around. According to a survey conducted in 2022²¹, about 75% of commutes taking place in the agglomeration are towards Budapest, which is typically because those who move out of the capital continue to work or study there. The majority of journeys are also done by cars - a problem that is exacerbated by the lack of P+R and B+R parking lots, and the fact that none of the four metro lines reaches the suburbs. The unattractiveness of using public transport from the agglomeration is reinforced by an obsolete and unreliable railway system operated by state owned companies and the physical and info-communicational inaccessibility of subway and metro lines. Until recently, with few exceptions, surface services in the inner suburbs have also been disconnected from lines in the outer suburbs further driving car use in the city.

## Lack of information

Finally, a general factor impeding the acceleration of climate-neutrality initiatives is the lack of sufficient information people receive on the severity of climate change and the importance of adapting to its effects. This problem is further deepened by the continuous cuts in public education funding and the monopolization of mass media by the government. News regarding climate emergency is not given priority and the increasing consumption of goods is encouraged. Due to social media, imprecise and misleading information can also appear concerning climate change, which can negatively impact attitudes.

As the municipality has direct control over only 5% of total emissions, it would be crucial that individuals receive reliable information about climate change, what they can do to counter it and the support available for them. Every year, as part of the yearly Environmental Status Assessment of Budapest,

citizens are asked in surveys about their stance on climate protection. From the surveys, it is clear that a big proportion of the population is already environmentally conscious. Therefore, with widespread awareness-raising, the improvement of public education and the introduction of media education, the flow of accurate and sufficient information could be improved.

# General opportunities to achieving climate neutrality in Budapest:

# Renewable energy potential

Because of the geographic and climatic conditions in Budapest, there is great potential in utilising renewable energy sources, particularly solar and geothermal energy in the city.

According to the data available $^{22}$ , the portion of the buildings and roofs in Budapest which are suitable for the utilization of solar energy, and the areas suitable for being used for this purpose are sufficient for the installation of solar panels of a total installed capacity of 1500 MW (1750 MWp). This would require a roof area of ca. 10 million  $\mathrm{m}^2$ . However, it is to be noted, that photovoltaic systems may be installed not only on roofs but also on walls, on the ground, as well as on stands above parking spaces, etc.

![img-10.jpeg](img-10.jpeg)
Figure: The publicly available solar map of Budapest, showing the solar energy capacity of roofs

Overall, Budapest also has excellent geothermal potential, but there is a lot of local variability, with different ways of harnessing the earth's thermal energy from place to place within a district[23]. A good example of geothermal energy utilization is the capital's zoo, whose animal houses, and other facilities, 29 buildings in total, are largely heated by waste heat from the thermal water of the neighbouring Széchenyi Spa. The heating system based on condensing boilers is therefore only used as an auxiliary

system during periods when the energy of the thermal heat alone would not be sufficient to provide the required temperature due to the exceptionally low temperatures. In recent years, Budapest Public Utilities has been working with Icelandic, Hungarian and Danish partners to integrate more geothermal energy in the district heating system. Based on the example of Vienna, Budapest Public Utilities is also investigating the possibility of using wastewater from Budapest's wastewater treatment plants for district heating in Budapest through heat pumping. With lower risks than geothermal energy, the hope is that this will increase the volume of green district heating production by up to one million gigajoules per year.

## Brownfield sites

Budapest is rich in brownfield sites - areas with the potential to be rehabilitated and used to increase green spaces, improve railway infrastructure, or create positive energy districts in the city. The municipality has created a brownfield register for the purpose of keeping track of them and their particularities that can be later used by developers for the rehabilitation of reserve areas. In the assessment of these areas, particular attention is paid to the urban structure, the presence of built and natural assets, the infrastructure and the function of the surrounding areas, the environmental impacts as well as the potential uses of the site. As of 2023, 2737,5 ha brownfield sites can be found in Budapest.²⁴

Act LXXVIII of 2020 introduced the concept of the "Rust Belt Action Area", which will provide the locations for the housing development programme under the City Home Creation Programme in the coming years.²⁵ The government was granted the power to designate action areas and establish specific building requirements, while the Municipality of Budapest has the right to express an opinion (under Decision 9/2020-10-15/FKT). Under the Act, all developments in rust belt action areas will be priority investments. When taking advantage of the option to express its opinion, an important task of the Municipality will be to represent the interests of the residents.

## Environmental consciousness of society

A positive trend in society towards a more environmentally friendly and active lifestyle is taking form in the growing spread of cycling, solar panels, and recycling. A survey conducted by the Municipality in 2020 also showed that people, in general, are concerned about climate change, ranking their worries 61 on a scale from 0 to 100 (0 meaning not afraid at all and 100 meaning very afraid).²⁶ This presents a great opportunity for the city to mobilize its citizens and encourage them to take action. As more and more companies realise their responsibility towards their community in creating a greener sustainable city, they can also be a catalyst of change in their employees' and consumers' life.

According to a survey conducted in 2021²⁷, selective waste collection is already widespread among people but avoiding food waste and reducing water and energy consumption at home are also common behaviours.

# Stakeholder mapping

The transition towards climate neutrality is a complex challenge that requires the coordinated action of relevant local actors. The following table illustrates the stakeholder groups of Budapest's climate neutrality target that populate the urban systems described in the previous section. These are the local actors that have a considerable influence on and interest in the city's climate-neutrality ambition and hence, should be an integral part of the mission process.

# 3 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B represents the core of the CCC Action Plan, shaped by local authorities, local businesses, and stakeholders, comprising of the most essential elements: scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, action portfolios and indicators for monitoring, evaluation, and learning.

# 3.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Based on the GHG inventory of Budapest, which highlights significant emissions from transport and buildings, the extent to which the Municipality can directly control each emission source, as well as the barriers and opportunities of the transition - particularly those related to stakeholder relations and capacities - the following strategic objectives and key priorities were identified:

Reducing transport need through sustainable and smart city design and developments, and by promoting affordable housing
Electrifying public transport and providing comprehensive support for active mobility to promote climate-friendly means of transport
Increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and accelerating the use of renewables in urban areas, with a special focus on residential homes
Enhancing climate dialogue with key stakeholders, such as businesses, districts and the government.

Because a big proportion of emissions fall under the influence of residents and enterprises, a big proportion of impact pathways are related to collaborations, awareness-raising and incentive creation as a way to mobilize private actors. For incentives, we will place more focus on financial instruments combined with non-refundable grants and the work of the Climate Agency in financing retrofitting (with 2,5 billion HUF coming from the Municipality), and negotiating with commercial banks (for another 5 billion HUF), along with district municipalities (for another 2,5 billion HUF) to contribute to the programme. Technological, infrastructural and organizational measures are also emphasized as they can be more directly influenced by the Municipality and can significantly impact the city's transition towards net zero. Regulatory impact pathways are scarce, as the Municipality's ability to influence the regulatory framework is limited – most things fall under the authority of the Government of Hungary and some are distributed between district municipalities and the Municipality of Budapest. Since 2010, policymaking regarding climate change has not been progressive. Today, interventions are mainly limited to some aspects of the zoning plan and building code as regulated by the Gov. Regulation no. 419/2021 (VII. 15.) called the "settlement plan", which is under preparation, allowing the Municipality to incorporate a climate-neutral approach into building regulations. Despite the limited room for manoeuvre, the Municipality is trying to influence and support policymaking by identifying key regulatory interventions by sector through its projects (e.g. Budapest Solar Powered, LIFE in Runoff, food projects, Air Quality Plan). Budapest also regularly comments Eurocities policy proposals and is an active member of city-level lobbying groups such as Local Alliance. In the impact pathways, key regulatory interventions were identified where the Municipality can act independently and where it should put political pressure on legislators.

The table below summarizes the key impact pathways, their early changes and late outcomes, and both their direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits). Direct impacts and some of the co-benefits such as air

quality, and noise pollution are regularly measured and monitored by the Municipality. However, other co-benefits including health benefits, job creation, increased cooperation and property value are harder to measure and link to specific actions. It is also difficult to see how certain impact pathways affect the social, economic and cultural dimensions of the city. While they all have a positive environmental impact, actions can lead to long-standing issues in other facets of city life, such as gentrification, increased inequality or job loss.

The Municipality finds it important that the transition to a climate-neutral Budapest happens in a socially fair and economically sustainable way. For this reason, the Municipality used the Budapest Degrowth Doughnut²⁸ created by the Budapest Corvinus University, which analyses the capital's current social and ecological sustainability status (strengths, shortcomings, unexploited opportunities) in relation to the sustainability transition. It identifies important indicators and links them to each other to see the impact they have on one another.

The Budapest Degrowth Doughnut can be structurally divided into three equal parts, the cultural, socioeconomic and biophysical dimensions. There are two types of indicators within the safe and just space marked in green. On the outer rim are the upper limit indicators and on the inner rim are the lower limit ones. Zones marked in red indicate that the limit values have been exceeded.

The Doughnut allows the Municipality to have a more overarching view of the climate-neutrality transition, consider its effect on other aspects of city life and develop the Action Plan accordingly. For example, extensive renovations of residential buildings will lead to a rise in rents, causing gentrification and increased suburbanization. To address this, an important sub-action under the impact pathway Public building renovations is the transformation of unused municipal buildings into affordable social housing. The discovery of cause-and-effect relationships between the indicators defined in the Budapest Degrowth Doughnut analysis framework was supported by the system map created during the research process.

The indicators of the Degrowth Doughnut also cover most of the co-benefits not yet monitored regularly, while the rest can be later added to the model if deemed more important than the current indicators.

|   |  Raising knowledge and awareness | Collaborating with businesses and districts to mobilize public activity in climate actions  |
|   |  Building government relations, raising funds and policy making | Working together with the Government of Hungary to develop and implement urban regulations and mitigation proposals, and support climate-conscious policy-making by sharing information, experience and knowledge on the urban aspects of climate change.  |
|  Transport | Reduced motorized passenger transportation need  |   |
|   |  Developing compact neighbourhoods | Creating mixed-function neighbourhoods by strengthening existing and potential centres in the city, and developing a network of sub-centres, which also operate as easily accessible transport nodes.  |
|   |  Providing affordable housing to stop suburbanization | Currently, Budapest has the highest rents relative to wages of any capital city in the European Union. The aim of the action is to tackle this issue and provide secure, affordable housing to those in need in Budapest, thereby also stopping the increasing outflow of people from the city to the suburbs.  |
|   |  Supporting flexible working hours and home office | To respond to the growing demand for flexible working arrangements, the Municipality offers its employees the option to work from home and actively encourages this initiative across its companies and institutions. This aligns with broader efforts to reduce urban congestion, lower carbon emissions, and improve overall quality of life by decreasing the need for daily commuting.  |
|   |  Introducing stricter rules regarding the movement and parking of tourist coaches | Considerable reduction in motorized transport needs requires to some extent restrictive measures such as introducing stricter rules regarding the movement and parking of tourist coaches.  |
|   |  Shift to public & non-motorized transport  |   |
|   |  Public transport network developments | The action involves improving modal split by reducing walking distances and transfers, improving inter-regional connections, and integrating new and underserved areas into the public transport system.  |

|   |  Action description | The city is planning to implement various measures to reduce traffic demand, with the most prominent and important being the creation of compact urban neighbourhoods to eventually materialize a 15-minute city vision. In 2021, a study was commissioned by the Municipality to assess and evaluate the compactness of Budapest and explore actions to achieve the "compact city" objective. This study includes a list of 13 tools and interventions, including the development of Budapest's valuable brownfield sites. The city currently has nearly 8,000 hectares with significant development potential, of which nearly 3,500 hectares can be used for residential development under the capital's urban development plan.  |
BUDAPEST

|   |  | Other interventions to make the city more compact include launching a digital twin pilot project, organizing awareness-raising programmes and designing and managing so-called thematic streets. Thematic street initiatives are designed to enhance streets where local businesses operate by making them more attractive, expanding their range of functions through events, and ensuring coordinated operation with residential areas. There is also growing emphasis on the support for the use of empty shops on the district level. Such initiatives have so far included a website (kiberelem.hu) that aims to make vacant commercial premises known and attractive to those who want to start a new business or want to place their business on the map of Budapest. A long-term goal of the initiative is the realization of sustainable real estate management, which allows for the utilization of hard-to-use, empty municipal and private properties. The platform also features an interactive map where residents can suggest desired businesses or services for their neighbourhoods.

As transport need is also largely driven by the ongoing suburbanization of Budapest due to its rising living costs and rents, another key intervention of reducing motorized transport is ensuring the affordability of housing. For this reason, the Budapest Housing Agency was founded, which offers to take over rental management tasks from landlords in return for lower rents for tenants. Under the umbrella of the Agency, the Municipality will also renovate its disused, non-residential buildings to create additional municipal housing and gain more control over the cost of living in the city.

To reduce motorized traffic need and respond to the growing demand for flexible working arrangements, the Municipality offers its employees the option to work from home and actively encourages this initiative across its companies and institutions. This aligns with broader efforts to reduce urban congestion, lower carbon emissions, and improve overall quality of life by decreasing the need for daily commuting.

Finally, to achieve a considerable reduction in motorized transport, besides improving the walkability of the city, additional measures are needed such as introducing stricter rules regarding the movement and parking of tourist coaches.  |

|   | Action description | To facilitate the shift from motorized to public and non-motorized transport, a number of initiatives are being planned and implemented in the city. A major focus is on developing the public transport network by integrating new and underserved areas and making transfers easier and distances shorter. This includes improving transport links between the city and its surrounding areas, including rail service to the airport. In line with EU directives, future developments will also aim to reduce the environmental impact of public transport vehicles in Budapest, in particular by purchasing a new fleet of climate-neutral, state-of-the-art vehicles. The suburban public transport fleet will also be upgraded similarly, and diesel operation in Budapest's suburban rail transport will be phased out. It is also important that public transport is given priority, which involves the designation of bus lanes on busy urban road sections where regular congestion hinders the movement of buses.

Another important objective of the Municipality is to encourage cycling in Budapest. The aim is to create a coherent, clearly designed, easy-to-use main cycling network connecting the city's districts, ensuring safe and convenient access for cyclists. Additionally, a key goal is to develop the public bike-sharing system (MOL Bubi), by increasing accessibility, providing additional collection points in new and existing service areas, expanding and diversifying (electric-assisted and specialised bicycles) the fleet by 1500-3500 bicycles, increasing inclusiveness, and improving service management.

In addition to developing the cycling infrastructure, giving priority to pedestrian traffic is also crucial. Recent developments have established a new architectural standard, gaining social support for further public space reconstruction and traffic calming. The goal is to prioritize pedestrians in the central parts of the outer districts and to organise pedestrian and cycle-friendly public spaces in the inner districts into a cohesive, liveable urban fabric.

A major project by the Municipality is the renewal of the Pest quay, which is regularly closed to cars on summer weekends. This project aims for a complete transformation to make the area greener and more pedestrian- and bike-friendly. The project includes the improvement of active pedestrian-cycle transport conditions, the diversification of accessibility to the Danube bank, the development of 800 m of new community facilities, the regeneration of a World Heritage site, traffic calming along 3,2 km, rethinking road links and the development of 3,2 km of bike lanes along the Lower Quay of Pest.  |

|   |  | Another leading public space renewal initiative is the Healthy Streets programme, which was launched as part of a 300 billion HUF EU development package recently announced by the Mayor. As part of the programme, district municipalities can apply for non-repayable grants ranging from HUF 250 million to HUF 2,5 billion, out of a total budget of HUF 24,16 billion.

A similarly key measure is the gradual expansion of paid/controlled parking zones in the city. First, in areas that can reasonably be covered by the current ticket machine network meaning about 30 % of the city's residential area, and then in a further stage with regulation allowing for a lower ticket machine density. Under the current legal framework, the plan includes the introduction of free but time-limited waiting zones across the entire city, eliminating currently non-paying areas used as "quasi-P+R" parking by drivers from the agglomeration. Another effective measure would be increasing parking charges and reducing resident discounts. In addition to parking regulation changes, all P+R car parks would be subject to a fee, and the current fee of HUF 350 for P+R car parks would be linked to the use of public transport.

To further curb motorization in the densely built-up areas of the inner and transition zones, the expansion of restricted waiting zones and the designation of Tempo30 zones are ongoing. An additional 12 traffic calming zones are planned throughout the city. Based on the proposal of the road safety strategy and traffic calming plan, differentiated reductions in speed limits will also be introduced on major roads depending on public space conditions.

Less impactful but still important measures include developing the BudapestGO app (new transport tools and services e.g. shared mobility), encouraging companies to develop Workplace Mobility Plans and organising awareness-raising campaigns. Carrying out pedestrian and cycling awareness campaigns in schools and organising workshops with drivers and cycling organisations are especially important for the Municipality to mobilize residents.  |

|   |  | including lockers, taxi stands, car sharing and charging stations. The charging network needs to be established with consideration to the infrastructure at home and in facilities attracting traffic, and the establishment and operation of further charging stations in public places must be supported.

Additionally, the city is developing smart charging tools, providing smart grid integration (e.g. with solar panels) and demand management.

Budapest is also promoting the electrification of the residential and car-sharing fleet by offering free parking for EVs with green license plates. Since October 2015, the green license plate is a mark distinguishing environmentally friendly cars, which has been assigned to cars classified in one of the environmental protection classes 5E, 5P, 5N or 5Z.^{32}

Finally, the city is also developing a comprehensive electromobility strategy. Preparation of the strategy started in June 2024 and will be completed in September.  |

New mobility stations with charging stations: The first mobility stations were put into use in June 2024. The establishment of a further 20-25 stations are planned until 2030.

Smart charging tool: It is not possible to change the charging capacity (e.g. 22 kW to 11 kW or much lower level) at publicly available electric vehicle charging stations. Therefore, we had to create a demo environment for the dynamic charging control of the SMAC system in a non-public location.  |

From 1 September 2024, only fully electric and zero-emission cars will be eligible for green licence plates. The green licence plates previously issued for hybrid electric vehicles will be replaced by white ones.

|   |  Action description | To optimize logistics, the Municipality is planning a series of initiatives to make more efficient use of scarce public spaces. The flagship project focuses on developing a network of designated loading areas and introducing a loading area booking system. The elements of the project are:
• Conducting a survey of current public space functions and the existing loading area network in Budapest
• Developing a city-wide loading area network to support freight flows
• Creating multifunctional service areas, which combine loading areas with facilities such as electric vehicle charging
• Equipping loading bays with sensors (including number plate recognition cameras and vehicle detection sensors) to facilitate loading activities and the search for loading bays
• Establishing freight transfer points close to the city centre and developing a detailed business and operational model
• Developing and implementing a loading bay reservation system, which aims to reduce vehicle journeys by allowing users to view occupancy data and make online reservations

Another initiative facilitating the optimization of city logistics in Budapest is the development of a sustainable city logistics policy framework. The project includes:
• Identifying the scope of city logistics data required for traffic modelling and data collection and building the IT infrastructure for data storage and analysis
• Developing a cooperation framework for data sharing between freight transport companies and municipal institutions
• Identifying city logistics intervention areas by 2024
• Launching 2 pilot programmes using the developed city logistics methodology to create specific proposals based on data analysis
• Proposing and then introducing changes to the regulatory environment

Finally, coordination and collaboration between different actors are necessary to optimize freight  |

|   |  Action description | Established in June 2024, the Budapest Climate Agency, a municipality-owned non-profit company, will be responsible for achieving the capital's 2030 decarbonisation targets (and beyond) in the building sector.

The Budapest Climate Agency will manage the development of funding schemes relying on various EU, national budgetary or market resources, organise actors in the sector, and develop and implement large-scale projects. In addition to designing and managing targeted programmes, taking into account social, financial and technical aspects, the Budapest Climate Agency will provide a one-stop-shop service covering the whole process of residential renovation (assessment, planning, financing, construction) through a customer service network. This network will be coordinated by the Agency with the help of district authorities and NGOs. This front office service will be provided by the RenoPONT network, launched under the Horizon-funded RenoHUB project. The Agency will also contribute to the radical reduction of CO_{2} emissions from buildings by testing innovative solutions and, in case of successful pilot projects, scaling them up, e.g. by creating PED districts based on the results of the Horizon projects already underway (ATELIER, ASCEND).

Recognizing the relatively low awareness among residents about the energy efficiency of their homes, awareness-raising programmes will be launched, including:
• appearance at events organised by the Municipality or private companies
• development of visitors' centres, open days and marketing communication tools
• awareness-raising related to specific projects (targeted campaigns and activities).

Besides facilitating residential renovations, the Municipality is also facilitating renovations in municipally owned buildings and facilities. Plans are also underway to modernise the building energy database, which will enable the Municipality to launch digital twin projects.  |

|   |  Comments on implementation – consider mentioning resources, timelines, milestones | The priority of the Municipality is to facilitate residential building retrofitting in order to achieve an annual renovation rate of 4%.

As part of its Budapest CARES project, which received €1.5 million in direct EU funding, the Budapest Climate Agency was developed to support and speed up residential building energy efficiency projects both scientifically and institutionally. Until June 2025, in the framework of the Budapest CARES project the following tasks will be done:
• Comprehensive database on the energy performance of the building stock in the capital, the savings that can be achieved through renovation, and the willingness of the population to renovate.
• Development of a metropolitan building energy strategy.
• Creating a network of residential advisors, developing building energy efficiency pilot programs, and identifying and evaluating blended financing opportunities.

Following the Budapest CARES project, the Budapest Climate Agency will launch comprehensive investment programmes by scaling up the Budapest CARES pilot projects, make PED developments, and reinvest the savings revenues (Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme) in the available funds.

The Municipality and business associations providing public services are also planning to carry out extensive energy efficiency renovations. A list of completed and planned interventions can be found in the Monitoring the implementation of the Environment Programme chapter of the Environmental Status Assessment Report of Budapest.  |

|   |  Action description | The interventions mentioned under Building renovations (envelope) also apply here, as facilitation programmes of renovations and retrofitting of municipal buildings do not only include envelope renovations but the modernisation of the heating system as well. In particular, the Budapest Climate Agency will play a crucial role in facilitating these heating upgrades. The Agency will offer recommendations on the most technologically and economically efficient ways to transition from gas to alternative heating solutions. Additionally, its front office service will provide personalized advice on sizing, design, and installation to ensure the successful implementation of heating upgrades.

Recognizing the relatively low awareness among residents about their energy consumption, awareness-raising programmes will also be launched, including thematic campaigns and informational activities coordinated by the Municipality with special regard to reducing the volume of household energy consumption.

Finally, the City is also planning a number of interventions to decarbonize and expand district heating, including:
• Exploring the possibility of connecting geothermal heat to district heating: By installing geothermal heat sources and heat exchangers, 292,500 - 477,000 MWh/a of renewable district heat can be produced, resulting in emission reductions of 63,180 - 103,032 tCO2/year.
• Replacing the waste recovery plant's steam turbine and reconstructing the boilers: the heat source modernisation will result in additional electricity generation of about 50 GWh. The replacement of the turbine generator set will result in additional heat sales of about 380 TJ/year and additional electricity sales of about 50 GWh/year. This will result in primary energy savings of about 900 TJ/year and a reduction of CO2 emissions of about 37,000 tonnes/year.  |
BUDAPEST

|   |  | • Installing electric boilers with a total thermal capacity of 20-40 MW
• Connecting district heating zones: As a result of the initiative, the City expects to achieve annual primary energy savings of 240,000 MWh. This initiative will also reduce CO₂ emissions by 58,000 tonnes annually.
• Expanding and developing the district heating infrastructure
• Energy efficiency reconstructions of transmission lines, energy efficiency reconstructions of heat exchanges: As a result of the reconstructions, an additional 3,264 (2,529+735) MWh of primary energy savings and 704 (546+158) tCO₂ savings can be realised on the district heating system.

As district heating becomes more efficient and increasingly reliant on renewables, efforts are underway to connect new consumers to the network, saving about 137,000 MWh/year of energy and 32,200 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.  |

• Connecting district heating zones: It is important that planning and implementation can only start if new grant opportunities arise and market expansion is available for district heating.
• Replacing the waste recovery plant’s steam turbine and reconstructing the boilers: The design of the project is scheduled for 2024-2025, and the implementation for 2025-2026.
• Installing electric boilers with a total thermal capacity of 20-40 MW: The installation of an electric boiler is conditional on the availability of green electricity only and on the availability of grants. Mapping of the installation site is ongoing.
• Expanding and developing the district heating infrastructure: continuous implementation conditional on the availability of grants.
• Energy efficiency reconstructions of transmission lines, energy efficiency reconstructions of heat exchanges: continuous implementation.  |

|   |  Action description | Out of all renewable sources, solar energy is the most accessible in the urban context. The Budapest – Solar Powered project therefore concentrates on the city’s solar potential. The aim of the work is to explore ways of promoting and supporting the uptake of solar panels. The project also explores administrative and legal barriers, technical as well as economic issues, and social and community attitudes and involvement.  |
BUDAPEST
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

|   | The Municipality has collected and analysed the district and city-level regulations for the installation of solar panels. The detailed legal analysis helps professionals, municipalities and the general public to navigate through the wide range of rules. Three expert working groups have been set up, involving municipalities, civil society organisations, academics, students and some of the companies involved, to think together and identify solutions to promote the use and uptake of solar panels: By integrating different databases and using geographic information software, the Solar Map of Budapest has been produced. Files containing the buildings and urban planning units of the city and digital surface models of the buildings were imported into the programme and used to build the Budapest Solar Map through various modelling and geodatabase building processes. The final output consists of several output layers, including the results of simulated irradiance modelling for the whole year, the irradiance and estimated electricity generation potential of building roofs, etc. The map aims to provide information to property owners and decision-makers to support the implementation of different solar PV investments. Building on the Budapest – Solar Powered project, a follow-up project is underway, whose main objective is to create a guide to help other cities promote the use of solar energy in urban areas. The project will also carry out benchmarking analysis and, on the basis of the results, propose steps for the integration of solar energy into the energy supply chain. While this can help facilitate residential and commercial investments in solar energy, the Municipality and its business associations are also investing in decarbonizing their own electricity generation by installing solar panels. Furthermore, the roofs of shopping centres and office blocks provide excellent surfaces for the installation of solar panel systems, just like outdoor car parks, where solar panels could be mounted on stands, also providing shade against strong sunshine. This is invaluable in a densely built city, lacking usable space. Hence, it is necessary to establish cooperation with the corporate sector and encourage knowledge sharing in this regard. There are also plans to promote the establishment of energy communities, by facilitating cooperation between condominiums, the electricity provider and offices. The initiative would enable residential buildings with solar panels to sell surplus electricity generated throughout the day. In exchange, offices  |

|   | Action description | From 1st July 2023, the concession company, MOHU took over the municipal waste management services for solid waste in Hungary. Over the next 35 years, MOHU will be responsible for providing domestic waste management services including the handling and treatment of waste as well as undertaking related investments.

As part of initiatives to increase recycling rates, a mandatory bottle return system was launched in 2024, allowing metal, plastic and glass bottles and containers to be returned to designated collection points in return for a HUF 50 return fee. The aim of the return system is to radically reduce the environmental pollution caused by plastic bottles, aluminium cans, and glass bottles and to reuse as much of them as possible. This is supported by an extensive communication campaign and by MOHU's app, featuring return points across Budapest.

Recycling will also be facilitated by gradually modernising waste yards, increasing the range of waste types they can accept, and thereby increasing the share of waste collected separately.

Another flagship action of MOHU is the introduction of a household biowaste collection system. Initially, this service will be launched in a few condominium zones and then gradually expanded to the rest of Budapest. Residents will receive new bins accompanied by information materials to help the transition.

To further spread the habit of composting, the Municipality will further develop its community composting network and organise various awareness-raising activities.

The Municipality of Budapest is also exploring other ways with the help of the Prevention Platform - a group of waste management experts - to reduce the amount of waste generated in the city. This includes developing existing Awareness-raising and Reuse Centres, creating a city-wide network of community repair shops and reuse schemes such as Cseriti, Rakun, and Munch, as well as considering policy interventions, public-private partnerships (PPPs), and awareness-raising activities.

The Municipality is also developing an Integrated City Food Strategy, which envisions providing residents with access to healthy and affordable food that benefits both people and the planet by fostering sustainable food chains, thereby contributing to decarbonization efforts. To achieve this, the Municipality will:
• Help build **short food chains** by strengthening urban-rural links (farmers' markets, shopping  |

## B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

In order for Budapest to reach climate neutrality, the capacity of carbon sinks in the city needs to be increased. In Budapest there are at present at least 1200 hectares that can be described as brownfield areas whose previous function has ceased or that are underused and require intervention for a new use.

The Economic Model does not calculate the costs of decarbonizing other sectors. As the emissions from IPPU and AFOLU are insignificant, costs are likely to be very low compared to other actions.
BUDAPEST

Brownfield areas present an excellent opportunity to create new green spaces, thereby increasing the capture of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  and improving the urban climate. Additionally, Budapest's existing green cover system does not adequately fulfil its recreational and environmental roles; there is insufficient and often poor-quality green space. This presents the city with further opportunities to enhance carbon capture and improve its green infrastructure.[35]

The Municipality has several prepared plans for the integrated recreational and green space development of the city. These are collected and summarized in the Radó Dezső Plan, the city's Green Infrastructure and Maintenance Plan. The plan includes projects in 10 action areas that are summarized below.

It is important to mention that the qualitative and quantitative development of the city's green infrastructure in itself, is not sufficient enough to offset residual emissions within the city border. Technological solutions are relatively novel in Hungary, however, the Municipality is open to working together with the private sector and research hubs who have started experimenting with or are already planning on using  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  removal technologies. With regard to private actors that have limited capacity to

completely eliminate their emissions within the city border, the use of carbon credits focused on projects close to Budapest or in the country will be encouraged.

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part C "Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030" aims to outline any enabling interventions, i.e., regarding organizational setting or collaborative governance models or related to social innovations – designed to support the climate action portfolios (Module B-2) as well as aiming to achieve co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Module B-1). These interventions also address the identified opportunities, gaps and barriers identified Module A-2 and A-3.

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

The transition of Budapest towards a climate-neutral future is a complex challenge that requires stakeholders from the entire local ecosystem to collaborate. In the centre of this transition is the Municipality of Budapest, whose responsibility is to encourage, enable and facilitate intra- and inter-institutional innovations, local, national, and international partnerships as well as participatory processes that support the implementation of the Action Plan by 2030.

The main facilitators and coordinators of environmental projects in the city are the Department for Climate and Environmental Affairs and the Department of Landscape Architecture, the former of which was established in 2019 with the aim of making environment protection one of the key pillars of city governance. To ensure the integration of sustainability into the operation of the Municipality, the Department was granted authority to review and advise on proposals related to climate and environmental protection and other relevant materials and initiatives based on their adherence to the city's Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan. Moreover, to improve the quality and consistency of data, the municipality has introduced a Sustainability Reporting System for public companies whereby they report on their energy consumption and emissions annually. Finally, the Environmental Protection Fund and the Green Budapest Foundation were set up to secure funding for sustainability initiatives in the city.

Since its establishment the Department has worked together with various stakeholders to combat climate change and accelerate adaptation, however, none of the projects compares in size or complexity to the challenge of achieving climate neutrality. For this reason, the Municipality of Budapest has established a so-called Mission Group based on NZC's Transition Team Model A, a collaborative governance structure involving the Municipality, private and public companies, academia, and the civil sector who help develop and implement the city's climate neutrality strategy. The cooperation model of the Municipality differs slightly from the NZC's model in that sectoral groups within the Mission Group, known as Transition Teams were defined, creating new and utilizing already existing platforms. The Mission Group is led by the Mission Team, a core group of people within the city administration solely responsible for managing the mission process. They establish the working modality, oversee, and coordinate the creation of the city's climate-neutral strategy, involve stakeholders, as well as support and facilitate the work of the Mission Group. The team works under the Department for Climate and Environmental Affairs and is closely supported by different departments, including the Department of Finance and Accounting, and the Department of Budget Planning and Supervision, as well as BKK Centre for Budapest Transport and Budapest Public Utilities Ltd, which provide professional help to make sure plans are prepared to the best of their fields' expertise.

Other members of the Mission Group include KÖVET Association, a civil organization specialised in sustainability training for companies, Budapest Corvinus University, where the Degrowth Doughnut of Budapest has been prepared and two networks serving as platforms for private companies and civil organizations where they can engage in dialogue with each other and the city governance regarding climate change.
BUDAPEST

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Members of the Mission Group meet each other periodically, in smaller or bigger groups depending on whether the issue in discussion is inter-sectoral or sector specific.

Members include:
The Municipality of Budapest
BKK Centre for Budapest Transport
Budapest Public Utilities Ltd.
Budapest Global, a network of private companies working together with the municipality.
Green Budapest working group, a network of civil organizations dedicated to climate protection.
KÖVET Association
Budapest Corvinus University

Private companies - both global and local; large- and medium-sized businesses - were invited to join the Mission Group. In cooperation with the Budapest Global association, a public NGO responsible for corporate relations, the Department for Climate and Environmental Affairs reached out to companies through multiple channels. Together with the KÖVET Association, we have organised corporate workshops to introduce the ongoing project and activities being carried out by the Department to showcase and identify potential cooperation areas with companies along 4 thematic areas: mobility, energy, circular economy and green infrastructure. As a result of the workshops, we have organised personal meetings with companies to discuss the details and framework of the cooperation. Many of the personal meetings resulted in the involvement of additional businesses, based on the established partnerships of the given companies.

As an additional channel, we have reached out to business organisations active in Hungary, such as foreign chambers (e.g. The American Chamber of Commerce in Hungary and French-Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, etc) and BCSDH - The Business Council for Sustainable Development. These organisations provided a platform for us to meet companies and introduce the Department's efforts for climate transition, as well as outline the approach and potential involvement with the Mission.

Establishing new connections with businesses and reaching out to additional companies are still planned and ongoing. The discussions have begun with organisations such as the Hungary Green Building Council (HuGBC) on the involvement of their members. Additionally, we are planning to represent the Municipality of Budapest and the Mission on the Office Week (which is an annual key event in the real estate market), and have leveraged the 'snowball effect', by establishing connections that support the outreach to many others through existing cooperation.

The next step in the engagement of companies is to organize regular events, such as business breakfasts to facilitate joint actions that support the climate neutrality transition, identify synergies between companies' ongoing climate actions, address companies' main pain points in their sustainability operations, and develop joint actions and projects to overcome systematic barriers.

Figure: The governance model of Budapest's climate neutrality transition

Also key in enabling the transition are residents that the city government – with the help of the Mission Group – informs and mobilizes. A particularly important aim of the city leadership is to actively include citizens in decision-making and planning processes. For this reason, the Municipality of Budapest has multiple deliberation initiatives and participatory processes encouraging citizens to share their ideas and make decisions regarding climate mitigation and adaptation actions. Initiatives since 2020 have included surveys, online questionnaires, citizen involvement in traffic calming projects, participatory budgeting, and citizen assemblies. In 2020, the Municipality organized its first citizen assembly $^{36}$ , whereby 8 interventions were proposed by participants. In developing the CCC, mitigation proposals were integrated into the Action Plan.

Finally, getting district governments on board is also crucial as they play an important role, alongside civil society organisations, in engaging the public, raising awareness and encouraging small-scale climate actions at a local level. Additionally, recognising the role of universities in research and development, more focus will be placed on their mobilization in the future too.

The table below summarizes the key governance innovation planned or already in place to reach climate neutrality:

## 4.2 Module C-2 Social Innovation Interventions

Social innovation interventions are crucial to the Municipality of Budapest to address complex societal challenges and to ensure inclusive decision-making with the consideration of environmental and social aspects. These interventions aim to improve urban management and development endeavours of Budapest. Table C.2.1 lists social innovations initiated and driven by both the Municipality of Budapest and non-governmental organisations. Social innovations were gathered with the involvement of the civil sector: a sub-working group of the Green Budapest working group was established, and the civil thematic working group dedicated one of its sessions to collecting social innovations initiated by NGOs in Budapest. The table below contains the most relevant and crucial initiatives supporting the transition towards climate neutrality.

Even though the listed social innovations represent over-arching benefits and advantages, the innovations were grouped into 5 sub-groups based on the main sectors they impact. A 'Government'

group was also created. As the initiatives listed there deeply depend on social inclusion, directly involve society and reflect residents' perspectives to a great extent, they seemed to fit more into the social innovation module than into the governance innovation section.

The barriers and opportunities listed in Table 4-2. go beyond the description of 2.3 Module A-3 and provide a more detailed description of barriers and opportunities. They offer additional information on the obstacles the initiatives aim to overcome, and potential opportunities for scaling up the innovations. Marginalised groups are impacted in several ways – e.g. through their direct involvement in governance-related social innovations that ensure their participation in decision-making, most interventions are accessible irrespective of income, origin or social status. Just to name a few, the Repair Café supports people to extend the life cycle of products to decrease consumption; innovative financial loans, offered by both RenoPonts and the Budapest Climate Agency are designed to be accessible to low-income households too; placemaking initiatives are offering free public spaces and cultural event to all residents. These social innovations all have the potential to be scaled up and spread throughout Budapest. Public sources are already available for funding – such as the Participatory Budget, or the green grants and tenders – with limited financial resources, and mainly are capable of funding few initiatives in the long run. However, private funding may be directed into these initiatives, as we are working on establishing stronger cooperations with companies, they are becoming more open to investing in solutions that align with their ESG and sustainability targets. Therefore, the Municipality of Budapest may be a facilitator of cooperation between companies, NGOs and residents.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

The Action Plan aims to outline the roadmap and necessary steps to achieve climate neutrality in Budapest, as well as the barriers and the opportunities lying ahead. The plan mainly focuses on actions within the control of the Municipality but also identifies key interventions beyond its authority, where cooperation and advocacy with public bodies - with special focus on the national government and district municipalities - can enable the transition.

The Action Plan is an iterative document that will be reviewed and modified biannually to account for missing data and sectors and to respond to the changes in the political, social, economic, and technological aspects of the environment. Deviations from target values will be identified, duly analysed and corrective measures will be defined. The Municipality’s work regarding climate protection will continue, with the pilot project Budapest CARES being the flagship project of the Mission. Stakeholder engagement activity started as part of the CCC process will also resume after the submission, with the hopes of mobilizing further private, public and civil actors to find synergies, build rapport, and strengthen the city’s commitment to climate neutrality.

# Introduction

The world is at a crossroads, where the actions taken in the next few years can have lasting impacts on our future. Global warming is accelerating at an alarming rate, with the global average nearing $1,2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}^{1}$ increase compared to pre-industrial levels. Budapest recognizes that preserving and improving the natural environment, ensuring economic stability and social well-being are essential for creating decent living conditions for future generations. The Municipality of Budapest and stakeholders of the urban ecosystem are committed to leading the way in taking climate action and setting an example for other cities in achieving climate neutrality.

Budapest has a long history of environmentally conscious city operations and has been building a strong mandate for climate protection since 2008, with the development of Budapest's Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP). In 2015, the city joined the Under 2 Coalition, committing to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least $80\%$ by 2050 compared to 1990 levels, or to less than 2 tonnes per capita per year. In 2019, the newly elected General Assembly pledged to build a green, opportunity-rich, and democratically functioning city. Since then, the city has made great strides in decarbonizing public transport, developing the cycling infrastructure of the city, revitalizing green spaces and reducing the emissions from the Municipality's facilities and buildings. Recognizing the threat of climate change to the well-being, social peace and living conditions of future generations, the General Assembly declared a climate emergency in 2019. Additionally, it was decided that all decision proposals would be based on an assessment of their impact on the environment, with climate action being given priority. The General Assembly of Budapest has also tasked the Mayor with reviewing the action plans for extreme weather events and submitting an action plan to ensure that the Municipality, its institutions and companies become carbon neutral within a reasonable period and eventually transition entirely to green energy.

In 2021, the General Assembly adopted the Budapest Environmental Programme, its horizontal strategy document for the period 2021-2026. The programme aims to protect and improve the environment of Budapest and ensure that sustainability aspects are considered in the development of the capital. To further these efforts, the Department for Climate and Environmental Affairs was founded in 2020, which - in just 4 years - has grown to a team of over 30 colleagues of diverse disciplines, working on climate mitigation and adaptation projects. In 2022, Budapest also submitted its Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), committing to a $40\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions by 2030 compared to the 2015 base year.

To raise this ambition and accelerate the transition towards climate neutrality, the Municipality of Budapest submitted its Expression of Interest (EoI) to join the European Union's 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission (hereinafter: Mission) on the $31^{\text{st}}$ of January 2022 and was subsequently invited to be one of the 112 cities to participate. With its Climate City Contract (CCC), Budapest aims to lay the groundwork for the capital's climate-neutral transition by 2030. The CCC goes beyond the emission reduction targets set out in international agreements and national strategic documents, establishing a comprehensive roadmap for achieving climate neutrality. In addition to detailing the necessary steps to net zero and to monitor the progress, joining the Mission also allows Budapest to learn from other cities, and communicate its challenges to the European Commission, ensuring strong support in reaching its climate goals.

The CCC Action Plan was prepared in line with the city's other environmental and developmental concepts and action plans. Its strategic objectives reflect on them and include the decarbonisation of transport, increasing energy efficiency and fostering relationship with key stakeholders, such as businesses, district governments and the national government. Strategic objectives were identified based on the GHG inventory of Budapest, which highlights significant emissions from transport and buildings, the barriers and opportunities of the transition, as well as the extent to which the Municipality can directly control each emission source.

The Action and Investment Plan was developed by the Mission Team, an internal core group of people within the Municipality supported by a wide network of external actors - private and public companies, academia, and the civil sector. The process began with developing a targeted strategy to engage and effectively mobilize different stakeholder groups, creating new and leveraging already existing platforms. This was followed by an extensive data collection and analysis process, built on the long existing environmental reporting tradition of the city. However, to address the full scope of the CCC, beyond regularly collected data, additional information was needed, especially regarding green spending. For designing the action portfolio, Transition Teams were consulted to ensure the CCC aligns with the city's and its actors' key strategic objectives and builds on actions already in progress. Local stakeholders, such as enterprises and citizens are especially key to be on board, thus the Municipality places significant emphasis on its community engagement activities (community design, citizen assemblies and participatory budgeting) and intensifies efforts to mobilize and collaborate with enterprises.

# Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

The Municipality of Budapest prepared its SEAP in 2008, in which the city aimed to reduce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions by at least $21\%$ by 2020. In 2015, Budapest also joined the Under 2 Coalition - by signing the Memorandum of Understanding, Budapest has committed to reducing its GHG emissions by at least $80\%$ by 2050 compared to 1990 levels, or to limit local GHG emissions to less than 2 tonnes per capita per year by 2050. With the submission of the SECAP in 2022, Budapest set a new goal of achieving a $40\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions by 2030 compared to 2015. That same year, Budapest joined the European Commission's 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 Mission, aiming to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 - by reducing $80\%$ and offsetting $20\%$ of total emissions - and pledged to support sectoral interventions to fulfil the goals of the Mission. Budapest's 2030 climate neutrality target is in line with the climate neutrality definition of the Mission and covers the entire administrative territory of the city. However, in terms of emission sources, exclusion areas include ETS participants, aviation, national railways (suburban trains are included), coaches and water-borne transportation due to the complexity of data collection. In terms of GHGs, only $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions are accounted for currently. Future iterations will attempt to address these gaps and provide a more accurate emission inventory for the city.

Budapest's pursuit of climate neutrality is further strengthened by the co-benefits arising from the climate-neutral transition. Beyond environmental considerations, the economic and social co-benefits should also be recognized and highlighted to reinforce the city's climate neutrality goals. The identified co-benefits include health and economic gains from reduced congestion, air and noise pollution, improved urban land use due to function change and freed up spaces, cost savings, strengthened local economies and more resilient, independent urban systems.

# Strategic priorities

For Budapest to be able to reach climate neutrality, the following strategic objectives need to be achieved:

Reducing transport need through sustainable and smart city design and developments, and by promoting affordable housing
Electrifying public transport and providing comprehensive support for active mobility to promote climate-friendly means of transport
Increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and accelerating the use of renewables in urban areas, with a special focus on residential homes
Enhancing climate dialogue with key stakeholders, such as businesses, districts, and the government.

Without meeting them, the city will not be able to reduce GHGs enough to make climate neutrality a possibility. Therefore, it is key that these objectives are given priority in the Action and Investment Plan and throughout the implementation process in the coming years.

The climate neutrality portfolio was designed with the involvement of Transition Teams - actions were identified during multiple consultations and ambitious targets were defined. The most important actions of the CCC, organized by sector, are summarized in the table below. The action portfolio builds on and is in line with sectoral plans and development strategies (Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, Integrated Urban Development Strategy, Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan), and includes both ongoing and future interventions. As part of the Action Plan, the Budapest Energy Strategy will also be developed that will encompass the cross-sectoral vision of the city and actions related to all fields of action.

|  Transport | Buildings & heating | Electricity, waste & other  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  • Public transport network developments.
• Developing city logistics loading area network.
• Developing compact neighbourhoods.
• Creating a multilevel network of mobility stations.
• Bicycle infrastructure and bike sharing developments
• Electrification of the public transport fleet. | • Budapest Climate Agency: Energy-efficiency improvement of the building stock.
• Creating Positive (and Clean) Energy Districts (PCEDs).
• Reconstructing and energy upgrading the public lighting system. | • Facilitating solar panel development projects on buildings and sites owned by the municipality or its companies.
• Improving urban waste management, especially bio waste, inert waste and sewage.
• Enhancing mitigation and decarbonisation activities of industrial production and facilities of the tertiary sector.  |
|  • Raising knowledge and awareness of climate change through joint actions and sensitisation with civil society, businesses and districts.
• Working together with the Government of Hungary to develop and implement urban regulations and mitigation proposals, and support climate conscious policy-making by sharing information, experience and knowledge on the urban aspects of climate change.  |   |   |

The implementation of the actions above, however, poses some challenges, with the main barriers being the lack of financing, skills, human resources and the ever-shrinking regulatory space. Another challenge facing the Mission is that strategic objectives are also largely beyond the direct control of the Municipality of Budapest. The responsibility primarily falls on residents to reduce their motorized transport need, renovate their homes and modernize their heating in order to substantially reduce GHG emissions. The Municipality of Budapest can inform and incentivize them, but the lack of control (e.g. through legislation, official measures or financial incentives) poses serious risks to the viability of reaching climate neutrality. Therefore, indirect incentives and actions to promote behavioural change should be given increased emphasis, but they will by no means be sufficient on their own, the implementation of supportive actions by key stakeholders is essential. Other key stakeholders include companies, who also have a considerable impact on the emissions in the city through their commercial activities, and employee commuting, as well as the government, who has greater control over regulations and resources, and therefore, the creation of incentive schemes. Their involvement and support are essential to reach net zero emissions in Budapest.

Because a big proportion of emissions fall under the influence of residents and enterprises, most impact pathways are related to accelerating collaborations, awareness-raising, relationship building and incentive creation to mobilize private actors. Technological, infrastructural, and organizational measures are also emphasized as they can be more directly and easily influenced by the Municipality of Budapest and can significantly impact the city's transition towards net zero. Regulatory interventions are scarce, as the Municipality's ability to influence the regulatory framework is limited – most things fall under the authority of the Government of Hungary and district municipalities. Nevertheless, key regulatory interventions were identified where the Municipality can act independently and where it may put political pressure on legislators.

# Process and principles

The Municipality of Budapest has a direct influence on only 5% of emissions, so cooperation with the public and businesses is of particular importance. Reaching and actively involving both stakeholder groups in the dimension of Budapest, however, is a huge challenge in the preparation and implementation of the CCC due to their size and diversity.

The transition team model of Budapest closely mirrors NZC's Transition Team model A, whereby a Mission Group is created - a collaborative governance structure involving the Municipality, private and public companies, academia, and the civil sector who help develop and implement the city's climate neutrality strategy. The cooperation model of the Municipality differs slightly from the model in that sectoral groups within the Mission Group, known as Transition Teams, were defined, creating new and utilizing already existing platforms. The Mission Group is led by the Mission Team, a core group of people within the city administration solely responsible for managing the mission process. They establish the working modality, oversee, and coordinate the creation of the city's climate-neutral strategy, involve stakeholders, as well as support and facilitate the work of the Mission Group. They work under the Department of Climate and Environmental Affairs and are closely supported by different departments responsible for the provision of certain public services (e.g. department of urban management, urban planning and social policy) and departments with general, horizontal responsibilities (e.g. financial department and the legal department), as well as the BKK Centre for Budapest Transport and the Budapest Public Utilities Ltd, who provide professional help to make sure plans are prepared to the best of their fields' expertise.

As one of the first Transition Teams of the Mission - building on the existing organizational and legal structures - the Net Zero thematic group was launched under the so-called Green Budapest Civil Working Group. Another crucial element of mobilizing for the climate transition involved reaching out to businesses. In cooperation with Budapest Global NGO, established by the Municipality of Budapest in 2022 and responsible for corporate relations, the Department for Climate and Environmental Affairs reached out to companies through multiple channels following the snowball approach. Together with KÖVET Association, corporate workshops were organized to introduce the ongoing projects and activities being carried out by the Municipality to showcase and identify potential cooperation areas with companies. Chambers of Commerce also provided platforms for the Municipality of Budapest to present the Mission and the City's goals to businesses. As a result of the workshops and presentations, we now have a growing number of interested large enterprises active in Budapest, with whom we are currently discussing the details of our cooperation and have started to negotiate the terms of a Cooperation Agreement.

The next step in the engagement of companies involves organizing regular events under the umbrella of the Budapest Global NGO. These events will facilitate joint actions that support the climate neutrality transition, identify synergies between companies' ongoing climate actions, accelerate knowledge sharing about the urban sustainable agenda, and develop joint actions and projects to overcome systematic barriers. Both Transition Teams - the Net Zero Civic Thematic Group and the Budapest Global Climate Neutrality Platform - will continue to operate, providing a framework for collaborative action and increasing the impact of local government on the wider society and economy.

The municipal elections in June 2024 and the revised regulations on the launch of the newly elected general assemblies (new assemblies will meet for the first time only in October) significantly delay the actions to mobilize the district municipalities of Budapest. In terms of the Mission, district municipalities have authority in a number of areas (including construction law, public land use, parking management, building tax and managing, improving and operating local roads, public spaces and parks). Getting district governments on board would be crucial as they play an important role, alongside civil society organisations, in engaging the public, raising awareness, and encouraging small-scale climate actions at a local level. However, due to the aforementioned limitations, this outreach activity is planned to be launched in October.

In addition, effective cooperation with the Hungarian Government is essential for the success of the climate transition, due to its legislative power, transport in the Budapest agglomeration, domestic and international rail transport and the highly centralised allocation of resources. After joining the Mission, the Capital has referred to or presented its plans and programmes related to the climate transition in several governmental fora (e.g. Partnership Agreement Energy Subcommittee, URBACT workshop, EEEOP+ Monitoring Committee) and continues to promote cooperation, for which a specific action is being formulated.

The above underscores the Municipality's commitment to cooperating with actors of the local urban ecosystem regarding climate action and co-creating the CCC based on participatory processes and the widest possible involvement of stakeholders in its implementation.

The Municipality of Budapest also finds it important that the transition to a climate-neutral Budapest happens in a socially fair and economically sustainable way. For this reason, the Municipality used the Budapest Degrowth Doughnut² created by the Budapest Corvinus University, which analyses the capital's current social and ecological sustainability status (strengths, shortcomings, unexploited

² The Degrowth Donut is a visualisation tool to assess the current capacity of a country, a region or even a city to transition to ecologically and socially sustainable ways of operation. (Budapest Degrowth Donut, Research Report. Corvinus University of Budapest refers to Domazet et al., 2020).

opportunities) in relation to sustainability transition. It identifies important indicators and links them to each other to see the impact they have on one another. The Doughnut allows the Municipality to have a more overarching view of the economic and social aspects of the climate-neutrality transition, consider its effect on other aspects of city life and develop the Action Plan accordingly. For example, extensive renovations of residential buildings will lead to a rise in rents, causing gentrification and increased suburbanization.

Regarding the internal climate transition governance model of the Municipality of Budapest, it consists of three policy cycle elements: (1) decision preparation, (2) decision making, (3) monitoring. (1) In 2020, the Municipality established the Department for Climate and Environmental Affairs (hereinafter the Department). The mission of the Department is to provide an opinion on all decision preparation material from a climate and environmental perspective in the internal coordination of the proposals of the General Assembly and to be involved in the elaboration of the proposals. Due to the role of the Department, decision-makers gain information about the individual proposals' impact on and risks to the climate and the environment. Moreover, the Department can be involved in early-stage preparation of proposals to mitigate risks and increase positive effects.

Regarding the decision-making process (2), as mentioned above, it is only after the official formulation of the General Assembly - in 1st of October 2024 - that the exact responsible people, bodies, and decision-makers can be designated at the political level. However, the current leadership and the Mayor of Budapest are committed to incorporating clear, transparent, and efficient decision-making mechanisms into the governance structure of Budapest, which guarantees an effective climate transition.

To close the policy cycle, the existing yearly environmental reporting process will be amended with biannual extensive monitoring (3), data collection and analysis using the CCC framework of investment and action planning. These reports are published and made available on the website of the Municipality of Budapest.

## Outlook

The three documents of the CCC provide a basis for the planning for the city's climate neutrality transition. They are iterative documents that will be reviewed and modified biannually to account for missing data and sectors and to respond to the changes in the political, social, economic, and technological aspects of the environment under the umbrella of the existing environmental reporting (see above). Deviations from target values will be identified, duly analysed and corrective measures will be defined either in terms of taking actions to address lagging and capital deployment deficiencies more effectively or in terms of adjusting target values (in case of shortcomings in the planning process).

The Municipality's work regarding climate protection will continue, with the pilot project Budapest CARES being the flagship project of the Mission. Stakeholder engagement activity started as part of the CCC process will also resume after the submission, with the hopes of mobilizing further private, public, and civil actors to find synergies, build rapport, and strengthen the city's commitment to climate neutrality.
