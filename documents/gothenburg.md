# Summary

The abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CCC Action Plan) which is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses, and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

In this text the geographical area of Gothenburg is referred to as 'Gothenburg' and the City of Gothenburg as 'the City.'

Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city, is strategically positioned at the heart of Scandinavia, nestled between Oslo and Copenhagen. With its current population of 631,000 residents, Gothenburg acts as a crucial hub for the Västra Götaland Region, known for its robust industrial base and Scandinavia's largest port. The city is on a growth trajectory, aiming to accommodate 700,000 residents by 2035. Gothenburg's economy is bolstered by a diverse industrial base, including major corporations and a variety of small businesses across several sectors, further enriched by significant educational and cultural institutions. Gothenburg possesses a long-standing culture of innovation and collaboration, nurtured through close partnerships between industry, academia, and municipal entities, providing a solid foundation for undertaking the mission of becoming one of the 100 European cities to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

This Action Plan outlines the City's endeavour to become a climate-neutral city by 2030, an ambitious and multifaceted task that encompasses a wide range of strategies, actions, and collaborations across various sectors. The Action Plan outlines the City's current state of climate action (part A), pathways towards achieving climate neutrality (part B), and the enabling factors required to realize this vision (part C).

The City's climate goal for 2030, "a carbon footprint close to zero," has robust support from a broad political majority, and is particularly highlighted by The Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030. This program, applicable to all departments and city-owned companies, represents the overarching document guiding sustainable development efforts within the City. It is implemented through a City-wide Environment Management System in which

committees and boards shall identify and prioritize their environmental and climate measures, and in the program's seven cross-cutting strategies, where committees and boards join forces in areas that require a high degree of collaboration and new cross-cutting solutions.

The City has, during the preparation of this commitment, developed portfolios of action around strategic priorities. Each portfolio addresses various levers: technical, financial, organizational, governance, policy, culture, behavioural, and social. The strategic priorities are:

The intertwined energy and industrial system portfolio
The Port as a lever for reduced heavy transport emissions
Sustainable and efficient mobility
Improvements in the treatment of waste materials
Climate-neutral construction
Capacity for circular economy
Urban farming, green infrastructure, and nature-based solutions

To become climate-neutral by 2030, the City recognizes the need to continue to develop strategies and processes that support joint action plans and broader community engagement. The Climate City Contract has been instrumental in laying the groundwork for these efforts, providing a blueprint for future progress.

This Climate Action Plan is divided into three parts (A-C). Part A involves a detailed assessment of current greenhouse gas emissions, existing policies and strategies, and the identification of systemic barriers and opportunities. The assessment of current greenhouse gas emissions shows that the largest territorial emissions originate from the city-located industry, heating (CHP), and transportation. These areas are in focus in the City's strategic priorities, and the targets are shaped to address them.

The assessment of existing policies and strategies influencing the transition towards climate neutrality shows a complex landscape of international, national, and local agreements, policies, plans, and guidelines. It reveals strengths in the well-anchored and widespread Environment and Climate Program, and how it establishes the Environmental Management System and the strategies

as strong tools for its implementation. At the same time, areas to develop include the faster implementation of planned measures, the scaling-up of fruitful solutions, the need to develop co-created climate mitigation action plans, and the need for deeper integration of social sustainability considerations to ensure a just transition.

For addressing emissions and managing residual emissions, the City utilized NetZeroCities' Economic Tool. The tool projected a 77% reduction in territorial emissions by 2030 resulting in a 3% emissions gap to be addressed, and a need for handling of residual emissions of 20%. However, it's noteworthy that Gothenburg will be affecting emission reductions from an already relatively low starting point compared to other European cities. This is primarily due to the comparatively low emissions from the energy system, particularly electricity production. To illustrate, the average EU-27 territorial per capita emissions were 8.4 metric tons of CO2 equivalents in 2018 (EUROSTAT), compared to Gothenburg's 4.3 metric tons. An 80% reduction in emissions would therefore leave 1.68 metric tons per capita for an average European city, whereas Gothenburg's pathway towards a 77% reduction suggests 0.98 metric tons by 2030, predicted population change included. An important part of future iterations of the Climate City Contract will thus be to explore further reduction potential as well as compensation possibilities.

Part A concludes with the identification of systemic barriers and solutions. The City has to foster transition in a range of socio-technical systems, each with its range of stakeholders. Opportunities for systems change identified revolve around innovative collaborations and the utilization of digitalization and visualization tools to support decision-making and stakeholder engagement. The City aims to leverage its strong knowledge base, innovative culture, and the co-benefits of climate measures to drive forward the transition towards climate neutrality, as well as to further engage citizens in the transition process, recognizing the importance of societal norms and behaviour in achieving sustainability goals. The action plan also identifies several systemic barriers that could hinder progress, including knowledge gaps, system inertia, fragmented innovation, and financial constraints.

Part B of the action plan describes decided and planned actions in terms of systemic levers and action portfolios for the following fields of action:

Energy system (including industry)
City of Gothenburg
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Mobility &amp; transport
Waste &amp; circular economy
Built environment
Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions

Part B also lists indicators for monitoring, evaluation and learning.

Part C delves into governance and social innovation interventions in Gothenburg, aimed at overcoming systemic barriers and exploiting opportunities for climate neutrality. It details the City's efforts in developing governance innovations and provides examples of collaborations across multiple levels and actors, citizen inclusion, and social innovations. The development of a Climate Transition Function is emphasized as a means to enhance strategic intelligence and collaboration across sectors and actors. Coupled with the introduction of a Climate Budget and continued development of existing cross-cutting strategies, further improvement is expected in collaborative decision-making, mobilisation of actors and alignment of actions. Part C also showcases examples of social innovation aimed at addressing climate change, including citizen inclusion interventions to further democratise the climate action process, encouraging public involvement and leveraging community-driven initiatives for a more sustainable Gothenburg. These interventions collectively strive to create a just, inclusive, and sustainable transition for Gothenburg, reinforcing the City's leadership in climate action and social innovation.

Looking ahead, the City is committed to continuously evaluating and updating its Climate Neutrality Action Plan, integrating new insights and adapting strategies as necessary. This iterative process is crucial for staying on track toward the 2030 goal and responding effectively to the evolving landscape of climate action.

# 1 Introduction

The introduction outlines the local geographic and policy context in which the City's 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan is being developed and describes the gap it addresses in broad terms.

# Introduction

In this text the geographical area of Gothenburg is referred to as 'Gothenburg' and the City of Gothenburg (organisation) as 'the City'.

# A city in transformation – navigating growth with high climate ambitions

Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city, holds a strategic position at the heart of Scandinavia, nestled between Oslo and Copenhagen. With a current population of 631,000 residents, Gothenburg serves as a pivotal hub for the Västra Götaland Region, renowned for its robust industrial base and Scandinavia's largest port. As the City embarks on a trajectory of growth, with plans to accommodate 700,000 residents by 2035, the imperative of sustainable development takes centre stage.

The City's industrial landscape is diverse, hosting multinational corporations such as Volvo and SKF, alongside small businesses and specialized clusters across 50 sectors. This economic variety is matched by a rich cultural and educational scene, with two universities and a significant student population fuelling innovation and creativity. Gothenburg's commitment to sustainability is evident in its efforts to transform into a green urban area, redeveloping former industrial zones into new districts and improving infrastructure to encourage public transport and cycling.

With a long-standing tradition of innovation, Gothenburg fosters collaboration within the community and supports robust innovation systems in the region. Since 2013, the City has been host to one of Sweden's six designated Innovation Platforms, and it is also home to several test beds for innovation in technology as well as innovations in services and social collaboration, in both simulated and real environments. The Gothenburg region is gaining an extensive part of national R&amp;I funding and in 2018, the City was a finalist for the European Capital of Innovation (ICapital) award.

Gothenburg's proactive stance on climate and environmental issues is deeply ingrained. The adoption of its first climate program in 2014 outlined a comprehensive strategy spanning education, community planning, energy, transport, and consumption. Large-scale infrastructure projects like 'The West Link' underscore the City's commitment to sustainable mobility. By reporting its greenhouse gas inventory to the Covenant of Mayors and aligning with the EU's climate goals, Gothenburg demonstrates its dedication to reducing emissions and contributing to the vision of a climate-neutral continent by 2050.

In 2022, Gothenburg was honoured as one of 100 European cities stated to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 and serve as a frontrunner for all European cities by 2050. Armed with a clear vision, ambition, and preparedness, the City is poised to take on the EU mission and collaborate with cities across Europe to realize this vision. Today, Gothenburg is navigating its growth phase with a focus on sustainable urban development, aiming to balance its industrial heritage with environmental responsibility. The City's longstanding commitment to climate and environmental issues, along with its culture of collaboration and innovation, places it on a path toward becoming an international leader in sustainability.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

Climate neutrality, as defined by the Mission, entails achieving net-zero GHG emissions by minimizing emissions within the territory as much as possible and compensating for any remaining residual emissions (ideally no more than 20 per cent). This strategy encompasses Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from operations within the territory, whereas Scope 3 emissions are not currently mandated. Large-scale energy production or industrial facilities registered under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) may be exempted.

In the City of Gothenburg, the climate target for 2030 is formulated as “Gothenburg's climate footprint is close to zero”. The goal is detailed in the Environment and Climate Program for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030, which was adopted by a large political majority in the City Council in 2021. The goal applies to all the City’s administrations and City-owned companies. Despite shifts in the political leadership, the goal remains unchanged. The current administration has directed increased actions in the 2024 budget to ensure this objective is met. According to the budget, Gothenburg shall be a forerunner in environmental and climate work, while also leading a just transition where it is easy for everyone to be part of the solution, residents as well as businesses and academia.

The climate goal of the City of Gothenburg has a broader scope than required in the Mission. The goal targets emissions from both a territorial and a consumption-based perspective, see below.

Indicators of the Climate goal: Gothenburg's climate footprint is close to zero.

|  Indicator | Goal | Base value (CO2e per habitant and year) | Target 2030 (CO2e per habitant and year) | Scope  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Territorial emissions | Yearly reduction of at least 10.3% | 4.3 ton (2018) | 1.2 ton | All Scope 1 emissions in the geographical area of Gothenburg municipality  |
|  Consumption-based emissions | Yearly reduction of at least 7.6% | 9.25 ton (2017) | 3.3 ton | Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions allocated to goods and services consumed by the people of Gothenburg, no matter where they  |

|   |  |  |  | are produced, (including public consumption).  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

The territorial, or geographic, perspective includes all GHG emissions within the geographic area of Gothenburg no matter where in the world the goods and services are consumed. The consumption-based perspective includes all emissions caused by goods and services consumed by the people of Gothenburg (including public procurement), no matter where in the world they are produced. The perspectives are overlapping and provide different ways of looking at partly the same emissions, see figure A1.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure A1 - The image illustrates different perspectives on Gothenburg's climate footprint

The territorial emissions adhere to the same geographical boundary as the city administrative boundary, and can be described as all climate emissions emitted in the "greater city" of Gothenburg municipality. The target includes emissions from both traded and non-traded sectors and involves scope 1 emissions from all sectors, including stationary energy, transport, waste/wastewater, IPPU and AFOLU. The consumption-based emissions include scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from goods and services consumed by the people of Gothenburg, including public consumption. Scope 1-3 emissions of goods and services procured by the City are thus included in this indicator.

The geographical and the consumption-based emissions are partly overlapping. They shall be seen as two different perspectives on the goal of "close to zero" and are not additive between the logic of different scopes. Following the above, the close-to-zero-goal of Gothenburg has a different scope and target value than the Mission's "climate neutrality". The system boundary of the Gothenburg goal is broader. It includes Scope 1 emissions of all industries in the territory, also traded emissions.

It also includes scope 1-3 emissions of all goods and services consumed in the consumption-based perspective. This is summarized in table I-1.1.

|  Table I-1.1: Climate Neutrality Target by 2030  |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Sectors | Scope 1 | Scope 2 | Scope 3  |
|  Stationary energy | Included in territorial target | Included in consumption-based target for products and services consumed within Gothenburg | Included in consumption-based target for products and services consumed within Gothenburg  |
|  Transport | Included in territorial target | Included in consumption-based target for products and services consumed within Gothenburg | Included in consumption-based target for products and services consumed within Gothenburg  |

As seen from the Climate Action and Investment Plans, Gothenburg is anticipated to achieve a 77% reduction in territorial emissions. This is slightly less than the 80 per cent recommended for climate neutrality in the Mission, and the City will continue to develop measures to address the remaining 3%. It is also important to note that Gothenburg will manage emission reductions from a relatively low starting point in comparison with other European cities. This is due to relatively low emissions from the energy system, primarily electricity production. To illustrate this, the general EU-27 territorial per capita emissions were 8.4 tonnes of CO2 equivalents in 2018 (EUROSTAT), compared to Gothenburg's 4.3 tonnes. An 80% reduction of emissions will thus result in 1.68 tonnes remaining for an average European city, whereas Gothenburg's corresponding pathway of 77% reduction means 0.98 tonnes in 2030, predicted population change included.

Plans for addressing the residual emissions of Gothenburg in 2030 will constitute an important part of upcoming iterations of the Climate City Contract. Further measures will be explored to increase the reduction rate until 2030. The City and its stakeholders are also exploring different ways of neutralizing emissions through carbon sinks and carbon credits. Pilot studies on how to define and calculate such sinks and credits, as well as ensure their additionality, are currently being made by the City together with stakeholders in the building and construction sector.

## City structure with transformative potential

The City is organized into public administrations and municipal companies, each led by a political committee or board (see figure A2 below). On behalf of the City Executive Board, the City Management Office is responsible for the overall management, governance and follow-up of the administrations and the companies. Göteborgs Stadshus AB is the parent company of the City of Gothenburg's corporate group. The City Council sets goals and assignments for the City's administrations and companies. The City Executive Board manages and coordinates municipal operations and is responsible for municipal finances.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure A2 – the City's structure 2024.

The City's administrations are responsible for the daily operations of the various activities that apply to the entire city, such as education, care, urban building, traffic and more. In addition, the City has several municipal-owned companies which are largely owned by the municipality and governed by corporate boards. The companies work on behalf of the politicians and are organized under Stadshus AB. The operations range from private apartments and cultural experiences to the delivery of energy and running the largest port in the Nordic region.

The companies, as well as the administrations, execute their operations in line with political directives, including the goals of the Environment and Climate Program. The wide scope of
City of Gothenburg

operations and sectors handled within the municipality makes the City uniquely positioned to have a large impact on several key areas critical for the green transition, such as:

Planning urban development and traffic infrastructure to support sustainability.
Leveraging procurement processes to enforce environmental standards.
Managing energy production and infrastructure to enhance efficiency and reduce emissions.
Implementing construction practices that minimize climate impact.
Optimizing water and wastewater treatment processes for reduced environmental footprint.
Influencing sustainable energy use and reducing climate impact through policy, supervision, and community engagement.
Promoting sustainable lifestyles and consumption through education and guidance.
Collaborating with local businesses to foster their role in the ecological transition.

## Environmental management for systemic improvements and cross-sector innovation

The Environment and Climate Programme stipulates two main tools for its execution: The environmental management system and the City "strategies". All companies and administrations are obliged to implement an environmental management system and implement climate measures according to their main environmental impact as well as the goals of the Environment and Climate Program. In this way, all City administrations and companies, systematically contribute to the climate goal from the point of view of their own operations.

The second tool is the seven cross-cutting strategies, that aim to bring about change-driven development in areas where a city-wide perspective and collaboration between administrations and companies are necessary. The strategies are:

We act as forerunners.
We create conditions for sustainable living.
We drive the development of a circular economy.
We work strategically on financing to accelerate the transition.
We drive the development of sustainable construction.
We plan for a green and resilient city.
City of Gothenburg

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

We drive the development of sustainable transportation.

In addition to the two tools of the Environmental and Climate program, the City has also established a "Climate Transition Function", intending to form the basis and conditions for effective decision-making toward climate transition in Gothenburg. The Climate Transition Function was initiated in 2020, as part of the City's commitment to a National Climate Contract developed within the framework of Viable Cities. Today the function consists of a Climate Transition Team headed by the Environmental Administration and is tasked with maintaining and developing collaboration with internal and external stakeholders, to promote systemic learning with a focus on change management.

To further support the City's climate transition, 'The Gothenburg Climate Council' was set up in 2022. The council consists of seven independent researchers tasked with analysing Gothenburg's climate work as well as to advise and propose measures to reduce climate impact thus helping the City of Gothenburg achieve its climate goals.

Closing the GAP

The climate goal is followed up biannually by the Environmental Administration. The latest review from 2023 shows that substantial efforts to reduce climate impact are being made, but progress is too slow. Figure A3 shows geographical emissions per inhabitant and year, and what is needed to reach the target (red line). The trend (dotted line) shows decreasing emissions over time, but at a too slow pace to meet the target. System changes are needed with new ways of prioritizing and co-creating solutions together with the public sector, businesses and households. Innovation and collaboration are also needed across sectors to enable systemic transition.

As seen in Figure A3, the lion's share of Gothenburg's territorial emissions come from energy, industry and transport. These sectors are also closely intertwined, not least by a well-developed district heating network that utilizes the industry's waste heat. Half of the emissions in Gothenburg come from two refineries, not owned by the City. Other major emitters are waste incineration and traffic.

Several transformations are needed for climate transition, summarized in portfolios of action around seven strategic priorities:

The intertwined energy and industrial system portfolio
The Port as a lever for reduced heavy transport emissions
Sustainable and efficient mobility
Improvements in waste treatment
Climate-neutral construction
Capacity for circular economy
Urban farming, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions

The technical transformations needed are associated with large investments. The Climate Council states in its first report (in 2023) that to meet the City's targets, the refineries must either switch to renewable raw materials or capture and store carbon dioxide. Both measures require very large investments, where actors in Gothenburg, the City as well as industries, need to find and agree on ways to finance the long-term investments.

In addition, many of the technical shifts needed are also dependent on national and international development, such as the development of green technologies and products, national policies (e.g. for GHG reduction quotas in petrol and diesel), development of electricity supply and electric grid, etc.

To successfully transform into a climate-neutral city, the City recognizes that while many of the required changes are technological, achieving this goal also demands innovation in organization, governance, culture, behaviour and collaboration. The City acknowledges the need for continued development in governance structures, division of responsibilities, and cooperation models to drive the necessary systemic change.

Gothenburg's control over a broad array of policy instruments—regulatory, economic, and voluntary—is a crucial asset. However, for Gothenburg to become an environmentally and climate-sustainable city, it must make a concerted effort and accelerate the implementation pace.

Key to this endeavour is strengthened coordination between the City, trade and industry, inhabitants, academia, other cities, and actors. This collaboration is vital for Gothenburg to emerge as a leader in addressing environmental and climate issues. Many collaborations are also already

set, for example, Strategic partnership with Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg around a fossil-free Gothenburg, multi-actor commitments on circular construction with 50 actors in the construction industry chain, and joint strategy development for urban transition in the Gothenburg region to name a few initiatives (see section C.1 for a more comprehensive list).

The City has long-standing experience with the quadruple-helix model, which involves cooperation with industry, academia, research institutes, science parks, and citizens. The City has already established testbeds encouraging stakeholders to collaborate and learn together, fostering climate transition through new technologies, services, ideas, or operational methods. Nevertheless, there is a need for improved methods to scale up projects, initiatives, and innovations for full implementation.

## National and international collaboration

Gothenburg demonstrates a steadfast commitment to sustainable development and proactive collaboration with other cities, both nationally and internationally.

By joining forces with other municipalities and national authorities, Gothenburg underscores its dedication to driving systemic change at the national level. In 2020, the City signed the first national climate contract, a collaborative effort among 23 municipalities and six national authorities. This initiative, led by the Viable Cities national innovation program, aims to accelerate the climate transition in alignment with the Paris Agreement and Agenda 2030. At the regional level, Gothenburg has embraced the 'Municipalities' Climate Pledges' of the county, comprising 30 concrete measures aimed at reducing emissions by approximately 75,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents. These collectively agreed-upon pledges reflect the City's commitment to collaborative, region-wide efforts towards emission reduction and sustainability.

Internationally, Gothenburg's proactive approach to sustainability has garnered recognition and engagement. The City's consistent recognition as a recipient of the Leadership award in the Global Destination Sustainability Index, from 2016 to 2023, is one example. In 2022 Gothenburg was selected as one of 100 European cities to be climate neutral in 2030 and to be a forerunner for all European cities by 2050. Gothenburg also has a role as one of ten mentor cities within the European Commission's Intelligent Cities Challenge. By sharing its expertise and insights with 65 other

European cities, Gothenburg actively contributes to advancing sustainable urban development across borders.

The City has been involved in the EU Adaptation Mission since September 2022, to learn from other European regions in linking climate adaptation measures to emergency services. Gothenburg is developing a Climate Adaptation Plan (according to the RAST framework as developed by the European Commission) which will be politically approved in the middle of 2024 and implemented between 2024 – 2026. Priority areas and key measures have been identified. Many of the measures identified will have the potential to tackle both climate adaptation and mitigation and therefore can be used to generate synergies with the 100 Cities Mission.

## Advancing the transition – The City’s evolving approach to climate action

As outlined above, the City has a robust management structure with climate goals well integrated into ordinary governance structures. Yet, the climate challenge remains significant, and rapid societal transformation is imperative. Consequently, Gothenburg continually refines its working processes. In this process, the forming of the first Climate City Contract has contributed to further governance development.

### 1. Building a strong Mandate

The City's climate goals are deeply embedded in its ordinary governance structures, notably outlined in the Environmental and Climate Program, backed by a broad political consensus. Central to this program is the aim for near-zero emissions, driving action across all municipal administrations and companies. The two main tools for the program execution, the environmental management system and the seven joint strategies, are broadly recognized and gradually show results. Together they help actors in the City navigate action in-house as well as promote cross-functional innovation. Collaboration with academia and industry is robust, reflecting a shared commitment to achieve common climate goals. The award of Gothenburg as one of 100 selected cities in Europe to lead climate transition has further encouraged this joint ambition of Gothenburg as forerunner of climate mitigation.

To address conflicts and synergies between development and a just climate transition, the City also needs to build a strong mandate in the climate work together with citizens and civil society. As part of

this, the City is currently pilot testing a Citizens' Lab, with the aim of identifying tools, methods and processes for increased and improved citizens' interaction and engagement in climate transition. Together with the development of platforms for dialogue, infrastructure for democratic participation, social innovation interventions and other capacity-building interventions, the City will strengthen the buy-in and accelerate the transition.

## 2. Understanding the system

The City has many ways to assess its impact and understand its needs. To identify systemic barriers and opportunities for transition is, for example, at the core of the seven strategies. Every two years, a comprehensive evaluation is carried out of all the goals and sub-goals within the environment and climate program. The evaluation is carried out by the Environmental Administration in close collaboration with City administrations and companies. In addition to these joint analyses and evaluations, each administration and company also have their analyses, for individual operations or cross-cutting areas.

Gothenburg is committed to enhancing its data collection mechanisms to facilitate informed decision-making. By leveraging tools like the Stratsys reporting system used in other city governance tasks, the City aims to quantify the impact of various measures and track progress toward its climate goals more systematically.

With support from the work on the European Climate City Contract and the National Climate Contract, the work has begun to develop a first Climate Transition Strategy. The strategy aims to provide a shared understanding of the status of the City's climate change work, including the effect of already proposed measures, as well as what further needs to be done to reach the climate goal. The strategy will be based on trend analysis and risk analysis, and include scenarios showing possible pathways for Reaching climate neutrality.

## 3. Co-Creating an Action Portfolio

City action for climate change includes measures of all of the 57 administrations and companies of the City. To further mobilize resources and drive alignment of actions for systemic change, the City is currently exploring the introduction of a 'Climate Budget'. The budget will offer a strategic framework
City of Gothenburg
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

for estimating the impact of planned measures on emissions across organizations, fostering increased accountability and alignment of actions. Climate budget has been implemented in other cities, for example in Sweden in Uppsala and Kalmar, with good results. Gothenburg is following the work closely.

A cornerstone of Gothenburg's climate strategy will also be the formulation of a comprehensive Climate Neutrality Action Plan, identifying the actions needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and what additional efforts and measures are required. The Climate City Contract process has been a very valuable foundation for this work, leading to the first version of the plan. The plan will be continuously updated and revised to form the basis of a common action portfolio of the City. This 2030 Climate Neutral Action Plan, and its corresponding Climate Neutral Investment Plan, will be an integral and integrated aspect of the City's climate work and will be followed up, revised and evaluated in conjunction with other governing documents.

# The Climate City Contract– a catalyst for enhanced innovation and alignment

Through the ongoing process of the Climate City Contract, administrations and city companies have joined forces to identify and harmonize strategies and priorities, initiating and fostering a shared vision for a green transition.

The City's commitment to initiatives such as the EU Covenant of Mayors (EUCoM) and the national climate contract of Viable Cities remains. The CCC Action Plan concretize and further develops the measures planned within these contexts, positioning them within a systemic perspective on transition towards climate neutrality. Thus, the CCC Action Plan does not replace existing commitments and plans. Rather, it serves as a focal point for integrating planned actions and lays the groundwork for further co-creation of strategies and investment plans, in collaboration with actors in the Gothenburg community.

The work conducted under the Climate City Contract has proved invaluable for aligning the City's climate actions. With fifty-seven public administrations and municipal-owned companies, the overview created through the mission label process is deemed essential. It aids in aligning actions with the City's numerous strategies, programs, plans, and action plans.

The establishment of the Local Transition Team, comprising civil servants from various City administrations and companies, has played a pivotal role in leading this effort. The team has been instrumental in coordinating strategic endeavours across diverse administrations and agencies. This collaborative endeavour has not only laid the foundation for further cooperation but has also led to the permanent formation of the team as part of the Climate Transition Function.

Facilitating common priorities across all stakeholders in Gothenburg is crucial to ensuring a unified approach to a green transition. The Climate City Contract process has underscored the need for intensified collaborative efforts with stakeholders to identify shared priorities and timelines, facilitating collective action towards a sustainable future. A priority in the next version of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan is a larger share of co-creation with different stakeholder groups in Gothenburg.

The main components of the Climate City Contract, including commitments, action plan, and investment plan, are already being integrated into the working processes of the Climate Transition Function for regular iterations and updates. Future iterations will address current gaps in data and calculations through improved data management, such as through a climate budget process. Future iterations will also involve a greater engagement of external stakeholders to identify common priorities and timelines, facilitating collective action and systemic change towards a climate neutral Gothenburg.

Module A-1 "Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory" details and describes the latest GHG inventory, where available from 2018 or more recent, referring to a clearly stated geographic boundary. The aim of this section is to establish the emission baseline and to establish the emissions gap to 2030 climate neutrality

according to the inventory specifications defined in the Cities Mission's Info Kit for Cities† and the process outlined in the CCC Action Plan Guidance and Explanations.

# GhG Emissions Baseline inventory

The City of Gothenburg is a 'Greater City' with an administrative boundary of 718 sq km and it is this administrative boundary that corresponds to the City's climate neutrality target. The City will address all Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) and sectors/sources of emissions to reach climate neutrality by 2030 as defined by the Cities Mission (Scope 1 &amp; 2). Regarding scope 3, the City has a high ambition to work with this scope.

Since 2005, the City of Gothenburg has undertaken an inventory of GHG emissions, and the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC) has been applied. Every year, the City reports to CDP/ICLEI, the latest year was 2023 and included data from 2020. The latest inventory is uploaded with the CCC.

The inventory, which is also reported to the Covenant of Mayors covers data required to follow the climate-neutrality target. All Greenhouse Gas Emissions are included in the inventory, however only CO2e is presented in this document. Scope 3 is not included. There are climate footprints for the entire municipality of Gothenburg with no geographical areas excluded. The assessment shows that available data is sufficient to track the City's progress toward its targets.

The result from the inventory shows that the largest emissions originate from the city-located energy industry, the heating (CHP), and the transportation. These areas are in focus in the City's strategic priorities and the targets are shaped to address them.

The City has access to information on emissions of greenhouse gases in Gothenburg from several different national sources such as the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, SMHI (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute) and Statistics Sweden. The Stockholm Environmental Institute, in collaboration with Viable Cities, has developed a model to estimate citizens' consumption-based emissions and a tool, the 'Konsumtionskompassen', with a resolution at postcode level and this information is available in the City's map tool GoKart.

It is challenging for the City to interpret climate data and calculations at different levels and for different purposes. However, there are several initiatives in the City where climate calculations are made at different levels and with different purposes. Within the City's food supply/meals organisation for example, climate calculations have been made with the aim of increasing knowledge of how different raw materials affect the climate footprint of meals and, through conscious choice of raw materials with less climate impact, contribute to reducing the climate footprint of the City's meals.

There are examples from administrations and companies that perform climate calculations in connection with investment projects. Through climate calculations at an early stage, possible choices can be identified that can help to reduce climate impact. For example, the Port of Gothenburg has carried out climate calculations for several projects and has thus obtained a picture of the future climate footprint of planned measures and whether these are sufficient or whether further efforts are required to achieve set targets. Through an environmental pendulum analysis, the Purchasing and Procurement Administration has mapped the climate impact of the City of Gothenburg's purchases in 2020.

From 1 January 2022, the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning requires a climate declaration for the construction of new buildings. This means that developers must report the climate impact of a new building. Within the City and the strategy for sustainable construction, a method is being developed for calculating the climate footprint when renovating buildings and for calculating the climate footprint when constructing facilities.

# Gothenburg's energy system

The figure below displays Gothenburg's energy use over time. Despite Gothenburg having a growing population, energy use has been fairly constant over recent years due to decreasing per-capita energy use. Gothenburg's transportation is relatively car-dependent compared to other European cities of a similar size, mainly due to its infrastructure and physical structure. Energy use in the industrial sector is dominated by refineries. The City has a relatively large district heating system, which to a large extent relies on waste heat from the refineries and combined heat and power garbage incineration. There are limited opportunities for land-based wind power within the municipality, but solar power is increasingly being deployed.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure A5 – Total energy use in Gothenburg 2010-2018 per sector.

The Energy plan defines several measures that should be carried out before a certain point in time. Each measure has at least one actor (committee or board) that is responsible for its implementation. The measures are divided into eight topics and will be continually reviewed, assessed and, if necessary, updated several times until 2030. This will increase the possibilities for the plan to stay adequate in relation to changing conditions (e.g. technological development):

Flexible and robust energy system
Energy efficiency in the municipal sector
Energy efficiency in the private sector
Renewable electricity
Renewable and recovered heat
Renewable and recovered cold
Energy-efficient and fossil-free transport and machinery
Carbon capture and storage

The measures are quite different by nature. Types of measures represented in the plan include:

Investigations (e.g. investigate whether a low-emission zone is appropriate within parts of the City)
City of Gothenburg
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Investments (e.g. investing in new infrastructure)
Processes (e.g. implementing processes for how to include solar energy technologies in construction/renovation)
Requirements (e.g. demanding that certain committees or boards upgrade their lighting or machinery to more sustainable options)
Incentives (e.g. adjusting district heating charges)

# Waste

Every municipality in the Greater Gothenburg Region has a waste management plan. Since the residents of these municipalities travel across the municipal borders on a daily basis, 13 municipalities (Ale, Alingsås, Gothenburg, Härryda, Kungsbacka, Kungälv, Lerum, Lilla Edet, Mölndal, Partille, Stenungsund, Tjörn and Öckerö) have drawn up common goals for sustainable waste management.

The EU's overall waste strategy, known as the 'waste hierarchy', permeates the waste plan. The 'waste hierarchy' is about working preventively to avoid waste arising, reducing the danger of waste, detoxifying cycles, using waste as the resource it actually is and taking care of the waste that cannot be reused or recycled safely.

The purpose of the waste plan is to prevent waste and develop management of the waste that nevertheless occurs. When planning the new waste plan's target areas, requirements in legislation and evaluation of previous work with the waste plan have been taken into account. Under each target area in the new waste plan, both targets and action areas have been developed. The plan also describes the tools that are planned to be used and how the goals are measured and followed up.

The six target areas in the City's waste plan 2021-2030 are:

Prevention: Waste must be reduced from households and the City's operations – only then will the environmental impact and costs be reduced.
Reuse: Everything that can be reused should be reused.
Collection &amp; recycling: Should be done in the best possible way.
Urban planning: Waste management must have an obvious role in all stages of urban planning.
User focus: Users must be satisfied and find it easy to contribute to sustainable waste management.
Litter: Beaches, natural areas and built-up areas must be attractive environments without litter.

## Transport

Road traffic is the second largest source of geographical greenhouse gas emissions in Gothenburg, just below about 20 % of total emissions. As a large city, Gothenburg has a greater potential to increase walking, cycling and public transport, as well as shifting to more efficient freight transport, compared to other parts of Sweden where the population density is lower. The ambitions regarding the decrease in transport emissions are therefore higher compared to the corresponding national goal. The City's ambition is that the climate impact from transportation will be reduced by at least 90 % by 2030 and that the volume of motorized traffic will be reduced by 25 %. Reaching the targets will require a shift from car travel to walking, cycling and public transportation, and freight transport from road to rail and waterborne transport. Furthermore, the use of fossil fuels needs to stop and be replaced by different renewable fuels, electric or hydrogen-driven vehicles. Renewable fuels will not be sufficient

for the same volume of road traffic as today, nor will they be sufficient for shipping, aviation, work machinery and other sectors. That is why the volume of traffic needs to be reduced as well.

The Port of Gothenburg is Scandinavia's largest port and a central node in Sweden's transport system. This provides the opportunity for the City of Gothenburg to act as a forerunner and become a hub for the climate transition of the transport system for Northern Europe.

: Environmental values for delivered district heating 2020 [Göteborg Energi](Göteborg Energi)
(Please specify for primary energy type and GHG emission factor according to the methodology used).

**Emission factor for electricity**

For electricity, an emission factor for the Nordic electricity mix is used. The GHG Protocol provides guidance on how to choose emission factors and offers calculation tools with integrated emission factors for electricity. The GHG Protocol recommends primarily using market-based electricity figures. Market-based means that the emission factor is based on what is purchased, for example, an electricity mix from a specific supplier. Sweden is connected to the European Energy Certificate System AIB, and it is possible to use the market-based method and thereby account for, for example, wind or solar power.

**IVL (Swedish Environmental Institute)** has, on behalf of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, developed emission factors for the Nordic electricity mix, taking into account import and export, where a breakdown of direct and indirect emissions is also presented to facilitate reporting according to the GHG Protocol's scope.

## 2.2 Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

Module A-2 “Current Policies and Strategies” lists and assesses existing policies, strategies, initiatives, or regulations from local, regional, and national level, relevant to the City’s climate neutrality transition. This assessment contributes to identifying the gap (if any) between the emissions reduction due to existing initiatives and the City’s 2030 climate neutrality target. Filling this gap by identifying additional actions and levers to achieve the City’s emission reduction target is the focus of this Action Plan. The assessment of current policies and strategies offers hence a starting point for exploring the impact pathways (See Part C).

# A-2.1: Description &amp; assessment of policies

The starting points for the governance of the City of Gothenburg are laws and constitutions, the political will and the City's inhabitants, users and customers. The governance structure of Sweden is an important aspect as the responsibilities of local, regional and national governments are clearly defined (for example, the region is responsible for transport and health care). The City's politicians describe through governing documents how they want to realize the political will. The City of Gothenburg is governed by the governing documents adopted by the City Council and the City Executive Board. In addition, the boards and corporate boards determine their own governing documents for their own activities. The municipality's budget is the overriding and superior governing document for the City Councils and corporate boards.

There are international agreements in the environmental field such as the Paris Agreement, Agenda 2030 and legislation such as EU directives. There is also national legislation such as the Environmental Code and related environmental quality standards. The goal of the Environmental Code is to promote sustainable development for the current and coming generations to live in a good and healthy environment. Environmental quality standards reflect the minimum acceptable environmental quality or the desired environmental state. In addition to the legislation, there is the national system of environmental goals which contains the goals for the environment on a national level. The purpose of the environmental goals is to provide a long-term objective for environmental policy and to serve as a guide for society's environmental work as a whole. These are also a realization of the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals, Agenda 2030.

Figure A8 – The governance system in the City of Gothenburg.

The Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030, which applies to all committees and boards of the City of Gothenburg is the guide and the shared platform for the City's strategic long-term work for the climate and the environment. It is the comprehensive governing document for work within the environmental dimension of sustainable development in the City of Gothenburg. The programme helps drive the City of Gothenburg to transition into an environmentally sustainable society meaning that Gothenburg will become one of the world's most progressive cities when it comes to preventing and addressing environmental and climate problems. The coordination between the City of Gothenburg and trade and industry, inhabitants, academia, other cities and other actors is a prerequisite to succeed with this.

The starting point of the Environment and Climate Programme is the UN's Sustainable Development Goals Agenda 2030, Sweden's national environmental goals system, the Paris Agreement, and the challenges that Gothenburg as a community and the City of Gothenburg as an organization face in order to make the transition to an environmentally sustainable society.

Figure A9 - Summary of the objective, the environmental goals, sub-goals and strategies of the Environment and Climate Programme. The picture is framed by the environmental management system's classification, which is an important part of the implementation of the programme.

The programme is implemented by the following two toolboxes:

A City-wide Environment Management System - all committees and boards shall in their regular operational planning, identify and prioritize the environmental and climate measures required to be carried out in their respective areas of responsibility for the City to reach its climate goals. This is reported and followed up every year. (Rapport 2023:13 Uppföljning av Göteborgs Stads systematiska miljöarbete 2023 (goteborg.se)
City of Gothenburg
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
2

Through the programme's seven cross-cutting strategies (explained more in sections B and C), committees and boards join forces in areas that require a high degree of collaboration and new cross-cutting solutions. The strategies aim to bring about change-driven development to accelerate the transition to a sustainable city. (Strategierna sammanfattar arbetet hittills - Miljö och klimat Göteborg 2030 - Göteborgs Stad (goteborg.se)

Gothenburg has several policy documents, projects and processes that wholly or partly concern the climate area and that affect or are affected by the climate programme. Below, those most relevant are described:

**Budget**: Decided annually, the City of Gothenburg's budget is the comprehensive and overarching governing document for all boards and committees. The role of the budget is to indicate the City Council's prioritized goals and directions within the financial framework and current legislation, including prioritised goals for the climate. Plans, programs, guidelines and policies that the City Council has adopted must be followed and implemented but are subordinate to the budget.

Within each sector, there are also several collaboration platforms where collaboration and cooperation with actors from business, academia and civil society take place. Many of the City's programmes and plans affect the City's ability to achieve the climate goals:

**Energy**: The City of Gothenburg's energy plan 2022-2030 identifies several measures to ensure a sustainable, flexible and capacity-secure energy system. The City is also investigating the possibility of creating conditions for carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) together with industry players.

**Housing and construction**: Programme for environmentally friendly construction, the City of Gothenburg's programme for housing supply 2021-2026, the City of Gothenburg's programme for local supply 2020-2026 and associated plans.

**Mobility**: A large part of the city's climate impact comes from transport. The development of the City's transport infrastructure is governed, among other things, by the Gothenburg 2035: Traffic

strategy for a close-knit city, the City of Gothenburg's freight plan 2024 - 2035, the Cycling Programme for a close-knit city 2015-2025, the City of Gothenburg's electrification plan 2022-2030 and the Målbild koll 2035.

Circular economy and water and wastewater: The City's work on water and wastewater management, waste minimisation and increased circularity is governed by the City of Gothenburg's waste plan 2021-2030 and the Region's water supply plan. The purpose of the waste plan is to prevent waste and develop the management of the waste that nevertheless arises. Several of the plan's target areas have a major direct or indirect impact on the City's climate footprint.

Business cooperation: The City of Gothenburg's business strategy programme for 2023-2035 has the objective "Gothenburg is an international model for the ability to cooperate - in an environment where people develop and thrive. The business community has full support from the City and can feel proud to operate in one of the world's most innovative metropolitan regions".

Land use and planning: The City can contribute to reducing the climate impact of transport in particular through the City of Gothenburg's Comprehensive Plan, the City of Gothenburg's Forestry Plan and climate-smart planning that contributes to a structure that makes it possible to be close to workplaces, public services, leisure facilities and shops, so that many people choose to walk, cycle and use public transport rather than take the car.

Tourism, culture and leisure: The City of Gothenburg's programme for destination development 2023-2030 aims to ensure that the tourism industry grows and at the same time contributes to the development of people and living environments, and the ambition is to be an environmentally and climate-smart destination with a climate footprint close to zero, with industry players and visitors contributing to an ecologically sustainable destination.

Care and school: A sector with the opportunity to reduce its own and others' consumption-based emissions through indirect impact, see "Guideline for learning about sustainable development and systematic environmental work in primary and secondary schools".

Equality and inclusion: How the City works for equality and inclusion related to climate mitigation is important to enable a just climate transition. Gothenburg City's programme for an equal city has goals and strategies that aim for the City to become an equal city, concerning people's living conditions.

Other: This includes, for example, the Green Bond Framework, the Knowledge Centre for Digitalisation and the City of Gothenburg's guidelines for purchasing and procurement.

## Strengths and gaps of current policies

Current policies for environmental sustainability in Gothenburg exhibit notable strengths for climate transition. Firstly, the Environment and Climate program is specifically designed to address the City's significant challenges towards achieving sustainability and integrate objectives on biodiversity, climate, and a healthy living environment. The program undergoes biennial reviews, including recommendations that draw political interest and influence tasks assigned to administrations and companies, ensuring ongoing improvement and relevance. Moreover, the introduction of the City-wide Environment Management System (MLS) provides a systematic approach to aligning local objectives with the City's overarching goals.

However, the policy documents also reveal areas requiring improvement to fully realize its potential. Several plans and programs need stronger support for implementation. There is today an absence of concrete climate mitigation action plans that complement the existing Environment and Climate Programme and encourage cross-sectoral cooperation, highlighting a need for a more integrated and actionable strategy. Furthermore, there is a recognized necessity for a deeper integration of social sustainability considerations to ensure a just transition, suggesting that programs aimed at promoting equal city and public health should be more closely aligned with environmental and climate initiatives. The management of data and estimation of impacts also demands enhancement, including the implementation of e.g. Climate budget and socioeconomic analyses into the City's management system and decision support.

# Table A-2.1: Emissions Gap (kt CO2e)

This table is the output from the NetZeroCities Economic Tool, which is aligned with the Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CNAP) and Climate Neutrality Investment Plan (CNIP) templates in the V2.1 Resource Pack. Please see here for reference documents that support the economic model used for Gothenburg's analysis ( https://netzerocities.app/group-capabilitybuildingprogrammebuildingastrongeconomiccase ). The documents are posted on the NZC Portal in the group called: Capability Building Programme: Building a strong economic case.

The City of Gothenburg has Scandinavia's largest port (which is City-owned) and is home to two refineries and an incineration plant. For the City to reach its climate goals (near zero-emissions 2030) much needs to be done to reduce the emissions from these sectors. Since 2020, the City has been engaged in structured high-level dialogues with the CEOs and Directors from these sectors to identify the necessary measures needed and identify the actions to take place. There is still work to be done to fully characterise and address all (industrial) emissions sources, however, the gap is now well-defined and understood and engagement will continue to advance the development of plans for addressing the gap.

Concrete actions are provided in Part B.

Plans for addressing the emissions gap and the gap and residual emissions of Gothenburg in 2030 are a key part of upcoming iterations of the Climate City Contract, with a focus on exploring further measures to increase the reduction rate by 2030. The City and its stakeholders are investigating ways to neutralize emissions through carbon sinks and carbon credits, conducting pilot studies to define and calculate these mechanisms effectively. A significant portion of residual emissions is anticipated to originate from the City's industries, given Gothenburg's industrial base. These industries set their own climate targets and explore different methods for managing residuals, driven by their own sustainability objectives. Hence, industries are likely to complement the City's efforts in eliminating and compensating residual emissions. Plans for addressing the residual emissions of Gothenburg in 2030, in the City and among actors operating here, will constitute an important part of upcoming iterations of the Climate City Contract.

# 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

This module aims to document the conclusions of a systems and stakeholder mapping aimed at identifying systemic barriers and opportunities. In conjunction with the GHG inventory and the policy baseline analysis in the previous two modules of Part A, the analysis reported here serves as a basis for designing actions that address these barriers or exploit the underutilised opportunities in Part C.

## A-3.1: Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

### Main sociotechnical and institutional systems influencing GHG emissions

Gothenburg's GHG emissions are deeply entwined with various sociotechnical systems. The urban systems around Energy and industry, Mobility and transport, and Building and construction, are of particular importance for Gothenburg's geographical climate emissions. Waste and circular economy, and the Food sector, are also significant contributors, in particular to consumption-based emissions. All these systems are composed of both technical and social elements that influence both their impact and their evolution.

Governance and policy landscape, along with Social and behavioural systems, are integral to understanding and transforming these urban systems. They not only contribute to each of the urban systems' internal dynamics but also form crucial systems in their own right, with distinct dynamics and stakeholder interests on their own.

Table A-3.2 offers a stakeholder mapping across these sociotechnical and institutional systems. This mapping highlights key stakeholders within each system and examines their principal influence on Gothenburg's ambition for climate neutrality.

While recognizing the importance of actors in the transition of systems, it's essential to also consider other leverage points. The subsequent sections list major systemic barriers and opportunities for climate neutrality in Gothenburg.

### Systemic barriers

Major systemic barriers identified are:

**Knowledge, skills and leadership** - Systemic transformation demands deep, interdisciplinary knowledge. Without a comprehensive understanding of the system and its components, appropriate measures are unlikely to be implemented. Moreover, addressing complex challenges requires skills and leadership that can navigate complex issues of sustainability, innovation, and systems change. While multiple transition pathways to climate neutrality are theoretically possible, the dynamics and complexity of systemic transformations introduce uncertainty about how these transitions will occur. Developing knowledge and strategies to manage this uncertainty is crucial.

Gothenburg is a city rich in knowledge, with numerous universities, research institutes, and advanced businesses. This wealth of knowledge must be integrated across sectors and disciplines to facilitate transformation. There's a critical need for transformative leadership capable of synthesizing and expanding this knowledge, even in the face of uncertainties. This involves both developing such
City of Gothenburg

leaders and ensuring that system actors prioritize hiring and supporting individuals with these competencies.

Fragmented innovation - Innovation projects are often fragmented, isolated and do not scale to the desired extent. This is interlinked with other challenges of systemic transformation, innovation policy as well as internal organisational factors.

**System inertia and path dependence** - System inertia derives from the co-evolution that needs to take place between different interdependent parts of the system. If this evolution is not synchronized, the system is likely to resist change. Past events and decisions may also create path dependencies that limit innovation. In Gothenburg, current industry and infrastructure involve substantial investments over extended periods, leading to lock-ins for potential technological choices and urban layouts. The energy and transport systems are examples of systems where this can constitute a barrier to rapid change.

**Multi-actor impact and the City's degree of control** - Numerous actors influence the systems requiring transformation with power structures and mandates being decentralized. These actors also have varied knowledge and skills pertinent to system and climate transition, as well as varying goals and rationales for their actions.

Despite having significant influence, Gothenburg does not control major greenhouse gas emission sources, such as refineries, highlighting the varying degree of city control and underscoring the importance of multi-actor impact.

**Multi-level governance** - Influence over the systemic transformation is not only a local issue but also largely affected by regional, national and international institutional levels.

**Implications of the political system** - The democratic governance system is an important enabler and a prerequisite for systemic transformation. However, in terms of barriers, there are several built-in challenges. Time frames with one-year budgets and four-year terms of office, as well as shifting political landscapes, risk creating counterproductive incentives and high complexity for climate transition.

**Silo organization** - The City of Gothenburg is, like most other municipalities, organised in silos for adequate management according to each administration's specific task, but is not organised to meet major challenges that require a cross-sectoral approach.

**Financing and Business Models** - Present financing and business models, including issues like "split wallets" where actors taking the costs do not necessarily get the benefits, can pose barriers and discourage actions towards climate neutrality due to too narrow scope in cost-benefit calculations and competitiveness across actors.

**Geographical spread** - Reductions of territorial emissions as well as consumption-based emissions are dependent on actions in other geographical areas, since value chains, markets and different local-regional-global developments are interconnected in various ways.

**Societal Norms and Behaviour** - Norms and behaviour of today tend to enhance extrinsic values (such as self-interest and individual focus) rather than intrinsic values (such as benevolence and togetherness). This promotes higher resource consumption and carbon emissions and is a barrier to climate change.

# Systemic opportunities

Although facing considerable barriers, Gothenburg also has several systemic opportunities that potentially can help to enable the climate transition:

## Cross-sector and multi-actor collaboration

Sweden boasts a collaborative culture characterized by a high degree of openness and trust among various stakeholders. This collaborative spirit, coupled with shared visions of climate neutrality, offers significant potential to break down internal silos and overcome barriers between organizations through effective collaboration. By doing so, challenges posed by fragmented innovation, knowledge gaps, uncertainty, and system inertia can be addressed, thereby facilitating a smoother transition toward systemic change. The City's seven strategies are examples of forums that initiate and materialize this kind of collaboration, e.g. in research projects and actor platforms. The research institutes and science parks of Gothenburg are also home to many such initiatives.

## Digitalisation and visualisation

Digitalization holds the potential to reduce emissions by enabling new solutions, higher efficiency, and increased dissemination of knowledge. Moreover, digitalization and visualization serve as essential tools for supporting decision-making and involving stakeholders. Gothenburg exhibits a high level of maturity in digital solutions, both within the City and among its citizens and businesses, which could serve as a strong lever for change.

## Co-benefits

Climate mitigation measures in Gothenburg offer numerous co-benefits that, if considered and implemented, could lay the groundwork for a more sustainable society from a broader perspective. Planned climate measures present many possible synergies, including improved health, increased biodiversity, social inclusion and equity, as well as economic competitiveness. The desire and potential to create such synergies could spur further action for climate mitigation

## Just transition

Linked to co-benefits, but important to address separately, is the matter of creating conditions for a just transition. Striving for a just transition offers opportunities to enhance social sustainability and prevent societal dysfunctions. Additionally, a more equal and inclusive society may facilitate the implementation of climate mitigation measures. The City collaborates with academia in exploring pathways for just transitions.

## Societal norms and behavioural change

Whilst norms and behaviours may constitute a systemic barrier, they may also constitute important and powerful opportunities for systemic transformation in support of climate transition.

## Degree of City Control

The City of Gothenburg wields a high degree of control and influence over local society, compared to many other cities. Given its responsibilities in areas such as urban planning, construction, energy provision, and property management, actions taken by the City can have a multiplier effect. As the second-largest city in Sweden, Gothenburg also has considerable influence on the national society, for instance through the influence on the national market that the procurement of the City implies.

## Innovative culture and portfolio thinking

Gothenburg fosters a culture of innovation through initiatives like test beds and portfolios of innovation projects spanning different sectors. These approaches could contribute to systemic transformation if further developed, creating favourable conditions for larger-scale endeavours needed for climate action.

## Green bonds and financial mechanisms

Gothenburg is a pioneer in adopting and developing the use of green bonds, laying the groundwork for further development to reach the full potential of this tool.

Green electricity - Sweden's renewable energy system presents a favourable context for Gothenburg's transition. A substantial share of electricity derived from renewable sources facilitates the shift towards intensified electrification with minimal carbon footprint. Moreover, this green energy infrastructure attracts industrial investment. The ongoing establishment of the Northvolt and Volvo battery plant in Gothenburg illustrates this trend.

Citizen inclusion - Citizen inclusion remains an underutilized opportunity with the potential to accelerate the pace of climate transition, foster new and improved solutions, increase acceptance, and facilitate upscaling and behavioural change.

Social innovation - Closely linked to an innovative culture and citizen inclusion, social innovation addresses societal challenges in reaching climate neutrality through a bottom-up, collaborative, holistic, and human-centred approach to innovation.

Mission orientation - Working towards a common mission is an opportunity to bridge gaps between organizations, spur innovations, and direct efforts across various actors, including citizens, in an effective manner.

Empowering Gothenburg's systemic transformation through collaboration and learning

The seven strategies of the City were specifically designed to enhance the City's capacity to address systemic challenges. These strategies are tasked with identifying, addressing, and overcoming systemic barriers through testing and learning, while also exploring and enhancing systemic opportunities. The strategies do so in collaboration with stakeholders across the Gothenburg community. This explorative and collaborative approach has yielded promising results thus far and is likely to be pivotal in driving the transition forward. To this end, it is imperative to mobilize widespread engagement and capacity for active participation in these strategies and their explorations of solutions. The Climate City Contract could enforce this endeavour, by uniting stakeholders around the shared vision of being a leader in Europe in carbon neutrality.

Enabling interventions

The systems and stakeholders in the table below do not make an extensive list of all relevant stakeholders, and it is partly aggregated for better readability and overview. Nevertheless, the point here is made clear that there are multiple stakeholders which influence the pathways towards the climate neutrality ambition, and which all have different roles and interests in the transition. Many of the enablers described in part C are about summoning these stakeholders around fields of common interests. Here, minimum common denominators are a key factor for finding fruitful collaborations, but where different interests in detail will be, and must be, present around the same table. It's within these collaboration interventions that different interests become visible, addressed and to some extent also managed.

The barriers, opportunities and stakeholders described in this section are guiding the City on which type of enabling interventions the City needs to develop. The interventions described in part C visualize in which fields the City is already working, where the City is strong or weak, and which areas the City plans to develop. The remaining gaps are identified and must be handled by the City, its partners and/or stakeholders on various levels.

# 3 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

In this text the geographical area of Gothenburg is referred to as ‘Gothenburg’ and the City of Gothenburg as ‘the City’.

This part of the City of Gothenburg’s action plan describes decided and planned actions in terms of systemic levers, see Table B-1.1, Table B-1.2 and the text below. The systemic levers are presented for each field of action:

Energy system (including industry)
Mobility &amp; transport
Waste &amp; circular economy
Built environment
Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions

The fields of actions and systemic levers are linked to the emission sectors (presented in Part A of the action plan) and target emissions in scopes 1, 2 and 3. The linkages both between the fields of actions and the emission sectors as well as between the various fields of actions are in some regards complex and interconnected. Notably, the energy system is closely connected to the industry sector, the transport sector, waste management and the built environment. The reason for this is the district heating system that uses waste heat from the industry and the waste incineration plant as well as heat produced from the energy firm’s own plants. Additionally, electrification is featured as an important means to reduce climate impact from both the industry and transport sector, which increases demand for electricity within the geographical area of Gothenburg. Finally, the building sector also affects the energy sector in terms of its energy demand (heating, electricity and cooling). Circular economy is key for reducing material and energy use and indirectly emissions. Hence, circular economy is linked to particularly the energy system, the built environment and the business sector.

There are four areas of systemic levers in the fields of actions energy system (including industry) and mobility &amp; transport, that are key for reducing scope 1 emissions in Gothenburg (see Table B-1.1²):

Reduce the emissions from the two refineries by switching to renewable energy or implementing carbon capture and storage (CCS).
Replace the natural gas used as fuel at the combined heat and power plant (Rya) owned by Göteborg Energi (the municipal energy utility).
Stop the incineration of waste including plastics at Renova (the local waste-to-energy plant) or implement CCS.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

Reduce climate impact from transportation through electrification, switching to biofuels and taking measures to improve efficiency.

To expand the perspective, in terms of emission domains, scopes, mandate and possible levers to influence emission reductions in Gothenburg in a systemic way, the City has developed seven strategic priorities. The strategic priorities are portfolios of action embracing several levers; technical, financial, organisational, governance, policy, culture, behavioural and social.

The seven strategic priorities are:

The intertwined energy and industrial system portfolio
The Port as a lever for reduced heavy transport emissions
Sustainable and efficient mobility
Improvements on waste treatment
Climate-neutral construction
Capacity for circular economy
Urban farming, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions

To succeed with the above-listed strategic priorities, cooperation and co-creation are essential. This is achieved in many forms and constellations (see Part A and Part C of the action plan). An important example is the Environment and Climate Programme of the City of Gothenburg which works with seven strategies that cut across administrations and companies.

The strategies provide a platform to drive and coordinate work on the actions that require a high degree of collaboration across the City's administrations and companies (sustainability work within each administration and company is performed according to the City's environmental management system). The work of the strategies contributes to continuous learning in the City and to increase the pace of implementation of actions.³

In addition, the City has several processes for developing the climate mitigation work further (see part C of the action plan for an overview). An example is that the City is developing a method for calculation of CO2 emissions (including scope 1-3) that can be applied to all actions planned and decided by the administrations and companies (see "Climate Budget" described in part C of the action plan). Currently calculations are only available for some systemic levers and different methods and system boundaries are applied. Therefore, most of the systemic levers within this field of action (see Table B-1.1) do not have measures of direct impact.

For the purpose of the Climate City Contract, the City has used NetZeroCites' economic tool/model and will continue to use the model to explore various scenarios leading the path to climate neutrality 2030 (More information is available here: https://netzerocities.app/group-capabilitybuildingprogrammebuildingastrongeconomiccase. The documents are posted on the NZC Portal in the group called: Capability Building Programme: Building a strong economic case).

In the following section, the systemic levers within each field of action are described. First, systemic levers that have the potential to dramatically reduce emissions in Table B-1.1 are listed. Second, each field of action, including both context and systemic levers is described. Third, in Table B-1.2 a more detailed list of systemic levers is presented, and in Table B-2.2 a comprehensive example for each field of action is presented. Finally, indicators for monitoring, evaluation and learning are presented.

B-1.2: Description of impact pathways
Figure B1 – Overview of emission reductions.
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure B1 presents an overview of the emission reductions included in the scenarios until 2030 and the main areas where these emission reductions will be done. In the following, the systemic levers and impact pathways for each field of action that contribute to these scenarios are described.

# Energy system

The energy system in Gothenburg includes several energy carriers such as heat, electricity, and gas that operate in parallel, but also interconnected systems. Below the impact pathways for the various energy carriers are described.

# Two private refineries contribute to half of the emissions in Gothenburg

The two refineries in the city, Preem and ST1, collectively contribute to approximately  $50\%$  of the CO2 emissions in Gothenburg. Preem has committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2035, outlining a comprehensive strategy. This includes implementing CCS, utilizing renewable hydrogen and biogas in their production processes, and transitioning to advanced bio- and electro-fuels to reduce emissions from the transport sector. As part of this transition, Preem aims to maintain the waste heat output, ensuring its availability for Göteborg Energi's district heating system.

ST1 does not currently have a similarly explicit plan for climate neutrality. However, in terms of biofuel production, ST1 is already producing advanced ethanol and biogas from waste. Moreover, a new bio-refinery is currently under construction in Gothenburg, specifically designed to optimize the production of 200,000 m3 of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. This initiative demonstrates ST1's

commitment to expanding its sustainable energy portfolio and contributing to the overall reduction of environmental impact in the region.

## Heat

Most of Gothenburg's buildings are heated by the city-wide district heating system. More than 90% of residential and commercial buildings and some 20% of single-family houses are connected to the district heating system. The majority of the remaining family houses use electricity, either directly or with heat pumps.

The district heating system has been developed since the 1950s and is based on waste heat from activities in the surrounding society, most notably two refineries and the local waste incineration plant. Around 75% of the yearly heat supply is waste heat. The carbon emissions from the refineries and incineration plant were about 1.2 million tons in 2022, roughly 60% of the City's carbon emission. Hence, the district heating system in Gothenburg has high indirect emissions. As the refineries transition towards climate-neutral production of fuels, the City's indirect emissions from district heating will decrease. Depending on which path the refineries will choose to decarbonise (biofuels, hydrogen, Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) or a mix), the amount of accessible waste heat can change. The same goes for the incineration plants and their transition towards decreased incineration of waste, not least of fossil plastics and possibly implementation of CCUS/BECCUS. The City has identified the need to plan for alternative scenarios including aspects such as supply, demand and price development for biomass, reduced energy use and energy efficiency potential, technology development and global and external events. The City must then have the capacity to act on the strategy developed from such scenarios. The digital twin (see Part C of the action plan) that is being developed can be a tool for developing scenarios.

The remaining 25% of the yearly heat supply comes from various qualities of biomass, electricity (through large and small heat pumps) and a small part of fossil gas and oil for peak load. The City of Gothenburg, which owns the energy utility Göteborg Energi, has set a target in the Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg that district heating and electricity production by the energy utility shall be free from fossil fuels after 2025. To meet that challenge, Göteborg Energi will build a biomass combined heat and power (CHP) plant that will enable a fossil-free district heating production. Hence, from 2026 the heating and electricity produced by Göteborg Energi will be free from fossil CO2 emissions.

Lately, the district heating system has become an important tool for balancing the power grid, by being able to both produce electricity in CHP plants when there's a shortage of electricity or consume it in heat pumps when it is abundant, see figure below. In the near future, it will be crucial to offload the power grid by supplying heat without putting strain on the power system, as other sectors are set to increase their electricity consumption as a means to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.

District heating is flexible and can address many challenges
Figure B2 - Potential benefits of utilising district heating.

## Electricity

The electricity import is on a yearly basis about 90% in Gothenburg. As more industries and the transport sector are electrified, the electricity demand increases and the import demand as well if not met by increased production within the city. By 2035, the scenario shows an increase of 70% in electricity demand compared to 2022. This is a major challenge for the City, see summary in the figure below.

A major challenge for Gothenburg is the necessary reinforcement of the grid capacity from outside of Gothenburg to meet this demand in time. Therefore, several measures need to be taken, many of which are listed as actions above in B-1.1 and B-1.2 below.

## Our major challenge

Almost doubling of electricity demand in little more than a decade
New transmission capacity will take time
We have to use all available tools
Flexibility
Energy efficiency
Conditional connections
Local power production
Displacing electricity when there are alternatives
Without district heating we would need 750 MW more electricity now, and 250 MW of local capacity would disappear

# Figure B3 - Forecast of electricity demand in Gothenburg.

Another challenge is the low potential for renewable electricity production within the city border. The City is investigating the potential for solar and wind power. Previous investigations have shown low potential regarding large-scale wind power parks, both on- and offshore within the city border. The solar power potential has earlier (2016) been estimated to meet about 5-10% of the electricity demand, corresponding to 350 GWh/year. The potential needs to be updated to consider technology development and policy changes among other things. That being said, Gothenburg is the city in Sweden that by far has the most installed solar power. Nevertheless, public housing and other entities in the city have ambitious investment plans in solar power. Nonetheless, the City also needs a strategy to contribute to electricity production in other municipalities close by to meet its own demand. This is one way to take responsibility for the City's climate transition through more clean energy as well as increasing energy security.

# Gas

The gas grid capacity is not as constrained as the electricity grid. Moreover, the physical content of biomethane in the grid has grown over the last decade and now exceeds 30%. Purchasing biogas, instead of natural gas, has been a convenient way for industries and transport to become carbon neutral. However, the market conditions for biogas production and use have been subject to abrupt changes, and lack of reliable support from politics both nationally and the EU. To a large extent, Sweden has failed – so far – to realise the domestic potential for increased biogas production and use. The production potential is enough to make Sweden a net exporter of biomethane made from waste streams, but actual production levels are only a fraction of the potential. In Gothenburg, the production is about 70 GWh of biogas from the cities and nearby municipalities' sewage sludge and another 50 GWh from slurry. The City sees potential to increase biogas production from both sewage sludge and food waste.

# Reducing emissions with energy efficiency and reduced energy use

The City has identified a potential to decrease energy consumption with 500 GWh in residential buildings by 2030, compared to 2010. This can be achieved through a combination of renovation and investments in energy efficiency measures, efficient price models and by increased focus on knowledge sharing to bring about behavioural change.

# Reducing emissions with Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage

The City owns the port in Gothenburg, notably the largest port in Scandinavia. This distinctive municipal privilege affords the opportunity to allocate land specifically for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) infrastructure. Collaborative endeavours, spearheaded by the port authority in conjunction with diverse entities encompassing both public and private energy enterprises, as well as local refineries, have been investigating the potential of CCUS within the region. In the event of successful implementation, the envisaged infrastructure is poised to manage a capacity of 4 million metric tons of CO2 over the imminent years. CCUS could be used to substantially reduce emissions from large point sources both at the public waste incineration (Renova - owned by the City of Gothenburg and 9 other municipalities) and private refineries.

A prestudy shows that CCS on one of Renova's (the local waste incineration plant) four combustion lines would provide an emission reduction until 2030 of about 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, of which about 40,000 is fossil, at an investment cost of about SEK 500 million. This would have a minor impact on district heating production, but lead to a 20% reduction in electricity production at Renova. The cost of carbon dioxide capture and intermediate storage on the site would be SEK 1,150 per tonne of carbon dioxide captured, with additional costs for transport and storage. Overall, knowledge of CCS technology has increased, but there are still some major barriers to overcome before a potential investment decision can be taken.

Preem, owner of one of two refineries in Gothenburg, has CCS plans to decrease emissions with 300,000 tons of CO2 until 2030, corresponding to roughly 60% of their scope 1 emissions. Both refineries have plans to produce Renewable Fuels of nonbiologic origin (RFNBO) to decrease emissions from the transport sector, where CCU is one possible solution. Both refineries put extra focus on RFNBO for aviation, due to requirements from EU:s FF55-package.

CCUS is a new and complex value chain. There is a large lack of legislation in this field at present, which creates a great risk for actors who want to invest in CCUS which makes it difficult to create business cases. Infrastructure for CCUS in the port could solve parts of the chicken-and-egg situation, but in order to realize this, risk sharing from the public sector and bilateral agreement is required. Information is needed from actors who are interested in interim storage of CO2, when the need occurs and what volumes are relevant. Ongoing dialogues persist between the port authority and a spectrum of public and private stakeholders, with the overarching aim of creating solutions and business cases for CCUS.

## Mobility &amp; transport

Gothenburg is a hub for passenger and freight transport in Western Sweden. 120,000 people commute into Gothenburg every day, and roughly 50,000 people commute out. Gothenburg has many companies with large volumes of goods and is the largest port in the Nordic region, through which a large part of Sweden's exports and imports pass. Road traffic is the biggest source of both air pollution and noise in the city, and the second biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, the city is in the midst of the largest and most extensive urban development in modern times. This means that there have become about 70,000 more citizens of Gothenburg in 15 years, and the City is expected to have approximately the same number more in the next 15 years. In addition, the surrounding municipalities are also growing.

The traffic system of today is characterized by traffic to large-scale industries and the port, tram traffic in radial lines and the functionally separated planning ideal of the automobile society. Together, they have made fast transportation possible, which has resulted in a sparse urban structure where many people live far from the centre and their workplace. The City's climate targets regarding sustainable transportation in the Environment and Climate Program are to reduce the climate impact from transportation by 90% by 2030 compared to 2010 and to reduce road traffic work by 25% by 2030 compared to 2020.

Planning and building a denser city, where the inhabitants have close access to what they need in everyday life, is important to create a sustainable city in the long term. To reach the City's environmental and climate goals linked to 2030, powerful measures are also needed that have the potential to reduce environmental and climate impacts in the short term. For traffic, this means a rapid electrification of the vehicle fleet and a transition to biofuels, while the amount of travel and transport by car and other vehicles also needs to be reduced.

The City of/actors in Gothenburg does not have full control of the entire adjustment that needs to be made to reduce the environmental and climate impact of transport in the city. International and national conditions affect both technology development and the demand for different fuels and modes of transport, and thus the opportunities the City has to achieve its goals. In the same way, collaboration with the national traffic authority, the region, the public transport authority and nearby municipalities is also necessary to influence cross-municipal travel and transport.

## Urban planning for sustainable transport

Gothenburg's Comprehensive plan states that Gothenburg is to be developed into a close, cohesive and robust city. It should provide proximity to what you need in everyday life so that more people can get

through everyday life by walking and cycling. Development must mainly take place in connection with good public transport. A city that is connected in the street network and with public spaces that are for everyone means that people meet and get better conditions for equal life opportunities. A resilient city has resilience and adaptability to face challenges and crises, while residents have trust in each other and in the functions of society.

In order for Gothenburg and the region to be able to grow in accordance with set goals, it is necessary to restructure the traffic system and change travel patterns. The transition in traffic systems and travel patterns means that more journeys need to be made by foot, bicycle and public transport, but above all it means that the proportion of car journeys needs to decrease. A change in the transport system also means streamlining business transport and that some of the freight transport that currently takes place by road is moved to rail or waterways.

## Public transport

A substantial expansion of public transport is a prerequisite for reaching the City's goals of expansion and sustainability. Gothenburg is working together with the regional municipalities and the local public transport authority according to a common target image, Målbild Koll 2035, which describes how the public transport core network should be developed in the contiguous urban area until 2035. In this scenario/vision, various existing and new traffic concepts such as Metrobus, City Railway, tram and Citybus, together with a new network structure with fast journeys between important destination points, will lead to an increase in capacity by 70% and that journey times can be shortened by 20-25%.

To strengthen public transport in Gothenburg, but above all in the region, the construction of the Västlänken is underway, which is an approximately eight kilometer long double-track railway for commuter and regional trains that will run in a tunnel under central Gothenburg. Västlänken will get three new underground stations in the central city, creating the conditions for more and longer trains, and making it possible to connect train traffic in Western Sweden in a better way. By strengthening train capacity in Gothenburg with a tunnel, instead of building above ground, land can be freed up for more green areas, workplaces and homes. The areas around the stations are to be developed into more attractive environments to stay in and into strengthened hubs for public transport.

## Walking and cycling

Increased walking and cycling is good for the individual, the city and for city life. Pedestrians and cyclists create life and movement in urban spaces and contribute to an attractive urban environment, reduced environmental impact and improved health and well-being. New forms of cycling such as e-scooters and e-bicycles create new conditions for traveling by bicycle for part of the journey or longer distances. Travel by foot and bicycle is increasing in Gothenburg, but not at the rate needed to reach the City's goals. The cycling program for a nearby big city 2015-2025 directs the work on expanding, operating and maintaining the cycling infrastructure in the city and the development of support, services and communication to increase cycling.

## Car traffic

Reduced car traffic is a key area to reduce noise and air pollution in the city as well as carbon emissions. Reduced car traffic is also a prerequisite for creating room for increased sustainable travel. The City has several control instruments at its disposal that have the ability to have an effect on travel relatively quickly, such as accessibility for different modes of transport, reduced speed, supply and price for parking. Gothenburg also has congestion tax, but it is not controlled by the municipality but by national authorities. Another way is to reduce the relative advantage of traveling by car by redistributing areas and transforming existing street environments in favor of leisure, pedestrians, cyclists and public transport or using areas for new buildings and greenery where suitable.

In order to reach the environmental and climate goals by 2030, the City needs to develop and increase the use of both proven and new control measures to reduce car traffic. The change required will affect people's everyday lives and therefore needs to be anchored and implemented in a way that can be accepted by the residents.

## Transport of goods and business transport

Gothenburg has many companies with large volumes of goods and the Nordic region's largest port, through which a large part of Sweden's exports and imports pass. More residents, visitors and businesses means more freight transport, distribution of goods and other utility traffic. In order to reduce environmental and climate impact, freight transport needs to be electrified or powered by other sustainable fossil-free fuels. They also need to be made more efficient, for example through reloading and consolidation for increased filling rate or transfer from road to rail and river. The largest volume of freight transport in the city comes from or goes to the Port of Gothenburg. The Port of Gothenburg strives to be the world's most sustainable port, The Green Connection, and to reduce its climate emissions by 70% by 2030. By, for example, giving electric trucks priority passage and handling in the container terminal, offering access to electricity, HVO, biogas and hydrogen gas in the port area, and expand the railway for the transport of containers to and from the port. The port is driving development towards sustainable freight transport.

## Electrification and Sustainable Biofuels

Gothenburg has a strong position as an international role model in electrified transport and energy solutions and, in addition, a strong vehicle cluster. The transition to a fossil-free transport system requires the City's actors and the business community to work together. Openness to cooperation, combined with a complete ecosystem for vehicle manufacturing, has given Gothenburg a unique position when it comes to making the transition to an electrified and connected transport system.

For many years now, the City has had a successful collaboration with the region, the business community and academia, which aims to develop, test and implement solutions that can contribute to accelerating the electrification of the transport sector and thereby create new opportunities for urban development. The ElectriCity collaboration started with testing and development of electric buses, which has resulted in Western Sweden today having the most electric buses in the Nordic region. Projects around sharing charging infrastructure between different modes of transport, Bus-as-a-service and electrified construction sites are now underway. Within the Gothenburg Green City Zone collaboration wireless charging of taxis, passenger cars as energy storage, regional goods hubs and climate-smart events are tested.

The City's Electrification Plan 2022-2030 aims to drive the transition to an electrified transport system and contains measures to realign the City's own and procured vehicles and transport as well as measures to stimulate a rapid transition to electrified transport in the rest of society.

## The strategy We drive the development of sustainable transportation

The strategy We drive the development of sustainable transport is one of seven strategies within the City's Environment and Climate Program. The strategy aims to clarify and strengthen the work to reduce environmental and climate impacts from transport in Gothenburg. In concrete terms, this means reducing and making transport more efficient and driving the transition towards electrification and sustainable biofuels. The strategy is an impetus to increase efforts to reduce car traffic in the city, while at the same time strengthening the conditions and attractiveness for walking, cycling and traveling by public transport. In order to reach environmental and climate targets by 2030, measures that have the potential to have an effect in the short term need to be prioritized, while the longer-term development of the city needs to be steered towards a more transport-efficient society. The strategy also aims to support the City's work with electrifying transport and the conversion to sustainable fuels. Development of working methods for

collaboration and communication are important tools to gain acceptance for the measures that will be needed to succeed in a rapid transition to a sustainable transport system.

## Waste &amp; circular economy

The UN's International Resource Panel has found that the extraction and processing of natural resources has increased dramatically over the past two decades, which is now responsible for more than 90% of biodiversity loss and water scarcity, as well as about 50% of the climate impact globally. It is therefore essential to shift resource use to protect ecosystems. According to the Circularity Gap Report, Sweden is 3.4% circular, which means a circularity gap of more than 96%. This means that the majority of the resources used in Sweden come from virgin sources. To reduce unsustainable resource use, greenhouse gas emissions and the spread of toxic substances, the patterns of how and what is produced and consumed need to change. Circular economy has a great potential to contribute to sustainable consumption and production, as well as reducing the City's costs. Toxic-free cycles are a prerequisite for a circular economy in order to stop both the release of harmful substances and to detoxify the cycle.

Circular economy can also provide socio-economic benefits. A study from the Swedish Recycling Industries Association (2018) of five significant product areas (steel, plastic, aluminium, paper and cement) showed that as much as ¾ of the material value is lost after just one use, which from a socio-economic perspective means a cost of SEK 42 billion per year in Sweden.

Since 2016 circular economy has been seen as an important tool to reach the City of Gothenburg's goals. Today, these goals can be found in the City's Environment and Climate programme 2021-2030, the City's waste plan, business strategy program and plan for an equal Gothenburg. Some examples of goals are:

Reduce climate impact from the City's purchase by 90% until 2030
Reduce the amount of waste from municipal operations by 40% until 2030
There should be good conditions for the City's administrations to reuse products
Gothenburg's climate footprint is close to zero until 2030

In 2016, the circular work in Gothenburg started with a tax funded initiative 'Circular Gothenburg'. Since then, the focus has been on resource efficiency (focusing on the top two steps of the EU waste hierarchy), climate impact and on SDG 12 of Agenda 2030. The mission of this work has been to develop and create practical conditions for circular transition and therefore the approach has been practical, and action based from the start. Target groups have been both the City administrations and citizens, consequently the work has been carried out in broad collaboration with business, academy and civil society.

## The strategy We drive the development of circular economy

Since 2021 the work with circular economy is organised and driven by the strategy 'We drive the development of circular economy', which has representatives from nine different key administrations in the City. The strategy is a means for working across the various administrations and companies within the City aiming at making them able (and willing) to make circular purchases, circular disposal, reuse, repair and share. The strategy focuses on the reduction of material flows, i.e. how resource extraction can be reduced and the value of products and materials retained over time. In practice, this means how the City will significantly reduce new purchases through increased utilisation rate and increased lifespan for products and materials. The strategy also drives the development of conditions that support working in a circular way, e.g. new roles, working methods, norms and governance within the City of Gothenburg (as an organisation), to collaboration and innovation together with market players, academia, other public organisations and civil society. An example of how the strategy works is that it aims to become a Circular Customer by 2030, which includes circular purchase and procurement, circulation and sharing between administrations, circular divestment and adaptation of the organization.

O

The work within the strategy includes several systemic levers that aim to increase the circular economy, these are described below:

## Implementing circular economy principals in city steering documents and guidelines

The City's own consumption of goods and materials needs to be reduced, made more efficient and based on circular principles instead of the current linear ones. This applies to all flows including food, inventory, electronics, construction materials and demolition waste. Therefore, the strategy is implementing circular economy principals in city steering documents and guidelines, such as the guidelines on acquisition and disposal 2022-2024, Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030, Waste Plan 2021-2030, Business strategy program 2018-2035 and Gothenburg's Comprehensive Plan.

## Building capacity for action and mobilizing key actors

The strategy is building the City's capacity for action and mobilizing key actors within the City in order to be able to act on the circular economy principles in the strategy and documents. A lot of effort will be put into anchoring, implementation and mobilization of key players at all the administrations and companies. The organizations will be included and need to act in accordance with circular economy principles. This will make it clearer what needs to be done differently and why, who needs to act and what support each administrations and companies can get. Any gaps in responsibilities and roles will also be identified and communicated to those concerned. To be able to act there is also a need to align the governance at different levels within the City so that administrations and companies are able to act on the circular economy principles. Platform building and mobilization are part of the work and is important for learning from and inspiring each other. The focus is also on practical action - testing and developing, and then deploying and integrating into regular processes. It is also about using available tools to make it difficult to make mistakes from a circular perspective.

## New ways for circular procurement and market dialogues

The strategy is changing the City's procurement to include and support circular economy principles as well as developing new ways for market dialogues. This involves for example early and continuous transition dialogue with the market, requesting other or new products and services (not currently available in framework agreements). This is already done in several product areas, but a systematic approach is needed as well as cooperation with other municipalities. By doing this the City of Gothenburg can find new ways of dividing and sharing the responsibility of developing new business models for both products and services. In addition, in broad collaboration, the City of Gothenburg will look further at the development area of Industrial Urban Symbiosis (IUS). The plan is to carry out two feasibility studies in 2024, in which the City's role, development areas and proposed approaches are described, and the potential from a business perspective.

## Collaboration for circular economy

The City of Gothenburg participates in several national and international networks focusing on the circular economy in order to exchange experiences and jointly pursue issues with politicians and market players. These include municipal networks, expert networks and networks focusing on different themes, such as circular procurement and circular construction. This is to inspire others, drive development, raise issues at national and EU level, and to initiate the collaborations needed to achieve better results and scaling up. An example of this is the EU's Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI), where the City of Gothenburg has been selected as one of 12 circular pilots, thanks to the City's circular strategy work and ambitious environmental and climate objectives. Procurement and market dialogues is an important area for development within this pilot.

By working in this way, the work within the City affects the wider society in Gothenburg via the need of new business models, circular products and services, which are needed to reach the goals set in the city as an organization and as the society.

## Reducing emissions from management of waste and water

The Administration for Sustainable Waste and Water manages the water supply, handles waste and sewage in the City of Gothenburg. They work with waste prevention which includes several different fractions: plastic, food waste, textiles, bulky waste and electronics. This includes for example, feasibility studies and testing of measures that can give households feedback of waste quantities that will be carried out in collaboration with academia. Activities to prevent and collect textile waste for reuse are also done in cooperation with several non-profit organizations. By preventing waste, carbon dioxide emissions from waste incineration are reduced. Reaching the goals of the City of Gothenburg's waste plan 2021 - 2030 imply significant emission reductions. For example, the City of Gothenburg is working on increasing the collection of food waste and EU requirements for sorting and separate collection of biowaste are implemented in Swedish legislation in January 2024, which is pushing this work further.

The production of drinking water causes significant carbon dioxide emissions through, for example, the use of energy and chemicals in production. By reducing water use or, where possible, using water of a different quality, less drinking water needs to be produced and energy and chemical consumption can be reduced. Examples of how this can be done is by watering with rainwater or cooling and cleaning with treated wastewater. For the Northvolt battery factory under construction in Gothenburg pipes are now being built to cool the factory with treated wastewater. In addition, expansion and maintenance of the network of waterpipes is a large source of greenhouse gas emissions.

## Reducing the amount of fossil-based plastics in waste streams

Several waste streams end up at the Renova waste-to-energy plant, which is owned by the City of Gothenburg and 9 other municipalities. Over 99% of Renova's climate impact consists of the fossil content of the waste that goes to energy recovery. The fossil material consists almost exclusively of plastic, including small amounts of synthetic textiles, foam rubber and rubber. Unfortunately, the consumption of synthetic materials tends to increase over time.

Renova has investigated how to limit the plastic content of the waste. For example, a) by providing feedback to customers about the climate impact of their waste, offered source separation solutions for plastic and help to find outlets for plastics on a recycling market; b) by offering differentiated gate fees that depend on the plastic content of the customer's waste - a lower plastic content results in a lower fee; c) by using sorting plants, that sorts out larger plastic items from the waste, which then are become recycled material for other products and d) by investigating post-treatment in an automated facility for residual waste from apartment blocks. Such a facility was estimated to reduce fossil emissions from the waste-to-energy plant by 10,000 to 20,000 tonnes of CO2e per year and would cost around SEK 4,000 per tonne of fossil carbon dioxide avoided by the plant at Renova.

The use of plastic continues to increase in society. UNEP and the Swedish Government's Action Plan for Plastics estimate that the amount of plastic will double by 2040. Therefore, Renova's efforts above do not result in a drastic change in fossil emissions at the waste-to-energy plant. Since the fossil share of carbon dioxide began to be monitored in the stack at Renova in 2013, the emissions have remained at about the same level, while many of Sweden's other waste incineration plants have given rise to increasing emissions during the same period. The tightened targets in legislation and policy documents from the EU, Sweden and the regional waste plan on the use of plastics are expected to counteract the increase of plastics in waste for incineration. However, Renova does not expect emissions to decrease because of them.

## Built environment

Gothenburg is in an expansive phase as it is growing in terms of population, companies and workplaces, and is consequently facing an extensive investment in construction works (premises, residential and

infrastructure). The City has a relatively large amount of control, partly because more than half of all new production is via municipal land allocation agreements, and partly because the public utility group Framtiden is responsible for a majority of new construction of housing (both construction for own ownership, but also construction for sale). Furthermore, the City owns 76,000 flats via the group, which means that 25% of Gothenburg residents live in a municipally owned property. The rate of expansion is also high in municipal services, particularly schools, preschools, retirement homes and specialised housing. The construction works (renovation, infrastructure, and new buildings) accounts for 65% of the City's purchases.

## Climate impact from the construction sector and the built environment

The climate impact of the construction sector in Sweden (estimated to have the equivalent distribution in Gothenburg) accounts for 21% (about 11.7 million tonnes CO₂e) of domestic emissions. In addition, there are emissions of about 7.7 million tonnes CO₂e due to import of construction materials. Of these emissions, heating accounts for 25%, new construction almost 50% and renovation and retrofitting for the remaining 25%. The relatively low share of heating by international comparison is partly due to longstanding systematic efforts to improve energy efficiency in the sector and to the conversion of the energy mix to more sustainable alternatives. The high share of district heating in Gothenburg is a major contributor with e.g. waste heat being used. As countries in EU convert their heat production to renewable sources and reduce the energy demand in buildings, they will have similar figures, with building and construction measures accounting for an increasing share of the climate impact from the construction sector.

There are no detailed data of the climate impact from all construction works in Gothenburg, but the climate works from the City's own activities is calculated to 170,000 tonnes CO₂ yearly. Construction of buildings accounts for about ¾ of this climate impact, and infrastructure accounts for about ¼. Concerning infrastructure, the climate impact of characteristic projects has been analysed and the distribution of the climate impact is assessed to be the following: 84% of the climate impact is related to investment and exploitation, 16% to operation and maintenance. The study shows that fuel use in transports and machineries accounts for about 40% of the climate impact, asphalt for 22% (where of bitumen 6.5%), steel 9% and concrete 7%. In new building projects, the fuel use accounts for &lt;10%, instead the building frame, envelope and foundation account for &gt;60% of the climate impact. By focusing on these elements, the climate impact of new construction can be significantly reduced. The conditions are very different in renovation, where the foundation and building frame (two of the heaviest climate-impacting elements) are rarely included. Therefore few individual reduction measurements seldom result in a significant reduction of climate impact in renovation projects, but all the constituent parts must be addressed.

By 2025 the City aims to reduce the climate impact of construction works by 50% and by 90% by 2030. There is a roadmap and framework for reducing the climate impact by -90% by 2030 from the LCA stages A1-A5 for new properties including the effects of altered land use (works procured by the City and by land allocation agreements). These are based on academical estimate of potential (BAT and BATNEEC solutions until 2030, including new innovative solutions identified needed to be stimulated by the City), also indicating technical and systemic effects of the reduction pace. In the exploratory and knowledge-building pilot Hoppet ('hope' in English), which involve the construction of a preschool, the climate impact of the construction project has been reduced by 60% (70% if the scope is limited to the regulations of the Swedish National Board of Housing and Planning, where installation products are not included).

All new construction projects started after 2020 are included in ongoing action plans for halving the climate impact by 2025, including projects with high requirements of at least 50% reused materials with a special focus on heavy and loadbearing parts. Besides a reduction of the construction work's climate impact by 50%, the focus is also on a radical reduction of climate impact in the operational phase, which

besides energy and water use includes the lifestyle of tenants, such as the impact of sharing services, sustainable mobility services etc.

## Energy efficiency in the City's properties

Energy consumption in properties owned by the City has systematically been reduced over the years and is well on track to be reduced by 30% by 2030 compared to baseline year 2010. Between 2010-2017 the reduction of primary energy consumption per m2 was 12%, and ongoing reduction keeps the same pace. The energy use in the City's buildings constitutes to approximately 80% of district heating and 20% of electricity (mainly for lighting, ventilation, laundry facilities). Being well on track, considerable measures still need to be taken. The climate impact from energy accounts for 20% of the CO2 emission from the building sector within the City.

## The strategy We drive the development of sustainable construction

The strategy We drive the development of sustainable construction is one of seven strategies on which the City's Environment and Climate Programme is based. The strategy includes new construction, reconstruction and renovation of buildings and facilities, adaptation of existing premises, infrastructure and development of public spaces such as squares, parks, sports facilities and playgrounds. The work in the strategy has the perspective of the whole life cycle, from the construction phase, through the use phase to the final phase. The work requires close collaboration with academia and industry throughout the value chain. The fact that the City is a clear and long-term owner of needs creates favourable conditions for the market to make the transition in a resource-efficient way.

The public utility group Framtiden is designated coordinator for the Strategy and mandated to lead this work. The concerned administrations and companies have a designated responsibility to come together and collaborate whenever needed, especially in areas with great need for transition and new innovative methods.

The Strategy includes new construction, reconstruction and renovation of buildings, facilities and infrastructure and adaptation of existing premises. The City is expected to set higher standards with less environmental impact. The Strategy involves e.g. improving the City's governance of sustainable construction in LCA perspective, in terms of resource management and environmental and health impacts, cooperating with industry to test and develop new methods and materials, using innovative procurements to drive the development of a circular, non-toxic and resource-efficient construction.

## Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions

There is often a positive correlation between improvements in green infrastructure and nature-based solutions and climate mitigation. Overall improving of improvements in green infrastructure and nature-based has many co-benefits such as more greenery, more multifunctional solutions for biodiversity, climate adaptation and climate mitigation, better air quality, more recreational space, less noise, increased well-being, better protection against heat stress and flooding.

There are currently only a few calculations of direct climate impact (emission reduction) on individual projects. An example is the project SPARC in which direct climate effects of the forestry management in the City of Gothenburg is calculated by researchers at SLU (Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences). The City is developing methods for calculation of CO2 emissions to be applied to all actions (see description in the introduction to this text element), but it is not available nor applied yet. Therefore, most of the systemic levers within this field of action (see Table B 1.1) do not have measures on direct impact.

## Sustainable food system

There is a strong connection between green infrastructure, nature-based solutions and the City's food system. The City is not characterized by agricultural activities but one of the unique features is the
City of Gothenburg
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
5

ownership of around 3,000 ha of agricultural land and the many ongoing activities to promote and support urban farming on public property. A study performed by the municipality has provided estimates for self-sufficiency of food, if this land were to be utilized, and concluded a potential of nearly 40% of the annual consumption. An increased share of local production is one of the City's related goals and it will not only support local businesses, enable control and transparency throughout the food chain and shorten the food chains (which also lessen food waste) but also make possible a decreased footprint in regard to biodiversity and climate change.

In addition to this the City's procurement for public meals is one of the largest in Sweden, which makes it possible to send a signal on sustainable consumption patterns as well as making a real difference to individual suppliers of food. To support that public meal makers uses a local food concept ('miljömåltider', 'environmentally friendly meals' in english) to weigh up different sustainability aspects and promote a sustainable food culture.

To make good use of these local features City is currently reviewing the comprehensive plan to ensure responsible land and water use in relation to substantial public interest and to future-proof the expansion of Gothenburg. For this purpose, the City also develops a visualization within the City's digital twin to exhibit a future food system with minimized climate impact as well as taking other ecological and societal aspects into account at the same time as it will display a wide range of urban food production methods.

A more sustainable food culture to support societal development brings another additional benefit, aside from contributing to a sustainable food system, since it improves resilience of the society in the new reality of external, antagonistic agendas in the geopolitical situation.

## An ecological perspective in the urban planning process

The City has several steering documents, guidelines and methods to ensure a structured and systematic approach for handling various environmental challenges in the urban planning process. The direction of development of the Gothenburg comprehensive plan shows ways to achieve the City's overall goal of sustainable development. This involves that the City as far as possible will preserve and develop existing ecosystem services and biodiversity in planning and construction. When new areas are planned, more ecosystem services should also be created. A coherent blue-green structure, from the large natural areas and watercourses in the suburbs to a more fine-meshed network in the dense city, promotes outdoor recreation as well as plant and animal life. The City strives to protect agricultural land for food supply.

The Green Plan shows how the City works with green qualities from an ecological, social and economic perspective. Three overall perspectives define Gothenburg as a close, cohesive and robust city where a) a variety of nature types and green connections create conditions for a high level of biodiversity, b) parks, natural areas and urban spaces contribute to varied, equal and healthy living environments and c) the ecosystem services of the green structure create value and form the basis for a sustainable economy.

Another example is the Guideline for ecosystem services. Working with this tool imply that if natural and/or recreational values risk being negatively affected by planning and exploration, the City of Gothenburg uses the checklist to see which functions exist and how the development risks affecting them. By doing so impacts can be avoided and minimized. However sometimes the ecological functions of the site need to be replaced in such cases this is done with compensatory measures. The measures can be to create new or improve existing functions that sites have for various ecosystem services. Another tool is 'green area factors' which imply that the planning process should use nature-based solutions to address various environmental challenges, such as local climate, biodiversity and large amounts of water.

GIS, geographic information system, is necessary for both environmental monitoring and for strategic urban planning. The City of Gothenburg is working to develop the information that is needed to analyse the conditions of the nature resources in the municipality. For example, a new layer in GIS is produced for ecosystem services.

Additionally, the City is building knowledge and capacities to be able to work according to the documents and guidelines at the city scale.

## Nature preservation and restoration

The City works with many activities for nature preservation and restoration. For example, the City is since 15 years ago applying close to nature forestry management and work with restoration of peat bogs and biotope protection for eelgrass.

## The strategy We plan for a green and resilient city

The strategy We plan for a green and resilient city is one of seven strategies on which the City's Environment and Climate Programme is based. The strategy aims to clarify and strengthen work on biodiversity and ecosystem services across administrations and companies. This means speeding up the work of utilizing, developing, integrating and increasing the proportion of urban greenery, blue structures and ecosystem services. It also means emphasizing blue-green infrastructure as a structuring and natural part of urban planning. The strategy also targets changing the perception of biodiversity, green-blue structures and ecosystem services. The effect that the work with the strategy target is that biodiversity, blue-green structures and ecosystem services are valued in the same way as other infrastructure, making the issues a natural and integrated part of all urban development and the City's economic assessments.

# 3.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

The actions/systemic levers presented in Table B-2.1 below complements the systemic levers in table B-1.1 above.

B-2.1: Description of action portfolios for each field of action

|  Fields of action | Systemic levers |   | Systemic impact and change  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Energy system (including industry) | The City optimizes the district heating system. | Technology and infrastructure, Finance and funding | More investments in district heating to reduce the need for heating solutions from electricity. This helps decrease "power peaks" and marginal production in a situation where Gothenburg needs a lot of electricity in a short amount of time.  |
|  Energy system (including industry) | The City expands production and infrastructure as well as optimizes measures for the district cooling system. | Technology and infrastructure, Finance and funding | The need for cooling system will increase as temperature rises. Scaling up and optimize existing district cooling system will lead to decreased use of electricity for cooling. For Gothenburg, this is a matter of householding with resources as well as maintaining lower power peak in the electricity system, compared to more investment in single household solutions. This also allows waste heat to be used, which during the summer months exceeds the demand.  |
|  Energy system (including industry) | The City investigates possibilities for seasonal heating storage, taking care of waste heat and also investigates combination of district heating/waste heat and heating pumps. | Technology and infrastructure, Finance and funding | Resource and energy efficient heating system in the city. This is due to a decreased need for single solution-investments for heating where district heating is possible from an economic and environmental perspective.  |
|  Energy system (including industry) | The City implements local policies for the local electricity system such as efficiency rates, flexibility markets and conditional agreements. This affects many groups of actors and contributes to increase connectivity between different sectors such as buildings, transport and electricity system. | Governance and policy | By implementing new local policies and scaling up already implemented local policies, the companies and citizens use energy more efficient due to economic incentives. The use of electricity will also be spread out during the day, which will even out power peaks and thereby decrease the need of investment in production. By increasing the link between the electricity sector with other sectors, such as transport and building, the flexibility in the electricity system will increase, leading to decreased need of investment in more production.  |
|  Energy system (including industry) | The City works to increase cooperation between cities, regions, authorities, companies, organisations and citizens for expanding renewable production of electricity. | Governance and policy, Democracy and participation | Enhanced cooperation at all levels, from local to national and between different actors in the society is a necessity to meet the increased demand of renewable electricity. The need is mainly drivers from the industries and transport sector in Gothenburg, on the path to become fossil free. This demands a large amount of cooperation between national and local authorities as well as private actors to produce large amounts of renewable electricity in a relatively short period of time.  |
|  Energy system (including industry) | The City invests in new clean electricity (solar, wind and bio power). | Finance and funding | Increased supply of renewable electricity from solar PV's on public and private buildings, large scale wind and solar farms at land and sea as well as electricity from CHP.  |
|  Energy system (including industry) | The City develops storage of electricity in large and small batteries. | Technology and infrastructure, Finance and funding | Investments in small and large batteries will decrease power peaks and the need of investments in production of electricity.  |

## B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

The work with residual emissions is in an early state in the City of Gothenburg and mainly involves learning and capacity building activities. This involves learning from other cities that have done more in this area and investigating methods and actions that could work in Gothenburg.

An example of actions that are investigated to see how they could work as natural sinks are in the area of nature preservation and restoration. The City is, for example, applying close to nature forestry management and work with restoration of peat bogs and biotope protection for eelgrass.

Additionally, Renova AB (the waste-to-energy facility owned by the City of Gothenburg and nine other municipalities) in collaboration with the Administration for Sustainable Waste and Water and Göteborg Energi AB, has initiated a pilot project aimed at generating biochar from collected waste originating from gardens and parks, with the potential to harness surplus heat (6-10 GWh) as a resource in the district heating system. The biochar produced at the local facility can, for instance, be used as a soil

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part C “Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030” aims to outline any enabling interventions, i.e., regarding organizational setting or collaborative governance models or related to social innovations – designed to support the climate action portfolios (Module B-2) as well as aiming to achieve co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Module B-1). These interventions also address the identified opportunities, gaps and barriers identified Module A-2 and A-3.

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

### C-1.1: Description or visualisation of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

#### Introduction to governance innovation interventions

The governance innovation interventions are addressing the systemic barriers and opportunities identified in section A3. The interventions are categorised in four groups of different character:

) Governance innovation interventions for the City organisation
) Multi-level innovation interventions primarily addressing the aspects of multi-level governance, and
) Multi-actor innovation interventions primarily addressing the multi-actor collaboration within different sectors, systems or emission impact domains
) Citizen inclusion interventions

#### Governance innovation interventions for the City organisation

##### The governance challenge

The City of Gothenburg is, like most municipalities, organised in silos according to each department’s specific task. This is, in the case of the City of Gothenburg, enhanced by a decentralised organisational structure with strongly independent organisational bodies, each having their own mandate and governance. This means that the City of Gothenburg is organised for effective continual management. This effectiveness is an advantage for climate transition actions that can be handled vertically. But since some overarching climate transition actions require collaboration and decision-making across silos, the vertical management structure needs to be complemented with functions that support joint information sharing, collaboration and decision-making between the different administrations and companies.

Since 2019, the City has addressed this challenge trying to find governance innovations capable to unlock the potential it would bring to the climate transition and mission of climate neutrality. The City’s work on this is ongoing and will continue to evolve until the mission is within reach. The main tools developed so far in this development are described below.

##### The Climate Transition Function

The Climate Transition Function is a complementary governance innovation with the aim to address the challenges described above by complementing the vertical structures to better handle the governance and management required to achieve the necessary climate transition. This may include the development of new development pathways for the City that involve systemic change, which requires management and governance to incorporate a city-wide perspective. Moreover, it requires that certain enabling capabilities and capacities are in place.
City of Gothenburg
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
O

The purpose of the City of Gothenburg's Climate Transition Function is thus to create the conditions for effective decision-making within the City's management and governance that are required to achieve the City's climate goals. The work towards this purpose includes showing 1.) what is being done to achieve the City's climate goals, 2.) what more is required to achieve the goal and 3.) how this can be achieved. The Climate Transition Function should not be regarded as an organisational unit in the traditional sense. It is rather a form of organizing that is coordinated by the Environmental Administration but is based on the active participation of a large number of municipal administrations and companies, which together develop and shape the work.

## The Climate Transition Function - the "engine" for the Climate City Contract

The Climate City Contract, with its Action Plan and Investment Plan are crucial tools that answer to the need of functions that support joint information, collaboration and decision-making. The first Climate City Contract of Gothenburg is this one, but continuous revision is planned in order to keep it a relevant tool serving its purpose. Besides, the City sees the need to develop a Climate Transition Strategy that complement the Action Plan and Investment Plan by external analysis of trends and risks, exploring different pathways on long-term and short-term basis, and accordingly, constituting a better basis for joint decision-making.

## The Climate Budget

In addition to the Climate Transition Function, the Climate Budget is being developed as a tool to address the barriers to systemic transformation in the City, related to knowledge, skills and leadership (described in A-3.1).

The Climate Budget aims to raise awareness and mobilise stakeholders by compiling and visualising results in the form of the current climate footprint and estimated future climate footprint in relation to the City's climate targets.

The City's Climate Budget is proposed to describe how the City can manage and plan the use of the remaining amount of greenhouse gas emissions without exceeding the climate target.

## The Climate Budget is:

a methodology for more clearly linking the City's climate goals to the effects of the climate measures that the City is implementing and planning to implement through a city-wide framework for reporting current and estimating future emission reductions.
a platform to visualise the City's climate footprint and how the implementation of the City's climate action plan is progressing.
a tool to effective management of emissions data.

## The seven cross-cutting strategies

Another governance innovation intervention aiming at addressing the challenges connected to the silo organisation aspect is the City's new cross-cutting strategies that was launched as part of the Environment and Climate Programme in 2021.

Through the seven cross-cutting strategies, committees and boards will join forces in areas that require a high degree of collaboration and new cross-cutting solutions. The strategies aim to bring about change-driven development to accelerate the transition to a sustainable city. For each strategy, there is a coordinating board or committee responsible for driving and aligning the strategy. The Environmental- and Climate Committee is responsible in coordinating the work within and between the strategies.

## Two strategies to deal with underlying enablers
City of Gothenburg
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
O

Two of the seven cross-cutting strategies (We act as forerunners and We work strategically on financing to accelerate the transition) focus on underlying enablers such as cross-sector multi-actor cooperation, skills and leadership, influence and strategic communication, improved financial capacity for the transition as well as addressing the problem of fragmented innovation. Hence, these strategies are governance innovation interventions also due to their focus areas.

## The Climate Council (Klimatrådet)

Another governance innovation intervention is the local Climate Council that provides knowledge for the City to implement, contributes to skills and leadership and is an example of cross-sector multi-actor collaboration.

The seven members of the Climate Council are all active researchers in the three sustainability dimensions of social, economic and ecological sustainability. The members are elected for two years. With their independent expertise, they can support both the City of Gothenburg and society's transition. The Climate Council will propose feasible and specific measures to reduce climate impact in the future. The Climate Council shall report its work in writing to the Environment and Climate Committee once per year. The report must state which measures are deemed to provide the greatest climate benefit and the greatest social cost-effectiveness.

## Testbed Gothenburg (Testbädd Göteborg)

Testbed Gothenburg is an initiative that includes the entire city: industry, public actors, academia, research institutes science parks and the City. It aims to create inspiration and discussion around test beds: development, business models and collaboration opportunities. Testbed Gothenburg is based on existing testbeds, initiatives and programmes with the aim of raising the level further and opening up to new actors. Testbed Gothenburg is one tool to build on the successful work on testbeds and further address the systemic barriers of fragmented innovation and involve more actors to enable upscaling.

## The Knowledge Arena (Din Kunskapsarena)

Another intervention is The Knowledge Arena focusing on internal capabilities of the City to foster innovation and digitalisation.

## Virtual Gothenburg

Virtual Gothenburg is a digital twin developed to address the increasing societal challenges of climate change, segregation and the complexity of society at large. Virtual Gothenburg creates new opportunities to better describe, understand, plan and manage the city. It enables better basis for decision-making and understanding of the challenges and solutions related to climate neutrality.

## Multi-level governance innovation interventions

The multi-level governance innovation interventions have emerged in collaboration with other actors. They are either initiated and developed by the City of Gothenburg together with other actors or the City has simply joined initiatives developed by other actors.

## Viable Cities and NetZeroCities

The multi-level governance innovation interventions are all addressing the systemic barriers of multi-level governance, enabling the City of Gothenburg to interact with regional, national and international levels. Viable Cities and NetZeroCities are both system innovation platforms with multiple aims enabling the City of Gothenburg to work with organisations and institutional bodies on all levels as well as other cities.

## West Sweden Regional Mobilisation

City of Gothenburg
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

To be successful towards the mission of climate neutrality it is important to collaborate regionally as many of the challenges are closely linked with neighbouring municipalities and the region. Gothenburg, together with the Gothenburg region and a handful of other regional cities are planning on how to build a stronger regional mobilisation, here called the West Sweden Regional Mobilisation.

## Municipalities' 30 climate pledges

The municipalities' climate pledges are an initiative within the 'Climate 2030 - Västra Götaland is changing', which is run by Region Västra Götaland and County Administrative Board Västra Götaland. In 2021 and 2022, the municipalities in Västra Götaland have together implemented climate pledges that are estimated to reduce emissions by more than 75,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents. For 2024-2026, most of the municipalities in Västra Götaland have now submitted their climate pledges, with a total of around 800 pledges being adopted. The municipalities have a strategically important role in achieving the climate goals. The municipalities' climate pledges consist of 30 concrete measures over which the municipality has control, which are tried and tested, and which can lead to major emission reductions. The climate pledges are politically adopted and each municipality is responsible for implementing the adopted climate pledges. A platform for collaboration is formed where successes and failures are shared among the municipalities.

## Orchestrate climate transition through collaboration and networks

The City is involved in many member organisations, networks and platforms and uses this as a tool to solve problems, gain knowledge and influence other actors. The City plans for further development on how to contribute to and utilise networks and collaborations on local, regional, national and international levels in a more coordinated way aiming to orchestrate a higher transition speed. Developing a more coordinated and intentional way of contribution to the collaborations will enable the City to bridge systemic barriers to a larger extent.

## Multi-actor governance innovation interventions

The thematic multi-actor governance innovation interventions are all being developed to overcome systemic barriers and combat system inertia by working together across sectors and organisations. By bridging the gap between organisations the City enhances its influence over the development and creates knowledge, skills and leadership to increase the pace towards climate neutrality. Fragmented innovation and implications of the political system are also barriers that are remedied by these initiatives. Mission orientation is at its core in these types of interventions.

Gothenburg and western Sweden has a solid experience and has cultivated a culture for this type of multi-actor collaborations. They are often joint initiatives by the City or any of its partners.

## Housing and buildings emission impact domain

The Gothenburg Platform for Climate-Neutral Construction (Göteborgs plattform för klimatneutralt byggande) summons 130 organisations within the Housing and buildings emission impact domain, also contributing to reduced emissions within the waste and energy systems as well as consumption based emissions.

The Handshake (Handslaget – initiativ för cirkulärt byggande och återbruk) is an initiative comprising 50 actors working towards circular construction building a new market to reduce emissions from construction.

## Mobility and transport emission impact domain
City of Gothenburg
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Gothenburg Green City Zone is a multi-actor initiative creating emission free transportation within three geographical areas developing test beds and scaling up innovation.

Public transport for the future is a portfolio of initiatives in collaboration between actors working on the development of public transportation and the intersection with new solutions within micro-mobility and car sharing.

ElectriCity is a demonstration arena for electrification of transports and work machines developed by a cross-sectoral team from public, private and academic sectors.

The Green Connection is a portfolio of linked initiatives together with numerous actors with the ambitions to become the world's most sustainable harbour. Involving the entire logistics chain this initiative has the potential to reduce emissions both locally and globally.

## Industrial processes emission impact domain

Climate-leading Process Industry (Klimatledande Processindustri) organises seminars, working group meetings, meetings with decision-makers and initiates innovation and development projects in the chemical and process industry. There is also collaboration with other sectors and clusters in Sweden and Europe.

Fashion, Facts and Fun is the name of the City's collaboration with fashion companies in the Gothenburg region to support their transition. The ambition is to contribute to more sustainable and competitive business models, understand and see opportunities in increased requirements and stricter regulations. This is part of the regional Textile Movement.

## Food, water and green areas emission impact domain

The food system collaboration node aims to enhance collaboration between the City's food system actors to reduce emissions from food production while creating resilience and co-benefits.

## Other domains/unspecified

The world's most sustainable destination is an initiative cutting across emission impact domains reducing emissions from transportation and mobility, energy, waste and buildings by working with the tools connected to destination development. Seven times in a row, Gothenburg has ranked as the world's most sustainable destination according to the Global Destination Sustainability Index. And in 2021, Lonely Planet named Gothenburg the world's Best sustainable city stay. To keep this leading position requires even more developed and broad efforts engaging key actors across the City organisation as well as the tourism sector, accommodation, restaurants, events, etc.

## Partnerships with academia

The City is also engaged in partnerships with academia. The City, Chalmers University of Technology and Gothenburg University has ongoing collaboration with one focus area for in-depth collaboration on "A fossil-free Gothenburg".

Urban Futures – Centre for Sustainable Urban Development is an important platform for developing knowledge, networks and transdisciplinary methodology to address sustainability challenges, not least concerning governance for a just climate transition. The platform is regional and includes the City of Gothenburg, Chalmers University of Technology, the University of Gothenburg, RISE Research

Institutes of Sweden, IVL – Swedish Environmental Research Institute, GR – the Gothenburg Region, VGR – Region Västra Götaland, and the West Sweden County Administrative Board.

Wexsus (West Sweden Nexus for Sustainable Development) is a new platform under development. It is a collaborative arena run jointly by Chalmers University of Technology, the University of Gothenburg and University West. The platform connects all sectors of society and build relationships to strengthen the ability to implement a sustainable transition based on research-based knowledge.

## Citizen inclusion interventions

A society where people's commitment is taken care of is the basis for a strong democracy, as well as for strengthening social innovation. Therefore, it is important that the City of Gothenburg continues to develop its capacity and ability to cooperate and include citizens and civil society organisations to a greater degree. This requires both new ways of working, organization and many times also a cultural change in the City. The City is currently building a stronger infrastructure for democratic action, consisting of tools and methods for citizen dialogue and engagement such as citizens proposals, citizen budget and open arenas for dialogue. In addition to that, the City has initiated a new citizen assembly taking place in spring 2024 where the participants will work on the question of how citizens can become more involved in the climate transition.

There are already many civil society and community driven initiatives in Gothenburg contributing towards the transition to a climate neutral city, but the local government needs to improve its capacity to collaborate and take advantage of the engagement already existing, including enabling for new bottom-up initiatives. Plans are being developed in order to work in a more structured way with civil society. The aim is to explore how dialogue and cooperation can be improved, potentially leading to a new way of co-creating solutions to become a climate neutral city.

Initiatives that will support this development towards 2030 and onwards are constantly being processed.

Initiatives providing different types of platforms to support this development are:

An Infrastructure for democratic action and participation is being developed to strengthen the City organisation and enhance organisational and personal skills for democratic action and participation.
The test of a Citizen assembly as a social innovation and citizen inclusion method.
A Civil society platform for climate and environmental transition, a concept currently under development with the aim of creating more common action towards the mission together with civil society organisations.
"The Futureable City" – an ambulant concept for stakeholder and citizen dialogue about the sustainable future of the City.
"The Transition City" – a concept which is at an early stage and not yet formed, but with ambitions to fill a perceived gap of supporting initiatives towards the mission.
Frihamnsdagarna – an annual democracy festival and an arena for city dialogue around many issues including sustainability and climate transition.
Virtual Gothenburg – a digital twin that provide tools for citizen involvement and shared understanding.

## C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

### Introduction to social innovation interventions

Strongly connected to innovative culture and citizen inclusion, social innovation tackles the societal challenges that is reaching climate-neutrality with a bottom-up, collaborative, holistic and human-centred approach to innovation.

The governance innovation interventions described in C.1 are not isolated from the social innovation interventions. Some interventions described in this section focus on how the governance innovations will be further developed to grasp the social innovation aspect to a larger extent.

What the social innovation interventions have in common is a focus on overcoming the systemic barriers of societal norms and behaviours, political implications, knowledge, skills and leadership described further in section A.3. The social innovation interventions have the potential to enable more rapid change towards the mission of climate neutrality through unleashing the potential of the systemic opportunities. Important opportunities for these interventions are cross-sector multi-actor collaboration, co-benefits, just transition, citizen inclusion and, of course, social innovation.

### Capacity building within the City

Within the City organisation there is a need for continuous work on building skills and capacity to better make use of social innovation as a tool for unlocking potential. Initiatives supporting this are:

The Strategy: We create conditions for sustainable living which from a strategic point aims to canalise the City's effort to a sustainable living in Gothenburg.
User-centered innovation initiative – capacity building to put people in the center of solutions, based on a Design Thinking methodology.
Just Transitions Graduate School will build knowledge and train eight PHD students on how a just transition can be implemented in the local context of a city.

### Urban infrastructure and culture of a circular and sharing economy

Opportunities to make sustainable choices are often associated with the range and conditions available in and around homes, neighborhoods and in commercial centers. An important focus is therefore to encourage and collaborate with actors in urban development who can influence people's local environment and develop sustainable and circular services and offerings in consumption, leisure and entertainment.

The City of Gothenburg has during many years facilitated the development of the circular and sharing economy in Gothenburg in order to enable a more resource efficient consumption and lifestyle for its citizens. Gothenburg was previously part of the national program Sharing Cities Sweden, where the city became a testbed for developing new concepts and service for sharing products and space, such as Sweden's first toy library, but also exploring how the sharing economy can become integrated in new urban development projects. As part of the "15-minute city concept", that has inspired many cities during recent years, the City of Gothenburg has also just started its journey on developing local squares and neighbourhoods, where the eco-system of sharing and circular economy initiatives must be integrated as well.

The City government is as well cooperating with the civil society organization Kollaborativ Ekonomi Sverige who developed the Smart Map Start - Smarta Kartan | Gothenburg launched in 2016, a social innovation and digital platform showing the way to sharing and circular initiatives in the city. The challenge for many NGOs and community driven sharing initiatives is access to premises to a low rent to run their activities. The City of Gothenburg is currently revising its grant system for civil

society organisations to better meet the needs of those organisations active in the sharing economy.

## Private consumption &amp; Consumption-based emission tools

Since private consumption accounts for approximately 60 percent of the consumption-based climate emissions in Gothenburg, it needs to decrease drastically for the City to reach its climate goals. As part of the Environment and Climate Programme, the City has a strategy focusing on creating the conditions for a sustainable consumption and lifestyle for those who live, visit and work in Gothenburg. This requires the City to use all available tools and policy instruments, for example planning Gothenburg in a manner that facilitates a sustainable lifestyle and offering services and events always being environmentally and climate friendly.

The task of reducing consumption-based emissions is complex and depends on a variety of factors and solutions taking place on all political levels. In addition to that, it is important to recognize the fact consumption-based emissions vary a lot between different income groups in society. Recent research from Stockholm Environment Institute calculates consumption emissions down on post code level for every municipality in Sweden. The City of Gothenburg has incorporated this data in its own map planning tool Gokart. The next step is to continue increasing awareness among civil servants and politicians on how consumption-based emissions vary a lot among groups and geographical areas of Gothenburg in order to develop more sharp and efficient measures.

## Focus area consumption

The initiatives described above can be seen in the context of social innovation initiatives focused on consumption. An overview of the initiatives shows:

Urban infrastructure for a circular and sharing economy – creating the utilities needed for circular consumption through collaboration within the City and together with CSO:s.
The Smart Map – a social innovation and digital platform enabling circular initiatives.
Single-use free city - An initiative paving the way for the elimination of single-use food and drink packaging by being ahead of regulation, testing and scaling up solutions.
Private consumption &amp; consumption-based emission tools – an innovative analyse tool under development.
Sustainable destination and climate smart events – an initiative comprising consumption broadly but with the departure point of events and Gothenburg as a destination.
Way out West – Gothenburg's most famous annual music festival has a focus to inspire visitors and exchange ideas on greener lifestyles. The City has collaborated dedicatedly with the festival, with good results, and with the devotion to continue along the same path.

## Focus transportation

Initiatives within the field of social innovation interventions focused primarily on transport and mobility are:

Gothenburg Green City Zone – emission free transportation zones with the ambition to widen efforts towards scaling-up through social innovation tools.
Reallocate – living labs to find interventions that catalyse change in mobility practices.

## Focus food production

The initiative within the field of social innovation interventions focused primarily on food is:

# 4 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the CCC Action Plan above and highlight the next steps and plans for refining the CCC Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract in future iterations.

# Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iteration

This 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, as part of Gothenburg's Climate City Contract, is the first plan of this kind that the City has generated and will act as the foundation for future versions.

Looking at the different parts of the Climate City Contract together, further development is needed to assist the City along the pathway ahead. The City will continue to base future investment plans on modelling in combination with an inventory of ongoing activities. The City needs to identify effective ways of working based on interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes to produce an investment plan that is as relevant as possible. The Action Plan, with its measures and calculated emission reduction impact, is also a subject for further work on consolidating the top-down and bottom-up perspectives.

The forming of the Action Plan, as well as the Investment Plan and Commitment, has generated new insights that need to influence the content and procedures of the Environment and Climate Programme as well as other relevant governing documents and processes.

The Action Plan needs to be refined and continuously iterated to be a relevant tool for the City and its partners. A prognosis regarding the City's progress will need to be looked at annually and justly revised in conjunction with the operational planning for the City's administrations and companies.

The Environment and Climate Programme, including the City-wide Environment Management System, has well-planned structures of evaluation and revision. The National Climate Contract, conducted in a process together with 22 other Swedish municipalities and six national authorities, has an additional procedure with an annually edited and signed contract. Now, forming a Climate City Contract as part of the climate neutral and smart cities on an EU-level, adds to the complexity. All these three main processes have additional values to the City of Gothenburg, and therefore it is crucial that these processes are aligned to provide maximum output. Put together, they also need to be streamlined to enable the City and other involved stakeholders to focus limited resources on the right things. Exactly how this alignment will look like in detail, is not possible to outline in this early stage and need to be further examined. The Climate City Contract in its complete form will be revised annually or biannually.

# Monitoring and accelerating learning

The governance innovation interventions that the City of Gothenburg has developed, and will continue to develop, will contribute to the collective learning and shared knowledge that is necessary for dealing with the uncertainty that comes with climate transition.

The Climate Transition Function is a central tool to orchestrate co-action, but also co-learning. The Climate Transition Function is developing climate transition scenarios, which provide knowledge on how the different City departments and companies need to act, and how the management needs to adapt in relation to the scenarios. Together with the Climate Budget, the City will be better placed to manage emissions data and plan future measures. The interventions to coordinate the work within the City organisation need to be connected to the collaborative work with other actors, other levels and the citizens. From strengthening these connections, the City will have better preconditions to

Climate Neutrality Action Plan
O

carry out sensemaking, reflection and synthesis based on a strong knowledge base. This is crucial for being successful when working in a system transforming way.

Conclusions from the accelerated learning is absorbed by the processes of the Environment and Climate Programme, including the City-wide Environment Management System and the seven cross-cutting strategies, where actions of different character, both short-term and long-term, will be incorporated. The Environment and Climate Programme is monitored every second year and is also subject for revision, the next revision taking place 2025. Learnings from the Climate City Contract will be included in the monitoring of the programme. The monitoring process means that there is a constant learning loop within the City, forming preconditions for utilising the accelerated learning.

## The Climate City Contract

The Climate City Contract is more than a document. It is a process of assembling all relevant efforts and plans, and for connecting most relevant stakeholders around the City's ambition to reach its climate goal. Continuous revision will ensure that it will be a continuous tool for joint information sharing, collaboration and decision-making. Together with the Climate Transition Strategy and the national climate contract, the Climate City Contract will be much more than a manifestation – it will be one of the City's most important tools for successful climate transition.

# City of Gothenburg governance system

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

The starting points for governance of the City of Gothenburg are laws and constitutions, the political will and the city's inhabitants, users and customers. In order to realize the starting points, conditions of different kinds are required. The city's politicians have the opportunity to describe, through governing documents, how they want to realize the political will. The city of Gothenburg is governed by the governing documents adopted by the municipal council and the municipal council. In addition, the boards and corporate boards determine their own governing documents for their own activities. The municipality's budget is the overriding and superior governing document for the City Councils and corporate boards.

# City of Gothenburg governing documents

City of Gothenburg governing documents ensure that we have the means to do the right thing in the right way. The documents stipulate what committees, boards, administrations and companies should do, how they should do it, and who is responsible for implementation.

‘Governing documents’ is the collective term for all these documents.

The city’s basic principles, including human rights principles, the non-discrimination policy, and fundamental views on democracy, are put into practice by incorporating them into the city’s regular decision-making processes. The preparatory work leading up to decisions relating to governing documents are of vital significance to the embodiment of these principles in the work of the City of Gothenburg and its various organisations.

Governing documents should clarify for the organisation, as well as the city’s inhabitants, service-users, customers, suppliers, partners and other stakeholders, about what is expected of the administrations and companies. Governing documents also form the basis for insisting on direct accountability when we fail to work in compliance with the decisions that have been reached.

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021–2030
# Introduction

## Purpose of the programme

The Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg is the guide and the shared platform for the city's strategic long-term work for the environment. The programme lays the foundation for the transition to an environmentally sustainable city by 2030 and it is the city's comprehensive governing document for work within the environmental dimension of sustainable development.

## Who is covered by the programme?

The programme applies to all committees and boards of the City of Gothenburg. The programme is valid from its adoption until 2030.

## Background

The City of Gothenburg’s budget for 2019 gave the Environmental- and Climate Committee together with the City Executive Board the task of adjusting and updating the City of Gothenburg’s Environmental Programme.

The City Executive Board decided in 2019 to change the name to Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg.

The programme has been developed by the Environment Administration in collaboration with the City Management Office and with the support of staff from the city's departments and companies.

## Link to other governing documents and legislation

The City of Gothenburg's budget is the comprehensive governing document for all boards and committees. There are international agreements in the environmental field such as the Paris Agreement, Agenda 2030 and legislation such as EU directives. There is also national legislation such as the Environmental Code and related environmental quality standards. The goal of the Environmental Code is to promote a sustainable development in order for the current and coming generations to live in a good and healthy environment. Environmental quality standards reflect the minimum acceptable environmental quality or the desired environmental state. In addition to the legislation there is the national system of environmental goals which contains the goals for the environment on a national level. The purpose of the environmental goals is to provide a long-term objective for environmental policy and to serve as a guide for society's environmental work as a whole. These are also a realization of the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals, Agenda 2030. Agenda 2030 is a

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030
(52)
universal agenda for an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable development.

The Environment and Climate Programme also interacts with several governing documents within the City of Gothenburg.

# Limitations

The following limitations apply to the Environment and Climate Programme:

The programme does not contain goals for areas that are already covered by other governing documents in the city, such as waste prevention, reuse and recycling as addressed by the regional waste plan,
The programme does not contain any goals regarding climate change adaptation. Instead, the focus is on reducing our climate impact and thereby reducing the future need for climate change adaptation measures. However, the programme's strategy *We plan for a green and resilient city* provides space for collaboration on solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change through green infrastructure.
Requirements contained in legislation or other regulations that motivate change are not repeated as goals or target values for indicators in the programme.

# Implementation of this programme

The Environmental- and Climate Committee is responsible for driving and coordinating the work based on the committee's mission in the regulation to "drive and coordinate the city's work in the environmental dimension of sustainable development".

There is a clear ambition to develop capacity to work with the implementation in order to reach the goals in the programme. This will be done in two ways:

Regular operational planning with the support of environmental management systems

All committees and boards shall in their regular operational planning, with the support of their environmental management system, identify and prioritize the measures required to be carried out in their respective areas of responsibility, in order to reach the environmental goals and sub-goals in the programme. Environmental issues will in this way be integrated into the organizations' planning.

Cross-sectoral work through the programme's strategies

Through the programme's seven cross-cutting strategies, committees and boards will join forces in areas that require a high degree of collaboration and new cross-cutting solutions. The strategies aim to bring about change-driven development to accelerate the transition to a sustainable city.

For each strategy, there is a coordinating board or committee responsible for driving and aligning the strategy. The Environmental- and Climate Committee is responsible in coordinating the work within and between the strategies.

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030
(52)
Any requirements of additional city-wide action plans to this will be considered. New action plans that may be developed should complement existing plans in the city and include measures that require cross-sectoral cooperation.

The coordination between the City of Gothenburg and trade and industry, inhabitants, academia, other cities and other actors is a prerequisite to meet the goals. In order to ensure a clear focus on implementation and being able to meet any obstacles that may arise, it is of great importance that the programme is properly followed up.

# Follow-up of this programme

The follow-up and the analysis of the completion of goals will be reported to the City Council every two years unless the City Council decides on a different frequency related to specific parts or the whole programme. The Environmental Administration collects information for the programme's indicators continuously during the period and will request information from the city's organizations when necessary. The current indicators that are missing in the programme will be established at the beginning of the programme period and be used in the monitoring of the programme. In addition to the indicators defined in the programme there will also be other, supporting indicators which will be followed to determine how the work with the goals is progressing. The Environmental Administration will be able to follow the organizations' work with the programme and its goals through the city's ongoing work with the environmental management system.

A process-oriented follow-up of the work under the programme's strategies will be carried out to identify both successes, difficulties and possible ways forward. The results will be used for learning and for capacity development which are required to accelerate the implementation. Feedback will be given to appointed director groups connected to each strategy and will be reported once a year to the City Executive Board.

The programme will be evaluated and revised during its period of validity.

# An environmentally sustainable city – for nature, climate and people

## Agenda 2030 is the starting point

The starting point of the Environment and Climate Programme is the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals Agenda 2030, Sweden's national environmental goals system, the Paris Agreement, and the challenges that Gothenburg as a community and the City of Gothenburg as an organization face in order to make the transition to an environmentally sustainable society.

The three dimensions of sustainability are integrated in the global sustainable development goals: social, economic, and environmental. The goals are indivisible and several of the goals are dependent on and directly linked to each other, which means that a positive development for one goal could provide positive effects for another goal. Sustainability within the environmental dimension is a basic prerequisite to achieve sustainability within the economic and social dimensions.

## The objective of the programme: Environmentally sustainable city 2030

The objective of the programme is to transition Gothenburg to an environmentally sustainable city by 2030. This means that Gothenburg will become one of the world’s most progressive cities when it comes to preventing and addressing environmental and climate problems. Our children and future generations should not be burdened with problems that we can solve ourselves. Nor should humans, animals and nature in other countries be negatively affected by our way of living.

The Environment and Climate Programme is the comprehensive governing document for work within the environmental dimension of sustainable development in the City of Gothenburg. The programme will help drive the City of Gothenburg to transition into an environmentally sustainable society. The coordination between the City of Gothenburg and trade and industry, inhabitants, academia, other cities and other actors is a prerequisite to succeed with this.

## Environmental goals for nature, climate and people

The programme focuses on the greatest challenges for an environmentally sustainable Gothenburg, and it contains three environmental goals that addresses nature, climate and people. The three environmental goals cover the whole of Gothenburg. The environmental goals include twelve sub-goals that focus on the City of Gothenburg's own organization.

For each environmental goal and sub-goal there is a table with indicators that displays the current situation and target values. The indicators with the target values specify what

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021–2030
(52)
needs to be achieved for a given year. Indicators that lack values for the current situation are displayed with "requires development". These will be established at the beginning of the programme period. An in-depth description of goals and indicators can be found in appendix 1.

The Environment and Climate Programme is valid until 2030. The indicators for the three environmental goals and most of the sub-goals also have 2030 as the target year. Some of the indicators for the sub-goals have 2023 and 2025 as target years. This is because these are considered to be easier to achieve, that the transition in these areas needs to be accelerated, or that the target value needs to be reached in order for another indicator's target value to be reached by 2030. In addition to the indicators in the programme, there will also be support indicators used in the follow-up as a basis for assessments and analyses.

Each environmental goal states which of Sweden's national environmental goals and the global sustainable development goals the environmental goal mainly relates to. Each subgoal states what governing documents in the City of Gothenburg the sub-goal mainly coordinates with.

# The City of Gothenburg's control over environmental impact in Gothenburg

In order to reach the environmental goals and the sub-goals there needs to be changes in society that the City of Gothenburg has varying degrees of control over. Control in this context means the manner in which the city can influence an issue. To achieve these goals, the City of Gothenburg needs to work with our direct and indirect control as well as our control through influence. Examples of the city's different degrees of control are shown in figure 2. The City of Gothenburg's general control regarding the environmental goals and the sub-goals is shown in a table for each corresponding environmental goal.

# Cross-cutting strategies

The programme has, in addition to the goals, seven cross-cutting strategies. The work with the strategies contributes in different ways to achieving all the environmental goals.

Through the programme's strategies, committees and boards will join forces in areas that require a high degree of collaboration and new cross-cutting solutions. The aim of the strategies is to achieve a change-driven development of relevant working methods to accelerate the transition. The strategies will make the city work through more adaptive processes that encourage collaborative learning. It is crucial that the strategies are given the capacity to manage the transition.

# Summary of the programme's goals and strategies

Figure 3 shows a summary image of the three environmental goals together with the sub-goals and the programme's seven strategies. The goals are shortened in the image. The picture is framed by the four activities of the environmental management system for systematic environmental work: plan, implement, follow up and improve.

# Environmental goal: Gothenburg has a high level of biodiversity

The goal is for Gothenburg to have sufficient areas of natural habitats and habitats with proper management to conserve the species present in the municipality and to provide conditions for the development of ecosystem services by 2030 at the latest. The City of Gothenburg will also contribute to biodiversity on a regional, national, and a global level.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

# Biodiversity is the foundation for healthy ecosystems

The loss of biodiversity is one of the greatest global environmental problems today, according to the UN's expert panel of biodiversity scientists IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services). The use of land and water is changing resulting in loss of habitat for plants and animals. The main cause is the overexploitation of natural resources. In addition, global warming is causing species that build ecosystems to disappear. A great challenge is to reach the environmental quality standards for water.

A rich biodiversity is a prerequisite for nature to provide the uses and benefits that we humans receive from nature. These are called ecosystem services and examples of these include the pollination of crops by insects, the purification of water and air in nature, the fertilization of the soil by micro-organisms and worms, and the improvement of our health by spending time in nature.

Globally, species are becoming extinct at a high rate and ecosystems are being destroyed. But at the same time, there are good opportunities to reverse these trends. Gothenburg has a wide variety of habitats for many plants and animals. We need to develop and take care of Gothenburg's nature and its rich plant and animal life for the benefit of future generations.

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030
The City of Gothenburg can work toward that future because we

own and manage more than half of Gothenburg's land.
have the possibility to protect natural areas with support from the environmental code and to enter into voluntary conservation agreements with landowners.
manage Gothenburg’s wastewater that reaches waterways, lakes and the sea
plan the urban development of Gothenburg.
purchase large quantities of goods and services and are able to make tough demands in procurement.

The environmental goal is followed up with the help of the following indicators as well as the sub-goal’s indicators:

|  Indicators | Current situation | Target value 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Proportion of well-maintained meadows and pastures | 55 percent (2017) | More than 90 percent  |
|  Area of protected nature | 13,230 hectares (2019) | At least 16,200 hectares  |
|  Number of municipal biotope protection areas and natural monuments | 0 (2019) | 10 and 15 respectively  |
|  Area of natural grasslands | 2,112 hectares (2018) | Has not decreased compared to current situation  |
|  Area of deciduous forests | 1,734 hectares (2011) | Has not decreased compared to current situation  |
|  Proportion of surface water bodies with good ecological status | 17 percent (2019) | 100 percent  |

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

## The goal relates to these national environmental goals:

A non-toxic environment
Zero eutrophication
Flourishing lakes and streams
Good-quality groundwater
A balanced marine environment and flourishing coastal areas and archipelagos
Thriving wetlands
Sustainable forests
A varied agricultural landscape
A rich diversity of plant and animal life

# Sub-goals for nature

## 1. The City of Gothenburg protects and manages the habitats of species to ensure the development of natural values

Responsibility biotopes are habitats for plant and animal species that a municipality or region, for example, has a particular responsibility to conserve and develop from a national perspective.

The Environmental Administration has selected 23 categories of responsibility biotopes for Gothenburg. These include shallow sea bays, natural pastures, deciduous forests and small water bodies.

Many of the responsibility biotopes are dependent on continuous management, and lack of management is one of the major threats to them. One such example is how well-maintained grazing lands have declined by almost half from 1990 to today. These are very important habitats for a number of rare plants and animals that are dependent on grazing or mown meadows. Species in decline include the flowers catsfoot and meadow saxifrage. The city does not possess all the knowledge about the responsibility biotopes that we need to make the right priorities. This contributes to the fact that we do not manage and protect natural values sufficiently today.

In order to reach the goal, the City of Gothenburg needs to do an inventory and determine the need of protection for the responsibility biotopes in order to make the right priorities. Following that, the city needs to establish a long-term protection and management of the biotopes that are in need.

The greatest challenge is to increase efforts in habitats that require special management in order to preserve and develop their specific natural values, even outside protected areas. For areas that require grazing animals, the city can increase the cooperation with its

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030
leaseholders and other livestock owners. Within the city, we need to develop our work with the conservation tools that are suitable for smaller areas, such as creating biotope protection areas or entering into conservation agreements with private landowners.

|  Indicators | Current situation 2020 | Target value 2025 | Target value 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Proportion of inventoried categories of responsibility biotopes (23 in total) | 80 percent | 100 percent | -  |
|  Proportion of categories of responsibility biotopes determined to require protection | 0 percent | 100 percent | -  |
|  Area of responsibility biotopes, total and on municipal land | Total 11,165 hectares of which 2,787 hectares is municipal land. | - | To be completed by 2025 at the latest based on inventories  |
|  Proportion of responsibility biotopes with nature conservation management and proportion with formal protection, total and on municipal land | Nature conservation management: Requires development Proportion with formal protection: 53 percent in total, municipal 31 percent. | - | To be completed by 2025 at the latest based on inventories  |

## 2. The City of Gothenburg works towards cleaner seas, lakes and waterways

Good water status in seas, lakes and waterways is an environmental quality standard that Sweden's water management aims to achieve by 2027. Good water status consists of several quality factors, such as the state of the river bed, if there are migration barriers, and if there are nutrient discharges that affect aquatic life through overfertilisation. Only a few water bodies in Gothenburg have good status today. The City of Gothenburg affects the status in many different ways, such as through pollutions and in our planning and management of land and water.

It is a challenge to drastically reduce the city's impact on point emissions, surface water and land use both in the existing environment and in new construction. It could mean that the total emissions need to be reduced through efficiency improvement or by developing new treatment methods. The City of Gothenburg also needs to develop a clear cooperation on the measures with the municipalities located upstream in the city's waterways. Between 45–65 percent of the water bodies today are unclassified in regards to the status of different quality factors. It creates a large uncertainty range. A comprehensive and more detailed picture of the need for action will be provided in the City of Gothenburg's action plan for good water status (Göteborgs Stads åtgärdsplan för god vattenstatus).

|  Discharge of nitrogen and phosphorous from the sewage system (Ryaverket and overflow of wastewater) to Göta Älv | Nitrogen: 740 tons
Phosphorous: 29 tons | Reduction of the average value over a five-year period  |

# 3. The City of Gothenburg increases biodiversity in the urban environment

Much of the biodiversity in Gothenburg is found in urban areas. With proper management, green spaces in the urban environment have a great potential to make an important contribution to the conservation of the species found in Gothenburg. These may be proper habitats for plants and animals or opportunities for them to spread across the landscape. For example, old trees in our parks are habitats for many endangered beetles, lichen and fungi, such as Megalaria grossa and the Robustus conk. Some natural values can quickly deteriorate if their management is faulty or neglected, old trees can, for example, be damaged by other trees that grow inside their crown and roadsides rich in wild flowers can become overgrown with thickets.

The challenge lies in making sure biodiversity is increasing and taken care of as a resource for the city and its inhabitants as the city expands. The City of Gothenburg needs to establish a methodology where biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide become visible in development calculations. We also need to establish new tools that complements the city's working methodology in calculating the green space factor, which allows us to intelligently plan urban development with biodiversity. We need to make sure that areas with natural value are managed properly. It may mean that we need to establish new management methods.

|  Indicators | Current situation | Target value 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Proportion of public space with land usage “Nature” of the total planned area | 3.7 percent (2020) | Has not decreased compared to 2020  |
|  Proportion of green spaces according to established criteria that the City of Gothenburg owns within "Coherent urban development" (or equivalent designation in future comprehensive plans) that have management goals for biodiversity (broken down by nature, park, and developed area) | Requires development | 100 percent  |
|  Proportion of green spaces within “Coherent urban development” managed in a manner that increases biodiversity (broken down by nature, park, and developed area) – random sample | Requires development | 100 percent  |
|  Area of wetlands (in urban areas) | Requires development | Annual increase  |
# 4. The City of Gothenburg's purchases help promote biodiversity

The City of Gothenburg's purchases of goods and services affect biodiversity locally as well as globally. The services the city purchases, such as land management, have a corresponding and direct impact on biodiversity in conjunction with the work. We have good opportunities to promote biodiversity in construction and subcontracting, for example by creating meadows or sandy areas for wild bees and other pollinators. The production and consumption of food has a significant impact on biodiversity, not least in the agricultural landscape.

The City of Gothenburg purchases about 13,000 tons of food annually, and the city's preschools, schools, retirement homes and other housing facilities serve around 20 million meals each year.

One challenge is to use the increased knowledge of the impact of the city's purchases on biodiversity in order to make suitable demands during procurements. To follow up and to ensure that these conditions are met may mean that criteria and accounting methods need to be developed.

|  Indicators | Current situation | Target value 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Proportion of purchases of eco-certified/eco-labelled products and services where such options are available (Does not apply to purchases covered by the organic food indicator) | Requires development | Annual increase  |
|  Proportion of organic food purchases | 48 percent (2019) | 80 percent  |
|  Proportion of purchased construction and civil engineering contracts according to criteria regarding meaningful impact promoting biodiversity | Requires development | Annual increase  |

# The climate

## Environmental goal: Gothenburg's climate footprint is close to zero

The goal is for Gothenburg's climate footprint to be reduced annually with the aim of reaching a zero climate footprint as soon as possible. The emissions within the geographic area of Gothenburg will be reduced by at least 10.3 percent annually, and the consumption-based emissions will be reduced by at least 7.6 percent annually by 2030. The City of Gothenburg needs to reduce its emissions at a faster rate and use all tools and policy instruments available to drive the transition in society.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

## A global warming below 1.5 degrees

The average temperature in the earth's atmosphere has so far increased by more than one degree since pre-industrial times, and the effects of the increased temperature has already been seen in, for example, rising sea levels, the reduction of ice cover in the Arctic, and changes in precipitation patterns. The Paris Agreement states that the global temperature increase should be kept well below two degrees and that efforts should be made to limit it to 1.5 degrees. All countries of the world are committed to implementing measures that contribute to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. The commitments thus far are estimated to lead to a 3.2 degree warming. The world therefore needs to do more to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.

The UN's climate panel IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) points out in their special report from 2018 large differences in the consequences of a 1.5 degree global warming compared to a 2 degree global warming. To illustrate, hundreds of millions fewer people would be exposed to climate impacts and increased poverty, heat waves and water scarcity, while fewer habitats for animals and plant species would shrink or disappear. If the world is to be successful in limiting the climate impact to 1.5 degrees warming, global emissions will have to be reduced by 7.6 percent between the years 2020 and 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050. Success will require fast and far-reaching

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030
changes in society. We need to carry out system transitions that have never before been conducted on such a large scale, that would significantly reduce emissions in all sectors, and we would also need a wide portfolio of measures and a significant increase in investments. Global emissions have increased 11 percent in the last ten years.

Gothenburg should be above the global reduction rate to meet the Paris Agreement and aim to reduce its climate footprint to zero as quickly as possible.

Climate impact from consumption needs to be reduced by at least 7.6 percent annually which is equivalent to a 64 percent reduction between 2017 and 2030. To be in line with the regional target of Climate 2030 – Västra Götaland in transition, emissions in the geographical area of Gothenburg must be reduced by at least 10.3 percent per year, which is equivalent to an 80 percent reduction between 1990 and 2030.

The term climate footprint in the goal includes both the geographic as well as the consumption-based perspective on emissions. It therefore includes emissions occurring in the geographic area of Gothenburg as well as consumption-based emissions. The consumption-based emissions include emissions from products and services that have occurred in earlier stages before being consumed, no matter where in the world these emissions occur, see figure 4.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Figure 4 The image illustrates different perspectives on Gothenburg's climate footprint. The geographic perspective shows emissions caused by production within the geographic area of Gothenburg, no matter where in the world the goods and services are consumed. The consumption-based perspective shows emissions caused by goods and services consumed by the people of Gothenburg, no matter where in the world they are produced. The perspectives are overlapping each other and provide different ways of looking at partly the same emissions.

The City of Gothenburg will act as a good example of how to achieve these goals, and we will set more ambitious goals in areas where we have higher degrees of control. We will at the same time ensure that our measures not only reduce emissions locally, but that they also reduce emissions in Sweden, Europe and the world. This will present both challenges and possibilities as Gothenburg has a large industrial sector while also serving as a Swedish logistics hub. Measures that are scalable and useful in other municipalities will be prioritized.

Even though the focus will be on reducing emissions, the City of Gothenburg still needs to work towards facilitating and deploying carbon capture technologies. They are important to reach negative emissions in the future.

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021–2030
(52)
The City of Gothenburg is an important driving force in the climate transition of Gothenburg, above all by virtue of the city's control over a large number of policy instruments that can create the conditions for the transition, but also by virtue of being a large organisation with significant opportunities of its own to reduce emissions.

The City of Gothenburg can work toward that future because we

plan the urban development and traffic infrastructure of Gothenburg.
purchase large quantities of goods and services and are able to make tough demands in procurement.
are responsible for a significant part of the energy production and the energy infrastructure.
can affect the energy use of our facilities and residential buildings.
can reduce the climate impact during construction of facilities and residential buildings.
can reduce the climate impact of our processes in areas such as water and wastewater treatment.
can affect energy use and climate impact through supervision, advice, education and information campaigns.
through education and guidance drive for and make the changes possible for more sustainable lifestyles and consumption patterns.
can cooperate with businesses in the city on their important role in the transition.

The environmental goal is followed up with the help of the following indicators as well as the sub-goal's indicators:

|  Indicators | Current situation | Target value 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Emissions of greenhouse gases per inhabitant and year within the geographical area of Gothenburg (includes emissions from both traded and non-traded sectors) | 4.2 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per inhabitant and year (2018) | 1.1 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per inhabitant and year  |
|  Consumption-based greenhouse gas emissions per inhabitant in Sweden | 8.9 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per inhabitant and year (2017) | 3.3 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per inhabitant and year  |

## Sub-goals for the climate

### 1. The City of Gothenburg reduces energy use in residential buildings and facilities

Improving efficiency in our energy use is a prerequisite for an energy system without a negative environmental and climate impact. A reduced energy use makes it easier to transition energy production from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. A reduced electricity consumption in the specified sectors, which may also lead to a reduction in power output, would facilitate the ongoing electrification of the industrial and transport sectors.

The sub-goal is to reduce the primary energy consumption by at least 30 percent per inhabitant by 2030 compared to 2010. The sub-goal covers the energy consumption in residential buildings, facilities, public services and businesses, not including industry, agriculture and transport. The primary energy consumption per capita was reduced by about 10 percent between 2010 and 2018.

It is important that we in the City of Gothenburg do everything we can in order to set a good example and show the way. To reach the goal the city needs to prioritize improving energy efficiency in our existing residential buildings and facilities, while constructing new buildings with a high energy performance. To encourage businesses and individuals to reduce their energy consumption, we need to use and develop our advisory capacity, supervision and collaboration with trade, industry and academia, for example through the Gothenburg Climate Partnership.

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021–2030
(52)
|  Indicators | Current situation | Target value 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Primary energy consumption per inhabitant within the municipality | 18 MWh per inhabitant (2010)
MWh per inhabitant (2018) | 12 MWh per inhabitant  |
|  Average primary energy consumption per square meter in the City of Gothenburg's facilities and residential buildings where the operation can be related to surface area | Facilities: 182 kWh/m² (2009)
kWh/m² (2019)
Residential buildings: 123 kWh/m² (2009)
kWh/m² (2019) | Facilities: 133 kWh/m²
Residential buildings: 88 kWh/m²  |

## 2. The City of Gothenburg produces energy solely from renewable sources

Gothenburg is in a good position to develop an energy system with minimal climate impact. With a well-developed district heating network and the City of Gothenburg as a producer of district heat, district cooling and electricity, the city has considerable control over the necessary transition of the energy system from fossil fuels to renewables.

The City of Gothenburg, through Göteborg Energi AB, owns several heating and power plants that produce both heat and electricity by partly using fossil fuels. The fossil fuel-fired generation plants must be decommissioned or converted to use renewable fuels by 2025 in order to reach the goal. A challenge with such a transition is the economic investments necessary and that it needs to be done in a relatively short time. The city needs at the same time to work with the sub-goal *The City of Gothenburg reduces energy use in residential buildings and facilities* to facilitate the transition to a more sustainable energy system.

|  Indicators | Current situation | Target value 2025  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  The proportion of electricity and district heating produced by renewable fuels in the production facilities of Göteborg Energi AB | Electricity: 1.6 percent (2010)
percent (2018)
District heating: 35 percent (2010)
percent (2018) | Electricity: 100 percent
District heating: 100 percent  |

## 3. The City of Gothenburg reduces the climate impact from transportation

Road traffic is the second largest source of geographical greenhouse gas emissions in Gothenburg, after the refineries. Gothenburg as a large city has greater possibilities to increase walking, cycling and public transport, as well as more efficient freight transport, than Sweden as a whole. The sub-goal regarding transport emissions is therefore set higher than the corresponding national goal. The sub-goal means that the climate impact from transportation will reduce by at least 90 percent by 2030 compared to 2010, and that

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021–2030
(52)
the volume of motorized traffic will be reduced by 25 percent by 2030 compared to 2020. The greenhouse gas emissions from transportation in Gothenburg has decreased by 5.4 percent between 2010 and 2017.

Reaching the sub-target will require a shift from car travel to walking, cycling and public transportation, and freight transport from road to rail and waterborne transport. Furthermore, the use of fossil fuels needs to stop and be replaced by different renewable fuels and electric vehicles. Renewable fuels will not be sufficient for the same volume of road traffic as today, nor will they be sufficient for shipping, aviation, work machinery and other sectors. That is why the volume of traffic needs to be reduced.

|  Indicators | Current situation | Target value 2023 | Target value 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation in Gothenburg | 999,900 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per year (2010)
,600 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per year (2017) | - | At least 90 percent less compared to 2010  |
|  Volume of traffic, i.e. the number of kilometers driven by all types of motorized road vehicles per weekday, in Gothenburg | Requires development | - | 25 percent less compared to 2020  |
|  Proportion of the City of Gothenburg’s vehicles that are fossil-free | 55 percent (2019) | 100 percent | -  |

# 4. The City of Gothenburg reduces the climate impact from purchases

The City of Gothenburg is one of Sweden's largest buyers with purchases of around SEK 25 billion annually. At the same time, the city's services produce around 500 million tons of waste annually. Construction accounts for almost half of the purchasing volume. The sub-goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the city's purchases from a life cycle perspective by around 30 percent for food and by at least 90 percent for other purchases and for buildings and facilities.

To achieve this sub-goal, the city's purchasing, procurement, use and disposal of goods and services needs to be assessed, systematised and made more efficient. The challenge to reach the goal lies mainly in the number of small and large decisions that need to be taken within the City of Gothenburg as well as the need for coordination and common routines for prioritizing the city's purchases.

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021–2030
(52)
|  Indicators | Current situation | Target value 2025 | Target value 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Greenhouse gas emissions from purchased inventories, products, materials and services from a life cycle perspective (Does not apply to purchases covered by other indicators of the sub-goal) | Requires development | - | At least 90 percent less compared to 2020  |
|  Greenhouse gas emissions from new and renovated buildings under own management and from new development on land with land allocations | Requires development | At least 50 percent less compared to 2020 | At least 90 percent less compared to 2020  |
|  Greenhouse gas emissions from facilities under own management and from new development on land with land allocations | Requires development | At least 50 percent less compared to 2020 | At least 90 percent less compared to 2020  |

## Environmental goal: The people of Gothenburg have a healthy living environment

The goal is to promote the health and well-being of the people of Gothenburg by improving air quality and the sound environment, as well as reducing the use of harmful substances. Gothenburg should be a green and resilient city where ecosystem services are used to serve people’s needs both now and in the future.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

## An environment for health and well-being

The physical living environment the people of Gothenburg are living and working in has considerable importance for health and well-being. The environmental goal and the sub-goals are about strengthening the environmental health factors that affect people positively and reducing the effect of factors that have a negative impact. By creating healthy living environments, the city gives the people of Gothenburg the conditions for a good quality of life.

Exposure to harmful substances, air pollution and environments with high levels of noise can cause people health problems. Children are especially vulnerable, which is why their living environments are prioritized. Taking the youngest residents into consideration will have positive effects for everyone in Gothenburg.

Road traffic in Gothenburg is the single largest contributor to high levels of air pollution and high noise levels where people live. Road traffic needs to be reduced and walking, cycling and public transportation need to be prioritized in the planning and management of the city to create a healthy living environment for the people of Gothenburg.

The City of Gothenburg will create a green and resilient city by using, preserving and developing the benefits of nature, which is known as ecosystem services. With the help of water and green spaces, we can both offset the effects of climate change and provide the

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021–2030
(52)
people of Gothenburg access to healthier environments. The City of Gothenburg can work toward that future because we

plan the urban development of Gothenburg.
plan and manage Gothenburg's transport infrastructure.
own and manage more than half of Gothenburg's land.
purchase large quantities of goods and services and are thus able to make demands in procurement.
provide supervision, advice, education and information campaigns.

The environmental goal is followed up with the help of the following indicators as well as the sub-goal's indicators:

|  Indicators | Current situation | Target value 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Volume of traffic, i.e. the number of kilometers driven by all types of motorized road vehicles per weekday, in Gothenburg | Requires development | 25 percent less compared to 2020  |
|  Proportion of green and blue spaces in coherent urban development (or equivalent designation in future comprehensive plans) | 55 percent (2018) | Has not decreased compared to current situation  |
|  Access to “urban cold islands” | Requires development | Annual increase  |
|  Percentage of detailed plans on municipal land where green space factors are set in the consultation (percent/year) | 3 percent (2019) | 100 percent  |

# Sub-goals for people

## 1. The City of Gothenburg reduces the use of harmful substances

Reducing the use of substances that are designated as particularly harmful by the Swedish Chemicals Agency lessens the risk of people developing health problems such as endocrine disruptions, cancer and allergies. It would also benefit animal and plant habitats where these substances might otherwise have ended up after use. Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of chemical substances as they are exposed more than adults in relation to their body weight.

The sub-goal is for the city's administrations and companies to phase out and by 2030 stop using phase-out substances, and to halve the use of priority risk reduction substances. This applies to substances in chemical products and goods that are used directly by the city's services, as well as through the services and contracts that are procured.

The work to reduce the use of harmful substances is moving forward. Administrations and companies are working on replacing products that contain phase-out substances. The city sets requirements for chemical content in procurements and the requirements are continuously tightened. We need to develop our work continuously, as both new chemical substances and new knowledge about their effects on human health and the environment are constantly emerging.

A prerequisite to reach the goal, besides having to increase the pace, is that both managers and co-workers receive relevant education in relation to their responsibility and roles. This involves both knowing what the law requires and having sufficient knowledge to be able to make good decisions when purchasing and procuring chemical products and goods, as well as in services and contract work.

|  Indicators | Current situation 2020 | Target value 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Number of chemical products containing phase-out substances used in the city's services | 154 unique products | Close to zero  |
|  Number of chemical products containing priority risk reduction substances used in the city's services | 711 unique products | Reduction by 50 percent  |
|  Percentage of construction materials and products in the city's logbooks in “Byggvarubedömningen” that have the overall assessment recommended or accepted | Requires development | Annual increase  |

## 2. The City of Gothenburg ensures good air quality for the people of Gothenburg

Road traffic in Gothenburg is the single largest contributor to high levels of air pollution where people live and socialize. Air pollution increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases and cancer. Children, especially younger children, are particularly

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021–2030
(52)
vulnerable to air pollution. Children also spend time outdoors often during times when the levels of air pollution are the highest, during mornings and late afternoons. The sub-goal is for the City of Gothenburg to ensure that the air quality around pre-school playgrounds and residential houses meets the national environmental goal for fresh air with respect to nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter (PM₁₀). There is a correlation between poor health and air pollution even at moderate levels, but a safe threshold where no adverse health effects occur has not been identified.

The challenges to ensure good air quality are mainly connected to reducing the effect from traffic. Reaching the sub-goal requires a shift from car travel to walking, cycling and public transport. The transition to an electrified vehicle fleet likewise contributes to reaching the goal, mainly in terms of nitrogen dioxide concentrations.

|  Indicators | Current situation | Target value 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Proportion of pre-school playgrounds and residential houses with a nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) concentration of less than 20 micrograms per cubic meter | Pre-school playgrounds: 85 percent (2015)
Residential houses: 73 percent (2015) | 100 percent  |
|  Proportion of pre-school playgrounds and residential houses with a particulate matter (PM₁₀) concentration of less than 15 micrograms per cubic meter | Requires development | Annual increase  |
|  Proportion of area in coherent urban development (or equivalent designation in future comprehensive plans) with a nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) concentration of less than 20 micrograms per cubic meter | 70 percent (2015) | Annual increase  |
|  Proportion of area in coherent urban development (or equivalent designation in future comprehensive plans) with a particulate matter (PM₁₀) concentration of less than 15 micrograms per cubic meter | Requires development | Annual increase  |

# 3. The City of Gothenburg ensures a good sound environment for the people of Gothenburg

Environmental noise is the element in our environment that affects most people in Gothenburg, with traffic noise being the biggest source of noise. By ensuring that the city's homes, pre-school playgrounds and green spaces have a good sound environment reduces the risk of, among other things, cardiovascular diseases and sleep disorders.

Children, especially younger children, spend a large part of their childhood in the local neighborhood and in pre-school. Good sound environments are important for children's development and learning as well as their health and safety.

The sub-goal is for the City of Gothenburg to ensure that all pre-school playgrounds have an equivalent noise level in accordance with the guideline values set by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. The sub-goal is also about the City of Gothenburg ensuring that the residential buildings that are most exposed to noise have an equivalent noise level below 50 dBA on at least one side, in cases where the apartment has rooms in different directions, as well as ensuring that there is access to green spaces with an equivalent noise level below 50 dBA.

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030
The challenges for the City of Gothenburg are to improve environments that are currently noisy, create new good sound environments and to protect environments that are currently relatively free from noise. Reaching the sub-goal requires a shift from car travel to walking, cycling and public transport. The city needs to focus its efforts both on measures at the source, and to take into account people's exposure to noise during urban planning.

|  Indicators | Current situation | Target value 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Proportion of new pre-school playgrounds with an equivalent noise level below 50 dBA | 80 percent (2020) | 100 percent  |
|  Proportion of older pre-school playgrounds with an equivalent noise level below 55 dBA | 75 percent (2020) | 100 percent  |
|  Proportion of residential buildings with a noise-exposed residential façade exceeding 60 dBA equivalent noise level that have access to a quieter side below 50 dBA equivalent noise level | 60 percent (2020) | Annual increase  |
|  Proportion of inhabitants with access to green spaces larger than 0.2 hectares and within 300 meters, with an equivalent noise level below 50 dBA | 75 percent (2018) | Annual increase  |

# 4. The City of Gothenburg ensures access to green spaces and uses ecosystem services

The benefits provided by nature's ecosystems, so-called ecosystem services, are an important asset for the city. Access to cultural heritage, inspiration, cultivation, meeting places, experiences in nature and recreation have far-reaching positive effects on public health and quality of life. Green spaces provide other benefits such as managing precipitation, equalizing temperatures, reducing noise and cleaning the air. The sub-goal is for the City of Gothenburg to ensure access to green spaces in both residential area surroundings as well as parks and pre-school playgrounds. This will improve the physical and psychological well-being of people. Green spaces in the city will have an even greater importance with increasing climate change, both for the well-being of people as well as the city's resilience to extreme weather.

Reaching the sub-goal requires the City of Gothenburg to improve the use, preservation and development of ecosystem services in planning, construction and management. The City of Gothenburg also needs to prioritize people's access to green spaces. The challenge lies in prioritizing access to high quality green spaces while expanding and densifying the city. To do this the City of Gothenburg needs to calculate all societal costs connected with people's health and well-being in an early planning stage, and include the benefits provided by ecosystem services to ensure maximum benefits to society.

|  Indicators | Current situation | Target value 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Proportion of pre-school playgrounds with a green space factor above 0.45 | 21 percent (2015) | Annual increase  |
|  Proportion of inhabitants with access to green spaces larger than 0.2 hectares and within 300 meters | 93 percent (2018) | 100 percent  |

# Cross-cutting strategies

In order to both succeed in the transition to an environmentally sustainable city and accelerate the pace of the implementation, it is crucial that the City of Gothenburg makes a concerted effort. The overarching challenge to reach the goal of the programme is to implement measures that require cross-cutting cooperation. That is why the Environment and Climate Programme contains seven cross-cutting strategies, each of which contributes in different ways to achieving all the environmental goals:

We act as forerunners
We create conditions for sustainable living
We drive the development of circular economy
We work strategically on financing to accelerate the transition
We drive the development of sustainable construction
We plan for a green and resilient city
We drive the development of sustainable transportation

The strategies provide a platform to drive and coordinate work on actions that require a high degree of collaboration and should have the capacity to drive implementation to fruition. The aim of the strategies is to achieve a change-driven development work to accelerate the transition. Through the work on the strategies, the city will be in a continuous learning process to increase the pace of implementation and achieve the goals of the Environment and Climate Programme.

Working with the strategies will add value to ongoing missions and bring together responsibility and drive development in areas where responsibility is currently dispersed. The strategies will also develop new solutions and working methods within and around the city.

The strategies will be linked to groups of directors with the aim of bringing them proposals for solutions that require joint decisions. The groups of directors will mostly consist of groups that already exist in the city, but they may also be formed on the basis of a specific strategy if necessary.

The strategies are party overlapping, which will be dealt with in the framework of the coordination of all strategies under the responsibility of the Environmental Administration.

## General starting points

For all strategies, innovation, digitalization, communication and collaboration are key to enable success. The City of Gothenburg’s governing documents for these areas are important starting points. Coordination with these documents, as well as other relevant plans and programmes in the city, is essential to develop synergies and to integrate environment and climate policy into relevant policy areas, which in turn is necessary to achieve the goals.

## Capacity for implementation

Many issues can be handled in the line organization, but many issues require cooperation, especially in an area like environment and climate. One challenge in cross-cutting cooperation is to build capacity for the implementation – that arenas for cooperation have the mandates and conditions needed to drive cooperation to fruition.

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021–2030
(52)
The capacity for implementation can be sorted and described in many different ways, but the following is crucial:

Driving and responsible actors who are expected to participate in the work with the strategies are identified in the programme by designating coordinators and key actors in relation to each strategy. This provides guidance and conditions for co-creation, which is also made clear in the mission statement for the coordinators, see appendix 2.

Politically decided missions and support from managers and leadership provides a foundation and room for action for the services to work with the cross-cutting issues. This programme provides a politically decided mission and mission statement for coordinators, which together with the work on environmental management systems provides a basis for managers and management to support the work.

To create a cross-cutting cooperation requires trust between participating actors and shared challenges. The strategies represent a challenge-driven work method.

To work in a challenge-driven manner means repeatedly testing different approaches and solutions together for the shared challenges.

There are no obvious ways to handle conflicts and deadlocks in a cross-cutting cooperation. Different types of conflicts will emerge repeatedly, and it is crucial to a successful cooperation to manage those before they become an obstacle to the implementation. The strategies are expected to have the capacity to manage conflicts, both through the mandate given to the coordinator in the mission statement, and by the ability to forward proposed solutions to an appointed group of directors.

New working methods and new types of measures require a certain amount of risk-taking. A stage for cooperation needs to be able to allocate responsibility and risk between the actors involved. The strategies are expected to have the capacity to distribute responsibility and risk, both through the mandate given to the coordinator and by the possibility of referring the issue to the appointed group of directors.

The work in the strategies is based on the missions that exist in the city today, as well as the resources and expertise available in the organization. The first challenge is to create added value linked to the goals of the Environment and Climate Programme based on the available resources. The missions and resources that are missing today are expected to be identified through the work in the strategies. Participants in the strategies will both propose solutions and act to meet the identified requirements.

The committees and boards most closely associated with the issue are expected to be involved in the work on the strategies. Each strategy should also communicate with other interested parties, some of whom may become important players over time, and others who need the information to carry out their missions in the best possible way. Communication can be carried out on a per-strategy basis or by the coordination of the Environmental Administration.

# Coordinator and important actors

Each strategy has an appointed coordinating board or committee. The responsibility is to drive and coordinate the strategy by the overarching coordination of the Environmental Administration. Working methods for strategies and the mission statement for coordinators can be found in appendix 1. In summary, this means working to ensure high capacity for cross-cutting cooperation with a focus on delivering impact and contributing

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030
(52)
to the goals and sub-goals of the programme. The different strategies will be driven by the same basic mission, but with variations based on the different conditions present in each strategy. Some strategies will be coordinated with other strategies and missions in the city.

Certain strategies will need to be started from the ground up, while others build on extensive ongoing work that needs to be coordinated to strengthen the environmental and climate perspective. It also means that the strategies will have different types of groups of directors or counterparts to report to.

Each strategy will have examples of committees and boards that are deemed to be important actors for the implementation. There could also be additional committees and boards that will be involved in the work on the strategies. It is the coordinator’s task to involve these in the best possible way. Being chosen as a key player in a strategy means actively participating over time in the joint work on the strategies, in accordance with the appointed mission and on the job description and mission statement for the strategies in appendix 1.

External players from trade and industry, civil society and academia can and should be invited to participate in the strategies as needed.

# Process follow-up as a tool

In addition to the follow-up of environmental goals and sub-goals, ongoing process follow-up is carried out with a focus on the maintenance and development of capacity in each strategy.

The process follow-up is done within the framework of the Environmental- and Climate Committee’s mission to follow-up on the programme. Results and reflections from the process follow-up will regularly be reported back to the coordinators. This facilitates continuous learning and becomes an integral part of the work.

Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030
(52)
# Strategy: We act as forerunners

The City of Gothenburg will drive the transition to an environmentally sustainable society and be one of the most progressive cities in the world when it comes to preventing and addressing environmental and climate problems. That is why we will begin the transition with ourselves, partly because we are a large organization with considerable environmental impact, and partly to be able to inspire and influence others in a credible way.

In this area, city representatives need to show leadership and drive advocacy work nationally and at an EU level. By having the proper expertise, collaborating with academia, trade and industry and civil society organizations, and by producing good examples and results, we will also influence decision-makers nationally and at EU level so that policy instruments are tightened and legislation is changed.

## The strategy involves, for example

The City of Gothenburg driving cooperation with other cities and relevant actors in an active advocacy work toward decision-makers on a national and EU level, with the aim to develop suitable policy instruments and legislation to accelerate the transition to an environmentally sustainable society.
The City of Gothenburg's services developing skills to meet the challenges of the transition by training staff and attracting skilled workers. Crucial to this transition is a brave leadership.
The City of Gothenburg, in collaboration with academia, civil society organizations, trade and industry and other municipalities, taking the lead in strategically important areas and using the city's investment in test beds to drive the transition.
The City of Gothenburg communicating, in a clear and structured way, good examples of what we are doing in the environmental field to inspire both internally and externally. The city's services should also act as role models in their daily contact with citizens, businesses and other actors.

# Strategy: We create conditions for sustainable living

It should be easy for everyone to make environmentally sound choices in the sustainable city. The City of Gothenburg, with the help of its committees and boards, will create the conditions for those who visit, live and work in Gothenburg to live sustainably. The City of Gothenburg will use all its available tools and policy instruments to create the conditions for a sustainable lifestyle.

In other words, the city will make the sustainable choice the standard.

## The strategy involves, for example

The City of Gothenburg planning Gothenburg in a manner that facilitates a sustainable lifestyle.
The City of Gothenburg’s services and events always being environmentally and climate friendly.
The City of Gothenburg contributing useful tools, communicating with and giving advice to the people of Gothenburg and civil society organizations on what they can do to contribute to the transition to a sustainable society.
The City of Gothenburg facilitating the development of the sharing economy for the people of Gothenburg.
The City of Gothenburg listening to ideas and inviting civil society organizations to co-create solutions for a sustainable Gothenburg.

# Strategy: We drive the development of circular economy

To reduce unsustainable resource use, greenhouse gas emissions and the spread of toxic substances, the patterns of how and what is produced and consumed need to change. The circular economy has a great potential to contribute to sustainable consumption and production from a system perspective. Toxic-free cycles are a prerequisite for a circular economy in order to stop both the release of harmful substances and to detoxify the cycle. The city's own consumption of goods and materials needs to be reduced, made more efficient and based on circular principles instead of the current linear ones. This applies to all flows including food, inventory, electronics, construction materials and demolition waste. This strategy is therefore based on the city's own services.

Using resource-efficient, non-toxic, innovative purchases and procurements, an increased recycling and an increased sharing of products would not only reduce resource use and environmental and climate impact, but it would also reduce the costs for the city.

## The strategy involves, for example

The City of Gothenburg, in cooperation with trade, industry and academia, developing models for the circular economy.
The City of Gothenburg demanding new climate-smart business models and resource-efficient and non-toxic products in procurement and innovation procurement.
The City of Gothenburg using recycled products and creating the conditions for various products to be made available to others in a resource-efficient way.
The City of Gothenburg making it easier to find products and services with minimal environmental impact in the central purchasing system, and replacing environmentally harmful items in particular.
The City of Gothenburg leading the way in waste prevention.

# Strategy: We work strategically on financing to accelerate the transition

In order to accelerate the transition to meet the goals, the city needs to regroup and rethink its approach to financing, which includes both investment and operations. The city faces major challenges such as the implementation of fossil-free energy supply and sustainable mobility. Analysis and development of different financial options is required to implement the major system changes society is currently facing.

Both national and EU funding should be actively sought and used to contribute to innovation and enable the introduction of new solutions. This is where the EU's Green Deal initiative provides funding opportunities.

Sustainability-driven investing is a responsible, long-term choice for ownership, and they are investments that contribute to an environmentally and socially sustainable transition without sacrificing returns. It is important that the city does not make investments that lock us into solutions that lead to environmental degradation, such as increased greenhouse gas emissions, increased exposure to harmful substances and negative impacts on biodiversity.

## The strategy involves, for example

The City of Gothenburg having knowledge about the associated costs with the transition during decision-making from a municipal finance perspective and from a socio-economic perspective.
The City of Gothenburg thinking innovatively and seeking different types of financing solutions, such as green bonds to manage the transition.
The City of Gothenburg analysing which investment priorities will help us achieve the goals of the Environment and Climate Programme.

# Strategy: We drive the development of sustainable construction

All construction in Gothenburg will focus on people’s need for quality of life, good health and resource management. The strategy includes new construction, reconstruction and renovation of buildings and facilities, and adaptation of existing premises. The city is expected to set higher standards for methods with less environmental impact, to contribute to the development of methods and to contribute to the formulation of relevant functional requirements.

## The strategy involves, for example

Improving the City of Gothenburg's overall governance of sustainable construction, in the construction phase, use phase and final phase, in terms of resource management and environmental and health impacts.
The City of Gothenburg cooperating with trade and industry to test and develop new methods and materials for sustainable construction.
The City of Gothenburg using innovative procurements to drive the development forward of a circular, non-toxic and resource-efficient construction.
The City of Gothenburg setting functional requirements for reduced environmental and health impacts in the construction of infrastructure, public spaces such as squares, parks, sports facilities, playgrounds and buildings.

# Strategy: We plan for a green and resilient city

The City of Gothenburg considers green infrastructure as a structural and natural part of urban planning, both in the strategic and early planning stages. Green infrastructure is essential for plants and animals to spread themselves between their habitats. This means that in planning and management, we will utilize, develop, integrate and increase the share of urban greenery, blue structures and ecosystem services.

The core of the strategy is to integrate the value of ecosystem services into all economic and policy decisions.

To build a resilient city means that urban planning ensures that society is prepared for the effects of climate change. Green infrastructure will be developed as a part of the climate change adaptation efforts and to address the undesirable effects of climate change.

## The strategy involves, for example

The City of Gothenburg is driving efforts to integrate the social costs and benefits of ecosystem services during the planning and implementation phase, and in management/operation so that target conflicts and sub-optimization can be managed.
The City of Gothenburg is preparing for climate change and extreme weather with shifting temperatures, higher flows and torrential rainfall as well as rising sea levels. The city's resilience and ability to cope with climate change will be developed so that Gothenburg is in a strong position for the future.
The City of Gothenburg actively uses green and blue structures and other measures to create a good microclimate in the developed parts of the city and to reduce the effect and avoid the development of "urban heat islands".

# Strategy: We drive the development of sustainable transportation

In order to achieve a modern transportation system with a small impact on health and the environment, work with sustainable transportation and sustainable availability will be essential. Spatial planning will prioritize proximity, density and a mix of functionality. Reaching this goal requires a holistic approach that requires close collaboration between different actors in Gothenburg.

Many strong measures are needed both in urban planning and in the existing city. We need to reduce the need for transportation and work with more measures for a transportation system that is more efficient and sustainable. The transport sector faces major challenges, particularly in regards to reducing climate impact, providing clean air and a good sound environment, and ensuring efficient land use.

The Port of Gothenburg is Scandinavia's largest port and a central node in Sweden's transport system. This provides the opportunity for the City of Gothenburg to act as a forerunner and become a hub for climate change transformation of the transport system for Northern Europe.

## The strategy involves, for example

The City of Gothenburg developing a more efficient mobility by prioritizing walking, cycling and public transportation in traffic management and in prioritizing the use of street and road space. As major reconstructions will affect the city during the programme period, sustainable mobility will also be a priority for temporary traffic solutions.
The City of Gothenburg prioritizing walking and cycling, which means that the city needs to promote soft factors and create attractive urban spaces and pedestrian routes where people want to be, spend time and move through. It includes managing and maintaining the urban environment to preserve its beauty. To succeed in reducing traffic congestion, we need to ensure that the local environment satisfies many of the needs of residents.
The City of Gothenburg working toward an electrified transportation system, fossil-free fuels and a charging infrastructure for the city's own vehicles, as well as creating conditions for the development of the Gothenburg community, in collaboration with the business community and other regional actors.
The City of Gothenburg developing and continuously using different types of policy instruments such as congestion tax, pricing and regulation of parking, low-emission zones and car-free zones in the city center, and behavioral interventions.
The City of Gothenburg using our opportunities through urban planning and ownership of the largest port in the Nordic region to allocate land for multimodal logistics terminals, transshipment centers and freight tracks.

# Glossary

Biodiversity
Biodiversity is the diversity of living organisms and the ecosystems they are a part of. It includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems.

Biotope
A biotope is a small area of land or water with specific characteristics that favor certain species or groups of species.

Overflow
Overflow is the direct release of wastewater into a ditch, lake or other body of water without first being treated in a sewage treatment plant.

Byggvarubedömningen
Byggvarubedömningen is a documentation and assessment system with criteria for construction products/materials and chemical products used in the construction industry. All city services have access to the system.

Chemsoft
Chemsoft is a chemical management system for the assessment, documentation and follow-up of chemical products. All city services have access to the system.

Ecosystem services
Ecosystem services are the benefits, products and services that nature provides us humans with that affect our well-being. Some examples of this include greenery that delays and purifies surface water, improves local climate and air quality, reduces noise, provides pollination and experiences in nature.

Equivalent noise level
Equivalent noise level is used to describe exposure to noise during a longer time period, for example the average value in a 24-hour period for a year.

Green infrastructure
An ecologically functional network of habitats and structures, natural areas and landscaped features that are designed, managed and operated to conserve biodiversity and to promote ecosystem services important to society across the landscape. This includes both land and water.

Green space factor (GSF)
Green space factor (GSF) is a measure of how many ecosystem services an area provides, i.e. how well green and blue spaces can, for example, improve local climate and provide recreational opportunities.

Climate change adaptation
Climate change adaptation means implementing measures in all sectors of society to adapt to the climate changes we are already experiencing today and to those that we cannot prevent in the future.

Climate footprint
The term climate footprint includes both the geographic as well as the consumption-based perspective on emissions. It therefore includes emissions occurring in the geographic area of Gothenburg as well as consumption-based emissions. The consumption-based emissions include emissions from products and services that have occurred in earlier stages before being consumed, no matter where in the world these emissions occur.

Carbon capture
Carbon capture is an umbrella term for different ways of capturing carbon dioxide from the air.

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
Nitrogen oxides are formed during combustion and have negative effects on both human health and the environment. Vehicular traffic is the main contributor, but energy production, machinery and shipping are also significant contributors of nitrogen oxides. Road traffic emissions of nitrogen oxides consist mainly of nitrogen monoxide (about 80 percent), but the substance is quickly converted into nitrogen dioxide when it reacts with oxygen in the air.

Environmental health factor
Environmental health factors are physical, chemical and biological environmental factors as well as all related factors that affect human health. These can be negative, such as air pollution, or positive, such as parks and other recreational environments.

Multimodal logistics terminal
A physical location for the transfer of goods and commodities. Multimodal means transports using more than one type of transportation method in the chain from sender to recipient.

Natura 2000
A network of protected areas within EU that contain species or natural habitats of particular conservation interest from a European perspective.

Natural value
A natural value represents the importance for biodiversity. The value may reflect the presence of species and/or biotopes, an abundance of variation between them, special ecological processes, or an important part of the green infrastructure and/or as a dispersal route for species.
Environment and Climate Programme for the City of Gothenburg 2021–2030
(52)

Negative emissions
Negative emissions occur when the amount of carbon dioxide captured and stored from the air is greater than the amount of fossil carbon dioxide released. This would enable a reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

The Paris Agreement
The Paris Agreement is a global climate agreement that was established primarily to limit the global temperature increase and to support those who are affected by the impacts of climate change. The Paris Agreement states that the global temperature increase should be kept well below two degrees and that efforts should be made to limit it to 1.5 degrees. All countries of the world are committed to implementing measures that contribute to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Particulate matter (PM10)
PM10 are inhalable particles with a diameter of less than 10 micrometers. PM10 is generated mainly from the wear and tear between road traffic and the road surface. The smaller fraction of PM10 are particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2,5). PM2,5 is generated during combustion and is in Gothenburg primarily originating from car exhausts and from polluted air from other countries.

Primary energy
Primary energy refers to the entire energy chain, from extraction to use, not just end use. To calculate the primary energy use, the energy use is weighted by a certain factor, depending on the energy type. For example, fossil fuels are weighted higher than renewables. The programme uses the weighting factors in Boverket’s (the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning) building regulations, BBR.

Priority risk reduction substances
Priority risk reduction substances are substances designated by the Swedish Chemicals Agency to be used with caution due to their hazardous properties, such as their toxicity.

Reach
Reach is an EU regulation that includes rules on the registration, evaluation, authorization and restrictions of chemical substances in chemical products and goods. The regulation also contains rules for the production, import, sale and use of these substances.

Resilience
Resilience is a system’s long-term ability, be it a forest, city or an economy, to manage change and continue developing.
Urban cold islands

Urban cold islands are the opposite of urban heat islands, a phenomenon that occurs in cities mainly due to the presence of heat-absorbing materials, such as concrete and asphalt. Greenery is recognized to be the most effective measure to lower the urban temperature and having access to “urban cold islands” in cities also reduces the risk of health problems during heat waves.

Phase-out substances

Phase-out substances are substances designated by the Swedish Chemicals Agency as having particularly harmful properties, such as being carcinogenic.

Well-maintained

Well-maintained means that a pasture is grazed with a sufficient number of grazing animals, or that a mowed meadow is mowed (mechanically or with a scythe), to ensure the grass cover is short and to prevent vegetation overgrowth.

# 1 Introduction

This opening section explains the city's motivation to join the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" and highlights the city's present commitments to climate action.

## Introduction

Gothenburg is dedicated to taking a lead in the climate transition of cities. The City's vision, "sustainable city - open to the world", reflects this mission. Gothenburg is already a leader in green industrial transition. The city is a hub for advanced industry, cutting-edge knowledge, innovation and logistics in terms of new emerging industries, large infrastructural transformations and intensified efforts in finding solutions to sustainability challenges such as those related to climate change.

The climate transition in the City of Gothenburg is about creating a city that is attractive to, and supportive of, its current and future citizens. This includes the creation of more liveable and attractive neighbourhoods, but also more jobs and efficient public transportation. To achieve these and other ambitions the climate transition of Gothenburg is about tackling multiple challenges simultaneously, using the power of societal transformation to also address issues of inequality and strengthening citizen's equal opportunities to improved life, health and participation in society.

Central to the City's climate ambition is the Environment and Climate Program for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030¹ adopted by the City Council in 2021. The program is the main governing document for the environmental dimension of sustainable development, and includes goals on biodiversity, climate and healthy living environments. The City's climate goal is clearly quantified in the program: By 2030, Gothenburg's climate footprint is to be close to zero. To achieve this Gothenburg's climate footprint must be reduced annually with the aim of reaching a zero-climate footprint as soon as possible.

To strengthen the City's efforts in reaching the climate goal, and to both support and learn from other cities with the same ambition, the City applied for and was accepted as one of the cities in the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030". The City was also one of the first cities in Sweden to join the national Viable Cities platform with the same ambition. Through both these platforms the City expands its toolbox for building a stronger mandate, mobilising more actors and co-creating portfolios of action.

Other platforms are also crucial for the City's climate ambitions. Through its science parks the City provides opportunities for, and is active in, experimentation and innovation to test, develop and scale up climate neutral and smart solutions. The City is also an active member in several international, national and regional networks focusing on climate mitigation. In close collaboration with the two universities in Gothenburg, and also other universities and institutes, the City is a partner in a number of research and development projects, including being a lead partner in EU projects focusing on climate transition issues. Several of these projects focus on the development of governance to support a fair climate transition, such as the Just Transitions graduate school. Projects also focus on enhanced citizen participation in climate transition, such as the Viable Cities project Climate Neutral Gothenburg 2.0, where Gothenburg is the first municipality in Sweden to test the citizen assembly method in the spring of 2024.

Cooperation and co-creation is essential in order to succeed in the climate transition. Together with its key partners in all sectors, The City of Gothenburg in this Climate City Contract outlines the path

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

to near-zero emissions by 2030, with the confidence and humility this endeavour requires, whilst also being aware of the great challenges that lie ahead, and the large investments required.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

## Goal

### An ambitious goal with robust support

The climate goal of Gothenburg aims for a near-zero carbon footprint by 2030. This goal is an integral part of the Environment and Climate Program for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030, which was adopted by a large political majority in the City Council in 2021. The objective encompasses all administrations and City-owned companies, addressing both territorial and consumption-based emissions. Under this objective, territorial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are targeted to decrease from 4.3 to 1.2 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per inhabitant annually, while consumption-based GHG emissions are targeted to decline from 9.25 to 3.3 metric tons (based on 2018 and 2019 year baselines respectively). Many stakeholders in academia, industry, and civil society in Gothenburg embrace the vision of pioneering climate transition and seek collaboration to achieve the target.

### Territorial reductions and remaining gap for Gothenburg

Gothenburg's near-zero goal differs in scope and target value from the Mission's "climate neutrality." The Mission's definition of "climate neutrality" entails achieving net-zero GHG emissions, incorporating Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from territorial operations, with Scope 3 emissions not presently mandated. In contrast, the system boundary for Gothenburg's goal is broader, encompassing Scope 1 emissions from all industries within the territory, including traded emissions, as well as Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions from all goods and services consumed, from a consumption-based perspective. Thus, the two targets vary in their scope.

As presented in the Climate Action Plan, Gothenburg is anticipated to achieve a 77 % reduction in territorial emissions, slightly below the recommended 80 % for climate neutrality in the Mission. However, it's noteworthy that Gothenburg will be effecting emission reductions from an already relatively low starting point compared to other European cities. This is primarily due to the comparatively low emissions from the energy system, particularly electricity production. To illustrate, the average EU-27 territorial per capita emissions were 8.4 metric tons of CO2 equivalents in 2018 (EUROSTAT), compared to Gothenburg's 4.3 metric tons. An 80% reduction in emissions would therefore leave 1.68 metric tons per capita for an average European city, whereas Gothenburg's pathway towards a 77% reduction suggests 0.98 metric tons by 2030, predicted population change included.

The remaining GHG emissions in 2030 constitute the city's residual emissions. Strategies to address these emissions will form a significant part of future iterations of the Climate City Contract.

### Synergies and conflicts of interest

The city's climate transition efforts reveal several sectoral connections, conflicts of interest, and potential synergies. Conflicts must be identified and managed with care, ideally transformed into opportunities, thus maximizing the benefits of change. One notable example is the intersection of climate transition and equity, where climate action can facilitate social progress if approached with both perspectives in mind. A just transition is an area currently being explored by the City through initiatives such as the Just Transition Graduate School and cross-cutting efforts to integrate social

and environmental sustainability work. Common co-benefits identified by the City include improved public health, enhanced air quality, reduced noise pollution, increased biodiversity, and the creation of more livable and attractive neighbourhoods, alongside job creation and bolstered city resilience. The green transition also presents significant opportunities for many companies in Gothenburg, leveraging competitive advantages, particularly in the realms of electrification and the establishment of emerging green industries.

# 3 Strategic priorities

## Strategic priorities

### Systemic interventions based on system understanding

The strategic priorities to reach climate-neutrality in Gothenburg need to be based on a solid understanding of the emission impact domains and the different systems to address, for the City and its involved stakeholders, the most efficient measures to be prioritised.

Industrial emissions constitute the largest share (55 %) of greenhouse gas emissions in Gothenburg, whereof the lion share is from the refineries. However, it is also closely intertwined with the City's energy system. These two systems therefore need to be addressed together. Changes in the energy system are key for climate transition. As mentioned in the previous section the electricity sector already has low emissions. The energy system and the industry sector are in addition closely connected to the transport sector, waste management and the built environment. The reason for this is the district heating system uses the waste heat from industry and the waste incineration plant (about 75 % of the energy source), as well as heat produced from the City energy company's own plants (about 25 %). Additionally, electrification is featured as an important means to reduce climate impact from both the industry and the transport sector, which increases the demand for electricity within the geographical area of Gothenburg. Finally, the building sector also affects the energy sector in terms of its energy demand (heating, electricity and cooling). Circular economy is key for reducing material and energy use and indirectly emissions. Hence, circular economy is linked particularly to the energy system and the built environment.

Road traffic is the second largest source of geographical greenhouse gas emissions in Gothenburg, just below about 20 % of total emissions. As a large city, Gothenburg has a greater potential to increase walking, cycling and public transport, as well as shifting to more efficient freight transport, compared to other parts in Sweden where the population density is lower. The ambitions regarding the decrease in transport emissions are therefore higher compared to the corresponding national goal. The City's ambition is that the climate impact from transportation will be reduced by at least 90 % by 2030, and that the volume of motorized traffic will be reduced by 25 %. Reaching the targets will require a shift from car travel to walking, cycling and public transportation, and freight transport from road to rail and waterborne transport. Furthermore, the use of fossil fuels needs to stop and be replaced by different renewable fuels, electric or hydrogen driven vehicles. Renewable fuels will not be sufficient for the same volume of road traffic as today, nor will they be sufficient for shipping, aviation, work machinery and other sectors. That is why the volume of traffic needs to be reduced as well.

The Port of Gothenburg is Scandinavia's largest port and a central node in Sweden's transport system. This provides the opportunity for the City of Gothenburg to act as a forerunner and become a hub for climate transition of the transport system for Northern Europe.
City of Gothenburg
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

With Gothenburg being a growing city, emissions derived from the building and construction sector are crucial. Focusing on this sector as an enabler for climate neutrality has large implications on emissions in Gothenburg and elsewhere.

Emissions of greenhouse gases due to food production are important from a consumption-based emission perspective. The City has investigated the potential to reduce these emissions, and connected emissions from the transportation of food, the potential of nature-based solutions and greening of urban areas. In total, this focus has potential to generate reductions in emission with many co-benefits.

## Strategic priorities

A large number of different types of actions are necessary to achieve the climate goal, and several different levers needs to be used. Most of all, to be successful the City of Gothenburg needs to work in close collaboration with all necessary stakeholders within business, academia, public organisations, civil society and citizens to expand the portfolio and strengthen the alignment.

The City has, during the preparation of this commitment, developed portfolios of action around seven strategic priorities. Each portfolio addresses various levers: technical, financial, organisational, governance, policy, culture, behavioural and social.

The seven strategic priorities are:

The intertwined energy and industrial system portfolio
This portfolio includes actions to reduce emissions from the privately owned refineries by switching to renewable energy or implementing carbon capture and storage (CCS), replacement of the natural gas used as fuel at the combined heat and power plant owned by Göteborg Energi (the municipal energy utility), and broad energy efficiency measures and energy advice to citizens and SME:s. The technical shifts needed will be supported by multi-lever measures, for example behavioural change.

The Port as a lever for reduced heavy transport emissions
The City, in cooperation with many actors, works for improved conditions and infrastructure for fossil-free freight transport by sea, port and on land. This is achieved through a portfolio of linked activities regarding bottleneck issues of fossil-free logistics to enable shifts from road-bound to rail-bound freight transports, infrastructure for hydrogen, onshore power supply for tankers and fast lanes for electric trucks, to name a few examples.

Sustainable and efficient mobility
The City uses a wide toolbox to induce a shift towards a more sustainable and efficient mobility system. This implies efforts to expand and improve infrastructure for walking, cycling, trams, electrified busses and trains micromobility. Additionally, mobility management, city planning, parking regulations, new business models, nudging and infrastructure for electric vehicles are elements of the portfolio. The battery factory of Northvolt and Volvo Cars will act as a local landmark for this shift. The multi-stakeholder collaboration initiatives (Green City Zone, ElectriCity, Public transportation of the Future as well as mobilising for the international conference on electric vehicles) are important enablers.

Improvements in the treatment of waste materials
Reductions of the amount of plastic in the waste treated by the incineration plant is needed, as well as reductions of incinerated food waste. Instead of being sources of emissions these resources can be used for recycling (plastic) and for biogas and fertilizer (food waste) and thus replace use of fossil

based raw materials. Apart from enhancing infrastructural capacity, different strategies and combination of instruments are applied, including pricing, investigations on CCS, developed work procedures and behavioural shifts.

## 5. Climate-neutral construction

The City uses public construction projects as an engine in the transformation to a climate-neutral construction sector in Gothenburg. This involves working with requirements in public procurements of buildings and construction as well as using living labs for long term co-creation and innovation processes, together with stakeholders of the construction sector, such as The Platform for Climate-neutral Construction and The Handshake. Changing norms to optimise the use of existing building stocks is also part of this portfolio.

## 6. Capacity for circular economy

The City of Gothenburg is one of Sweden's largest procurers, driving the market towards circularity. City administrations and companies are joining forces to build capacity for action on a circular economy and by mobilizing key actors, as well as to nudge behavioural change, involving various stakeholders in the city. Building the infrastructure for the shared and circular economy together with civil society organisations is also a key component.

## 7. Urban farming, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions

In collaboration with entrepreneurs, business sector, academia and civil society actors, the City supports the increase of urban farming through land allocation, procurement, by running collaboration platforms and supporting innovation. Closely linked to this is urban planning measures to enable food production, nature-based solutions as well as green infrastructure for enhanced ecosystem services.

## 4 Process and principles

### Process and principles

#### Governing the climate transition of Gothenburg

Gothenburg has a long tradition of working with environmental and climate issues, integrated across the City's organisation and in collaboration with other stakeholders. During the last years, the City has worked progressively with developing strategies, goals and indicators to form the pathway towards 2030. Successful platforms have been developed with the business sector, academia, the civil society and other public authorities to foster systemic change in areas where no single actor has the tools or mandate to solve problems on their own.

Nevertheless, the challenges ahead demand further development of the City's work and procedures to support systemic transition. Key priorities for the City of Gothenburg are:

**Governance within the City**: additional governance innovation interventions that support systemic, mission-oriented and co-designed portfolios of actions that accelerate learning and transition within the City organization.

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

**Multi-level governance**: Multi-level innovation interventions that aim to mobilise opportunities and overcome barriers connected to governance structures on local, regional, national and international levels.
**Multi-actor governance**: Multi-actor innovation interventions that aim to strengthen collaboration with business, academia, public authorities, civil society and citizens to widen the systemic, mission-oriented and co-designed portfolio of actions and accelerate learning.
**Social innovation**: Social innovation interventions which aim to unleash the potential of collaboration, citizen inclusion, co-benefits and a bottom-up human-centred approach.

## Developing governance within the City

The City of Gothenburg, much like other municipalities, operates with distinct administrations and companies, each tasked with specific functions. Management is also highly decentralised, with the administrations and companies each having their own mandate and governance. While this setup facilitates efficient day-to-day management, it lacks in its ability to address systemic challenges like climate transition. For this reason the governance system needs to be enhanced with instruments such as the *Climate Action Plan*, *Climate Investment Plan*, and the forthcoming *Climate Transition Strategy* that will describe possible strategic pathways, based on advanced scenario- and risk analyses.

These three instruments will add to the following governance tools that are already in use:

The *Climate Transition Function* that organizes the development of the Climate Transition Strategy.
The *Climate Budget* which contributes to raising awareness of the city's carbon footprint and describe necessary actions for achieving climate targets and serves as a follow-up and planning instrument for implementing the right measures.
The *seven cross-cutting strategies* in the Environment and Climate Program for the City of Gothenburg 2021-2030 that deal with key priority areas which require a high degree of collaboration and cross-cutting solutions.
*Strategic work on underlying enablers* such as financing, leadership and skills, communication, influence and collaboration capacities.
The *Climate Council* which contributes with independent academic expertise to support the city's transition with proposals of feasible and specific measures.
The *Testbed Gothenburg* which is a tool to further address the systemic barriers of fragmented innovation and involve more actors to enable upscaling.
The *Knowledge Arena* which aims on developing internal capabilities of the City to foster innovation and digitalisation.
*Virtual Gothenburg* which creates new opportunities to better describe, understand, plan and manage the city. It also enables better basis for decision-making and understanding of the challenges and solutions related to the net-zero mission.

## Developing multi-level governance

The City needs to continue building on its multi-level collaboration with regional, national and international levels in order to be successful in the climate transition. The work ahead will evolve through the platforms of Viable Cities, NetZeroCities and the regional mobilisation efforts in western Sweden in particular. Additionally, there will be a focus on ways of orchestrating the various collaborations the City is engaged in, to utilise this for accelerating climate transition.

## Developing multi-actor governance

It is a key priority to include actors from different sectors of society. To widen the systemic, mission-oriented and co-created portfolios of action and accelerated learning in order to reach beyond the City organisation there is a need to develop multi-actor collaboration. The strategy is to build on already ongoing initiatives.

Concerning innovation and technology development some of the most prominent platforms are:

Climate-neutral construction
Circular construction (see MoU in appendix)
Emission free transportation zones
Electrified transportation and heavy machinery
Public transportation innovation
Emission reductions from the port and logistics sector
Climate-leading process industry
Sustainable fashion industry
Sustainable food system
Sustainable destination

The City is also engaged in several specific City-academia partnerships. One of these is the focus area “A fossil-free Gothenburg” that includes research initiatives and in-depth collaboration with Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg.

Urban Futures – Centre for Sustainable Urban Development is an important platform for developing knowledge, networks and transdisciplinary methodology to address sustainability challenges, not least concerning governance for a just climate transition. The platform is regional and includes the City of Gothenburg, Chalmers University of Technology, the University of Gothenburg, RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, IVL – Swedish Environmental Research Institute, GR – the Gothenburg Region, VGR – Region Västra Götaland, and the West Sweden County Administrative Board.

Wexsus (West Sweden Nexus for Sustainable Development) is a new platform under development. It is a collaborative arena run jointly by Chalmers University of Technology, the University of Gothenburg and University West. The platform connects all sectors of society and build relationships to strengthen the ability to implement a sustainable transition based on research-based knowledge.

Other examples of broad collaborations throughout sectors of society are the mobilised efforts around the establishment of a new battery factory for electric vehicles in Gothenburg (see MoU in appendix). Mobilisation around the development of electric vehicles is also shown through the engagement of various actors to arrange an international conference on EV development in Gothenburg 2025 (see MoU in appendix).

## Developing citizen inclusion and social innovation

Citizen inclusion and collaboration with civil society is an integrated part of the multi-actor collaborations around specific challenges described above. However, citizen inclusion needs a separate focus as well. This is due to its profound importance and to the differing conditions of citizen engagement compared to involvement of other stakeholders of business, academia and the public sector.

An important starting point is that the administrations and the companies in the City are obliged by the City Council to involve citizens in their field of operation, and for this purpose use the

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

infrastructure for democratic action and participation. There is a separate committee and administration responsible for maintaining and developing this infrastructure.

"The Accord" (Överenskommelsen) which is an overarching agreement between the City and the umbrella organisations of Gothenburg civil society, will provide a framework for the collaboration and mutual interests of the City and the civil society.

Collaboration with civil society and citizen inclusion will be an integrated part of the Climate City Contract and be further developed through the following initiatives:

The City's infrastructure for democratic action and participation
The test of a citizen assembly in the spring of 2024
A civil society platform under development
Three different concepts for dialogue and co-creation – The Futurable City, The Transition City and The Frihamnen Days, which are different public setups with a shared ambition
Virtual Gothenburg – a digital twin to provide tools for citizen involvement and shared understanding

Another key area to enable systemic transformation is social innovation interventions that can unleash the potential of collaboration, citizen inclusion, co-benefits and a bottom-up human-centred approach. The capacity to enable social innovation will be developed within the City by building on:

Strategic work on creating conditions for sustainable living
User-centred innovation capacity building
The Just Transitions Graduate School

Other concrete focus areas within the social innovation dimension that the City will utilise to mobilise action are:

Develop an urban infrastructure for a circular and sharing economy
The Smart Map – a social innovation for circular economy initiatives
Single-use free city – elimination of single-use containers
Private consumption and consumption-based emission tools
Sustainable destination and climate smart events
Gothenburg Green City Zone – developing social innovation tools
Reallocate – living labs to catalyse change in mobility practices
The urban and peri-urban food production stimulant

## Monitoring and accelerating learning

The governance innovation interventions that the City of Gothenburg has developed, and will continue to develop, will contribute to the collective learning and shared knowledge that is necessary for dealing with the uncertainty that comes with climate transition.

The Climate Transition Function is a central tool to orchestrate co-action, but also co-learning. The Climate Transition Function is developing climate transition scenarios, which provide knowledge on how the different City departments and companies need to act, and how the management needs to adapt in relation to the scenarios. Together with the Climate Budget, the City will be better placed to manage emissions data and plan future measures. The interventions to coordinate the work within the City organisation need to be connected to the collaborative work with other actors, other levels and the citizens. From strengthening these connections, the City will have better preconditions to

carry out sensemaking, reflection and synthesis based on a strong knowledge base. This is crucial for being successful when working in a system transforming way.

Conclusions from the accelerated learning is absorbed by the processes of the Environment and Climate Programme, including the City-wide Environment Management System and the seven cross-cutting strategies, where actions of different character, both short-term and long-term, will be incorporated. The Environment and Climate Programme is monitored every second year and is also subject for revision, the next revision taking place 2025. Learnings from the Climate City Contract will be included in the monitoring of the programme. The monitoring process means that there is a constant learning loop within the City, forming preconditions for utilising the accelerated learning.

## The Climate City Contract

The Climate City Contract is more than a document. It is a process off assembling all relevant efforts and plans, and for connecting most relevant stakeholders around the City's ambition to reach its climate goal. Continuous revision will ensure that it will be a continuous tool for joint information sharing, collaboration and decision-making. Together with the Climate Transition Strategy and the national Viable Cities climate contract, the Climate City Contract will be much more than a manifestation – it will be one of the City's most important tools for successful climate transition.

# Letter of Support for Gothenburg Climate City Contract

We, Region Västra Götaland, Sweden, hereby declare our strong support of Gothenburg Climate City Contract. Gothenburg has the ambition to be one of the world's most progressive cities when it comes to preventing and addressing environmental and climate problems. The Climate City Contract outlines the path forward to realize such actions. It establishes the ambition for the City of Gothenburg to bring about systematic change to reach climate neutrality by 2030. This commitment will inspire other European cities and strengthen the chances of reaching the climate target in Västra Götaland. Gothenburg plays an important role in our regional partnership.

# Our organisation

Region Västra Götaland is governed by democratically elected politicians and with over 50,000 employees is one of Sweden's biggest employers. Our task is to offer good healthcare and dental care and to provide the prerequisites for good public health, a rich cultural life, a good environment, jobs, research, education and good communications. Altogether, this all provide a foundation for sustainable growth in Västra Götaland. Together with the 49 municipalities, trade and industry, organisations and academia, we drive development with Västra Götaland's best interest as objective.

# Partnership

Klimat 2030 – Västra Götaland ställer om (Climate 2030 – Västra Götaland in transition) is a broad collaboration of different stakeholders and actors in the region run by the Region Västra Götaland and the County Administrative Board of Västra Götaland to join forces on climate action. This includes close and ambitious cooperation with the municipalities and the City of Gothenburg is an important partner to drive the transition.

All municipalities in the county have signed and committed to the goal of a fossil-independent region of Västra Götaland by 2030 and the municipalities also submit their own Local Authorities Climate Commitments yearly. Calculations of the Local Authorities Climate Commitments from 2021–2022 show emission reductions of more than 75,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents. 2023 all municipalities were invited to join for a new period and Gothenburg committed to fulfil all 30 commitments in the period 2024–2026 which is the most ambitious out of 48 municipalities participating. The Västra Götaland county has extensive

experience of successfully adapting to structural changes. By trying to be a forerunner, we believe we can also inspire others.

## Support and contribution

We recognise the importance of collaboration between the City of Gothenburg and Region Västra Götaland in the climate transition. The City of Gothenburg is important for prosperity and well-being in the Västra Götaland region in many ways and works as the core of a large labor market region and hub for freight transport. At the same time the city is dependent and affected by the surrounding municipalities and residents in the region and the possibilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Examples of common challenges are to support the transition of industry, facilitate energy efficiency and production of renewable energy. Hence, Region Västra Götaland and Klimat 2030 can contribute to enabling the City of Gothenburg to become a climate neutral city by 2030 by further developing our cooperation and continue to support municipalities and offer financing for climate investments and projects.

We, the undersigned, hereby commit to support and collaborate towards a climate neutral Gothenburg by 2030. We agree on the joint ambition and commitments, as formulated in the City of Gothenburg’s Climate City Contract.

Sincerely,

Helena L Nilsson
