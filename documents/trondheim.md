# Summary

"Together we create Trondheim." This is the slogan for Trondheimsløftet, the municipal master plan for 2020-2032. As one of the three main goals, Trondheim shall assume responsibility for a greener and more circular city. After being selected as one of the 112 climate-neutral and smart cities in the EU Cities Mission, Trondheim aims to become climate neutrality by 2030.

The mission platform NetZeroCities provides methodologies such as the Climate Transition Map and the Theory of Change framework, which have been adopted in planning Trondheim's climate transition since spring 2022. The timing was good. Trondheim was about to revise the fourth energy and climate plan. Klimaløftene was adopted by the City Council in April 2024. The Climate City Contract (CCC) Action Plan has then been drafted in hope to realise the political ambitions and transition strategies.

Trondheim has over two decades of experience in climate governance. Our first energy and climate plan was adopted by the City Council in 2001. As the technological capital of Norway, Trondheim is known for its capacity to innovate. Still, the exercise of drafting this CCC Action Plan has given us both insight and a roadmap to accelerate the systemic changes needed. The direct GHG emissions in Trondheim have been reduced by approx. 20 percent during 2009-2022. Our ambition is to reduce 80 percent by 2030. There is still a huge gap to act upon.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Fig. S1: Overview of contents and relationship of the different parts in CCC Action Plan

This CCC Action Plan contains three main parts. Part B is the centrepiece. Trondheim's transition towards climate neutrality is detailed in 5 impact pathways, 33 actions planned in 14 portfolios and 28 indicators for monitoring, evaluating and learning. Part A informs, with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions baseline inventory, assessment of current policies and strategies, systemic barriers and opportunities, and a mapping of key stakeholders. Part C enables, with a description of governance innovation and social innovation interventions.

The five focus areas or impact pathways in Trondheim's climate transition are 1) energy systems, 2)

mobility and transport, 3) built environment, 4) waste and circular economy, and 5) viable nature. These are also important aspects of the citizens' everyday life. For us, the CCC AP is both an instrument for coordinated climate governance and an instrument to activate the ecosystem for change. Actions, actors and assets are the three indispensable elements for successful implementation of our planned portfolios. With this first CCC AP in place, we are to start a new chapter in our transition journey.

# Introduction

The introduction outlines the local geographic and policy context in which the city's 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan is being developed and describes the gap it addresses in broad terms.

# Introduction

## "Together we create Trondheim"

The City of Trondheim is the third largest city in Norway and the regional centre of Mid-Norway. Its administrative territories cover 528 square kilometres. The population size in 2024 is 215,121. The city was founded in 997 and has over 1000 years of history. And at the same time, Trondheim has the reputation of being the technological capital of Norway as the city hosts the headquarters of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and SINTEF, one of Europe's largest research institutes. Greater Trondheim is an incubator for good ideas. There are 37,000 students, 5,000 researchers/academics and a Nobel Prize for medicine. Nowhere else in Norway does society invest more per capita in research and new knowledge.

Trondheimsløftet, the municipal master plan for 2020-2032 - the societal section, was adopted by the City Council in November 2022. It is difficult to translate "Trondheimsløftet" directly into English because "løftet" has two meanings in Norwegian, both equally important to the cause. Firstly, the word means "to lift" or "to elevate" the city to a higher level". Secondly it is also "a promise", "an agreement" that we and our inhabitants must work together to achieve the goals in the plan.

The knowledge base for the making of the master plan consists of the following:

The UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
14 perspectives on Trondheim today, and the challenges and opportunities we face
Insight into what the inhabitants and employees think is important
Recommendations from the Trondheim Panel

The 14 perspectives on Trondheim gives a systematic description about the city's conditions, categorised in social, environmental and economic dimensions. These are some of the issues the report points out:

16.2 % of Trondheim's residents have psychological symptoms or disorders.
21 % of the residents 0-17 years old live cramped with little space.
3.3 % of Trondheim's residents are over 80 years old, and the percentage is growing.
6.9 % of the households in Trondheim are considered low-income.
10 % of Trondheim's main streets are monitored digitally.
98 % of the inhabitants live within 300 metres from open space and green urban spaces.
Each resident of Trondheim is responsible for approx. 37 kg of food waste at home per year.
There are 19,169 companies in Trondheim, 92.55% of which are small- and medium-sized.

Trondheimsløftet is a product of massive co-creation with the citizens. Digital wish tree, involvement through local arenas and libraries, innovation camp at schools with 8th graders, future workshops with municipal staff and dialog meetings with business actors were some highlights. In addition, a citizens' assembly, the Trondheim panel, was established to discuss important dilemmas. They gathered and came up with recommendations relating to well-being and sustainable societal development in Trondheim.

As a result, Trondheimsløftet came up with:

1 vision - Together we create Trondheim
3 main societal development goals
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

15 subgoals
86 strategies that says what we as a municipality are going to do
84 strategies that says what all citizens can contribute with

The three main goals for Trondheim are the following. These are presented in a wheel together with the 15 subgoals, a good system for us to connect the co-benefits of climate actions to.

Trondheim shall assume responsibility for a greener and more circular city.
Trondheim shall be a diverse city with a strong community.
The knowledge and technology capital Trondheim shall be a power centre for a better world.

The municipal master plan consists also of a land-use section, which is being made for 2022-2034. The version after public hearing is finalised, but still pending for approval at the City Council (as of September 2024).

After the local election in September 2023 (electoral participation 65.7%), the political leadership shifted from the centre-left coalition led by the Labour Party to the centre-right coalition led by the Conservative Party. In addition, a history change in Trondheim's political landscape came soon after in June 2024: The municipality turned into the parliamentary governance model, after 187 years of chairmanship model. The municipal administration is re-structured, and it takes time for the organisation to adjust to new routines. However, our commitment for the climate transition and the Cities Mission remains the same and is strongly supported by the new political leadership.

## Trondheim's climate governance

Green is one of three main colours in the Trondheimsløftet wheel of goals. The five subgoals are:

Trondheim is a climate-neutral city
We use our resources smarter in Trondheim
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Everyone in Trondheim has a green and attractive urban environment
It is easy to live environmentally friendly in Trondheim
The nature in Trondheim is viable and robust

During the last few centuries, Trondheim has suffered from the environmental tragedy of the commons. Examples are deforestation in Bymarka, waste and littering problems, including in the harbour, and poor air quality from fossil-based traffic and wood burning. Today, Bymarka is protected, the waste treatment is up-to-date, the harbour is cleaned up, and the local air quality is very good with a few days' exceptions (mostly in winter due to use of studded tires). Still, the greater tragedy of the commons is yet to come. **The City Council declared a crisis situation for climate and nature in 2019.** This is a result of greenhouse gas emissions, overconsumption of resources, pollution and nature degradation on a global scale. To cure these symptoms, we have to dare to come to the core. And as a city situated in the richer West, Trondheim needs to take a larger share of responsibility - for change.

Trondheim City Council adopted its first municipal energy and climate plan in 2001, in light of the Kyoto Protocol from 1997. The plan emphasised the connection between greenhouse gas emission, energy and local air pollution. Years later, the Norwegian government launched a national planning guideline. All Norwegian municipalities, big or small, have been required to include mitigation, adaptation and energy in their planning processes, either as part of the master plan or in a dedicated plan. In Trondheim, climate-related issues are considered and prioritised in the municipal master plans, both the societal section (KPS) and the land-use section (KPA), and in a dedicated municipal energy and climate plan. Trondheim's municipal energy and climate plan has later been revised several times, with approvals in 2010, 2017 and 2024.

The third version of the municipal energy and climate plan (adopted in 2017) laid an important foundation for Trondheim's climate governance. Climate actions became more structured and visible in various management platforms. In 2018, Trondheim made its first climate budget as a dedicated chapter in the municipal annual budget plan, one year after the global pioneer Oslo. This has since then become an annual practice until 2024. The climate budget is based on emissions scenarios for the four-year budgeting period. A baseline scenario is used to estimate the effect of concrete measures that are in the implementation phase. Together these calculations enable us to calculate an "action emissions pathway", which is compared to a "target emissions pathway". The yearly update of the climate budget enables a process of continuous evaluation, reporting and improvement where the goal is to close the "emissions gap" between the "action emissions pathway" and the "target emissions pathway".

Oslo, Hamar and Trondheim have jointly developed a guideline for climate budgeting for all Norwegian local governments at municipal and county level. This project (2019-2021) was sponsored by the Klimasats program of the Norwegian Environment Agency. The result was recognised as Local Climate Measure of the Year in 2021, run by the ZERO Foundation.

The municipal energy and climate plan (2017) was focused as the environmental aspect for Trondheim Municipality's ISO 14001 certification. The implementation of the plan has been reviewed by an external revisor yearly, with follow-up and improvement suggestions. This practice has ensured ownership and engagement of the CEO and top administrative leadership.

Trondheim is a signatory of the Global Covenant of Mayors. The commitment has been renewed by the City Council in 2022. The municipality has reported to the CDP platform since 2015. Many cities are building on the momentum in their environmental action, making it mainstream to their operations. In 2022 and 2023, the City of Trondheim received the highest score for the transparency and bold climate action and came on the CDP's annual cities A List.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

"100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities" is one of the EU's five missions under the Horizon Europe 2021-2027. The Cities Mission takes a cross-sectoral and demand-led approach, creating synergies between existing initiatives and basing its activities on the actual needs of cities. It aims to involve local authorities, citizens, businesses, investors as well as regional and national authorities for joint actions. It echoes well to what Trondheim needs, and the timing was good. When the call was launched, Trondheim was about to start the revision of the municipal energy and climate plan, for its fourth version.

Since Trondheim was selected as one of the 112 mission cities in spring 2022, the journey has been enriching and motivating. The mission platform NetZeroCities is both resourceful and supportive. Trondheim has adopted Climate City Contract as the backbone for the revision of the energy and climate plan. The tools such as Climate Transition Map and the Theory of Change framework have been incorporated during the revision process. And now the newly adopted energy and climate plan (2024) will be the backbone of Trondheim's Climate City Contract.

# The most important climate issues in Trondheim

Three-quarters of emissions in Trondheim come from three sources: transport (around  $35\%$ ), the construction sector ( $15\%$ ) and district heating ( $25\%$ ).

Within the transport sector: Trondheim has already experienced emissions reductions, thanks to the Miljøpakken, a multi-level partnership for sustainable transport in the Trondheim region, and a rapid uptake of electrical vehicles that make up  $20\%$  of the passenger car fleet. The municipality is well underway in transitioning to zero emissions vehicles in its own vehicle fleet, and a similar transition can be achieved for other commercial stakeholders through a combination of policy incentives, public procurement and the investment in charging and other zero emissions infrastructure. The municipality has already carried out a comprehensive assessment of infrastructure needs in this field, and has begun allocating funding to new charging points and energy stations with biogas.

Within the construction sector: The City Council adopted a three-step vision in 2020: the municipality's own building projects shall be fossil-free in 2021, these shall be completely emission-free by 2023, and the whole of Trondheim's construction sector shall be emission-free by 2030. The municipality's own role as public procurer with around  $10 - 15\%$  market share is key to kick starting this process, already setting in motion innovative projects such as the development of 13-tonne mobile "battery containers" to enable the hyper-charging of large construction machinery on-site. Going forward, policy innovation will be key. Trondheim has in concert with other Norwegian cities actively lobbied for municipalities to be given greater planning powers to enforce emission standards on private developers. Circularity of this sector is also of high focus.

Waste-to-energy in Trondheim is a vital part of treating waste produced in the whole of central Norway, dramatically reducing the need for landfill. It also covers approx.  $30\%$  of Trondheim's heating needs. In dialogue with the municipality, the plant owner is actively assessing the feasibility of carbon capture at the plant. An assessment has been made about the value chain for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in mid-Norway. CCS would also capture the biogenic emissions from waste-burning, enabling Trondheim to become carbon neutral already with current targets. Trondheim has an on-going project in the NetZeroCites Pilot Cities Programme about this.

EU project Positive City Exchange (2018-2023) has developed and showcased innovative solutions for positive energy districts (PEDs). As the Norwegian capital of technology, Trondheim has a good

track record of innovation. Together with partners across Europe, Trondheim became the lighthouse for energy transition. The massive electrification of the transport sector is supported by the fact that Norway produces almost all its electricity from renewable energy sources. However, this might become challenges in the energy systems, for example, lack of grid capacity. During the project, two operational PEDs, Sluppen and Brattøra, were established. Bold City Vision “Trondheim Energy Positive City 2050” was anchored and integrated in the municipal master plan Trondheimsløftet.

# Trondheim's goals for climate transition

In April 2024, Klimaløftene, the fourth municipal energy and climate plan, was adopted by the City Council. The name Klimaløftene can be seen as an extension of Trondheimsløftet, the municipal master plan. It can be translated as our Climate Pledges for the future. This brand new policy instrument serves as the strategic foundation for Trondheim's engagement in the Cities Mission. It sets the goals, strategies and guidelines. The climate budget and other operational routines for climate management will be re-structured accordingly.

The four climate pledges and the related goals are:

## Trondheim is Climate-Neutral

Together we create a zero-emission society

The direct greenhouse gas emissions shall be cut by at least 80 percent by 2030, compared to 2009, and the city will be emission-free by 2050.
By increasing natural carbon sequestration and industrial carbon capture and storage, we shall achieve climate-neutrality by 2030 and become climate-positive by 2050.
We will reduce our share of the carbon footprint in line with the 1.5-degree target.

## Trondheim is Energy-Smart

Together we make the best use of our renewable energy resources

All fossil energy that can be phased out has been phased out to achieve the goal of an 80 percent reduction in direct greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
Energy resources are utilised smartly and flexibly to ensure sufficient energy and power for climate transition while simultaneously minimising the loss of nature.
Everyone has stable and secure access to energy and power at an affordable price, allowing for population growth and economic development.
The municipality is facilitating space for energy infrastructure necessary for the green transition

## Trondheim is Circular

Together we take care of the resources and create a circular city

We take care of what we have and limit our resource consumption to the planetary boundaries.
Circular and shared solutions are the norm in 2030.
The waste is handled in a climate and environment friendly way, where resources are kept in circulation for as long as possible.

## Trondheim is Climate-Resilient

Together we create a sustainable society

Our natural and urban areas are prepared to withstand climate change, and we have emergency preparedness for extreme events.
The population stands together against climate change in a just energy and climate transition, which promotes public health and community.
Local value creation and employment increase through the energy and climate transition.
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

In order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, 9 focus areas were mapped out with specific actions towards 2030:

) Nature and land use: We aim to develop an area-neutral, attractive, and climate-resilient city.
) Energy and power: We will phase out fossil energy, increase local renewable energy production, and utilise energy resources smartly and flexibly.
) Mobility and transport: We will streamline and modernise the transportation sector and make it nearly emission-free.
) Buildings and constructions: We will develop buildings and infrastructure for a climate-resilient, emission-free, and circular future.
) Consumption and waste: We will develop a circular city where we preserve resources and reduce our consumption.
) Carbon sequestration for climate neutrality: We will compensate for the direct emissions we cannot eliminate.
) Climate adaptation and civil preparedness: Together we shall make the city and nature more climate resilient.
) Just transition and public health: We will promote equity and solidarity in the fight against climate change.
) Business and workforce: We will be a driver for value creation that safeguards environmental and social sustainability.

These 9 focus areas serve as the foundation of the Trondheim Climate City Contract, with a bit of restructuring. The climate actions will be categorised and elaborated in five focus areas or impact pathways in accordance with the NetZeroCities Theory of Change framework, while the remaining are included as either enabling factors or co-benefits.

) Energy systems
) Mobility and transport
) Built environment
) Waste and circular economy
) Viable nature

## Other climate-related instruments in Trondheim’s policy landscape

Trondheim’s climate planning consists mainly of the following elements:

(1) Trondheimsløftet: municipal master plan, societal section
(2) Klimaløftene: a theme plan for energy and climate
(3) Climate budget in the annual budget plan

In addition, there are many other policy instruments that are of high relevance and come into interplay. Module A-2 in this document will provide a more detailed description and assessment. Some examples can be mentioned here.

The GHG emissions from the transport sector is highly connected to spatial planning and land-use policy. The master plan, land-use section, sets the prerequisites for urban development. In the City Development Strategy for 2050 (2020), it is stated that Trondheim should aim to become a denser and more pedestrian-friendly city. Miljøpakken has also made strategies for walking og cycling, respectively.

Multi-level governance and collaboration across different levels in public administration is considered vital in systemic changes for climate transition. Miljøpakken, established in 2009, provides a good example. It is a partnership with municipalities in the Trondheim region, county and state that jointly invest in new infrastructure to facilitate increased biking, walking and use of public transport. The goals are cutting queues and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as facilitating easy
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY

and safe travel. Urban Growth Agreements between the state, counties and municipalities is an instrument to enhance the integration of land use and transport policy in order to achieve a national goal of zero growth in personal car transport. They include considerable state financing of transport projects in order to promote public transport, biking and pedestrians. The Zero Growth target in personal car use and introduction of zero emission cars combined, will contribute to significant GHG-reduction. Today, five Norwegian city regions have such agreements, among which the Trondheim region (2023-2029). The measures executed by Miljøpakken are part of this agreement.

## Journey along the Climate Transition Map

Cities are leaders in the transformation of the way people work and live. By joining the Cities Mission, Trondheim embarks on an ambitious journey to become the first 112 cities to reach climate-neutrality by 2030. A systemic and transformative approach is needed to accelerate decarbonisation. This approach is embodied and described by NetZeroCities' Climate Transition Map. Below is a short status of the Trondheim journey, covering the first three phases leading to our first iteration of Climate City Contract.

### Built upon a strong mandate

|  Build a strong mandate | Within city government | Set up / strengthen the internal team  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |   |  Mobilise resources and capacity  |
|   |  Within the local ecosystem | Develop a multi-actor Transition team  |
|   |   |  Build new collaborative governance structures and networks  |
|   |  With the other government levels | Strengthen buy-in  |
|   |   |  Clarify mutual commitments  |

### What we do/have done:

The internal climate team was set up and strengthened across different departments
The political commitment was confirmed, through Klimaløftene
Massive stakeholder engagement during the revision of the energy and climate plan
The citizen survey about Trondheim's climate efforts, yearly since 2017
Trondheim Municipality is member in green (business) network, such as Klimapartnere Trøndelag and Renergy
Trondheim Municipality collaborates actively and strategically with Rol institutions NTNU and SINTEF
Trondheim Municipality and Trøndelag County Authority meet regularly about climate measures
The four major Norwegian cities (Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, Stavanger) meet regularly to share experiences, discuss common challenges and make joint statements in the media.

### How we can be better:

To ensure internal coordination for climate actions in the parliamentary governance model
To develop a multi-actor transition team with external partners through new collaborative governance structure
To strengthen collaboration with national government (This is being carried out by the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development and DOCA through the Cities Mission)
In our PilotCities project we are testing citizen panel for concrete climate measures

### Understand the system

|  Understand the system through | Data | GHG emissions inventory  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |   |  Analyse actions and gaps needs  |
|   |  Connections, relationships | Map the system and resources flows  |
|   |   |  Identify key obstacles  |
|   |  Future scenarios | Identify levers of change  |
|   |   |  Model options, capital formation, funding strategies  |

What we do/have done:
The Norwegian Environment Agency publishes yearly direct GHG emission statistics for all municipalities, covering CO2, CH4 and N2O.
Trondheim's climate management is recognised by CDP Cities A List in 2022 and 2023.
A knowledge base is updated and made for the revision of the energy and climate plan, identifying challenges and opportunities in each focus area and levers of change.
An assessment (Roadmap for GHG reduction in Trondheim) is made by CICERO, analysing actions and gaps.

How we can be better:
To connect better actors, actions and assets in system mapping
To get better insight on capital formation and funding strategies, beyond the municipality

Co-creating a portfolio
|  Co-create a portfolio | Explore actionable pathways | Clarify possible actions and financing / funding options  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |   |  Estimate co-benefits and impact  |
|   |   |  Select impact indicators  |
|   |  Connect interventions across... | Actions with quantified impact  |
|   |   |  Policy  |
|   |   |  Finance  |

What we do/have done:
The importance of co-benefits is clearly addressed in Klimaløftene. "Just transition and public health" is one of the focus areas.
Trondheimsløftet (the master plan) and Klimaløftene (the energy and climate plan) are clearly linked, at a strategic level.

How we can be better:
To select impact indicators, measure them and cross-analyse them
To relate climate actions with the other subgoals in Trondheimsløftet (GHG reductions should also be a co-benefit of other life-quality improving measures.)
To communicate and co-create a city-wide investment plan for climate transition

Climate City Contract for Trondheim's climate transition

Plan, act, evaluate - and then start over again. This summarises the management cycle. Trondheim's fourth energy and climate plan, Klimaløftene, was adopted in April 2024, and the parliamentary governance model was introduced in the municipality in June 2024. The timing is
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

good for Trondheim to step up and accelerate its climate transition. The Climate City Contract (CCC) includes three elements: commitments, action plan and investment plan. It should work as the basis for building a strong foundation, ambition, and effective implementation. The City of Trondheim aims to adopt CCC as a transformative instrument, well integrated with the strategic Klimaløftene and the operative climate budget.

## CCC as an instrument for coordinated climate governance

Trondheim Municipality is experienced with climate governance. Implementation of the previous energy and climate plan (2017) has resulted in good routines. Now when Klimaløftet, our energy and climate plan 4.0, was approved, the routines will also be revised and strengthened, among others the annual climate budget and CDP reporting.

In addition to Trondheimsløftet and Klimaløftene, the municipality has several political decisions that are highly relevant to the city's climate transition, including the Municipal Plan for Natural Diversity and the Action Program for Sustainable Value Creation, to name a few. The CCC should be developed as a management tool that coordinates various societal goals and actions.

The CCC represents a holistic scheme to realise Trondheims ambition to become climate neutral in time for 2030. We aim to adopt the CCC as our sustainable energy and climate action plan (SECAP) for the Covenant of Mayors.

## CCC as an instrument for activating the ecosystem for change

The city's climate transition requires much more than what the municipality alone can manage. We need to activate an entire ecosystem for change - and we need the whole diversity. They can each bring along their experience and expertise, resources and investments with them. The municipality should create the right conditions for all actors to participate and contribute:

Internally in Trondheim municipality - staff, leaders and politicians
Collaborative partners in Trondheim and the region - knowledge institutions, business communities, NGOs, social innovators, and last but not least, the citizens
Multi-level governance - authorities at regional and national level, as well as the EU

Trondheim's first version of CCC Action Plan is a detailed assessment on how the goals in the municipal energy and climate plan, Klimaløftene, can be reached. The structure of the document is divided into three parts: A - current state of climate action, B - pathways towards climate neutrality 2030, C - enabling interventions. The documents are extensive, but we believe the process can help to strengthen the anchorage and share ownership, so that climate transition in Trondheim can increase in scope and speed.

Climate City Contract is neither legally binding nor a politically adopted action plan. It is a tool for Trondheim to realise the political ambitions towards climate-neutrality. Trondheim's CCC shall be implemented, reported and updated in close connection with the existing management routines such as annual climate budget and CDP reporting. Otherwise, our plan is to update the CCC every two years, at least partially, if not completely, to highlight both breakthroughs and improvements.

# Part A – Current State of Climate Action

Part A “Current State of Climate Action” describes the point of departure of the city towards climate neutrality, including commitments and strategies of key local businesses, and informs the subsequent modules and the outlined pathways to accelerated climate action.

# Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

Module A-1 details and describes the latest GHG inventory, where available from 2018 or more recent, referring to a clearly stated geographic boundary. The aim of this section is to establish the emission baseline and to establish the emissions gap to 2030 climate neutrality.

## GHG emissions baseline inventory

Trondheim’s greenhouse gas emissions inventory for territorial emissions dates back to 2009. The inventory is based on data for each municipality from the Norwegian Environment Agency (NEA). The whole time series from 2009 is recalculated every year, as both data assumptions and methodology are continually revised. The inventory provided by NEA includes all territorial emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O within the municipal border, including emissions from the production of district heating (which occurs within the municipal boundaries). Trondheim Municipality has also made an inventory publicly available through CDP/ICLEI Track since 2019. In this inventory emissions from district heating are allocated to the stationary energy sector as scope 2 emissions, as per the requirements for GPC-reporting. Scope 2 data for electricity usage are collected from the Distribution System Operator (Tensio). Scope 3 data are limited to loss in the transmission of electric energy. Data on F-gases are only available at national level - national authorities will provide these data at a municipal level for the next iteration of the CCC.

The municipality considers the current inventory to be sufficient in scope to cover the current target of climate-neutrality, as outlined in the Mission’s Info Kit for Cities. All main Scope 1 and 2 emissions sources are included and the obligatory Scope 3 sources are currently considered to be of marginal importance. Trondheim’s climate strategy includes ambitions regarding the circular economy that currently lie outside the scope of the climate-neutrality goal as currently defined - these are nonetheless outlined in impact pathways 4 and 5 (see part B).

Trondheim Municipality adopted its first climate action plan in 2001. The climate plan has been revised several times since - in 2010, 2017 and 2024. In the period 2009-2022, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions declined 20 percent, from 605,000 to 485,000 tonnes CO2e (scope 1). Trondheim Municipality has for many years reported a GHG emission inventory annually in CDP/ICLEI Tracker, and this data can be collected by NetZeroCities for the use of CCC.

The inventory shows that the most important impact pathway is transport - a sector responsible for one third of Trondheim’s emissions. Trondheim and Norway have very limited emissions from electricity production, and electrification of transport, processes and machinery are ongoing. Transport reduction, increased energy efficiency and additional electricity production will be needed to meet the increasing demand for renewable energy.

Another vital impact pathway is energy systems - both to fuel the climate transition with renewable energy and through carbon capture and storage (CCS) from the waste incineration plant. The plant is responsible for about one fourth of the city’s emissions and covers one third of the city’s thermal energy demand through the district heating network. As the plant emits substantial amounts of biogenic emissions, CCS can provide negative emissions for compensation of residual emissions.

A third impact pathway is buildings and constructions. Machinery related to construction sites are responsible for about 5 % of city wide emissions, with other off-road machinery contributing a further 5 %. The replacement of diesel construction and other machinery with emissions-free technology is a key impact pathway. There is also great potential for circular resource use, and to reduce our climate and nature footprint in this sector.

Waste and circular economy - our fourth impact pathway - sets out to reduce overconsumption of natural resources and to cut scope 3 emissions, by developing circular value chains that increase resource efficiency.

Our final impact pathway is to ensure a viable nature because we depend on ecosystem services. For climate mitigation through natural carbon sinks. For climate adaptation through e.g. flood regulation. For life in general.

Data on final energy use, emissions factors, baseline inventory of GHG emissions and key activity data are provided in the following tables. Please note that only loss in transfer of electric energy is included in scope 3 GHG emissions in this CCC AP: We need to explore how to get data on more scope 3 emissions for the next iteration of CCC AP. As shown in table A-1.2 we also lack information on F-gases: National authorities aim to make data on F-gases available on a municipality level for the next iteration of the CCC AP.

* Includes district heating (app. 144 ktons), but not off-road machinery.
** Includes emissions from electricity (app. 51 ktons) and district heating from waste incineration and some additional fossil fuels (app. 144 ktons)
*** Electricity includes all electricity consumption, not only in buildings.
*** Currently there is no data available for carbon sinks in AFOLU.
*** The differences between scope 1 and scope 2 for the two models are primarily explained by the allocation of district heating to scope 1 in the NZC economic model. The lower total in the NZC emission model can largely be explained by additional waste data included in the native Trondheim model.

## Description &amp; assessment of policies

### Description of the current climate policy context

Climate transition in Trondheim is affected by the policy context at different governance levels: international, national, regional and local. Table A-2.1 summarises some of the most important instruments.

Think global, act local. The city council in Trondheim has been engaged with international policy movements. Our first climate and energy plan was adopted in 2001 in light of the Kyoto Protocol. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement pointed out the direction for our city development - both in Trondheimløftet (municipal master plan) and in Klimaløftene (the newly adopted energy and climate plan).

The EU is an important partner for Norway. The European Green Deal brings opportunities for front-runners for change. Various directives and regulations in the “Fit for 55” package are to be harmonised in the Norwegian juridical system through the EEA mechanism. The EU Climate Pact, launched by the EU Commission as a part of the European Green Deal, has specified priority topics (here is an overview). Trondheim has been a signatory of the European Covenant of Mayors since 2014. In 2018 Trondheim became an EU Lighthouse City through the SCC1 *Positive City Exchange (+CityxChange)* project, which successfully demonstrated the application of the “positive energy block” concept in several areas of Trondheim.

Norway’s target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55 % by 2030 compared to 1990, and 90-95 % by 2050. These targets are statutory in the Climate Change Act. In 2023, Norway’s GHG emissions were 9.1% lower than in 1990, showing that the climate transition needs to accelerate more rapidly in Norway. A recent report done by the Climate Change Committee 2050 “The transition to low emissions - Climate policy choices towards 2050” provides a good overview:

"In a low-emission society, virtually all emissions have been eliminated for good. Policy must be based on this objective. The question is not which emissions should be reduced, but which minor emissions remain in 2050. Everything else must go." - Martin Skancke, Chair of the Committee.

Since 2022, the Norwegian government has made their annual climate budget (Green Book) connected to the national budget process. This is an important policy document for the municipalities to follow up, regarding which measures are prioritised, and how they are financed.

Trøndelag County Authority at the regional level is a key collaborator in Trondheim's climate transition, particularly in transport and mobility as they are in charge of public transport. Their climate strategy puts focus on buildings, transport, food production and nature-based carbon sequestration. Transport and agriculture are two important non-ETS sectors.

The most important local climate policy instruments for Trondheim Municipality are Klimaløftene, the municipal energy and climate plan, and the annually updated climate budget. The Department for Climate and Environment has the responsibility to lead the "plan, act, evaluate" process of these documents, in close collaboration with other departments in the municipality. The climate policy in Trondheim is deeply rooted in the municipal master plan, both the societal section and the land-use section. The climate transition requires systemic changes in various sectors that influence the citizens' everyday life. The connection to master plan and overall development goals may allow us to better elaborate co-benefits.

One major gap to be pointed out here is the difference in climate ambition by 2030 at different governance levels: Norway (55 %), Trøndelag (50-55 %), Trondheim (80 %). This may lead to a general lack of means, resources and legal framework to support Trondheim's climate transition. The Cities Mission and Climate City Contract puts focus highly on multi-level governance. There is definitely room for improvement and better coordination. The Urban Growth agreements (byvekstavtaler) in Norway provide a good example for possible models.

## Existing policy mix for the five focus areas

In addition to the overall policy context, there are many other sectoral instruments that are relevant for Trondheim's climate transition. Here is a short description of the five focus areas of Trondheim's CCC. These areas are structured from both the emission domains in the Theory of Change framework and the 9 focus areas in the municipal energy and climate plan. In each of these areas or sectors, there is a mix of existing policies from different levels of governance.

## Energy systems

The local policy for this focus area is covered in the municipal energy and climate plan. The key measures are within energy efficiency, energy flexibility and renewable energy production. As Norway's electricity is mostly produced from renewable sources such as hydro and wind, the decarbonisation strategy highly depends on electrification. The power supply system is currently highly centrally regulated. Through the +CityxChange project, Trondheim applied for dispensation and piloted mechanisms at the district level. Through public hearing of the national planning guidelines, Trondheim Municipality advocated for the municipalities' mandate for energy planning in the Plan and Building Act.

District heating in Trondheim is controlled through a concession from the Norwegian Energy Regulatory Authority (NVE-RME) to Statkraft Varme, a division of the renewable energy company, Statkraft. It is further mandated in the municipal master plan - land-use section that new buildings of more than 500 m2 within the concession zone should be connected to the district heating network. It is possible to apply to the municipality for exemptions from this rule. The use of CCS to significantly reduce emissions from district heating production has been analysed by the Norwegian Environment

Agency but is not currently part of national climate planning or policy. The Trondheim City Council adopted resolutions on the importance of this climate action, and a collaboration agreement between the municipal administration and Statkraft Varme was signed in 2023.

## Mobility and transport

At the national level, there are targets for the sale of new vehicles: in 2025 all new private cars and light vans shall be emissions free, by 2030 all new trucks and lorries shall be emission-free or biogas-driven. Although ambitious, these targets are not mandated by sanctions or a ban on sales of diesel and petrol vehicles, and are not in and of themselves enough to ensure a rapid enough transition to zero-emission vehicles to meet Trondheim and other Norwegian cities' emission targets. There is therefore discussion around other policy instruments, such as zero emission zones (see A.3 Barriers and opportunities).

The national policy of removing or significantly reducing sales and other taxes on the purchases of new zero-emission vehicles has perhaps been the most important driver of Norway's success in beginning the transition from petrol and diesel-based road traffic. In recent years, the national government has introduced sales tax on electric cars over a certain value, and plans are under consideration for introducing a distance-based road tax on electric vehicles, to replace the current fuel-excise duty. This may contribute to slowing the transition.

At the local level, the county, highway authorities and municipalities (Trondheim and 5 neighbouring municipalities) collaborate on implementing the Urban Growth Agreement (Byvekstavtalen). Through this agreement it is possible to implement exceptions or reductions in road tolls for zero-emission vehicles (it is common in Norway for transport infrastructure to be partially financed by a city-wide system of road tolls). Historically, zero-emission vehicles have been exempt from all charges. Recently, this exemption has been removed for private cars, with gradual increase to 70 % of the full toll charge under implementation. This was done to avoid an increase in private car traffic, and illustrates the tension between policy levers directed towards traffic reduction and those designed to encourage the transition to zero-emission technology (see also A3). For commercial vehicles, a full exemption remains for zero-emissions vehicles and large trucks. The city council has in 2024 adopted a policy of declaring a minimum five-year period for this policy, in order to reduce the financial risk for commercial actors investing in new technology. This policy lever will need to be agreed by the other actors in the urban growth agreement in order to come into effect.

The current mobility strategy for Trondheim was adopted in October 2022. The scope of this strategy is passenger transport, and includes a target of 20 % reduction in car trips by 2030. Feasibility studies about goods transport have been made, and some initiatives have been taken into action.

A further policy instrument set in place by the municipality itself is to require the use of zero-emission or biogas vehicles for all deliveries and transport services in municipal contracts (from 2025 for light vehicles and 2027 for heavy vehicles). This policy was adopted and announced in 2022 in order to give the market time to adjust. In the intervening period there has been a significant increase in the sale and leasing of non-fossil commercial vehicles in the Trondheim area.

For city buses, there is a mandate for all new contracts to require emission-free vehicles from 2025. This will apply next time Trøndelag County Authority enters a new contract period with public transport providers in 2029. There are however provisions within the legal framework for exemptions from this requirement if there are difficulties in powering zero-emission buses. Given the challenges

in providing enough power to drive the electrification of the transport and other sectors in Trondheim, this is one of the reasons it is important to look at the transport and energy contexts in tandem (See A3 and elsewhere).

## Buildings and constructions

Trondheim Municipality is one of the largest developers and of property managers in the city. Environmental strategy for buildings and constructions showcases how we position ourselves as a front-runner. Zero-emission construction has been an important measure. The municipality has exercised its power of procurement as a good starting point - the municipality requires a minimum of fossil-free construction sites, and favours emission-free solutions when evaluating bids in the tendering process. Going forward, policy innovation will be crucial. Trondheim has in concert with other Norwegian cities actively lobbied over many years for municipalities to be given greater planning powers to enforce emission standards on private developers and the government has put forward a change in regulations in this direction for public consultation.

## Waste and circular economy

The municipal plan for waste management covers the waste streams the municipality is responsible for: household waste, waste from the municipality's own operations and waste in public spaces. This does not cover waste streams from business and industry. Trondheim Municipality has also a Food strategy which puts focus on reduction of food waste. Norway is the latest of the three Scandinavian countries to come up with a national strategy for a circular economy. In recent years, reuse and resource efficiency is noticeably becoming a growing trend.

## Viable nature

In 2019, the Trondheim City Council declared a crisis situation for climate and nature. In December 2022, the UN Biodiversity Agreement came into place in Montreal with four goals and 23 targets. The Norwegian government is following up and working on a policy white paper and national action plan. We see increasing discussion about concepts and instruments like land degradation neutrality, restoration of wild areas, and nature budgeting. It is important to consider climate and nature issues in close connection. This was the common topic for the four major cities in Norway in 2024 during Arendalsuka, the largest political gathering in Norway held annually since 2012. In Trondheim, two municipal plans have recently been adopted, on natural diversity and agriculture. Both are highly relevant for viable nature in the urban environment. Nature-based solutions should also be considered and adopted in climate mitigation, as a long-term measure for establishing new carbon-sinks for offsetting residual emissions, and also as an adaptation strategy. The municipal master plan for land-use is currently being revised; the version presented by the administration includes provision for a target of land degradation neutrality within the city boundaries.

# Interlinkages - synergies and conflicts

The five focus areas are often interconnected and cannot be treated as silos, for example:

The decarbonisation of the transport sector requires innovation and upgrade in the energy systems
The building sector is a key area for implementing the circular economy, in addition to being an important arena for emissions reductions within the city itself
The waste-to-energy plant in Trondheim incinerates waste and produces energy for district heating, providing thermal energy, reducing strain on the electricity sector and preventing the need for landfill with concomitant methane emissions; at the same time it is the biggest single emitter of greenhouse gases in Trondheim.

The decision-making in climate transition can often result in conflict of interests, policy dilemmas and needs to prioritise. Here are some examples we brought up in the municipal energy and climate plan:

Trondheim is growing and we need buildings, energy production and other infrastructure. At the same time, we must take care of arable land and the natural environment for food production, carbon absorption and other natural benefits. Densification is today's practice, but how can we best safeguard health, well-being and quality of life in a denser city?
Electrification of the urban infrastructure will lead to increased demand for both energy and power. Who should get electricity? Hospitals, battery factories or large data centres? Will electrification lead to higher electricity prices and energy poverty?
Rapid restructuring of road traffic will require strict regulatory measures, such as tolls and parking restrictions. What about those who depend on a car in their everyday life? Moreover, much needed incentives for the adoption of electric vehicles can lead to rebalancing the incentive structure towards private car use and away from public transport, cycling and walking. Finding the right balance of policies that simultaneously reduce traffic while ensuring a rapid technological transition is a key challenge within the Norwegian urban context.

# Assessment of the GHG emissions reduction potential and remaining gap

The CCC Action Plan addresses what actions are needed to:

Cut 80 percent of territorial greenhouse gas emissions in 2030
a. compared to the politically adopted baseline year 2009
b. compared to the latest available baseline year (2022), as stated by NetZeroCities
Compensate for residual emissions.

The estimations show that:

For the 2009-2030 politically adopted scope 1 emission reduction target, the existing and fulfilled plans can potentially cut 42 percent of territorial emissions, while the additional actions in this CCC Action Plan (AP) can lead to a total 88 percent emission reduction (Fig. A1a, Table A-2.3a).
For the NZC climate neutrality scenario (scope 1-3, 2022-2030), the Trondheim model shows that existing plans can cut 27 percent, while the CCC AP can give a total reduction of 78.5 percent (Fig. A1b, Table A-2.3a).
For the NZC climate neutrality scenario (scope 1-3, 2022-2030), the NZC economic model does not differentiate between existing plans and CCC AP, but predicts a total emission reduction of 77 percent (Table A-2.3b).

The CCC AP will need to cut 38 percent and 231 thousand tons compared to 2009 and 53 percent and 286 thousand tons compared to 2022, including cuts in scope 2 and 3 (Table A-2-3a), according to the Trondheim model. Expected emission cuts from "other plans" are included in the annually revised climate budget or in a reference scenario for national policies, when they are ready for

implementation. Thus, they are not subject to double counting in the climate neutrality portfolio design (module B-2), which takes action following our baseline year 2022.

## Comparison between the Trondheim model and the NZC economic model

Overall, the Trondheim model predicts an emission reduction of 78.5 percent (Table A-2.3a), while the NZC economic model predicts 80 percent (Table A-2.3b) from 2022 to 2030 (scope 1-3).

In the transport sector, which is the sector where we need economic estimations of widely shared costs, the Trondheim model predicts a 94 percent emission reduction, including sea transport according to GPC methodology. The NZC economic model predicts a 94 percent reduction, excluding sea transport. Sea transport represents approx. 25,000 tons CO2e in the baseline scenario (Table A-1.3a). Substantial emission cuts are made in sea transport both in other plans and in the CCC AP (10,000 tons CO2e, in the portfolio 3, Sea transport in module B-2.)

In the buildings sector, the results are wider apart. The Trondheim model includes most emissions from the electricity sector in the NZC economic model (about 50,000 tons CO2e), and emissions from machinery on building sites (app. 53,000 tons CO2e), according to GPC methodology. These emissions are in the "other" sector in the NZC economic model. Corrected for this, the results from the models differ about 15 percent in the baseline scenario. Still, the main action to cut emissions in this sector is to decarbonise the district heating system by CCS from the incineration of waste (action in CCC AP), and by phasing out fossil fuels (action in other plans). Thus, the economic estimations from the NZC economic model are not valid for the presented actions in this plan.

The waste sector of the two models differ in what they include. The NZC economic model includes GHG emissions from scope 3 estimated export of waste fractions. The Trondheim model contains scope 1 emissions from methane emissions from old landfills, sewage and biological treatment of sewage. Thus, these results cannot be compared.

## Residual emissions

If the scenarios succeeds, Trondheim may cuts respectively:

up to 88 percent of GHG emissions (scope 1) compared to 2009, leaving 71,000 tons of residual emissions, according to the Trondheim model (Fig. A1a, Table A-2.3a).
up to 78.5 percent of GHG emissions (scope 1-3) compared to 2022, leaving 116,000 tons of residential emissions, according to the Trondheim model (Fig. A1b, Table A-2.3a).
up to 77 percent of GHG emissions (scope 1-3) compared to 2022, leaving 115,000 tons residual emissions, according to the NZC economic mode (Table A-2.3b).

Module B-2 provides more details on the residual emissions in 2030 and how to compensate.

# Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

Module A-3 aims to document the conclusions of a systems and stakeholder mapping aimed at identifying systemic barriers and opportunities. In conjunction with the GHG inventory and the policy baseline analysis in the previous two modules of Part A, the analysis reported here serves as a basis for designing actions that address these barriers or exploit the underutilised opportunities in Part C.

# Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

# Description of main urban systems and systemic levers

To reach the goal of climate neutrality requires system changes in society. The system is a complex combination of various systems. The future's energy system, transport, living environment, consumption patterns and labour market are affected by politics and regulation, financial and investment trends, technology and not least people's behaviour and choices.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Fig. A2: Systems and systemic levers in the NZC Theory of Change

In order to drive forward the necessary system changes, we need to get a better understanding of the urban systems and what we have in our toolbox. During the revision of the municipal energy and climate plan, we worked on a knowledge base and did an exercise by highlighting the following tools, echoing the systemic levers of the NZC Theory of Change.

# Political instruments and legal framework

This tackles the political and regulatory perspectives.

Political instruments in the form of both carrot and stick contribute to change, and the climate transition will require a good combination of these. As a planning authority, the municipality sets conditions for the city's development through spatial planning. However, current laws and regulations can also be barriers to the necessary energy and climate transition. In order to put in place a good framework for the low-emission society, the state, the regions and the cities must work together more closely.

# Finance and business models

This tackles the financial and value-creation perspectives.
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY

Who will cover the cost for climate transition, and how? The European Green Deal sets clear focus on sustainable finance, and the EU now has a taxonomy for investments in sustainable activities, which should also prevent greenwashing. Furthermore, there is a need for business models for green products and services, such as circular solutions that promote sharing and reuse. The municipality, with its great procurement power, must take the lead and set climate and environmental requirements that contribute to the necessary market transitions.

## Research and innovation

This tackles both technological and social innovation.

Trondheim is recognized as a powerhouse for research and innovation. As a lighthouse city in the EU project +CityxChange, we have contributed several ground-breaking pilots. Innovation partnerships are crucial for climate change, and the municipality has established several strategic and long-term collaborations with NTNU and SINTEF. The city will be a living laboratory and test arena for energy and climate solutions.

## Communication and awareness raising

This tackles the social and behavioural perspectives.

Good communication contributes to ensure that everyone in Trondheim makes good climate choices and prioritises sustainable and circular solutions. The municipality's annual climate survey provides knowledge about citizens' support for climate measures, as well as insight into self-reported behaviour. Through a varied selection of both digital and physical channels, we communicate with our own employees, partners and citizens to stimulate cooperation and behavioural change.

## Collaboration arena and meeting place

This tackles the institutional and organisational perspectives.

The climate transition applies to everyone, and everyone must contribute. The municipality shall stimulate participation and co-creation. We will facilitate action-creating and binding collaboration arenas and meeting places for the city's business communities, researchers, organisations and citizens. Trondheim also participates in national and international networks for exchange of experience and interaction.

In addition, the systemic lever of **Technology and infrastructure** is also crucial. especially when Trondheim Municipality and many key stakeholders (see A-3.2) are responsible for planning, building and maintenance of various types of urban infrastructure. Digitisation and artificial intelligence in rapid development can be effective enablers of climate-neutral and smart Trondheim.

## Barriers and opportunities in the Trondheim context

Here are some examples of **systemic barriers** at regulatory, financial and technological levels.

**Regulatory: lack of regulatory powers.** The probability of reaching climate neutrality by 2030 would be enhanced by either devolvement of legal mandates to the municipal level or changes to national regulation in order to create favourable local conditions for the climate and energy transition.

The current Road Traffic Act includes the power to prohibit the use of specific vehicle technology from the road network. However, this power cannot currently be used locally to create "Zero Emission Zones". After lobbying from the municipal level, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration produced a report on the subject where they concluded that devolving these powers would require changes to the law, but the national government has stated they will not follow this up in the current parliament.
Similarly, the Norwegian Planning and Building Act mentions sustainability but provides no strong legal mandate for municipalities to be able to require that developers use

emission-free construction machinery. Here there has been some progress and regulations under the Pollution Act are currently under public consultation.

At the national level the Energy Law, where the transfer of energy between buildings is limited, makes integration of local RES suboptimal and complicates the establishment of Positive Energy Neighbourhoods. The climate action with the largest single emissions reduction potential in Trondheim is CCS applied to waste incineration/district heating production. There is currently no national policy framework specifically directed at CC within this sector. State funding of CCS pilot projects has been limited to the industrial sector.

## Financial: capital investment required for certain key climate actions.

The owners of the waste-to-energy plant in Trondheim have estimated. Several hundred million euros are needed in order to implement carbon capture and storage (CCS). This project is also a good example of where climate action requires new business models and the development of large-scale policy frameworks to support these - new markets for sequestered carbon - especially for biogenic carbon, are required in order for the investment and running costs for CCS to be sustainable.
Other smaller but collectively just as important capital investments are required, for example in electric construction machinery and heavy goods vehicles, together with the concomitant charging infrastructure.
Recent changes in interest rates, the weak Norwegian currency and the generally uncertain economic outlook makes climate investments more challenging. This also applies at the level of the municipal administration itself, and the ability of the City Council to continue to prioritise climate action in the context of other pressing challenges, such as the need for health and social care provision to an ageing population.

## Technological: how to scale up more rapidly?

The technology for implementing most if not all of the climate actions required in Trondheim already exist, but there are challenges regarding the availability of these technologies and the time-scale for their uptake.

Many stakeholders within the transport sector have reported long delivery times for electric commercial vehicles. Furthermore, the current throughput of new stock into the fleet of vehicles will make it challenging to reach a 100 % emission-ree fleet by 2030.
This raises policy dilemmas around the themes of both sustainable consumption and a just transition. Policy seeking to increase the throughput of new vehicles into the fleet would in the short term increase consumption and the associated environmental footprint. Conversely, prohibiting any remaining owners of diesel vehicles from using their vehicles would from the perspective of some be tantamount to restricting their freedom of movement, independent of improvements in public transport.

## Conflict of interests: the land use challenges

National/local policy has for many years been for urban densification. However, in a fast growing city with high demand for housing this can be challenging to implement in practice, including finding space for new zero-emissions infrastructure

## Cross-cutting barriers: the example of electrification

For many if not most countries, the central and most pressing climate action is the decarbonisation of the electricity sector. Norway on the other hand has for many decades had ready access to plentiful electricity from hydropower. This ready access has however led to a large-scale reliance on electricity for heating, limiting the availability of electricity for use in the transport and other sectors that still require decarbonisation.

This barrier is particularly acute in urban areas such as Trondheim where the challenge is not so much access to energy but rather to sufficient power when electric vehicles, machinery and infrastructure all require energy simultaneously. For example, the fully emission-free bus fleet that is currently at the pre-tender planning stage may require up to 25 MW of power in areas of the city currently poorly served by the electricity grid.

Similar challenges face the harbour area, where greater access to shore power is urgently required to facilitate the electrification of shipping, in addition areas of Trondheim with a high concentration of logistics and delivery firms, where access to high-speed charging at the depot is deemed necessary by many of this stakeholders in order for a transition to electric vehicles to work.

When it comes to opportunities, here are some conditions for Trondheim to harness in order to achieve climate neutrality.

**A strong cross-party commitment to climate transition**: Trondheim has had a climate plan since 2001, through many local election cycles. In 2023, a left-orientated coalition was replaced by a coalition headed by the conservative party, Høyre. The political commitment to the climate transition remains high. The new energy and climate plan, Klimaløftene, was adopted by the City Council in April 2024 with broad support from across the political spectrum, and only one party voting against.

**Support from the local population**: Trondheim has been growing rapidly for several decades, and the population profile is young and highly skilled. The university and the surrounding commercial ecosystem attracts a high level of highly-skilled inward migration. Support for climate action is strong, with around 80 % of respondents expressing favourable views of the municipality's climate goals and the benefits these will bring to the city in the regular surveys mentioned above.

**Favourable economic conditions**: Wages levels and economic conditions in Norway are generally good by international standards, and Trondheim is no exception. Regional GDP growth has averaged around 3 % a year in the last decade, excluding 2020, providing a strong base for financing local climate action.

**Renewable energy**: Norway and Trondheim are net self-reliant on renewable electric energy, from wind and hydropower. In addition, Trondheim has a waste-to-energy plant providing district heating that covers one third of our heating needs, lowering the need for electric heating. Our transition shall put focus on energy saving and electrification.

**Digitalisation**: Trondheim, and Norway as a whole, are at the forefront of digitalization. This strong digital foundation provides significant advantages in accelerating the green transition through e.g. data-driven decision-making and smart energy management.

**Research and innovation**: The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and SINTEF, one of Europe's largest independent research organisations, are centres of excellence for climate transition. Trondheim Municipality is an active partner in many research projects and programmes, such as the Research Centre on Zero Emission Neighbourhoods in Smart Cities (FME ZEN) and the Norwegian Centre for Energy Transition Strategies (FME NTRANS).

**Growing interest from the private sector**: Trondheim Municipality has actively engaged with the private sector in the creation of both the municipal energy and climate plan and the Climate City Contract. A growing number of companies have made their own climate goals and sustainability strategies, and are keen to contribute to Trondheim's climate transition.

## Climate team within Trondheim Municipality

The Department of Climate and Environment has the coordinating responsibility for planning and reporting of the municipal energy and climate plan. First and foremost, we should empower and mobilise our own municipal organisation. During the implementation phase of the previous municipal energy and climate plan (2017), one of the focuses was to increase the working capacity in other departments. This resulted in an enlarged climate team in Trondheim Municipality. The climate team is mainly spread in the organisational areas of "environment, business and transport",
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY

"city development" and "finance". This is to be reinforced in the new organisational structure after the parliamentary governance model was introduced in June 2024.

The roles of a Norwegian municipality are the following:
Administrator of law and regulations
Service provider (education, health care, technical services &amp; more)
Society developer

Taking a look at the Trondheim Municipality's annual report 2023, we may track these relevances for climate transition in the organisation. This overview is for us to leverage influence and co-benefits.

# Key stakeholders in Trondheim's ecosystem of change

Partnership is the key to success for Trondheim's climate transition. A simple presentation was done in the Eol Trondheim delivered in January 2022. We follow the same structure and present a stakeholder mapping in the quadruple-helix manner in A-3.2. These are some of the most central stakeholders Trondheim Municipality are in contact/collaboration with for the time being. This list does not include an extensive list of private companies, the engagement of which is to be planned under the working title "Trondheim Green Deal". In addition, we shall explore initiatives with "financial institutions" for more bankable projects as part of the investment plan.

In addition to those in the local system, Trondheim should also strengthen collaboration with the national government and other cities in Norway and in the Cities Mission. The Ministry of Local

Government and Regional Development (KDD) is the national contact point for the Cities Mission. The Norwegian mission cities, Oslo, Stavanger and Trondheim, have had regular dialog meetings since August 2022. This cooperation is now strengthened with the involvement of DOGA, who has got the assignment from KDD to come up with concrete suggestions about a platform for municipalities. NetZeroCities has been resourceful to provide various types of exchange between mission cities.

Below is a map of stakeholders organised in the quadruple-helix manner. These are relevant actors Trondheim Municipality are in contact/collaboration with for climate transition.

# Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B represents the core of the CCC Action Plan, shaped by local authorities, local businesses, and stakeholders, comprising the most essential elements: scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, action portfolios and indicators for monitoring, evaluation, and learning.

## Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Module B-1 first describes and contextualises the impact pathways, summarising their relationship with key priorities and strategic interventions and with the analysis developed in Part A and then list the impact pathways, selected from or inspired by the NetZeroCities Theory of Change, including early and late outcomes (strategic objectives) and levers of change structured along the fields of action.

## Description of impact pathways

### Impact pathways for Trondheim's climate transition

Five focus areas are identified, covering the main emission domains. These are also important aspects of the citizen's everyday life and the strategic impact pathways for systemic changes the municipality and other key stakeholders are to co-create.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Fig. B1: Five focus areas in Trondheim's climate transition

### Energy systems

**Commitment:** We will phase out fossil fuels, increase local renewable energy production, and utilise energy resources smartly and flexibly.

### Where are we and why do we focus on energy systems?

The climate transition requires a swift shift from fossil fuel to renewable and emission-free energy sources. Norway is self-reliant on electricity, almost exclusively from renewable sources, but the demand for electricity will increase considerably, in order to phase out fossil fuels from various sectors, for example transport and industries. In Trondheim, the demand for electricity may rise up to 15 percent from 2022 to 2030, in order to phase out fossil fuels for actions in this action plan. Thus, access to sufficient electricity and grid capacity will be crucial for success. However, it takes
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
1

time to get new centralised power production and transmission capacity in place, and the facilities are often land-intensive and can lead to loss of nature or cropland. We must therefore create an integrated, efficient and flexible energy system that limits the demand for electricity and ensures enough renewable energy, with low use of nature and material resources, thus limiting indirect GHG emissions, costs and more - in line with Klimaløftene.

## What about energy poverty?

Norway is self-sufficient in renewable electricity from hydropower and has had cheap energy for decades. Thus, "energy poverty" was a foreign concept until the European energy crisis in 2022. Unfortunately, "energy savings" has been a more or less foreign concept too - and in combination with the extremely strong Norwegian welfare system, the result is full coverage of the energy bill for households on welfare regardless of energy use. Actually, from 2022 all households are financially supported when the energy price exceeds a (low) threshold level. Still, there are support schemes for upgrading homes, but you need to own your housing and cover most of the expenditures. This combination of welfare and support schemes are problematic:

The welfare and financial support on energy bills give most households little or no incentive to save energy.
The support scheme for home upgrades favours high income households that generally have large, but energy efficient homes.
Self-sustained low income households that need to save energy and improve their housing quality are unable: The support schemes for home upgrades are unavailable to them, since they generally rent their home and can't cover the remaining bill for the home upgrade.

Trondheim needs to cooperate with other cities to address the shortcomings of the current situation at a national level.

## How can we develop our energy systems sustainably?

We need to save energy individually and as a society, and to ensure just energy transition.
We need to reduce the use of electricity for heating purposes.
We must map our energy systems and establish smart and flexible mechanisms in order to control and store energy, thus distributing the electrical power demand through the day and year. This will limit the need for more grid capacity, thus reducing the cost, material resources and nature degradation.
We must produce more renewable energy - preferably in already developed areas.

## What are the systemic levers in Trondheim's energy transition?

Technology and infrastructure: We must phase out fossil fuels from our district heating, realise CCS from waste incineration (the backbone of our district heating), establish infrastructure to store surplus heat and energy, strengthen our distribution grid and build more renewable energy in urban areas.
Governance and policy: We need a national framework that encourages and enables local energy sharing/markets, and that speeds up the pace on e.g. solar energy. Then, we need to implement it locally.
Social innovation: Test out local energy consultants from the grid owner Tensio, to distribute the power demand over time. Inform citizens on energy-smart solutions and test out how we can speed up the establishment of local energy production and flexibility.
Democracy: Increase the understanding and engagement on energy and energy-related topics, like CCS, through communication.
Finance and funding: We need to establish a business model that makes CCS from waste incineration economically feasible. This might also be a matter of national governance.
Learning and capabilities: We must map our energy systems to fully integrate energy in the planning of a climate neutral and energy-smart city.

Fig. B2: Energy systems and other focus areas

## How does this connect with other focus areas and desired outcomes?

The single most important action - making our district heating from waste incineration carbon neutral through CCS - is vitally important to cut emissions which could just as well be allocated to the impact pathway "waste and circular economy". In addition, both district heating and other tools and actions that save electric energy reduce the need for new electric energy, thus reducing the pressure on nature and farm lands.

Combining energy, transport and area planning more closely will reduce the cost and climate footprint from transport and other infrastructure and also put lower pressure on nature and farm lands. Making the city more condense and walkable may also lower transport costs and provide other social benefits.

Finally, the energy transition literally fuels climate action - particularly in the impact pathways "mobility and transport" and "built environment" - by providing fossil and emission free energy for vehicles, vessels, machinery, buildings and construction sites. Together, the tools listed above can help us phase out fossil fuels in a just, energy-smart and resource efficient way, securing enough renewable energy for all at a reasonable price.

## Mobility and transport

**Commitment:** We will streamline and modernise the transportation sector and make it practically emission-free.

## Why and how do we focus on mobility and transport?

Transport is still the main emission source in Trondheim, despite a 30 percent cut in this sector since 2009. Transport is thus an important key to become climate neutral - and we have the technology and solutions:

Technology: Norway and Norwegian cities are world leaders in adopting emission-free transport, from electric cars and trucks to ferries and high-speed ferries.
National governance and policy, finance and funding: The Norwegian tax exemption for electric vehicles has made Norway an early adopter and test arena for electric cars and
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY
Climate Neutrality Action Plan
3

trucks. National regulations making emission-free public transport mandatory both on sea and land take effect from 2025. Since 2023, zero emission cars and small trucks have been mandatory in public procurement.

Governance and policy: There is a national-regional-local agreement - Miljøpakken - to limit car traffic and promote walking, cycling and public transport.

# How are personal transport governed?

Through the national-regional-local agreement Byvekstavtalen ("city-growth agreement"), there is an action program Miljøpakken (see section A-2), where Trondheim and neighbouring municipalities aims for urban densification and have a goal of zero growth in car traffic, regardless of population growth. Despite strong focus on public and shared transport, walking and cycling combined with toll fees on car traffic, the traffic has increased slightly after the pandemic. Recently, the Mobility strategy for Trondheim (see section A-2) set an additional goal of reducing car transport in Trondheim by 20 percent compared to 2019 by 2030, to compensate for increasing regional transport. An upgraded tool kit to achieve this goal will be adopted through a new Traffic plan for Trondheim autumn 2024 or early 2025. It is expected that it will include toll fees on car transport to encourage behavioural change and provide funding for improved public transport services as well as infrastructure and other promotion of walking and cycling. Stronger regulations on car transport must also be expected. One important action will be implemented through national regulations on emission free public transport: The public transport services shall be improved and emission free from 2029.

Miljøpakken is in a special position: It is an existing policy with an adopted budget for 2024-2029, and thus the expected emission cuts are included in "other plans". However, since the Traffic plan for Trondheim - which will contain the actual actions to reach these goals - is yet not adopted, personal transport and regulation on car transport is listed in the impact pathway below. Miljøpakken is also mentioned as a portfolio, but no actions are included as they are under revision (and are considered an "existing policy", ref. module A-2). Key indicators are included in module B-3. The adopted cost framework and cost allocation between stakeholders is provided in table 7 in the investment plan. Miljøpakken's special position indicates that we will need to pay special attention to the coming action plan and its results on green personal transport.

# What are the most important remaining challenges and opportunities?

We now have three challenges to reduce road transport and cut practically all emissions:

Reduce car and truck transport by logistics optimization.
Make the shift to emission free transport go even faster towards 2030.
Make enough power available for electrification.

In Norway, we have a one-sided focus on a faster technology transition. This has a high cost that might create or reinforce social inequalities, and although it cuts direct GHG emissions in Norway, it requires non-renewable resources and generates indirect GHG emissions elsewhere during manufacturing. Thus, it is not ecologically, socially or economically sustainable. On the other hand, reducing the road transport will make the shift in technology less demanding, by covering the need for transport with fewer vehicles and less energy. Reducing the amount of transport in combination with a swift technology shift is in line with our targets in Klimaløftene - consuming less energy, materials and area in a fair climate transition.

# How can we reduce emissions from transport, while still meeting our needs for transport?

Governance and policy: To manage and limit road transport as a whole, the multi-level governance of Miljøpakken needs to address both personal transport and goods and utility transport. Miljøpakken should aim for local GHG emission targets.
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Governance and policy: Challenge national regulations, in order to adopt a zero-emission zone. Next, announce a zero emission zone for goods and utility transport a few years before implementation, to promote investments in streamlined zero emission transport.
Technology and infrastructure: Find solutions and make infrastructure to support zero emission vehicles, and to streamline goods and utility transport, preferably through Miljøpakken.
Social innovation: Make active, public and shared transport the default and preferred option.
Social innovation: Promote a healthy and good lifestyle with less travel and consumption.
Democracy and participation: Engage citizens and local businesses in initiatives to test and implement sustainable transport solutions.
Finance and funding: Upscale emission-free and affordable public transport, and infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists through Miljøpakken. Subsidise shared personal transport as well as infrastructure for emission-free and streamlined goods and utility transport through e.g. Miljøpakken as well as other local, regional and national funding.
Learning and capabilities: Develop better practices through cooperation with research and development, and exchange best practice with other cities.

## What about sea transport?

Sea transport is mostly a technical issue, and we have come far with hybrid public ferries from 2019. There is also available shore power for the Norwegian coastal route Kystruten. Remaining challenges are to make fully electric ferries and speed ferries, and the use of shore power and battery operation mandatory: Shore power must be made available for large cruise ships. This is mainly a question about infrastructure, (national) governance and funding. Infrastructure is the main local responsibility and the work is currently in progress. Trondheim havn - the local harbour - will address how to make more vessels able to use shore power. Trondheim municipality will continue to address the need for national regulations and financial support for new technology in vessels. Other potential contributors for reducing emission from sea transport towards 2030 are increased use of other fossil- or emission free fuels, energy saving technologies, technologies for carbon capture onboard vessels etc. From 2024 the Norwegian government has enforced a turnover requirement requiring a 6 % biofuel share added to the fossil marine fuel. The biofuel has to comply with sustainability criteria. It is also expected that the stricter environmental international governance and regulations (i.e. IMO, FuelEU Maritime etc) will contribute to reducing emissions from sea transport.

Fig. B3: Mobility and transport and other focus areas

## How does this connect with other focus areas and desired outcomes?

Our goal to reduce car transport by 20 percent is combined with urban densification and improved infrastructure for public transport, walking and cycling. This makes the city more accessible, healthy and fair for everyone, while also protecting nature and farm land from urban sprawl in accordance with the impact pathway “viable nature”.

Reducing car transport in favour of public and shared transport, combined with optimising truck transport will also save energy and materials, in line with the impact pathways “energy systems” and “waste and circular economy”. However, the demand for electrical energy and effect will increase and should ideally be met by increased energy efficiency in the built environment. More reuse of building materials in the pathway “built environment” will contribute to reducing heavy duty transport.

In sum, co-benefits from this impact pathway include social benefits like increased accessibility for all, health benefits from active transport, improved traffic safety, preservation of nature and farmland, as well as reduced congestion, air and noise pollution.

## Built environment

**Commitment:** We will develop buildings and infrastructure for a climate-resilient, emission-free, and circular future.

### Why do we focus on the built environment?

The building and construction sector in Trondheim is responsible for:

direct emissions from both construction and transport.
indirect emissions from material and energy use.

Our goal is to make this sector virtually emission-free, circular, energy-efficient and climate-resilient. We will take care of existing buildings and facilities, upgrade them sustainably and use them flexibly. When new construction is necessary, buildings and structures shall be designed for longevity, reuse, and a changing climate, and built with a low carbon footprint.
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# Where are we and where are we going?

Along with Oslo, Trondheim is already requesting fossil and emission-free building and construction sites in our own projects. Practically all ongoing projects in 2023 were fossil free and most sites used at least some emission-free machinery. Our goal is that all municipal building and construction sites will be emission-free by 2025, while all sites city wide should reach this goal by 2030. This will require revising national regulations.
Major municipal building projects must present climate budgets and cut at least 40 percent of their carbon footprint during the expected lifespan, compared to reference buildings representing national regulations. Our projects are ready for green loans. Our goal is to make the building and construction sector city wide more circular and resource efficient, by seeking to preserve, restore and upgrade buildings and constructions, or reuse building materials. Upcoming work on circularity in the built environment is covered in the impact pathway "waste and circular economy".
The municipality's own net energy consumption shall be reduced by three percent annually, through upgrading energy systems, buildings and infrastructure, combined with energy production and storing in our buildings and infrastructure. This is an existing policy and not described further here.

# How can we cut emissions and increase circularity further?

Technology and infrastructure: Maintain and upgrade existing buildings, and use them more flexibly/ for more purposes.
Governance and policy: Limit climate footprint for expected lifespan in area planning.
Social innovation: The municipality will be a driver for establishing public and commercial reuse centres and platforms for building materials, elements, furniture etc.
Democracy and participation, learning and capabilities: We will establish arenas and channels for closer dialogue with business actors and R&amp;D, to find, share and effectively implement sustainable solutions.
Finance and funding: The municipality's own projects will continue to receive financial support for emission-free, energy-smart and/or circular solutions. This support for procurement enables private actors to test and invest in green technologies and solutions.

# Fig. B4: Built environment and other focus areas

# How does this connect with other focus areas and desired outcomes?

We have already observed that our focus on emission free construction sites has put life cycle analysis of emissions, energy and material (re)use on the agenda of the actors - in line with the impact pathways "mobility and transport", "energy systems" and "waste and circular economy". Please note that fossil free transport to and from construction sites; fossil free heating in buildings and on construction sites; and reuse of building materials are addressed in these three impact pathways. This is in line with Klimaløftene - cutting direct and indirect emissions, using less materials and energy, and supporting green jobs and businesses.

Next, life cycle analysis of buildings and construction sites in combination with urban densification leads to increased focus on efficient and flexible use of buildings and infrastructure. Besides protecting local nature from urban sprawl and global nature from overuse of resources, flexible use of areas can create new and better social arenas.

Other co-benefits from this impact pathways include less waste production and better working conditions due to less noise and air pollution on construction sites.

# Waste and circular economy

Commitment: We will develop a circular city where we preserve resources and reduce our consumption.

# Why do we focus on waste and the circular economy?

If everyone consumed renewable resources as we do in Norway, we would need 3.6 Earths, according to Earth overshoot day (www.overshootday.org). Our overconsumption is among the highest in the world. At the same time, The Circularity Gap Report has concluded that Norway is only 2.4 percent circular, and therefore among the least circular countries in Europe. This is a problem because of the amount of resources we use that also lead to waste, pollution and significant environmental destruction around the world, as well as an excessively large carbon footprint.

What are we working on in Trondheim?
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Citizen involvement—activities to reduce consumption and increase knowledge about repair, and solutions for sharing, exchanging, thrifting and more.
Set up a separate collection of food waste from households.
Biogas and fertiliser from treating food waste.
Improve the collection system for separate collection of glass and metals from households.
Improve separate collection of textile waste.
Increasing reuse of reusable household waste.
Trade more reusable waste from households.
Food loss projects in municipal units.
Reducing food wastage from both households and the municipality.
Sustainable procurement for all construction projects.
A research project on reuse of load-bearing structures in municipal buildings.

# How can we reduce our consumption and carbon footprint?

**Technology and infrastructure:** Establish user-end sorting of food waste and establish a plant for post-sorting of plastic packaging and other waste fractions.
**Governance and policy:** Public procurements must focus on dialogue with the market in order to set high, yet reasonable demands for circular and shared solutions in order to lower the carbon footprint and resource intensity.
**Democracy and participation:** Involve organisations for nature and reduced consumption in our work to engage the citizens on these topics. Educate children on topics related to the waste hierarchy and circular economy.
**Social innovation:** Public and private actors should offer - and consumers use - circular solutions where we share, borrow and fix things to make the most out of our common resources. For instance, we are planning to establish a marketplace for used building materials for private and public actors.
**Finance and funding:** Waste treatment is financed by the waste owner, who must expect increasing costs on residual waste. Public procurement will help create and support circular solutions markets. Applying for various fundings (Inter regional, national, regional, from research organisations, EU, from organisations and more) will be necessary to be able to do research, test and work together.
**Learning and capabilities:** We will explore how we can gain resources and workplaces efficiently within a circular economy. Amongst others we will conduct close and active collaboration with the university and institute sector, startups, innovation hubs and industries, to drive forward new circular business models.

Fig. B6: Waste and circular economy and other focus areas

## How does this connect with other focus areas and desired outcomes?

The focus on waste reduction and circular solutions is particularly strong in the municipality's work on construction sites, due to the extreme amounts of materials used in this sector. Please note that this portfolio of actions is addressed here, and not under "the built environment".

In contrast, the efforts to make the waste treatment climate positive, are handled in the impact pathway "energy systems". This is because the main action is to implement CCS at the waste incineration plant, which is the backbone of Trondheims district heating system.

All transport of household waste will be fossil free by 2025 in line with the impact pathway "mobility and transport". This policy is implemented through the current waste plan (module A-2).

Reducing residual waste and promoting reuse, repair and other circular solutions is in line with Klimalaftene, The Action Program for Sustainable Value Creation, The Waste Plan and EUs Waste Framework Directive: We need to follow the waste management hierarchy and focus on reducing our consumption and reuse and repair our stuff in order to stop wasting resources. This cuts our climate and nature footprint, in line with our impact pathway "viable nature". Furthermore, it creates social benefits, by lowering the social pressure on consumers, as well as creating social arenas and jobs through sharing, fixing and repairing.

## Viable nature

**Commitment:** We will preserve and restore nature and its resources, make it resilient to climate change, and increase the overall carbon stocks.

## Why do we focus on a viable nature?

Land and nature are limited resources, and how we use them affects both greenhouse gas emissions and their absorption. Building on our nature is like cutting the branch we're sitting on: it weakens both biodiversity and the ecosystem services we depend on, such as clean air, food, water, and other natural resources, as well as the absorption of greenhouse gases and flood and

erosion control (Fig. B7). Preserving nature is therefore crucial to how climate-resilient our society can become.

# Where are we - how viable is our nature?

Globally, in addition to nature loss and degradation caused by land use changes, our nature and environment is threatened by global warming, pollution and overuse of resources in what is known as the nature and climate crisis.
Locally, we still lose, or destroy, nature and farmland bit by bit every year. Land use changes are the main cause of biodiversity loss. When we develop infrastructure on carbon-rich areas such as forests, wetlands, and farmland, the uptake of greenhouse gases stops and the existing stores are released to the atmosphere. We are also losing red listed ecosystems and habitat types: For instance, about half of Trondheim's ravines are already lost, but the filling, levelling and urbanisation persists.
Huge parts of the harbour had to be cleaned due to littering and pollution in the project Renere havn (2011-2016).
Trondheim's urban forest Bymarka has historically been cut clear of trees due to overuse of this resource. It is now reforested, but partly with monocultures with limited biodiversity.
Norway and Trondheim have now, to a large extent, out-sourced the overuse of resources to other parts of the world: According to Earth overshoot day (www.overshootday.org) the world's annual production of renewable resources in 2024 is depleted by August 1. It would be depleted on April 12, if the world's population used resources like Norwegians do.

Global warming, land-use changes, pollution and overuse of resources lead to what is collectively known as the nature and climate crisis, acknowledging these crises must be addressed together.

# How can we address the nature and climate crisis collectively in Trondheim?

Governance and policy: We must make nature, farmland and area neutrality a key priority in our area planning. We will follow up our municipal plans on biodiversity, agriculture and climate adaptation, for example by mapping land use, assessing carbon stores and identifying areas with potential for nature restoration.
Democracy and participation: Involve organisations for nature, agriculture and reduced consumption in our work to engage the citizens on these topics.
Social innovation: Raise awareness on the importance of a viable nature and farmlands locally through e.g. restoration of nature and urban farming. Raise awareness on the global climate, nature and resource footprint of our consumption, for sustainable consumption.
Finance and funding: We need to show the real cost of building on farmland and in nature. In addition, we need to raise (more) public and private funding to restore nature and decarbonize the agricultural sector.
Learning and capabilities: Trondheim aims to become a regional resource centre for restoration of nature and sustainable agriculture.

These actions will help implement key elements like area neutrality, increased carbon storage and climate resilience in Trondheim as stated in Klimaløftene.

# How does this connect with other focus areas and desired outcomes?

To combat the nature and climate crisis and maintain a range of crucially important ecosystem services (Fig. B7) for the future, we must make preservation of nature and farm lands the core of our area, energy and transport planning locally. Our impact pathways on "energy systems" and "mobility and transport" addresses this.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Furthermore, we must radically reduce our overconsumption of natural resources to limit our carbon and nature footprint and make our contribution to stop the loss of nature and biodiversity globally. Our impact pathway "waste and circular economy" focuses on this. It also includes actions to reduce overconsumption in the impact pathway "the built environment".

Preserving nature is very important for a just transition locally and globally, due to ecosystem services ranging from clean air, food, water and energy for all; to resources, energy, inspiration and knowledge that generates jobs and businesses.

|   |  0: Involve and engage
★ Trondheim Green Life
★ Trondheim Green Deal
★ National Cities Mission Platform | We aim to involve and engage:
• Citizens in cooperation with NGOs and research actors under the label “Trondheim Green Life”.
• Business and research actors under the label “Trondheim Green Deal”.
• National and regional authorities, as well as other cities, through the national cities mission platform, which is currently developing.  |
|  Energy systems | 0: Involve and engage | Information campaigns to engage citizens and businesses in the energy transition - communicating best practice on how to improve the energy efficiency and flexibility and/or install solar panels in homes. Includes households of different income levels, businesses of various sizes, etc. Address a just and climate-friendly energy transition in collaboration with regional and national authorities, through the national cities mission platform. See “Cross-sectoral actions”.  |
|   |  1: Energy analysis
★ Energy analysis | In order to integrate and develop our electric and thermal energy grids in an efficient and functional way, we will map our energy systems. Digital maps of the current situation will constitute the baseline for scenarios that will help decision making in urban planning, energy solutions in new and existing buildings, locations for charging stations, and more.  |
|   |  2: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from waste- incineration
★ Pilot City programme on CCS
★ E2.2: CCS from waste incineration | Capture and storage of CO₂ from incineration of waste from both fossil and biogenic origin, represents both an emission cut, and a carbon sink. Trondheim municipality cooperates with the plant-owner Statkraft Varme, to develop a feasible business model and plan for implementation and public acceptance.  |
|   |  3: Phase out fossil fuels in industry and at construction sites:
★ In Rockwool facility
★ In small and medium sized industries
★ In heating of buildings and construction sites | We need to phase out fossil fuels in a Rockwool facility and some small and medium sized industries and to substitute gas for heating in some buildings and construction sites. Availability of electric power is crucial, but also utilisation of waste heat, local power production and flexibility solutions.  |
|   |  4: Upgrades of hydropower plants and in the electricity grid
★ Upgrades of hydropower plants
★ Upgrades in the electricity grid | Upgrade our hydropower plants and gradually increase the local grid capacity to 132 kV. Establish a new 420 kV transformer in the transmission grid.  |

★ T2.1 / 2.2: Improved logistics for goods transport
★ T2.3 / 2.4: Zero emission vans (procurement and infrastructure) | The municipality aims to:
• Make goods and utility transport more efficient.
• Use public procurements in a predictable and fair way, to promote greener and more efficient transport.
• Give practical and economic incentives in favour of zero emission transport.
• Support implementation of infrastructure for zero emission fuel.
• Use zero-emission zones, and similar regulations, in a predictable and fair way, to promote green and efficient transport, if the national authorities will allow it.
• Phase out all of the municipality’s own light and heavy vehicles running on fossil fuels.  |
|   |  2: Zero-emission zone
★ T3.1: Zero emission zone for passenger cars
★ T3.2 / 3.3 / 3.4: Zero emission zone for vans, heavy vehicles and buses | To speed up the energy transition in transport, we might need strong regulations like a city-wide zero-emission zone (ZEZ). Strong regulations like ZEZ must be announced a few years before implementation to promote behavioural change and investments in emission free vehicles. The four largest cities in Norway have requested national authorities for permission to implement ZEZ in order to limit GHG emissions.  |

Still, electric cars entered the market properly from about 2011: There is a considerable network of charging infrastructure, and a large market for used electric cars. Thus, democratic and participatory actions building on our Pilot City programme on CCS (see “Energy systems”, portfolio 2) will be taken to explore how the energy transition of cars can gain even more traction, while still reducing overall car traffic.  |

Grid capacity is an issue that is linked to governance regulation about grid security (n-1).
Stronger energy infrastructure will be needed - and there is work in progress from both national and local authorities.
The signal from several local transport actors is that they will make this transition, if: it is enforced by equal regulation for all actors; announced a few years in advance; there is sufficient energy infrastructure; and available emission free vehicles in the market. Local and national benefits must also be maintained.  |

# Strategy for residual emissions

## Strategy for residual emissions

### Where does the residual emissions stem from?

The residual emissions are hard to abate emissions from (Fig. B8, Tables A-2.3a and A-2.3b):

**Buildings:**
**District heating**: Residual emissions after implementing CCS. The expected efficiency to remove CO2 is close to 90 percent.
**Local heating**: The residual emissions here are primarily methane and nitrous oxide from the burning of wood. Wood stoves are a small but traditional part of the energy system in Trondheim, and removal of this part of the energy system would be extremely unpopular and therefore difficult to achieve, while achieving marginal emissions reduction and most likely placing more strain on the electricity sector.
**Electricity**: Due to the very low emission factor from renewable wind and hydropower, building renovations are not particularly cost effective and are also quite resource intensive. Thus, it is not in focus in this CCC AP, but there are some national efforts in existing plans/ongoing work.

**Transport**: There will be some residual emissions from thoroughfare road transport. In addition, the action plan envisages the widespread implementation of shore power for passenger and commercial shipping: This will allow significant reductions in direct emissions from ships both in port and on their approach to and from the harbour, given the availability of batteries onboard. However, it is considered unlikely that all shipping will be able to use this technology by 2030, hence the residual emissions for sea transport.

**Waste and sewage**: Wastewater from Trondheim is currently emitted to the Trondheim fjord after treatment. Given the size of this body of water these emissions are considered to have minimal impact on the fjord ecosystem. Currently, a fair amount of biological material is converted into methane in the fjord. Upgrading to a more advanced treatment method, which would reduce biological material in the wastewater, is not possible without substantial investment that is not currently under consideration.

**Industry / IPPU**: The action plan is based on an aggressive scenario for reducing emissions from energy use within the industrial section. Much of the residual emissions in 2030 will be from hard-to-abate industrial processes.

**Agriculture / AFOLU**: The emissions from agriculture in the residuals inventory are from three main sources: methane emissions from livestock, emissions from fertiliser stocks, and the emissions from the spread of manure and other farming practices in agricultural fields. A comprehensive analysis carried out by Norwegian Institute for Bioeconomy Research in 2020 concluded that significant reductions from this sector would be extremely difficult to achieve without a radical restructuring of the farming sector within Trondheim.

# Compensation by CCS from incineration of waste from biological origin

Trondheim plans to compensate for these emissions - in the short term - by CCS from waste incineration of household waste from all of Mid-Norway. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) makes it possible to capture the carbon from flue gas and store it for the foreseeable future in geologically stable formations several kilometres below the seabed. For our part, it is a goal to capture CO2 from the waste-to-energy plant in Trondheim. This will give us emission-free incineration of the residual waste we cannot recycle, and the surplus heat from this will provide the city with virtually emission-free district heating that covers 30 percent of the city's heating needs. The technology has been tested and similar plans are made in Oslo. There is ongoing work on national level to establish the offshore facilities for the actual CO2-storage by 2025 - the "Longship" project (see the government's information on this here).

Emission figures show that CCS at the incineration plant can contribute to:

An emission reduction of 90 500 tons CO2e
130 000 tons CO2e of negative emissions, which we use to compensate for residual emissions

The emission reductions stem from the incineration of waste with fossil origins, such as plastic and other oil products. These are emissions that human activity adds to the natural carbon cycle, and which contribute to climate change.

# What is negative emissions and how can it compensate for other emissions?

Negative emissions occur through the capture and storage of CO2 from the incineration of biogenic waste, such as wood. Biogenic waste makes up about 60 percent of the waste that is incinerated. CO2 from biogenic sources is part of the natural carbon cycle and therefore does not contribute to climate change in the same way as emissions from fossil sources. The emissions are therefore not counted in the emissions accounts - until we capture and remove them from the natural cycle. Then we get negative emissions, which can thus compensate for residual emissions from other sources.

It is still most important to cut emissions: According to the UN, we must cut almost all emissions by 2050 and capture biogenic CO2 on a large scale to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

# How about natural absorption of greenhouse gases?

Forests and other vegetation bind and store CO2 from the air through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a prerequisite for life on Earth, and a key part of the carbon cycle.

Over time, a lot of carbon is deposited in the soil. However, by 2030 we will not have time to strengthen the natural carbon stores significantly. We can therefore not rely on natural carbon uptake to compensate for residual emissions by 2030, but it is of course important to plan and implement measures that will strengthen the natural carbon stores in the longer term. In the action plan, we describe that we will start with assessing the nature restoration potential and aim for area-neutral government of land use combined with projects to restore nature in line with the UN's biodiversity framework. The work starts now, but the results in form of increasing carbon sinks will not come this decade, but later.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Fig. B9: The carbon cycles

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

The climate crisis arises when we remove nature and add fossil carbon to the carbon cycle.

# Why are natural carbon stores so important?

The climate and nature crises must be solved together: Globally, there is three times more greenhouse gas in the soil than in the atmosphere. To slow down climate change, we must therefore stop the degradation and destruction of nature: Not only does the forest and the possibility of binding and storing CO2 disappear, but when the forest and vegetation die, the carbon stores in the soil are also gradually released into the atmosphere (Fig. B9). Natural habitats such as forests and bogs have larger carbon stores than other natural habitats, and are therefore particularly important to take care of.

Nature is also very well adapted to the stable climate we have had since the last ice age. When we add fossil greenhouse gases, we change the climate faster than nature can adapt. This makes nature's carbon stores more vulnerable and can lead to them not storing, but releasing, CO2. We

must therefore take care of and strengthen nature and agricultural areas. This prevents emissions now and promotes natural uptake of greenhouse gases in the future. At the same time, we become more robust against climate change by maintaining biodiversity, food production and other natural resources.

To conclude, CCS will compensate for residual emissions in the short term. However, at some point, there will be physical limits to how much carbon we can store in the ground. Thus, in the long term we need to cut practically all emissions, and compensate for the residual emission by strengthening the natural carbon sinks over decades, starting now.

# Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

Module B-3 contains a selection of indicators to monitor and evaluate progress along the selected impact pathways and fields of action described in Module B-1, as well as a monitoring and evaluation plan, i.e. metadata on each indicator selected, in addition to milestones and timeline. More specifically:

Table B-3.1 is an overview table listing the indicators selected per outcome and impact including targets and evaluation points
Table B-3.2-X are metadata tables for each indicator selected

## Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL)

Trondheim Municipality has a strong basis for reporting the climate transition. The municipality has been an active participant in lobbying for and establishing the system for municipal GHG inventories managed by the Norwegian Environment Agency. In addition, the integration of the climate action plans/climate budget into the municipal budget plan provides a solid framework for reporting on both progress in the implementation of climate actions and progress towards GHG emissions and other targets. In the climate budget there is a strong focus on the "emissions gap" in the short term, in order to focus on the need for urgent climate action now, precisely in order to achieve longer term goals. Trondheim also reports annually to the CDP/ICLEI track platform. Building on the existing reporting platform will be required in order to follow-up.

Our selection of indicators for the CCC AP is supposed to be measurable and relevant for our targets and/or actions. We have chosen indicators based on data availability. We expect to collect data at least annually for most or all indicators and will primarily compare data to a 2022 baseline in our international CDP reporting and the CCC.

Where available, for example for the city-wide vehicle fleet, data will be collected more often for the reporting on climate budget twice a year. This reporting is part of the municipal economy reporting and informs the City Council on the status of the climate transition, so they can make possible adjustments to budget allocations.

Trondheim has worked in various contexts within the field of data-based learning at the city-level, for example through the projects like United for Sustainable Smart Cities. To mobilise citizens and other stakeholders, we will also consider establishing an on-line "climate barometer", similar to that published by the City of Oslo. Here, we can provide status and open data on key indicators for Trondheim's climate transition for others to be informed and engaged. This may also include indicators on environmental, social and economic co-benefits connecting to the developmental goals in Trondheimslaftet (the municipal master plan), which are not included in this CCC AP.

Trondheim's CCC shall be implemented, reported and updated in close connection with the existing management routines. In addition to the existing reporting schemes managed by the municipality, the scope of the CCC will also require that we involve other key stakeholders, both public and private, to provide status on their responsible actions. With all data available, we may perform analysis to identify internal and external gaps and challenges. Based on this analysis, Trondheim's CCC is to be updated and improved.

# Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part C “Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030” aims to outline any enabling interventions, i.e., regarding organisational setting or collaborative governance models or related to social innovations – designed to support the climate action portfolios (Module B-2) as well as aiming to achieve co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Module B-1). These interventions also address the identified opportunities, gaps and barriers identified Module A-2 and A-3.

## Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

Module C-1 details the city’s governance innovations for achieving climate neutrality by 2030, describing innovations in institutional design, in leadership, and in collaborative and outreach processes, whether they are internal or inter-organisational.

### Description of the participatory governance innovations

Participatory and collaborative governance is vital for success in Trondheim’s climate transition. The municipality should start from mechanisms that mobilise its own organisation for continuous improvements. Module A-3 presents a stakeholder mapping in the quadruple-helix manner. We describe governance innovation in the same structure here.

### Climate governance within Trondheim Municipality

June 2024 was a historic moment in Trondheim’s political landscape: The municipality turned into the parliamentary governance model after 187 years of chairmanship model. The municipal administration is being restructured, and it takes time for the organisation to adjust to new routines.

The Department of Climate and Environment has had the coordinating responsibility for planning and reporting of the municipal energy and climate plan. During the implementation phase of the previous plan adopted in 2017, one of the focuses was to increase the working capacity in other departments. This resulted in an enlarged climate team in the municipal organisation. Colleagues in other departments used to be referred to as “satellites”. Later we renamed it **Team Climate**. Now when Klimaløftene was adopted and the new parliamentary governance model introduced, we should also strengthen Team Climate and connect it closer to the parliamentary leadership, so that it enables climate actions to take place where the responsibilities sit.

Climate budgeting has been recognised as an important governance innovation by the ZERO Foundation as Local Climate Measure of the Year in 2021. Trondheim was one of the pioneers in this. **Climate budget** has been annually revised as part of the municipal budget since 2018. It is to be revised according to Klimaløftene, the new energy and climate plan.

### Climate governance that strengthens partnership and collaboration

#### Government

**Multi-level governance** refers to the system that supports policy and decision-making among national, regional, and local governments. When these levels of government work well together, policies are more likely to succeed, fostering development in all places, according to OECD.

The Norwegian Environmental Agency (NEA) has the main responsibility to coordinate climate transition at the national level. They publish GHG emissions inventory for all municipalities, manage the funding scheme Klimasats and offer various types of support for climate and nature efforts at local level. Here is an overview. Trondheim is an active user of the supporting programmes. We shall also enhance multi-level governance together with other major cities in Norway.

Miljøpakken is a multi-level partnership for sustainable mobility in the Trondheim Region, established in 2008. In cooperation, municipalities, county and state invest in new infrastructure to facilitate increased biking, walking and use of public transport.
Urban Growth Agreements between the state, counties and municipalities have been established to enhance the integration of land use and transport policy in order to achieve a national goal of zero growth in personal car transport. They include considerable state financing of transport projects in order to promote public transport, biking and pedestrians. The latest version for the Trondheim region covers 2023-2029.
Collaboration between major cities. The four largest Norwegian cities, Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim and Stavanger, meet regularly on climate issues for information exchange and joint actions. In recent years, they have made joint statements annually, advocating central issues in urban climate transition.
Norwegian Cities Mission Forum was initiated in light of the EU Cities Mission, with the Norwegian Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development as the national contact and DOGA as the coordinator. Other than the three Norwegian mission cities, some other major cities with mission-oriented focus were also invited to join. The goal is to strengthen multi-level governance and to bring in systemic levers needed.

## Business

Renergy Cluster. Trondheim Municipality is one of the partners that initiated Renergy, the Renewable Energy Cluster, in 2017. This innovation cluster works for sustainable value creation and the transition to a renewable society by promoting innovation, increased production and efficient use of renewable energy and related technologies. 100 companies and organisations participate, covering the whole value chain.
Klimapartnere Trøndelag. Klimapartnere is a national partnership operating in all regions, currently with more than 400 partners in both public and private sectors. Trondheim Municipality has been a partner since 2018. The climate partners participate actively, set clear goals, share knowledge - and work on climate transition in their own organisation. The efforts are anchored at top-level leadership. The partners submit yearly climate accounting.
Sustainability Networks. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) have gained momentum in the private sector through focus on ESG (environmental, social and governance). In Trondheim and Mid-Norway, surveys such as Bærekraftsbarometer (Sparebank 1 SMN) and Løypemeldingen (PwC) were made to track the development. The Chamber of Commerce in the Trondheim Region (NiT) also recently launched a network for those who are in charge of sustainability issues in their member companies.
Trondheim Green Deal. This is a proposed action in Trondheim's first CCC, in order to mobilise and seek synergies while focusing more strategically on the five focus areas for Trondheim's climate transition. Another key strategic priority is to attract climate finance and investment, with closer connection to the European Green Deal.

## Research and innovation

University City TRD3.0. In 2018 as a national pilot, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and Trondheim Municipality entered into a partnership agreement to jointly develop a University City. With a duration of eight years, it aims to develop a model for innovation and restructure the public sector through research, innovation, education.
A cooperation agreement was signed between Trondheim Municipality and SINTEF, first for 2020-2022 and later revised for 2023-2027, with the goal to strengthen systematic and long-term collaboration. "Climate, environment and circular economy" is one of the two focus areas.
Gemini-Centre "Towards 100 climate-neutral and socially innovative cities" is a collaboration between NTNU and SINTEF during 2021-2025, following up opportunities in the EU Cities Mission and Horizon Europe. An agreement on climate-neutral Trondheim was signed in 2022 between Trondheim Municipality, NTNU and SINTEF to highlight

research and innovation as enabler in Trondheim's climate transition, while the municipal energy and climate plan was about to be revised.

# $\star$  Civic society

Engaged citizens can play a critical role in making cities more transparent, accountable, and effective, and contributing innovative solutions to development challenges such as the climate transition. The participation ladder from Distriktsenteret (Fig. C1) is a well-illustrated tool for the municipalities when planning and implementing citizen involvement. The municipalities shall make an active choice about the level (five steps in the staircase: information, dialogue, collaboration, co-determination and decision) on the basis of the desired degree of participation in the various phases of the development work.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Fig. C1: The participatory ladder for citizen engagement

In 2019, the Trondheim City Council adopted "Trondheim - the co-created municipality", with the aim to put more focus on participatory mechanisms. This is also to be applied for the climate transition.

Annual climate survey. Since 2017, Trondheim Municipality has conducted an annual climate survey to get an update about the public opinions on the climate transition. The questionnaire covers the respondents' attitudes about climate change, their support for Trondheim's climate measures and the individual behaviours within certain focus area(s). The results over years are comparable and provide important insights.
Participatory citizen consultation (when making municipal plans). The revision of Klimaløftene, the municipal energy and climate plan, included many rounds of consultations with the citizens and citizen groups. The activities are still in the lower steps of the participatory ladder: information and dialogues.
Citizen panel. This mechanism will be (re)designed and tested in the Pilot Cities project connected to CCS at the waste-to-energy plant, a key action for our climate neutrality.
Trondheim Green Life. This is a proposed action in Trondheim's first CCC, in order to engage the citizens in making Trondheim a greener and more circular city. As a start, Trondheim Municipality shall publish the climate and environment status in a more citizen-friendly way. We shall then invite citizens to co-create green solutions that have an impact on their everyday life. Environmental NGOs can be good partners for this.

# Module C-2 Social Innovation Interventions

Module C-2 presents examples of actions to support and foster social innovation initiatives or non-technological innovation more broadly (e.g., in entrepreneurship, social economy, social awareness &amp; mobilisation, social cohesion and solidarity, etc).

# Description of social innovation interventions

In Trondheim's climate transition, citizens have to play an active role as change makers. Following the description about participatory governance for civic society in module C-1, we take a closer look at how the municipality may empower and enable the Trondhjemmers through various types of social innovation.

# Who are the "citizens", really?

The citizens are people of all kinds, in all stages of life, with different economic status and value systems. They are students, families with small children, elderly pensionists. They are environmental activists or can be skeptical about whether climate change is man-made. In our climate communication strategy, we start from making assessments of various target groups so that we can address the messages and communicate more effectively, especially if we are expecting to stimulate behaviour changes. Below is an example of such an assessment.

# Some examples of social innovation interventions

Trondheim Municipality has several good practices that drive social innovation already. Going forward, we shall seek more collaborations for outreach and synergies.

# $\star$  Transition at neighbourhood level

Neighbourhoods are often addressed as change units in urban transitions. Several projects such as +CityxChange and FME ZEN already put focus on neighbourhoods. Områdesatsing is a program in Trondheim that aims to give less well-off neighbourhoods a strategic lift. The processes are carried

out intensively in co-creation format, both to improve physical infrastructure and to enhance place identity.

**Entrepreneurship**
Trondheim has a high percentage of student population. The high intensity of research and development often results in start-ups and commercialisation. Trondheim's climate transition should make room for testing and upscaling of innovative solutions. Climathon and Ungt entrepreneurskap are some programs we are active in.

**Funding schemes for citizen actions**
Trondheim Municipality provides various funding schemes for citizens and housing associations to apply, such as urban farming and vehicle charging infrastructure. We have also tried Klimamillion and Climathon for citizens to give financial support for the citizens' own green initiatives. In addition to municipal funding, we may also look into banks and other private funding opportunities.

**Just transition**
Trondheim Municipality was a partner in the COJUST research project, which aimed to co-produce energy and climate policies with and for low-income groups in Norway. During the revision of Klimalaftene, we have also had dialogues with those who provide welfare and social support. This gave us important insight to develop effective and fair measures that have support in the population.

**Knowledge that mobilises**
Grønn barneby is a municipal program for schools and kindergartens in Trondheim, addressing sustainability, climate and public health. All municipal entities and 80 % of the private entities are certified with Green flag (eco-schools). UngKlima, inspired by and in collaboration with UngEnergi, is a project which aims to enhance the understanding of climate issues among the young generation. From youth to youth, the messages are made and spread through articles, school visits, school assignments, films and other media. With NTNU at the forefront, the tech capital of Trondheim has several venues and events that promote climate and nature through research and innovation, such as Vitenskapsmuseet, Forskningsdagene and Trondheim Skaperfest. These are all mobilising platforms for green transition.

**Public libraries as centres for sustainable lifestyle**
Libraries are already in the reuse business. In addition to books and media, libraries in Trondheim have extended their services to lending out pro tools and e-bikes for transport and organising repair workshops and toy exchanges. They have become a platform to promote sustainable lifestyle.

# Trondheim Green Life

To a larger extent, the planning and implementation of Trondheim's climate transition has to relate to our citizens' everyday life. This is how they can be empowered and enabled as change makers. In this CCC AP, we propose to launch Trondheim Green Life as the new, coordinated platform for various citizen initiatives. And below are two relevant projects this platform can built upon:

**CrAFT (Creating Actionable Futures)** is an EU-funded project for cities to become climate-neutral, beautiful and inclusive, connected to the New European Bauhaus initiative. Trondheim is a CrAFt city, and there are many good examples we can learn from our city colleagues across Europe.

**NIYF (Nature in Your Face)** is a Norwegian research project Trondheim participates in. The project aims to develop and test a methodology to stimulate transformative societal change in a co-constructive way together with citizens and stakeholders from the civil, public, and private sectors.

# Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the CCC AP above and highlight next steps and plans for refining the CCC AP as part of the Climate City Contract in future iterations.

# Plans for next CCC and CCC AP iteration

The Climate City Contract (CCC) is both an ongoing process and a "living" document. The CCC process aims to co-create new ways of working together with local, regional, and national stakeholders to reach climate neutrality in the city by 2030. A CCC contains three elements: Commitments, Action Plan (AP) and Investment Plan (IP). AP and IP have a common structure. It describes the current status, draws pathways towards climate neutrality in detail and presents enabling interventions in governance and societal innovation. The documents are extensive, but the process has helped to strengthen the anchorage and share ownership. The figure below shows a selection of milestones from this CCC Action Plan.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Selected milestones 2022-2030
Fig. O1: Selected milestones 2022-2030

The CCC is neither legally binding nor a politically adopted action plan. It is a tool for Trondheim to realise the political ambitions adopted by the City Council, in mainly the following ways:

CCC strengthens climate governance. Trondheim's CCC shall be implemented, reported and updated in close connection with the existing management routines such as the annual climate budget and CDP reporting.
CCC activates strategic partnerships. Trondheim's climate transition requires much more than what the municipality alone can manage. We are dependent on strategic partnerships that bring in each their resources and expertise. The municipality shall create enabling conditions for all stakeholders to participate and contribute.
CCC makes our portfolios of actions more investment-ready. So far, our annual climate budget only details allocations of the municipal budget. Moving forward, we shall make our climate actions more bankable, as they will be carried out by both the public and private sectors. This is to be detailed in CCC IP.

As for further iterations, we plan to update our CCC every two years, at least partially, if not completely, to highlight both breakthroughs and improvements.

# 1 Introduction

This opening section explains the city's motivation to join the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" and highlights the city's present commitments to climate action.

## Introduction

### Why the EU Cities Mission?

In November 2019, the Trondheim City Council made this declaration: "Global warming and the loss of natural diversity represent a crisis situation that will also affect the City of Trondheim. The City Council believes that only an extraordinary, rapid and joint global effort can prevent catastrophic consequences. Trondheim Municipality must take its share of the responsibility."

In the same political proposal, the following action points were adopted:

Responsibility for the municipality's climate efforts must be placed at the top leadership level.
All municipal departments must prepare their own plans that show how they will contribute to achieving the municipality's climate goals. The plans must show concrete measures and their effect.
Consideration of the climate and natural diversity must weigh heavily in all cases.
The citizens of Trondheim must be actively involved in the design and implementation of climate measures.
Trondheim Municipality is to actively exchange experiences with the business communities about green solutions.

The European Commission launched the call for the EU Mission for 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030, also known as the Cities Mission, in autumn 2021. The Cities Mission takes a cross-sectoral and demand-led approach, creating synergies between existing initiatives and basing its activities on the actual needs of cities. This approach matches well with what Trondheim needs, and the timing was good. Trondheim was about to start the revision of the municipal energy and climate plan, for the fourth version. The methodology and resources at EU level could come in useful. The City Council decided that Trondheim send in an Expression of Interest.

These were some advantages for Trondheim to join the Cities Mission:

Trondheim has the ambition to be an international front-runner in climate and environment.
Climate neutrality should be a new goal for Trondheim to aim for, which may strengthen our existing efforts in carbon capture and storage (CCS) and help explore potentials within land use, agriculture and forestry.
The participation may enhance our knowledge about climate management and improve our processes for stakeholder and citizen engagement.
We may incorporate Cities Mission in multi-level governance and be active in the development of necessary (policy) instruments for change.
Innovation has been a keyword for Trondheim. EU Cities Mission is an important platform for the institutions within research and innovation to joint force in relevant projects.

In April 2022, the European Commission announced the 112 cities selected to participate in the EU Cities Mission. The designated cities, 100 coming from all 27 EU countries and 12 coming from Horizon Europe associated countries, are receiving tailor-made advice and support from the mission platform managed by NetZeroCities to reach climate neutrality by 2030 and inspire other cities to follow suit by 2050. Three Norwegian cities were selected: Oslo, Stavanger and Trondheim.

# Trondheim's journey of climate transition

The City of Trondheim is the third largest city in Norway and the regional centre of Mid-Norway. The city was founded in 997 and has over 1000 years of history, and at the same time, it has the reputation of being the Norwegian technological capital. Trondheim aims to become a city where it is easy to live an environmentally friendly lifestyle. The city has over two decades of experience in climate governance - the first municipal climate and energy plan was adopted in 2001.

## Some highlights so far

The Norwegian Environment Agency publishes yearly statistics on direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for all municipalities. The gases covered are CO2, CH4 and N2O. Trondheim's goal is to reduce the direct GHG emissions by 80 % by 2030, compared to 2009 (the start of this statistics series). The trend shows that there has been a gradual reduction in total emissions in Trondheim during the 2010s. In 2022, the emissions are approx. 20 % lower. The main driver of this reduction has been the transport sector where a combination of local measures to limit the growth in car traffic, measures to encourage the rapid penetration of electric vehicles, and the national policy of mixing biofuels in ordinary petrol and diesel have all contributed. Other sectors have seen an increase in emissions however, specifically construction machinery and waste-to-energy facilities.

Here are some of the climate measures Trondheim has successfully implemented:

Phasing out heating oil. In 2009, direct emissions from heating in buildings in Trondheim were 46,000 tonnes CO2eq. By 2020 these had been reduced by 80 % and heating oil eliminated.
Miljøpakken - A partnership for sustainable transport in the Trondheim region. Municipalities, county and state invest together to facilitate increased biking, walking and use of public transport.
Fossil-free public transport. In 2019 a new fleet of more than 200 city buses began operation using ev-buses, regionally sourced biogas and biodiesel.
Emissions-free vehicles. The municipality uses several policy instruments to incentivise emissions free vehicles, supplementing the national policy framework.
Fossil-free municipal construction sites. The municipality uses its procurement power - an estimated market share of 10-15 % - to require fossil and emissions free building projects.

Trondheim Municipality has several good practices in climate management:

The municipal energy and climate plan adopted in 2017 was pointed out as the focal environmental aspect of the ISO 14001 certification. The annual revision has resulted in improvements of management routines.
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY
Climate Neutrality Commitments

Since 2018, one year after Oslo, the climate budget has been a dedicated chapter in the annual budget plan of Trondheim Municipality. The status of climate measures is reported three times a year.
Two years in a row in 2022 and 2023, Trondheim received recognition by the CDP A List, for cities that have received the highest score for their transparency and bold climate action.

Trondheim has proven to be a front-runner in innovation. Trondheim was ranked #3 as European Rising Innovative City in the European Capital of Innovation Awards 2021. Here are some examples of innovative activities within energy and climate:

Trondheim was one of the two lighthouse cities in the EU SSC1 project Positive City Exchange (2018-2023). Several ground-breaking pilots were designed and tested within areas such as positive energy districts, mobility and citizen engagement.
The Nidarvoll projects (school buildings) were ranked #3 in the national ZERO Local Climate Measure of the Year 2021.
In cooperation with Climate KIC, Trondheim hosted Climathon yearly during 2016-2022 for co-creation of climate solutions with students and young entrepreneurs.

## Moving forward towards 2030

Since Trondheim was selected as one of the 112 mission cities in spring 2022, the journey has been enriching and motivating. The mission platform NetZeroCities is both resourceful and supportive. Trondheim has adopted Climate City Contract (CCC) as the backbone for the revision of Klimaløftene, the municipal energy and climate plan 4.0, which was adopted by the City Council in April 2024. In addition to climate neutrality by 2030, Klimaløftene also broadens the perspectives and addresses the need for systemic change. Moving forward, Trondheim plans to use the Climate Transition Map (CTM) as the strategic guidance in the implementation phase. To summarise, we see that the EU Cities Mission can enable and accelerate Trondheim's climate transition in the following ways:

Structuring - the CCC and CTM mechanism may strengthen the municipal operations and management routines
Coordinating - multi-level governance: local, regional, national, EU
Empowering - both individual actions and partnership in the Trondheim ecosystem

is a special year for Trondheim, Trøndelag and Norway. In 1030, king Olaf II Haraldsson (Saint Olaf) died in a battle at Stiklestad, a historic event that made this region important in the national context. When the national 1000 years' anniversary is being celebrated in 2030, Trondheim shall mark its position as a modern-day pioneer in climate neutrality.

## 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

This section summarises the city's 2030 climate neutrality target. It also presents an overview of co-benefits that the city will experience from increasing climate action and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.

## Goal
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY

Climate Neutrality Commitments

Trondheim has been active in climate governance for over two decades. The first municipal climate and energy plan was adopted in 2001, in light of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. The plan was then revised in 2010, 2017 and 2024. Trondheim has been a signatory of the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy since 2014. The City Council renewed Trondheim Municipality's adherence in 2021, while the new version of the EU Covenant of Mayors has been revised in accordance with the "Fit for 55" package. Trondheim was hereby obliged to work towards the European climate goals, including a goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. Later on, by being one of 112 cities in the EU Cities Mission, Trondheim is committed to climate neutrality by 2030.

## Klimaløftene - Trondheim's climate pledges

In April 2024, Klimaløftene, Trondheim's fourth version of the municipal energy and climate plan, was adopted by the City Council. The name Klimaløftene can be seen as an extension of Trondheimsløftet, the municipal master plan. It can be translated as our climate pledges for the future. This new policy instrument serves as the strategic foundation for Trondheim's engagement in the EU Cities Mission. Geographically, it covers the entire administrative territory of the city.

The four climate pledges are:

Trondheim is Climate-Neutral. Together we create a zero-emission society.
Trondheim is Energy-Smart. Together we make the best use of our renewable energy resources.
Trondheim is Circular. Together we take care of the resources and create a circular city.
Trondheim is Climate-Resilient. Together we create a sustainable society.

The four climate pledges illustrated in Klimaløftet

The goals under becoming climate-neutral is detailed as the following:

The direct greenhouse gas emissions shall be cut by at least 80 percent by 2030, compared to 2009, and the city will be emission-free by 2050.
By increasing natural carbon sequestration and industrial carbon capture and storage, we shall achieve climate-neutrality by 2030 and become climate-positive by 2050.
We will reduce our share of the carbon footprint in line with the 1.5-degree target.

The GHGs covered are CO2, CH4 and N2O, as in the statistics published by the Norwegian Environment Agency. In contact and collaboration with the NEA, Trondheim and other Norwegian mission cities may push for inclusion of other GHGs in the municipal climate inventory, which is required by both CDP and the EU Cities Mission. The ETS facilities within the geographical boundary of Trondheim are included in this statistics.

## Trondheimsløftet - the overall developmental goals

Trondheimsløftet, the municipal master plan for 2020-2032 - the societal section, was adopted by the City Council in November 2022 after some intensive rounds of co-creation with citizens and
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY
Climate Neutrality Commitments
6

organisations. Various stakeholders in the city gathered and came up with recommendations relating to well-being and sustainable societal development in Trondheim.

The three societal development goals for Trondheim are:

Trondheim shall assume responsibility for a greener and more circular city
Trondheim shall be a diverse city with a strong community
The knowledge and technology capital Trondheim shall be a power centre for a better world

These three goals cover the environmental, societal and economic perspectives of sustainable development. Each goal consists further of five subgoals, one of which “Trondheim is a climate-neutral city”. Visualising these 15 subgoals in one wheel, we see more obviously the need and the possibility to seek balance and interconnectedness. Climate policies and measures shall promote co-benefits. This can contribute to increased support from local stakeholders, funders, as well as the citizens. Klimaløftene already sets focus on co-benefits such as public health and green competitiveness. We shall make continuous efforts to increase awareness and measurability of co-benefits going forward, preferably connected to other subgoals in the municipal master plan in a more systematic way.

## A coherent policy mix for change

“Existing systems are powerful. Climate crisis is a product of broken systems. We can’t solve the climate crisis by only addressing GHG emissions.” This message from the ChangeNOW Summit in Paris 2024 summarises it well. In addition to the above-mentioned municipal plans, there are many other policy instruments that are relevant and/or necessary for the acceleration of the green transition. In the CDP reporting platform, we report details on the other environment-related plans, policies and/or strategies in Trondheim. These cover aspects such as spatial planning, climate adaptation, buildings, sustainable urban mobility, biodiversity, agriculture and food, water and waste management.

The coherence of policy mix across different governance levels is also vital for climate transition in cities. The national goal in Norway for the GHG emissions reduction is 55 % by 2030 compared to the 1990 level. To avoid that different ambition levels become a hindrance, dialogues and collaborations are needed. In Norway, a Cities Mission forum has been established to facilitate this. More about the policy landscape will be described and assessed in part A2 of the CCC Action Plan.

## 3 Strategic priorities

This section summarises the strategic systemic priorities that need to be implemented in the city to become climate-neutral by 2030. The Action Plan aims to describe in detail the expected pathways and actions (Part B) and enabling interventions (Part C). The Investment Plan further details the funding and financing for the expected pathways and actions.

### Strategic priorities

Klimaløftene, the municipal energy and climate plan 2024-2030, maps out 9 focus areas for actions: (1) nature and land use, (2) energy and power, (3) mobility and transport, (4) buildings and constructions, (5) consumption and waste, (6) carbon sequestration for climate neutrality, (7) climate adaptation and civil preparedness, (8) just transition and public health, (9) business and workforce. Areas 1-5 tackles reduction of GHG emissions, energy transition, nature preservation and resource efficiency. Area 6 discusses strategies for offsetting the residual emissions. Areas 7-9 address the
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY

Climate Neutrality

Commitments

C

environmental, social and economic resilience while the city is working on mitigating and adapting climate change.

These 9 focus areas serve as the foundation of the Trondheim Climate City Contract, with a bit of restructuring. The climate actions will be categorised and elaborated in five focus areas in accordance with the NetZeroCities Theory of Change framework, while the remaining are included as either enabling factors or co-benefits.

# Five focus areas for climate transition

Five focus areas are identified, covering the main emission domains. Put together, these are strategic systemic priorities for the municipality and other key stakeholders in Trondheim's climate transition. These are also important aspects of the citizen's everyday life.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Energy systems: We will phase out fossil fuels, increase local renewable energy production, and utilise energy resources smartly and flexibly.
Mobility and transport: We will streamline and modernise the transportation sector and make it practically emission-free.
Built environment: We will develop buildings and infrastructure for a climate-resilient, emission-free, and circular future.
Waste and circular economy: We will develop a circular city where we preserve resources and reduce our consumption.
Viable nature: We will preserve and restore nature and its resources, make it resilient to climate change, and increase the overall carbon stocks.

In the implementation phase of Klimaløftene, Trondheim Municipality's climate budget is a key instrument. This is a dedicated chapter in the municipal annual budget plan. The climate budget includes a comprehensive list of climate measures which is also updated annually og status reported tertiarily. And every year, Trondheim Municipality reports to the CDP platform. The CDP reporting structure is a useful tool for climate management in cities. It covers five key steps: governance, assessment, target, planning and actions. Moving forward, we are to make adjustments to the management routines, taking CCC into consideration.

The Action Plan will detail major infrastructure projects to be expected in each focus area, such as the grid upgrades and carbon capture and storage in energy systems, renewal of public transportation services in mobility and transport, and SESAM waste management facility in waste and circular economy.

# Carbon sequestration for climate neutrality

Actions for GHG emissions reduction shall be planned in the five areas above. In order to become climate-neutra, Trondheim aims to cut the direct GHG emissions by at least 80 percent by 2030, and the rest needs to be compensated. In Trondheim, the carbon capture and storage (CCS) facility at the waste incineration plant will be essential to compensate for our remaining emissions in time. In addition, we must preserve and strengthen our natural carbon stocks in the natural and agricultural areas. Klimaløftene points out the direction, but the details are yet to be planned. In Norway, a lot of efforts are currently being made within natural inventory and land degradation neutrality. We will follow this up and make synergies between climate and nature. Trondheim Municipality does not consider purchase of carbon credits for the time being.

# Digitalisation as an enabler

Trondheim is known as the tech capital of Norway. Digitalisation is in our DNA and will to a large extent be adopted as the enabling factor for our strategic priorities. Trondheim DIGITAL is a newly established unit in Trondheim Municipality to make sure digitalisation plays a vital role in Trondheim's developmental goals. With this as a foundation, we have several on-going projects, including better use of AI.

# Strategic partnerships

To bring about accelerated change in Trondheim's climate transition, deep and coordinated involvement of (groups of) critical stakeholders is essential. The quadruple helix covering sectors of research, government, business and civil society provides a good structure for the work needed.

# Research and innovation

Trondheim Municipality has established several strategic and long-term collaborations with the Norwegian University for Science and Technology (NTNU) and the research institute SINTEF. The Knowledge Axis (Kunnskapsaksen), an urban area concentrated with many of the most prominent knowledge actors from research, education, industry and public sector, is the playground of Trondheim's climate transition. The city will be a living laboratory for students and R&amp;I institutions to develop and test energy and climate solutions.

# Multi-level governance

Cities are highly dependent on support and cooperation with other authorities at regional, national and EU level. The Urban Growth Agreement (for mobility) and the Klimasats funding scheme are some examples mentioned in the Letter of Support from the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development to the three Norwegian mission cities. The Norwegian Cities Mission Forum orchestrated by DOGA is to consolidate more structural collaborations in the near future.

# Sustainable value creation and green competitiveness

For business actors, climate transition brings both challenges and opportunities. Changes in framework conditions can lead to increased costs, but also bring the potential for new markets. We see that the EU Taxonomy (for sustainable activities) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) already started to make an impact. Trondheim wants to be a role model and a collaborative arena to increase our green competitiveness.

# Citizen engagement and just transition

Since 2017, Trondheim Municipality has conducted an annual climate survey. According to the 2023 results, 8 out of 10 believe it is important that Trondheim achieves the goal of reducing GHG emissions by 80 % by 2030. Further on, citizens should be mobilised to take a more proactive role as change makers. We must implement inclusive processes and design policy measures that avoid increasing social differences and preferably strengthen social sustainability.

# Climate finance and investment

In Norway, public procurement of goods, services and construction works amounts approx. NOK 780 billion annually. Trondheim Municipality purchases goods and services for approx. NOK 5.4 billion per year. These are the potential financial muscles in climate transition. However, the contribution from the public sector is by far from being enough. Our aim is that Trondheim's climate transition shall result in bankable projects for both public and private sectors. Sustainable finance is a central element in the European Green Deal. We will build collaboration models and raise competence through the Trondheim Green Deal.

# 4 Process and principles

This section aims to briefly describe the systemic process the city will undertake to achieve its 2030 climate neutrality target and the provisions for monitoring and joint learning, including the intentions for updating the Climate City Contract.

## Process and principles

The roles of a Norwegian municipality are mainly the following: (1) administrator of law and regulations, (2) service provider (education, health care, technical services, etc) and (3) society developer. In addition, the municipalities may promote climate and environmentally friendly solutions through public procurement. These are the starting points for Trondheim's journey for climate transition. Through joint learning sessions and exchanges with NetZeroCities and other EU Cities Mission partners, we have discovered new perspectives and methodologies which may facilitate and accelerate the systemic changes our city needs, in a broader and more inclusive way. Here is a brief description about the systemic work processes which we plan to internalise in the municipality and in our ecosystem for climate transition, moving forward towards 2030.

## Moving from fragmented projects to a portfolio with systemic impact

A portfolio includes three elements:

Actions - The core of the portfolio: interventions, activities, projects
Actors - All relevant stakeholders within the ecosystem: partners, citizens, organisations
Assets - Resources and constraints that afford what is possible: funding, regulation, infrastructure, data, capabilities

This is a useful checklist when we plan for systemic changes. In the CCC Action Plan, impact pathways and portfolio design take us from ambition goals to structured actions.

## Adopting Climate City Contract as the transition tool

A Climate City Contract (CCC) contains three elements: Commitments, Action Plan (AP) and Investment Plan (IP). It covers the entire city and requires binding cooperation with other levels of government. The Commitments must be signed by the mayor, with the support of key partners and stakeholders. AP and IP have a common structure. It describes the current status, draws pathways towards climate neutrality in detail and presents enabling interventions such as regulatory and societal innovation. The documents are extensive, but we believe the process can help to strengthen the anchorage and share ownership, so that climate transition in Trondheim can increase in scope and speed.

Climate City Contract is neither legally binding nor a politically adopted action plan. It is a tool for Trondheim to realise the political ambitions towards climate-neutrality in the following ways:

### CCC as a management tool

Trondheim Municipality has extensive experience with climate management. Implementation of the previous municipal energy and climate plan (2017) has resulted in good routines. Since 2018, the climate budget is a dedicated chapter in the municipal annual budget plan. In addition, the municipality reports annually to CDP. Now with the newly adopted Klimaløftene as a basis, Trondheim's CCC shall be implemented, reported and updated in close connection with the existing management routines.

### CCC as a tool for mobilisation

Trondheim's climate transition requires much more than what the municipality alone can manage. We need to activate a dedicated and actionable network for change - and we need the whole range
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY
Climate Neutrality
Commitments

of actors: knowledge communities, business, grassroots organisations and social innovators. They shall each bring in their experience and expertise, resources and investments. The municipality should create enabling conditions for all actors to participate and contribute.

Our existing climate management routines such as annual climate budget and CDP reporting will be continued and used as monitoring channels for CCC. Otherwise, we plan to update our CCC every two years, at least partially, if not completely, to highlight both breakthroughs and improvements.

# Establishing partnership for Bold City Vision

One Trondheim deliverable from the EU SCC1 project Positive City Exchange is the Bold City Vision Framework. The BCV framework helps cities identify and address key opportunities and actions on their way towards becoming smarter and more sustainable. This step-by-step approach can provide some guiding principles for two engagement platforms that we propose to launch, in order to activate an inclusive ecosystem for change - the core of a just climate transition.

|   | Engage | Design | Activate | Accelerate | Support  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Standardize | Evaluate | Visualize | Simulate | Finance | Share  |
|  Develop policies | Review | Revise | Plan | Budget | Analyze  |
|  Establish innovation partnerships | Make appointments | Link together | Collaborate | Prioritize | Manage the portfolio  |
|  Change the organization | Identify | Lead | Support the intrapreneurs | Make room for self-organisation | Twin  |
|  Involve the citizens | Acknowledge | Deliberate | Localize | Connect | Amplify  |
|  Develop projects | Pitch | Create prototypes | Deliver | Capitalize | Tell stories  |

More information about the framework:

# Trondheim Green Life - citizen engagement

This is to engage the citizens in the "green" developmental goal of Trondheimsløftet: Trondheim shall assume responsibility for a greener and more circular city. As a start, Trondheim Municipality should publish the climate and environment status in a more citizen-friendly way, probably with a dashboard solution. And who are the citizens, really? They are students, families with small children, elderly pensionists... actually people of all kinds. In our climate communication strategy, we start from making assessments of various target groups so that we can communicate more effectively. We should to a larger extent invite citizens to co-create green solutions that have an impact on their everyday life. Environmental NGOs can be good partners for this.

# Trondheim Green Deal - innovation partnerships with business communities

The business communities feel the pressure for change already. The EU Taxonomy and CSRD push them away from "business as usual". There are already existing initiatives that promote ESG, cluster cooperation and climate-friendly business development. The Trondheim Green Deal will seek synergies with these while focusing more strategically on the five focus areas for Trondheim's climate transition. Another key strategic priority is to attract climate finance and investment.

# 6 Statements of Support

The Governing Mayor and Vice Mayor for Environment, Business and Transport in the City of Trondheim sent out invitations to a selection of key stakeholders to express their support to Trondheim's climate transition. Below is the joint statement for all signatories:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

# Statement of support for Trondheim's climate transition

Klimaløftene, Trondheim's new energy and climate plan, was adopted by the City Council on 4 April 2024. The climate pledges we need in facing the climate and nature crisis are based on the municipal master plan Trondheimsløftet and the UN's sustainable development goals. By 2030, Trondheim shall become climate-neutral, energy-smart, circular and climate-robust.

Trondheim is one of the EU's 112 climate-neutral and smart cities. Through the EU Cities Mission, Trondheim Municipality will implement Klimaløftene and mobilise for a green transition within five focus areas:

Energy: We will phase out fossil energy, increase local renewable energy production and use energy resources smartly and flexibly.
Transport: We will make the transport sector more efficient and make it almost emission-free.
Building and construction: We will develop buildings and constructions for a climate-robust, emission-free and circular future.
Waste and circular economy: We will develop a circular city where we take care of resources.
Viable nature: We must preserve and restore nature and its resources, make it robust against climate change, and increase the overall carbon stocks.

Our organisation hereby signs this statement of support for Trondheim's climate transition and will contribute with concrete actions to realising Klimaløftene. Trondheim Municipality takes the signature to its Climate City Contract* with the European Commission.

*Climate City Contract is an agreement of intent with a work plan. It is not legally binding.

The mayor's invitation and all signed statements of support are collected in a separate attachment: "02 Local and regional statements_Trondheim CCC"

The signatories were invited to specify their own contribution. Below are the individual statements received (roughly translated):

## Aneu

We are a renewable energy company that will cut our own emissions and use our 70 years of knowledge and experience to enable emission reductions in others. Aneu will, therefore, contribute to

the energy transition through our core activities of renewable power, electrification, and energy efficiency within the limits of nature and in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We will seek sustainable solutions in all our activities. This includes contributing to the circular economy, minimising the footprint of our activities, and thus becoming climate neutral by 2030.

## AtB

AtB will contribute to the realisation of Trondheim municipality's climate pledges through concrete measures.

## Besteforeldrenes klimaaksjon, Trondheim og omegn

BKA will influence public opinion and politicians with information to help them make the right climate choices.

## Grønt kompetansesenter Mære-Skjetlein

We aim to support with the following actions:

Through the projects Bybonden og Mer trøndersk mat i offentlig måltid (City Farmer and More Trøndersk Food in Public Meals), we will contribute to increased local food production, thereby strengthening preparedness against climate change.
Through the establishment of Trøndelag's Living Soil Lab, we will contribute to increased carbon sequestration in soil.
Through the Agriculture's Climate and Energy Center, we will contribute to increased local renewable energy production.

The Green Competence Center Mære-Skjetlein is a joint development department for Mære Agricultural School and Skjetlein Upper Secondary School. Here, we develop and disseminate knowledge to succeed with climate initiatives in collaboration with residents, agriculture, and the research community.

## Naturvernforbundet i Trondheim

Naturvernforbundet in Trondheim commits to:

Disseminate information about the need for, and the benefits of, a changeover: It is not the transition away from destructive economics that is dangerous, but the steady course and "business as usual" that create the problems.
Argue for
to preserve carbon stores and carbon binding capacity in the city and the surrounding nature
safeguarding nature and enjoying nature in a city with increasing population density
change in travel habits and transport system through
Arrangements for cyclists and pedestrians
Public transport routes that give buses and trains a competitive advantage: A possible Byåstunell must be built for buses, without private car lanes!
Car-restrictive measures, including road/parking fees and car queues
To avoid road construction that increases car use
That lower material consumption will increase the quality of life for most people.

## Næringsforeningen i Trondheimsregionen

The Trondheim Region Chamber of Commerce will support the municipality's work to facilitate the business community's contribution to achieving the goals. This may include development of, and participation in, programs/projects, events, business policies, etc.

## NTNU (Norwegian University for Science and Technology)

NTNU aims to support with the following actions:
TRONDHEIM MUNICIPALITY
Climate Neutrality Commitments

NTNU has high ambitions for the environment and climate. Through research, education and innovation, we want to create knowledge for a better world. We also want to do something about our own impact on the environment.

NTNU will be a pioneering university for sustainability in its own operations. In the period leading up to 2030, NTNU will implement a number of measures to reduce its climate footprint and set up a more nature-friendly operation:

NTNU shall make a climate inventory report annually, and use this to assess target achievement and development.
By 2030, NTNU's CO2e emissions from travel must be reduced by 55% per man-year compared to 2019.
NTNU must reduce the amount of waste by 25% per man-year in relation to 2019 and at the same time increase the sorting rate for material recycling to a minimum of 65% by 2030.

## NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet

We will actively contribute to knowledge development to ensure a viable natural and cultural environment, disseminate knowledge about climate, nature, and the green shift, and facilitate knowledge experiences and recreational opportunities through the city's green lungs: Ringve Botanical Garden.

## Renergy Cluster

RENERGY will work for sustainable value creation and the transition to a renewable society by promoting innovation, increased production, and efficient use of renewable energy and related technologies. An important part of the cluster's work is to facilitate new and closer relationships between people, businesses, and organisations to challenge established structures in the energy sector. The aim is to build new collaborative constellations with technology- and sector-specific environments, as well as establish ambitious development courses with new business models, value chains, and energy solutions.

## Statens vegvesen

Actively participate in the work with the Urban Growth Agreement for the Trondheim region to facilitate that passenger transport is done by walking, cycling and public transport.

## Statkraft varme

Continue to utilise waste heat from the incineration of the city's residual waste for district heating.
90-95% of our production in Trondheim is renewable; we are converting the remaining production to fossil-free sources.
Replace all fossil-fueled vehicles with electric ones.
Work together with Trondheim municipality to explore the possibilities for carbon capture at Heimdal heating plant.

## Tensio

Tensio is responsible for the power supply in Trondheim and Trøndelag. Electricity from renewable sources is one of the most important solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and phasing out energy use from fossil and emission-based sources. In addition, through our own and partners' work with sustainability and climate change, Tensio has committed to contributing to a positive development within the above-mentioned points (1-5), and will set goals, prepare annual plans, and report on our contribution to the development.

## Trondheim Havn

Active participation in the municipality's work to achieve its climate goals. Eliminate our own emissions by switching to zero-emission vehicles or emission-free fuel. Eliminate emissions in maritime transport by continuing the development of shore power facilities and facilitating infrastructure to reduce or

eliminate emissions in the maritime sector. Facilitate efficient use of our port areas within transport, circular economy, and waste.

# Trondheim Renholdsverk

Provide citizens with competence on how they can reduce waste, increase reuse, and sort more waste for recycling through:
offering training activities on source separation at the recycling station and reuse at BrukOm in collaboration with Grønn barneby
events and stands at BrukOm and other places in Trondheim
waste prevention campaigns, including a cookbook project against food waste

Significantly increase the amount of waste that is reused each year by:
selling the full range of reusable resources (including the large amount of goods for which there is no market) at BrukOm
collaborating with external actors on the disposal of reusable waste/goods

Significantly increase the amount for recycling by:
establishing a new waste scheme for the remaining households that includes a collection scheme for food waste and glass/metal packaging at/near the residence
ensuring sufficient collection/reception schemes for textiles
contributing to the establishment of a post-sorting plant for residual waste (Sesam Resource) in/near Trondheim

Challenge state authorities to change the legislation so that circular solutions become attractive and competitive, for example:
producer responsibility schemes that fully ensure that the polluter pays
the possibility of establishing second-hand shops with support from the waste fee for the large volume of reusable waste that is unprofitable to sell

Waste treatment must at least be climate neutral by 2030 by setting requirements for:
own treatment and in agreements with external parties (first by maturing the market)
energy plants in tender competitions, for example carbon capture (first prepare the market and coordinate with several large cities)

Fossil-free transport by the end of 2025
Climate-neutral operation of own vehicle fleet
Set emission requirements in all transport agreements
