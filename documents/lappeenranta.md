# 1 Introduction

## Introduction - textual element

The city of Lappeenranta is one of the municipalities of the Finnish HINKU network and is committed to aiming for at least an 80 per cent emission reduction by 2030. In the Lappeenranta 2037 city strategy, the city has defined carbon neutrality as its goal by 2030. The carbon-neutral target applies to the entire city area and all sectors. The action plan takes into account mainly scope 1 emissions. Scope 2 emissions that are taken into account are emissions related to electricity production outside of the city area. Scope 3 emissions considered are the emissions related to waste incineration outside of the city area.

The city's SECAP was completed in 2021. The city's updated climate program for 2021-2030 was approved on 14 December 2020. However, the measures identified in the climate program are not enough to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. The size of the emissions reduction gap was determined using climate neutrality scenario tool provided by the Finnish environmental institute. The city has defined additional measures to achieve carbon neutrality that are based on the prepared sector-specific scenario tool. The content of additional measures, side benefits and the level of necessary investments were defined in cooperation with residents, experts and companies in workshops in spring 2023 and autumn 2023 and as expert work in autumn 2023.

The definition of the emission reduction gap is based on the city's 2020 emission calculation. Lappeenranta aims ambitiously to cut emissions in all sectors. Only those emissions that are impossible or difficult to cut are compensated with certified emission reductions outside the area or additional carbon sinks in the city area. However, compensations and additional carbon sinks will not exceed 20% of Lappeenranta's 2007 greenhouse gas emissions.

The share of Lappeenranta's city organization and city companies in the area's total emissions is relatively small. To achieve the goal of carbon neutrality, other regional actors, residents and companies must also be involved in emission reduction measures. The most challenging emission reduction sector for Lappeenranta is transport and mobility. In 2020, approx. 40 per cent of emissions came from traffic. In the transport sector, the city sets an example and moves to carbon-neutral modes of public transport, transport services, and logistics. With the help of service procurement, the city can have a broader influence on the emissions of transport services. Important in the transport sector, e.g. stakeholders were identified as operators, companies providing transport services, residents of the area and housing associations.

In the energy sector, the city aims to reduce emissions to nearly zero by 2030. The key to this is making the heating of buildings carbon-neutral and increasing the production of renewable electricity and the share of renewable electricity consumption. To enable a renewable energy system, paying attention to energy efficiency and the intelligent control and flexibility of energy use is essential. District heating companies in the region, companies developing renewable energy production, significant individual electricity users and residents of the region have been identified as crucial stakeholders

# 2 Work Process

## Work Process

### 1. Build a strong mandate

The city of Lappeenranta is strongly committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. The city has been a pioneer in climate action for several years. The first climate program of the city was approved as early as 2009, and the 30 % emission reduction target of this initial climate program was achieved ahead of schedule in 2015. The city joined the HINKU network in 2014, and at the same time, the emission reduction target was set at 80 % reduction by 2030.

The city's new climate program was approved in 2021, with the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. The City Strategy 2037, also approved in 2021, emphasizes sustainable urban development and carbon neutrality as one of its strategic objectives and CO2 emissions are one of the main indicators.

## LPR 2037 – SUSTAINABLE SUCCESS STORIES

Lappeenranta – Sustainable city: Lappeenranta will be carbon neutral by 2030. Clean water and air, zero waste.

In 2022, the city of Lappeenranta was approved as one of the one hundred cities in the EU's Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 network.

The climate efforts in Lappeenranta are guided by the city group's common Greenreality working committee. The working committee has members from departments and also from the city owned companies. However, the influence of the Lappeenranta city group on the emissions across the entire area is limited. Therefore, in addition to the Greenreality working committee, a wider transition team is being established to monitor and guide the city's climate efforts. The team will include representatives from local businesses, the regional council, LUT University, LAB University of Applied Sciences, as well as various organizations and associations. The transition team will meet at least twice a year.

The NetZeroCities mission team is the core team of city employees participating in the work needed for the CCC. The structure and members of the mission team can change as needed. For the successful planning and implementation of the AP and IP, the team needs wide expertise from various sectors, including financing, energy efficiency, renewable energy, sustainable transportation and nature based solutions.

The fig. 2 presents the structure of the transition team in Lappeenranta. The NetZeroCities mission team is the core team of city employees participating in the work needed for the CCC. The structure and members of the mission team can change as needed. For the successful planning and implementation of the AP and IP, the team needs wide expertise from various sectors, including financing, energy efficiency, renewable energy, sustainable transportation and nature based solutions. The mission team works continuously and actively.

For the efficient implementation of AP and IP, there will be themed working groups. The working groups will include members from the city departments, companies and NGOs. The first three working groups are: Working group 1: Built Environment, Working group 2: nature and land use and Working group 3: Transportation. The working groups have scheduled meetings several times a year.

The Greenreality working committee follows and guides the CCC work inside the city organisation, including the city owned companies. The committee has meetings once a month.

# 2. Understand the system

City of Lappeenranta has been doing emission inventories since 2015 and there has been quite clear view of the greenhouse gas emissions from the different sectors. The figure 3 presents the GHG emission development based on previous emission inventory calculations.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
CO2-emissions kt CO2e in Lappeenranta
Figure 3. Greenhouse gas emissions 2010-2020.

However, the land use and forests have been excluded in the previous emission inventories. For the NetZeroCities emission inventory we'll use the emission inventory provided by the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE). Link for the additional information: https://www.hiilineutraaliuomi.fi/en-US/Emissions_and_indicators/Municipalities_and_regions_usagebased_greenhouse_gas_emissions

The emission inventory provided by the SYKE has been modified to include also the land use and forest sectors. The data for emission inventory of the forests was gained from IBC Carbon project coordinated by Finnish Environmental Institute (SYKE). Land cover data is from the period 2015-2020 and is based on registry data or remote sensing. Forest productivity is modelled using process-based forest growth model PREBAS, developed in Helsinki University. More spesific methodology has been described in the Annex 1: Emission inventory methodology.

Emission inventory is based on the 2020 data and the year 2020 will be used as a base year for calculating the emission gap. The emission gap refers to the gap in GHG emissions between the carbon neutrality and the emission trajectory with current policies.

The biggest GHG emission source sectors were Transportation, Buildings and Agriculture, forests and land use.

The emission gap has been calculated with a climate neutrality scenario tool provided by the Finnish Environment Institute. Link: https://skenaario.hiilineutraaliuomi.fi/

The GHG emissions were 461 ktCO2e in the 2020 emission inventory. In the 2030 baseline scenario the GHG emissions are 342 ktCO2 in 2030, representing only  $24\%$  decline in the emissions. Additional actions and compensations need to cover the emission gap of that 341 kt CO2e.

# 3. Co-design a portfolio

After completing the emission inventory and calculation of the emission gap, we started the process to define the actions needed to fill in the gap to carbon neutrality. The work started by identifying the relevant stakeholders for each system. The stakeholders were invited to the workshops and take part in the planning of the action and investment plans. The work was done as a participatory process including several themed workshops. In the workshops, there were participants from various city departments, businesses, the university, and also city residents.

Additionally citizen participation has been done in the events organised by the city, ie in the Greenreality Carnival 2023.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
Figure 6. Greenreality Carnival 2023.

The main tasks in the workshops included the planning of the new possible emission reduction actions, mapping of the relevant stakeholders, understanding the barriers and recognising the co-benefits and possible negative effects.

Based on the workshop results and expert assessments, a new carbon-neutral Lappeenranta scenario was created. The 2030 carbon neutrality scenario, 2030 WAM1, shows a pathway to decrease GHG emissions by  $87\%$  by 2030. The remaining emissions will need to be offset either through additional measures or by purchasing emission offsets.

The carbon neutrality investment plan was created using both top-down and bottom-up approaches. In the bottom-up approach the implementation costs were estimated for each action in the action portfolio. The estimated costs included both the capital expenditure and operational costs (or cost reductions).

On the top-down approach the required investment level to reach emission reduction goals were estimated for each sector.

# 4. Take action

Climate change is progressing rapidly, and measures to prevent climate change are urgent. For this reason, the action program must be flexible and constantly moving forward. The most urgent actions need to be implemented quickly and additional actions planned.

The action plan and investment plan are both constantly developing plans. However, there will be formal updates done for both plans at least every second year. First update is planned for the year 2025.

Development and implementation of the actions are both constant processes. The action plan and will be integrated to the online monitoring site: https://kestavyysvahti.lappeenranta.fi/. Each action has a responsible department and a contact person(s).

The monitoring site is being updated to include also co-benefits of the actions and adding a possibility to include third party actors (outside of the city group).

The AP and IP development and implementation work is coordinated by the Mission team. The mission team reports the progress and current situation to the Greenreality working committee. The committee has members from the city departments and form the city owned companies. The committee has a meeting every month and it'll monitor and guide the work related to CCC.

The changes and updates to the AP and IP will be presented to the Transition team. Transition team will meet twice a year. After the transition team, the updates and progress reports will be presented to the city board (twice or more per year).

A-1.2: Emission factors applied

## Electricity emission factors

The emission factors are calculated both on annual and monthly levels, the latter of which is applied to calculating the emissions of heating electricity. The emission factor is, on average, larger during the heating season than during other times, which means that heating electricity has larger specific emissions than other use of electricity.

The monthly factor is calculated by allocating the annual GHG emissions of Finnish electricity production to different months in accordance with different production methods, and by dividing the monthly emission result with the electricity consumption of each month. The monthly data are taken from the statistics of Finnish Energy.

The emission factor other electricity use than heating (consumption electricity) is calculated by deducting the emissions of heating electricity, calculated with the monthly factors, from the total emissions of electricity and, similarly, the consumption of heating electricity from the total electricity consumption.

## Emission factors of fuels

The CO2 emission factors of fuels are taken from the annually updated Fuel Classification maintained by Statistics Finland. Bio-based fuels have zero carbon dioxide emissions. The factors of methane and nitrous oxide are obtained from IPCC's Emission Factor Database.

The methane and nitrous oxide emission factors of fuels are taken from IPCC's Emission Factor Database. They are separate for energy industries, manufacturing industries and other sectors, which includes housing and services. The 2006 IPCC Default is the selected emission factor option.

The carbon dioxide equivalence factors are calculated by using IPCC's Global Warming Potential (GWP) values of 2007, which are also used for national greenhouse gas inventory calculation. In a hundred-year period, the heating effect of methane is 25 times that of carbon dioxide (GWP100 = 25), and for nitrous oxide it is 298 times as large (GWP100 = 298). The GWP values of F-gases vary between 124–22,800, depending on the compound.

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

Emission inventory is based on the 2020 data and the year 2020 will be used as a base year for calculating the emission gap.

For the NetZeroCities emission inventory we'll use the emission inventory provided by the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE).

The emission inventory provided by the SYKE has been modified to include also the land use and forest sectors. The data for emission inventory of the forests was gained from IBC Carbon project coordinated by Finnish Environmental Institute (SYKE). Land cover data is from the period 2015-2020 and is based on registry data or remote sensing. Forest productivity is modelled using process-based forest growth model PREBAS, developed in Helsinki University. More specific methodology has been described in the Annex 1 : Emission inventory methodology.

The biggest GHG emission source sectors were Transportation, Buildings and Agriculture, forests and land use.

The GHG emissions were 450 ktCO2e in the 2020 emission inventory. Local renewable energy production (wind power) was used to mitigate part of the scope 2 emissions (-10 ktCO2e) from electricity use. Calculation was done by using national grid electricity emission factor. In the 2030 baseline scenario the GHG emissions are 342 ktCO2 in 2030, representing only 24 % decline in the emissions.

# A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers – textual elements

The city has encountered many barriers on it's path towards climate neutrality.

Summary of the identified barriers and plan how to lower or break the barriers:

Silos inside the city organisation. The cross-cutting Greenreality Working Committee enables participation and involvement of all city departments and companies owned by the city
Lack of resources. Lack of dedicated resources can hinder the climate work. New Greenreality Services department can provide information and assistance for other departments and city companies. Greenreality Services department also assists on finding funding or in other capacity needs. The assistance is not limited to city organisation or city companies. The Greenreality Services can help also other organisations and companies, ie. on renewable energy, energy efficiency actions or enabling new pilot projects.
Lack of information. The climate impact of many actions has been unknown. Currently information gaps are biggest on transportation, and AFOLU sectors
Multi-level governance coordination. Locally there has been successes on implementing new structures for Multi-level coordination. City is also active on national networks.
Capacity to act. The city has very limited possibilities for making major changes for private transportation and logistics. Collaboration with service providers, regional healthcare services and large companies is needed for a wider impact

# A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

The city of Lappeenranta has a multi-level participatory model for the climate neutrality actions.

First we have the Greenreality Working Group. The working group has a representation from city departments and city owned companies. The committee is very valuable for spreading the information and enabling to involve all city departments and companies owned by the city.

To include other companies and organisations, the city coordinates the Greenreality Network.

Link: https://www.greenreality.fi/en/greenreality-network

Greenreality Network is a network of the Energy and Environment sector's companies operating in South Karelia, Finland. It creates growth and new business opportunities for its members as well as the entire area. The network includes companies of the energy and environment sector, municipalities of the area as well as research and educational institutions. It is coordinated by the city of Lappeenranta.

City also coordinates the Climate Partners network.

https://www.greenreality.fi/en/yritykset-ja-yhteisot/greenreality-kumppanit/tutustu-greenreality-kumppaneihin

For the members, the network offers free assistance in assessing the initial situation of the company, for example, related to energy usage, waste, and transportation.

Climate-neutrality transition team includes members from the Greenreality Working Committee, Greenreality Network, NGOs, Universities and other organisations. The transition team is open for all residents, companies, and organisations.

Youth participation:

City coordinates the youth climate group, where youth can participate in planning the action.

Together with LUT University, city has developed UNIORI (junior university) model that enables information sharing and youth participation of all kids and students in Lappeenranta. The model is included in the curriculum of schools and reaches around 3000 students annually.

Link: https://www.uniori.fi/in-english/

City of Lappeenranta also has youth council, consisting of 31 elected 13-18 year old members, with the focus to make voice of youth heard in the decision making of the city.

City has been participating on Climate festivals that have been organised on the schools around South Karelia. The Climate Festivals is a half-day event including several themed workshops.

The city of Lappeenranta facilitates energy counselling for the residents of South-Karelia. This action is carried out as part of the work of Greenreality services and is funded by Finnish Energy Agency. The counselling is free of charge and thus enhances the accessibility of information for those who lack prerequisites for acquiring necessary information on their own.

For low barrier participation city has several participatory actions (questionnaires, polls, action planning) on different events. The organised events include ie. Greenreality carnival, Climate Café's, Zero emission traffic events etc.

The Action plan and investment plans were initially developed in workshops. The workshops were open for all. To enable wider participation, it was possible to attend also online. The workshop materials are also online on Miro-board. The participation and feedback has been open also after the workshops. For lowering the participation barrier, it was possible to participate also in English. Possibility to participate also in English will lower the barriers for non-native speakers.

# 4 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B represents the core of the Action Plan, shaped by local authorities, local businesses, and stakeholders, comprising of the most essential elements: scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, action portfolios and indicators for monitoring, evaluation and learning.

# 4.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

The impact pathways have been created in a participatory process with stakeholders in themed workshops for Transportation, Nature based solutions and Built environment. Impact pathway for the Energy systems was created together with Lappeenrannan Energia Oy and Mission team.

The more detailed Impact pathways are created for all the fields of actions separately, starting with the most urgent and important sectors. The more detailed Impact pathway framework and analysis for the Mobility and transportation was created together with LUT University, stakeholders, and residents in 2023. (The summary tables of the framework are included as an attachment to AP). The work to create more detailed and in-depth version of the Impact pathway for the Built Environment is going on in the autumn 2023. The Impact Pathways for the AFOLU/nature-based solutions depend strongly of upcoming national and EU policies. The more detailed framework will be done after these policy decisions.

The more in-depth Impact pathways for the waste and recycle economy will be done in 2024 together with stakeholders and ASKI-project, which focuses on creating and implementing recycling solutions together with residents.

|   |  List of actions | Descriptions  |
|  1. Energy systems | 1.1. Phasing out peat in the biomass power plants | The peat fuel usage on the biomass power plant will end by 2026. The biomass power plant provides about 85 % of the heat for the district heating networks in Lappeenranta.  |
|   |  1.2. Phasing out fossil fuels on heating plants | Lappeenranta has several smaller heating plants connected to either main DH grid or separate local DH grids. Main fuel on these plants has been natural gas. The use of natural gas and fuel oil will be either replaced with renewable fuels or electricity. Two separate DH grids will be connected to the main DH network.  |
|   |  1.3. District heating network efficiency improvements | Lowering of the DH network temperature reduces heat losses. Detection and prevention of the leaks will reduce  |
|   |  1.4. Seasonal heat storage | To enable the efficient utilization of new heat sources, a large district heating storage facility is being constructed  |
|   |  1.5. Utility scale solar and wind power | Several utility scale solar projects are on the planning phase and expected total of the utility scale solar is approx. from 600 MWp to 1000 MWp by 2030.  |
|  Mobility & transport | 2.1. Carbon neutral public transportation | Public transportation services provided by the city will be carbon neutral by 2030. This includes local buses, regional buses and school rides.  |
|   |  2.2. Carbon neutral transportation services and logistics | Transport and traffic related services of the city of Lappeenranta are carried out in a carbon-neutral manner  |

| --- | --- | --- |
|  Waste & circular economy | 3.1. Waste recycling rate increase
Biogas production increase | The amount of waste sent for incineration is being reduced by improving source separation and constructing a new waste sorting line where organic waste and metals are separated from dry waste.
Regional waste management company does an investment to increase biogas production and delivery capacity of the biogas to the stations.  |
|  Green infrastructure & nature based solutions | 4.1. Increase of the strictly protected land area
Restoration of forests and fields on organic soils. Raising the water level and restoring former peat production sites.
Lengthening the growth cycle of forests | One target of the EU Biodiversity strategy is to increase the amount of strictly protected land areas up to 10 % of the area. The Finnish Nature Panel has recommended that 10 % of the land areas is protected in every region. Protecting 10 % of Lappeenranta’s land areas mean 140 km2.
Organic forests act as a substantial methane source, estimated to represent net emissions of about 110 kt CO2e/a.
Carbon storages of the forests are increased by lengthening the growth cycle of the forests and thus reducing timber removal. Continuous growth is applied where suitable.  |
|  Built environment | 5.1. Energy efficiency renovations
Replacing heating oil with renewable energy on the buildings | Energy-efficient renovations are necessary for a large portion of Lappeenranta’s properties. Renovations include additional insulation, energy efficient windows and doors and also deep renovations.
The use of the natural gas and fuel oil will end in all municipally owned buildings by 2030.
City will collaborate with companies and housing associations to end the oil use on privately owned buildings. City will launch Information campaigns and provide energy advisor services to accelerate the oil phase out in the private homes.  |

## B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

In the Action Plan, the residual emissions are calculated to be 85 000 tons of CO2e in 2030, representing 18.9 % share of the baseline emissions. AFOLU sector has been an emission source in Lappeenranta. With additional actions, it is expected that AFOLU sector will be a carbon sink of 25 800 tons of CO2e by 2030. When considering also the carbon sinks from the AFOLU sector, the residual emissions would be 59 200 tons of CO2e.

The Action plan is continuously updating plan. New actions for the further emission reductions will be added and the target is to find additional interventions to cover part or all of these residual emissions.

All remaining residual emissions will be compensated with verified carbon credits or by purchasing EU ETS carbon allowances.

Lappeenrannan Energia Oy is committed to provide carbon neutral district heating by 2026. The residual emissions for the district heating has been estimated to be 3000 – 4000 tons of CO2e. These emissions will be compensated by verified carbon credits or EU ETS allowances, starting in 2027.

### Financing the compensations

To cover the compensation costs, city can direct revenue from solar farm property taxes and yearly land rents. Emission reductions and carbon sink growth are expected to continue after year 2030, reducing the amount of residual emissions. By 2035 residual emissions should be eliminated and there would not be need for additional compensations.

# 6 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for further refining the Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract.

## Plans for next CCC and Action Plan iteration – textual elements

The action plan and investment plan are both constantly developing plans. However, there will be formal updates done for both plans at least every second year. First update is planned for the year 2025.

Development and implementation of the actions are both constant processes. The action plan and will be integrated to the online monitoring site: https://kestavyysvahti.lappeenranta.fi/
Each action has a responsible department and a contact person(s).

The monitoring site is being updated to include also co-benefits of the actions and adding a possibility to include third party actors (outside of the city group).

The AP and IP development and implementation work is coordinated by the Mission team. The mission team reports the progress and current situation to the Greenreality working committee. The committee has members from the city departments and form the city owned companies. The committee has a meeting every month and it'll monitor and guide the work related to CCC.

The changes and updates to the AP and IP will be presented to the Transition team. Transition team will meet twice a year. After the transition team, the updates and progress reports will be presented to the city board (twice or more per year). The next transition team meeting will be on February 2024.

The Impact pathway frameworks will be reviewed and progressed to add coverage of actions and details.

For the next emission inventory there will be more detailed and robust calculations for the Nature based solutions.

The next comprehensive update for the Action Plan will be done in 2025.

# Emission inventory methodology, part 1: Alas model, excluding forests

# ALas model's calculation principles

The Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE) calculates the annual greenhouse gas emissions of Finnish municipalities by using the ALas model (Alueellinen Laskenta, regional calculation). ALas 1.4 – covers 309 municipalities and the years 2005–2021. The model is updated as necessary, and the most recent results are published annually. The carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, as well as F-gases, are calculated and the results are presented as carbon dioxide equivalents. With regard to carbon dioxide, bio-based fuels have zero emissions in the calculations. The energy consumption of various operations is

also calculated, in addition to the emissions.

The calculation method of the ALas model is usage-based. The region’s production-based emissions act as the starting point, but some operations that generate emissions are calculated based on consumption, regardless of their geographical area of origin. In broad terms, the calculation is similar to the basic level of GHG Protocol’s GPC standard, with agriculture, F-gases and grid losses included, but without the local air service included in the standard.

Table 1 presents the ALas 1.4 model’s emission sectors and their calculation principles. Hinku calculation (of the Towards Carbon Neutral Municipalities project) is the default calculation approach for monitoring municipal emissions. The Hinku calculation rules imply that the following aspects are excluded from municipal emissions:

fuel usage of industrial plants that are part of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS),
all industrial electricity consumption,
emissions from industrial waste treatment,
drive-through traffic of trucks, vans and buses.

Additionally, emission compensations are calculated for the municipality for any wind power produced in the region, based on the annual electricity emission factor.

In the ALas model, all results are also produced without the Hinku calculation rules. Furthermore, the emissions are allocated in the emission trading and effort sharing sectors.

Corrections with heating degree days are not used to even out the differences between different years or municipalities. The benefit allocation method is used to calculate the emissions of combined heat and power plants.

ALas 1.4 does not include the following sectors:

Air traffic
Foreign boat traffic
Ice breakers
Industrial processes
LULUCF.

# Updates to ALas 1.4

Global warming potential (GWP) multipliers of greenhouse gases were updated to the values given in the IPCC’s fifth assessment report.

Allocation of industrial emissions was changed so that also methane and nitrous oxide emissions caused by the ETS industry are left out from the Hinku emissions. Previously they were included in Hinku emissions as methane and nitrous oxide emissions are not regulated under ETS but instead they belong to the effort sharing sector.

In wastewater treatment the emissions calculation was separated to centralized and decentralized treatment as they have different emission factors. Emissions were allocated to municipalities based on the inhabitants in urban areas and dispersed settlement areas.

In the calculation of road transport emissions, the emission coefficients were specified.

# Updates to ALas 1.3

The biggest change in ALas 1.3 is related to the reporting of industrial emissions. In the previous calculations separate heating emissions of industrial buildings are reported within heating method specific emissions. However, in ALas 1.3 these emissions are included in industrial emissions. As a result, heating method specific emissions are decreased while industrial emissions are higher than before.

The change might have an effect on emissions calculated with Hinku calculation principles. This is because the emissions of separate heating methods are included in Hinku emissions while industrial emissions under emissions trading system are excluded from Hinku emissions. The same principle applies for the emissions under effort sharing sector, but it does not have such effect on Hinku emissions as industrial emissions under effort sharing sector have been included to Hinku emissions also in the previous results.

Another change was made on the allocation of emissions to emissions trading system and effort sharing sector. That is, carbon dioxide emissions of electricity and district heat generation, and industrial fuel usage are included in the emissions trading system, whereas methane and nitrous oxide emissions belong to effort sharing sector.

# Updates to ALas 1.2

The calculation of district heating emissions is changed so that the amount of residual emissions distributed across municipalities is lower. This affects especially the emissions in small municipalities.
The calculation principles of wind power compensation are changed. In ALas 1.2 municipal wind power outputs are calculated by multiplying annual wind power output in Finland by the share of municipality's wind power capacity of total capacity in Finland.

Corrections to heating degree days are made, that affect the emissions and energy usage of building-specific separate heating systems. Time series of agricultural emissions in 2005–2018 were corrected for five municipalities due to inaccuracies in the original datasets.

In Hinku calculation, territorial road traffic emissions are used for Åland due to missing data to calculate drive-through traffic.

# Updates to ALas 1.1

The updates of the ALas 1.1 that have the most significant effect on the results compared to the previous calculation (ALas 1.0 / February 2020) were made for agriculture, industry and water transport. Agricultural emissions were recalculated for the whole reference period 2005–2018, whereas previously the results were combined from different sources.

The emission calculation for industry was adjusted in ALas 1.1 so that not all emissions from the separate heating of industrial buildings are deducted from the total emissions of the effort-sharing sector, but now also from the emissions trading sector. This gives a more realistic picture of the non-heating emissions of the industry, and for several municipalities, emissions from small-scale industries included in the Hinku calculation are now better reflected. Emissions from the industry under Emissions Trading System, on the other hand, are slightly lower than in ALas 1.0.

In the calculation of waterborne traffic, the municipal allocation of emissions from boats, ferries and cargo ships was fine-tuned. The initial data for boats registered in Åland were supplemented. The calculation of ferries was comprehensively renewed on the basis of better data sources. The basic data on emissions from connecting vessels and road ferries in mainland Finland are the fuel consumption of the operators by route, and in the case of Åland, fuel consumption is estimated on the basis of ferry activity data.

The calculation of emissions from cargo ships was refined so that the size of ships now also affects the municipal allocation of emissions, instead of the number of port calls alone. Emissions decreased, especially in municipalities with small-scale, albeit busy, freight traffic. Correspondingly, ALas 1.1 allocates more emissions to larger-scale freight traffic than before.

In addition to the more significant methodological updates, small changes were made to the emission calculation of the electricity consumption and electric heating, affecting the previous years' results. Also, the consumption of heating electricity in greenhouse-intensive municipalities was estimated lower than before. Emissions from district heating decreased somewhat between 2005 and 2015 due to a revision of the calculation of the residual emissions. In the case of individual municipalities, plant-specific data adjustments were made for both district heating and industry.
The sector-specific calculation principles are presented in more detail below.

# District heating

The main data source of the district heat emission calculation is the annual district heat statistics published by Finnish Energy, which are supplemented with information from the Association of Finnish Municipalities' publication "Tietoa pienistä lämpölaitoksista" (Information on small-scale heat plants). After this, the possible residual emissions are allocated between the municipalities so that the total district heat emissions equal the district heat emissions presented in table 3.4.3 of the Statistics Finland's Energy -chart service.

The emission factors of carbon dioxide in Statistics Finland's fuel classification and methane and nitrous oxide in IPCC's Emission Factor Database (EFDB) are used for the calculation. The municipality-specific estimated district heat consumption, modelled on the basis of the region's building stock and heating demand, is also utilised for the calculations. The emissions from municipal waste incineration are allocated to the municipality where the heat that is produced from the waste is consumed. Hazardous waste is counted to have zero emissions.

The district heating statistics are used to calculate the district heat emissions for each heat producer, as well as the purchased and sold emissions, using the benefit allocation method. The net emissions are summed up for each municipality. Additionally, the emissions included in emissions trading are estimated by comparing the plants in the district heat statistics with the data from the emissions trading registry, and the production-based emissions are calculated separately.

The district heating statistics cover about 170 municipalities. The reports of small-scale heat plants by the Association of Finnish Municipalities add about 50 municipalities to the calculations. To prevent any overlap, only the municipalities in the report by the Association of Finnish Municipalities that are not included in the district heating statistics are included in the calculations. Any gaps of the time series are filled in with the previous year's results and the municipality's modelled consumption. The end results are the known emissions and energy consumption of district heating in around 220 municipalities.

According to building stock data, almost all Finnish municipalities have buildings with district heating. The combined emissions of the district heating statistics and small-scale heat plants are also smaller than the total Finnish district heat emissions calculated by Statistics Finland. The difference between emissions is divided between the municipalities where the known consumption is lower than the modelled consumption. The residual emissions are about $6 - 14\%$ of the total emissions of district heating, and the residual consumption is about $8\%$ of the total consumption.

## Oil, wood and other separate heating

The principle of the municipality-specific oil heating calculation is to divide the amount of heating oil that is annually consumed in Finland between the municipalities based on certain allocation principles. Table 7.3 in the Statistics Finland’s Energy 2022 chart service presents the light fuel oil consumption in single-family houses, linked and terraced houses, residential apartment buildings, recreational homes, service buildings, industrial buildings and agricultural buildings. These annual consumptions are distributed between the municipalities based on their oil-heated floor square meters, taking into account regional differences in heating demand. Heating demand has no effect on water heating. It is estimated that about 20 percent of heating energy is used for heating water.

With regard to residential buildings, gross floor area data corrected municipality-specifically by Statistics Finland’s, are used for the calculations. The floor areas of other building types are calculated by using the building and apartment registry (RHR) in the Population Information System, adjusted with the average national correction factors calculated from the materials of Statistics Finland, excluding agricultural buildings, the floor areas of which are taken directly from the RHR.

The municipal allocation process of wood heating is equal to the allocation process of oil heating. Quantity information of small-scale wood usage presented in table 7.3 of Statistics Finland is used, divided between the wood-heated buildings in municipalities based on the corrected building data and heating demand.

Other separate heating include natural gas, heavy fuel oil, peat and coal, the consumption and emissions of which have been calculated for municipalities by applying the same method as with the oil and wood heating calculations. Agricultural diffuse consumption and emissions from the Finnish air pollutant data system IPTJ are added to other separate heating used in agriculture. These mainly cover the usage of grain dryers.

The greenhouse gas emissions of the oil, wood and other heating fuel consumption are calculated with the emission factors presented in the fuel classification of Statistics Finland and by IPCC. A zero-emission bio-share of 0–4 percent is calculated for heating oil in 2009–2015, and only the methane and nitrous oxide emissions are taken into account with regard to wood.

The calculation does not include buildings with an unknown purpose of use and buildings that have “other” or “unknown” as their heating fuel. However, their share of the total separate heating is very small.

# Electric heating and ground source heat pumps

The municipality-specific annual consumption of heating electricity and ground source heat pumps is calculated based on building type-specific typical heat consumption from POLIREM model, weighted with heating demand and the corrected building stock data. Consumption according to POLIREM is also estimated for other uses of electricity, i.e. consumption electricity. The model’s typical consumption calculated for building volume is changed to correspond to the floor area-specific consumption with the help of the average room heights of different buildings.

The statistical electricity consumption of housing in a municipality is calculated for a residential building’s heating electricity, ground source heat pumps’ electricity demand (COP=3) and other electricity use in relation to the consumptions calculated with the help of POLIREM.

In the service and industrial sectors, the shares of electric heating, ground source heat pumps and other electricity of the sector’s total electricity consumption are estimated in a similar manner to residential buildings. However, if the consumption of heating electricity is larger when using this method than when calculated directly with POLIREM’s factors, the latter values are used. Then, other electricity consumption is the value that remains after heating electricity is deducted from the total statistical consumption. This ensures that the emissions of heating electricity will not become excessive, if the municipality has buildings that consume a great deal of electricity, but not a corresponding amount of floor area with electrical heating.

The POLIREM model does not have information on agricultural buildings. It is estimated that their typical heat consumption is $70 - 80\ \mathrm{kWh/m^2}$. The typical consumption is weighted with the heating demand of the municipalities, and the consumption of electric heating and ground source heat pumps are calculated based on the gross floor areas in the building and apartment registry (RHR).

The annual consumption of municipality-specific heating electricity is distributed over the months based on the monthly variation of local heating needs, and the emissions are calculated by using the monthly emissions factors of electricity. It is estimated that 20 percent of heating energy is used on heating household water, and the varying heating demand does not affect this.

The electricity consumption of heat pumps other than the ground source heat pumps is included in other electricity usage (Consumption electricity).

## Consumption electricity

Consumption electricity includes the use of all electricity except electric heating, the electricity consumption of the ground source heat pumps and rail transport. In addition to the electricity consumption of machines, equipment, air conditioning and lighting, consumption electricity also includes the electricity consumption of charging electric cars and other heat pumps.

The share of consumption electricity of the total energy consumption of housing is estimated based on the typical consumption values for residential houses presented in the POLIREM model. The municipality-specific usage of consumption electricity in agriculture and industry is calculated by deducting heating electricity and the electricity used by ground source heat pumps from the sector-specific total electricity consumption. Additionally, the electricity used by rail transit (passenger and local traffic) is deducted from the service sector’s other electricity usage.

Housing and agriculture have been counted together in the statistic of municipality-specific electricity consumption by Finnish Energy. First, the agricultural electricity consumption is separated from this value on a national level. Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke)’s data on agricultural electricity consumption in 2010, 2013 and 2016 are supplemented with data on the development of agricultural buildings’ floor area in the missing years.

The national annual total electricity consumption of agriculture is divided between the municipalities based on the municipality-specific total floor areas of agricultural buildings and, with a lower weighted value, based on the share of agricultural buildings with electric heating as well as local heating demand. The electricity consumption of greenhouses is taken into account separately in few municipalities.

The emissions of consumption electricity are calculated by using the national annual emission factors of electricity, taking into account the higher emissions of heating electricity compared to other electricity usage.

# Wind power

In accordance with the Hinku calculation rules, emission compensations are calculated for a municipality for wind power generated in its region. These compensations are calculated as their own emission category as negative greenhouse gas emissions. They can be considered to primarily compensate the municipality's emissions of electricity usage and, if they are compensated in full, other emissions. Utilising wind power compensation means that the national emission factor of electricity is increased correspondingly, when wind power's effect of decreasing the emissions of grid electricity has already been allocated to certain municipalities as emission compensations.

The project listing of Finnish Wind Power Association has the data on municipal capacity. The wind power production is calculated by multiplying annual wind power output in Finland by the share of municipality's wind power capacity of total capacity in Finland. The annual grid loss calculated by the Finnish average, presented in table 3.2 of the Statistics Finland's Energy chart service, is then deducted from this value. This results in an estimate of the wind electricity produced in the municipality that has ended up for consumption, which is then multiplied by the national electricity emission factor.

The amount of compensation is dependent on the installed capacity and windiness, but also, notably, on the emissions of electricity generation in Finland. When the annual emission factor of national electricity generation decreases (when calculated without wind power), the emission compensations received by the municipality for generating wind power will also decrease.

# Industry

The greenhouse gas emissions of industry include the emissions generated due to the fuel use of industrial plants. They do not include electricity and district heat production and the heating of industrial buildings. The emissions are divided into emissions trading and effort sharing sectors.

Industrial emission data (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) have been gathered from the Finnish air pollutant data system (IPTJ) where they are divided between industry and energy production by using a classification method used in international reporting of air pollutant emissions (NFR).

With regard to the emissions trading sector (ETS), electricity production's emissions, as separately estimated with the benefit allocation method, as well as municipality-specific, production-based emissions of district heating are deducted from the IPTJ-based total emissions of the sites included in both industrial and energy production, based on their NFR classification. The result of this is an estimate of the ETS emissions of industrial heating and steam production, which is then further scaled so that the total emissions of the energy sector are equal to the Finnish greenhouse gas inventory. Industrial emissions that are part of emissions trading are not included in Hinku calculation.

With regard to plants involved in emissions trading, the IPTJ data has been corrected so that the emissions of plants, which have belonged to the ETS only in part of 2005–2021, are calculated as ETS emissions during the whole period of 2005–2021. This prevents any unmerited benefits or detriments to the municipality caused by changes in the emissions trading register.
Industrial emissions excluded from emissions trading system include the heat and steam emissions of industrial plants belonging in the effort sharing sector, as calculated based on the IPTJ, as well as industrial diffuse emissions.

The diffuse emissions in IPTJ are based on the difference between the national fuel balance and the consumption of known locations. The emissions have been divided among the municipalities in relation to the surface areas of their industrial buildings that do not use district heat.

The lack of emissions of industry in the effort-sharing sector in some years does not (necessarily) mean that the municipality has no industry and industrial emissions, but instead this can be due to the calculations' technical factors or it could be related to the adequacy of initial data.

The best possible data sources have been used for industrial municipal calculations, but, simultaneously, the calculations include many assumptions that compromise their accuracy. All emission and energy consumption estimates are computational, both in the emissions trading and effort sharing sectors, and cannot be directly linked to any individual company.

## Machinery

Emissions of work machinery are calculated by dividing the national results of the TYKO model between the municipalities by using different allocation principles that depend on the machinery class. TYKO is a Finnish emission calculation model of machinery developed at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. It is used to produce the official annual emission quantities for the statistics of EU, UN and Finland. The allocation principles are taken from the Finnish Regional Emission Scenario model FRES by SYKE.

TYKO features a total of 51 machinery types, including off-road vehicles. In FRES, machinery types are divided into 13 main types: cranes, forklift trucks and industrial tractors, road graders, wheel loaders and dumper trucks, excavators, agricultural machinery, other maintenance machinery, forestry machinery, snow mobiles and ATVs, gardening machinery, diesel generators, diesel compressors and chain saws. Various allocation models, i.e. "proxies", are used to divide the emission results of these main categories between municipalities.

In total, nine different proxies have been developed to describe the conditions associated with the use of machinery in the municipalities. These are based on land use (industrial areas, fields, forests, residential areas, mines, green areas), road and street sections and their traffic numbers, as well as population data. Depending on the machinery category, one proxy or a combination of several can be used to allocate the emissions to municipalities. For example, all forestry machinery are allocated in accordance with the Forestry proxy, which means that the emissions are divided between municipalities in accordance with the categories Clc3111-3133 of CORINE Land Cover (forests, excluding national parks, and nature conservation areas), but, in comparison, 25% of excavators' emissions are allocated to industry, 25% to roads and 50% to building (population data).
The results of the 13 main types will then be further combined municipality-specifically into nine different categories; agricultural machinery, forestry machinery, construction machinery, landscaping machinery, industrial machinery, mining machinery, machinery of residential homes, road machinery, roads and road machinery, and streets. This is the most detailed level on which producing results is possible. When reporting municipal emissions, the number of categories has been cut to five: construction machinery, mining and industrial machinery, road machinery, agriculture and forestry machinery and other machinery.

## F-gases

The basis for municipality-specific emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases in 2005–2021 are the emissions of the Finnish greenhouse gas inventory reported to the EU and UNFCCC in spring 2022. For the municipality-specific calculations, the emissions of the entire country have been divided using sector-specific, applicable data or, if there is none, population figures.

In municipality-specific calculations, F-gas emissions have been divided into four different sectors – commercial refrigeration, buildings' ventilation devices (including heat pumps), the air conditioning devices of vehicles and other sources of F-gases. The emission calculations of the GHG inventory are made on the level of more than 20 different sectors, and the emissions are reported by using the classification defined in IPCC's guidelines (Common Reporting Format, CRF). Other sources of F-gases contain other refrigeration units and air conditioning devices (household and industrial refrigeration units and refrigerated transport), cellular plastics, aerosols, electricity distribution equipment, semiconductor industry, fire extinguishing equipment and a group of other, smaller emission sources.

Dividing the F-gas emissions of commercial refrigeration between different municipalities is based on the number of various grocery stores and professional kitchens in the municipality. The emissions of building's air conditioning devices have been allocated municipality-specifically based on population. With regard to air conditioning devices in vehicles, the municipal traffic emission calculations based on the ALas model have been utilised. It is assumed that the F-gas emissions of road traffic are distributed to the municipalities in accordance with their road traffic mileage. The F-gas emissions of rail transit have been allocated municipality-specifically, based on the electricity consumption of passenger and local traffic. The F-gas emissions of machinery have been allocated to municipalities the same way as their carbon dioxide emissions. The emissions of underground railway and trams have been allocated to municipalities where these transport forms are available. The emissions from other sources of F-gases, excluding the semiconductor industry, have been allocated to municipalities based on their population numbers. The emissions of semiconductor industry have been allocated to municipalities based on the production plants' locations.

# Road traffic

VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland maintains LIISA, the calculation system of exhaust gases and energy consumption of Finnish road traffic. The LIISA model is part of the LIPASTO calculation system for all modes of transport. It is used to calculate the Finnish official annual emissions for the statistics of EU and UN.

VTT produces territorial road traffic emission data. In this calculation method, all driving mileage within the municipalities' borders, and the corresponding emissions, are allocated to that municipality. Road traffic emissions are calculated separately for cars, vans, buses and trucks, as well as for motorcycles, mopeds and moped cars. Car, van, bus and truck emissions are separated into street and road emissions. Due to the territorial-based allocation in LIISA, the emissions of road traffic are high in municipalities that have a great deal of traffic from vehicles registered to other areas (drive-through traffic). The territorial allocation principle of emissions has been found to be problematic, which is why two alternative ways of municipal allocation of road traffic emissions have been developed: usage-based calculation and calculation that takes drive-through traffic into account.

In Hinku calculation, the emissions of cars, motorcycles, mopeds and moped cars are calculated based on their usage. Region-based emissions are calculated for vans, buses and trucks, but drive-through traffic is excluded ("region's own road transportation").

In the usage-based calculation method, all emissions caused by the driving mileage of vehicle stock registered in a certain municipality are allocated to it, regardless of where the driving actually takes place. The calculation is based on Traficom's vehicle register information about the vehicle's first registration date and the odometer reading registered during the vehicle's latest inspection. An average annual driving mileage of each vehicle has been calculated based on this information and, based on this, the average annual, municipality-based driving mileage of each vehicle registered in the municipality is calculated. When calculating the average driving mileage, vehicles that do not have an odometer reading are excluded. These include new cars that have not yet gone through an annual inspection and old cars that do not have a reading for some other reason.

Annual, municipality-specific total driving mileage is calculated by multiplying the municipality-specific average driving mileage with the number of vehicles registered in the municipality (including vehicles that do not have an odometer reading). The total driving mileage is allocated to municipalities' streets and roads based on LIISAs road and street driving shares. The computational street and road driving mileage are transformed into emissions utilising the vehicle-specific emission factors in Traficom's vehicle register. Based

on this information, the average gCO2/km emission factor of the vehicle stock is calculated for each municipality. The lacking gCO2/km data have been imputed from vehicle information saved in the vehicle register, categorised by the vehicle's year of initial registration, engine displacement and driving power.

The vehicle register does not include emission factor data for buses, trucks, motorcycles, mopeds or moped cars. Buses have been divided into five classes: small and large diesel engine buses, large buses that use natural gas, large buses that use bio-fuel and large buses that run on electricity. The usual average emission factors typical to vehicles from a certain year, as determined in LIPASTO unit emissions database, have been used for these vehicles. Similarly, annual average emission factors have been used for vans, motorcycles, mopeds and moped cars. Municipality-specific emissions are calculated by multiplying the municipal driving mileage with a municipality-specific emission factor. Finally, the levels of municipal emissions are adjusted municipality-specifically so that the computational emissions of vehicle classes in the entire country are equal to the emissions in LIPASTO calculated as Finland's carbon dioxide equivalents.
A calculation that takes drive-through traffic into account means the allocation aims to estimate the amount of emissions caused by vehicles registered in other municipalities. In other words, drive-through traffic includes the driving which may end in the inspected region, start there or pass over the borders of the inspected municipality. Both the region- and usage-based calculation methods are utilised for drive-through traffic calculations. If the region-based driving mileage is larger than the computational annual driving mileage of the municipality's registered vehicle stock (surplus), the vehicles registered to other municipalities must drive in the region of the inspected municipality as much as the difference indicates. Equally, if the region-based driving mileage is smaller than the computational annual driving mileage of the municipality's registered vehicle stock (deficit), the vehicles of the inspected municipality must drive in other municipalities as much as the difference indicates. The deficit sum is deducted from the surplus sum of driving mileage, so that the total driving mileage is equal to LIPASTO's Finnish total driving mileage. The remaining drive-through mileage is allocated to municipalities based on their street and road driving mileage. The emissions caused by the driving allocated to the municipality (region's own road traffic) are calculated based on the

average emission factor of the vehicles in the inspected vehicle class that are registered in

the municipality in question. The emissions of drive-through traffic are calculated by applying

the whole country's average emission factor.

Territorial emissions are used for Åland's municipalities in Hinku calculation.

## Rail traffic

The emissions of rail transit are calculated separately for electricity and diesel used for passenger traffic and freight transport, as well as for electricity used for local traffic (including metros and trams). The national energy consumption data of rail transit that is allocated to municipalities are taken from VTT's LIPASTO calculation system, the Finnish greenhouse gas inventory and, with regard to metros and trams, from Helsinki City Transport (HKL). The emissions are calculated by applying the national annual electricity emission factor. The diesel emission factor (tCO2e / GWh), on the other hand, is calculated based on data from LIPASTO and the Finnish greenhouse gas emission inventory.

When allocating the emissions of passenger traffic to municipalities, passenger kilometers need to be calculated for different railway sections (= number of trips x length of the section). The proportion of passenger kilometers in the rail section to the similarly calculated performance of the whole country is further weighted with the population numbers along the track (municipalities with a train station/stop in 2021). The result is a municipality-specific "passenger kilometer share" of the railway section, weighted with population numbers, which is calculated in total, and also separately for electrified and unelectrified railway sections.

The annual electricity consumption of passenger traffic in Finland is allocated to the municipalities based on electrified railway sections' passenger kilometre shares, and the consumption of diesel based on the unelectrified
sections. The diesel consumption of shunting and depot operations is allocated to municipalities in relation to the passenger kilometres of municipalities that have depots.

The rail sections' net tonne-kilometres (= transported freight x length of the section) are calculated for freight transport, and these are then divided evenly between the section's departure and arrival municipalities. The municipal net tonne-kilometres are calculated from the whole country's net tonne-kilometres as a whole and separately for electrified and unelectrified rail sections. The specific net tonne-kilometres of railway sections have been compiled from three years (2005, 2012, 2017), and the gap years have been interpolated

linearly. The railway sections of freight transport that are no longer in use have been taken into account.

The annual electricity consumption of freight transport in Finland is allocated to municipalities by multiplying the electricity consumption with each municipality's annual net tonne-kilometre share of its electrified rail sections.

The consumption of diesel is divided between the unelectrified railway network (49%) and the electrified railway network (51%) based on its net tonne-kilometre shares, diesel's total consumption and the average typical consumption of diesel locomotives. The consumption shares of diesel are distributed to municipalities based on the net tonne-kilometres of their electrified and unelectrified railway network. The diesel consumption of shunting and depot operations is allocated to municipalities in relation to the net tonne-kilometres of municipalities that have depots.

The energy consumption and emissions of electrical and diesel locomotive operations are allocated to municipalities based on their freight transport. With regard to electrical locomotives, the allocation principles of freight transport's electricity consumption are applied. The consumption of diesel locomotives is allocated based on the municipality-specific net tonne-kilometres of the entire rail network.

The electricity consumption of local traffic is divided between the municipalities with local rail network according to their population figures. The metro and tram power consumption data of Helsinki and Espoo are based on a report by HKL.

# Water traffic

In the water traffic calculations, the domestic water traffic emissions in the greenhouse gas inventory of Finland are allocated to municipalities. Allocation principles based on available materials have been developed for seven different categories of water traffic – recreational boats, passenger ships, cargo ships, cruise ships, fishing vessels, work boats, and ferries. The emissions of ice breakers are not included in municipal water traffic emission calculations. The fairly low emissions of cruise ships have been combined with passenger ships in the reports.

The emissions of recreational boats are allocated based on Traficom's and Åland's vessel registers. The category of recreational boats includes outboard motorboats, sterndrive motor boats, inboard motor boats, inflatable boats, hydrocopters, jet skis, motor sailboats and sail boats. The allocation basis is the municipality's total amount of recreational boats and for Åland's vessel register, the municipalities' population data.

With regard to passenger ships, the source material used are port calls (Portnet/MEERI) and the annual reports of domestic water traffic's passenger transport. The water body -specific share of each year's passenger traffic is calculated based on the passenger kilometres of domestic passenger traffic. The water body shares are allocated to municipalities with ports that were visited by vessels.

The allocation basis for cargo ships is the statistics data of port calls of domestic cargo transport and the tonne-mileages in inland and coastal areas.

The emissions of cruise ships are allocated to municipalities that have business locations of companies involved in coastal and/or inland passenger water traffic. This information is taken from Statistics Finland's regional business statistics. Coastal water passenger traffic has been weighted with the annual total revenue.

When allocating the emissions of fishing vessels (note, vessels of sea fishing), the regional business statistics are also utilised. The share of municipality-specific business locations of sea fishing are weighted with the combined total engine powers of fishing boats, as determined in the statistics maintained by the regional Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (ELY centres).

Ferries are distributed to municipalities on the basis of fuel consumption on connecting ferry and road ferry routes. Consumption data for mainland Finland have been obtained from the ELY Centre for Southwest Finland and consumption data for Åland have been estimated on the basis of road ferry activity and fleet data.

The work boats' emissions are allocated to municipalities based on their water surface areas and population figures.

Agriculture

The greenhouse gas emissions of agriculture include the methane and nitrous oxide emissions of livestock, manure and cultivation of agricultural lands as well as the carbon dioxide emissions of liming and urea fertilization. The carbon dioxide emissions generated by the decomposition of peatlands are allocated to land use, land use change and forestry sector (LULUCF) and they are not included in the Alas calculation.

The calculation principles are the same as in the greenhouse gas inventory of Finland. The emissions of animals' enteric fermentation and manure management are based on municipality-specific animal numbers. The calculations include cattle, horses, sheep, goats, swine, poultry, reindeer and fur animals.

The emissions from cultivation are generated by the application of inorganic fertilizers, manure, urea and sewage sludge, nitrogen released from organic soil, plant residue decomposing on the fields, manure and urine from grazing, field burning of plant residues, liming and nitrogen leaching.

The emissions from cultivation are calculated based on the municipal, crop-specific cultivated surface areas, municipal soil data, regional yield data (by ELY centre) as well as the national data on the use of lime, mineral nitrogen fertilizers and sewage sludge.

# Waste management

The landfill emissions include the methane emissions of municipal waste, construction and demolition waste, municipal sludge, and industrial waste and sludge taken to a landfill. These emissions are generated when the biodegradable parts of waste decompose in oxygen-free conditions into methane over years. The FOD method (First Order Decay), in accordance with the IPCC's calculation guidelines, is used in the calculations. This method assumes that the amount of generated methane depends on the amount of coal left in the waste, if conditions remain stable. The recovered quantity of landfill gas is deducted from the emissions and, additionally, the oxidising share of the landfill's surface layers is taken into account.

The quantity of landfill emissions is also dependent on the annual amounts of waste deposited in the landfill, the composition of waste and their decomposition properties and the recovery of landfill gas. The default values in the greenhouse gas inventory of Finland are applied as the calculation parameters. The waste quantity and gas recovery data are municipality- and landfill-specific.

Municipal waste landfill utilization rates are based on cooperation areas of regional and municipal waste management companies and other reviewed cooperation. The landfill waste quantities within these cooperation areas are distributed to the municipalities in relation to their population. In history data, the waste quantities of the years preceding the cooperation (for which landfill-specific data are not available) are also allocated based on the municipal population figures. Otherwise, history data, of which landfill-specific information is not available, are scaled by applying the same waste quantity ratios as in the national inventory. Other waste fractions (sludge, construction waste and industrial waste) are either allocated based on the cooperation areas and population figures of municipalities or estimated as local.

In a few cases, a different method of allocation is applied; for example, forest industries' landfills are often located in other municipalities than where the actual plant is. In such cases, the waste emissions are allocated to the municipality where the waste has been generated, in accordance with the principles of usage-based calculations. Industrial waste emissions are not included in the Hinku calculation.

The HSY data of the Ämmänsuo landfill emissions have been used with regard to Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, Kauniainen and Kirkkonummi. All landfill emissions in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area are allocated to municipal waste.

The greenhouse gas emissions from wastewater treatment, composting and anaerobic digestion are calculated by distributing the emission data of the national greenhouse gas inventory to municipalities. The allocation basis is population data for community waste and the floor surface area of industrial buildings for industrial waste.

# Electricity emission factors

When calculating the greenhouse gas emissions of municipalities, an average emission factor of electricity consumption in Finland is applied to all municipalities. This factor is calculated by dividing the emissions of Finnish electricity production, calculated with the benefit allocation method, by the total consumption of electricity.

The emission factor of consumption is different than the electricity production's factor, as the amount of electricity consumed in Finland every year is different from the annually generated amount of electricity. The difference is due to distribution losses and net import. Because consumption in Finland exceeds the production, the emission factor of total consumption is smaller than the emission factor of production. Imported electricity is assumed emissions-free.

The emission factors are calculated both on annual and monthly levels, the latter of which is applied to calculating the emissions of heating electricity. The emission factor is, on average, larger during the heating season than during other times, which means that heating electricity has larger specific emissions than other use of electricity.

The monthly factor is calculated by allocating the annual GHG emissions of Finnish electricity production to different months in accordance with different production methods, and by dividing the monthly emission result with the electricity consumption of each month. The monthly data are taken from the statistics of Finnish Energy.

The emission factor other electricity use than heating (consumption electricity) is calculated by deducting the emissions of heating electricity, calculated with the monthly factors, from the total emissions of electricity and, similarly, the consumption of heating electricity from the total electricity consumption.

The monthly and annual factors are also calculated without wind power production. These higher factors, in which wind power's effect of decreasing the electricity emissions has been neutralised, are used in the Hinku calculation, in connection to the wind power compensation.

# Emission factors of fuels

The CO2 emission factors of fuels are taken from the annually updated Fuel Classification maintained by Statistics Finland. Bio-based fuels have zero carbon dioxide emissions. The factors of methane and nitrous oxide are obtained from IPCC's Emission Factor Database.

Until 2013, fuel classifications are available as Excel files. Before this, the same factors as in 2013 were applied, excluding light fuel, for which zero-emission bio-shares were calculated in 2009–2012. The factors of earlier years than 2013 of engine petrol and diesel have also been calculated based on the figures of 2013, while taking into account the change of the bio-composition share. For traffic, however, the emission factors of VTT's LIPASTO system are used in the emission calculation of the ALas model.

The methane and nitrous oxide emission factors of fuels are taken from IPCC's Emission Factor Database. They are separate for energy industries, manufacturing industries and other sectors, which includes housing and services. The 2006 IPCC Default is the selected emission factor option.

The carbon dioxide equivalence factors are calculated by using IPCC's Global Warming Potential (GWP) values of 2007, which are also used for national greenhouse gas inventory calculation. In a hundred-year period, the heating effect of methane is 25 times that of carbon dioxide (GWP100 = 25), and for nitrous oxide it is 298 times as large (GWP100 = 298). The GWP values of F-gases vary between 124–22,800, depending on the compound.

# Emission inventory methodology, part 2: Forests

The data for emission inventory of forestry was gained from IBC Carbon project coordinated by Finnish Environmental Institute (SYKE).

Land cover data is from the period 2015-2020 and is based on registry data or remote sensing. Forest productivity is modelled using process-based forest growth model PREBAS, developed in Helsinki University. Initial state of the forest model is derived from the multi-source national forest inventory (MS-NFI; version 2015) and harvesting intensities are modelled based on the Finnish national statistics according to National Resources Institute Finland (LUKE).

Results of the project are shared as raster data with 250m-by-250m resolution. Emission intensities are reported as gCO2e/m2 based on the 100 year GWP as reported in the IPCC 5th assessment report.

CO2 emissions from decomposition on mineral soils are estimated with the soil carbon model YASSO07. On drained peatlands, in addition to CO2 emissions due to peat and litter decomposition, the soil emissions include the CH4 and N2O emissions. Net emissions due to CO2, CH4 and N2O from drained peatland are calculated using separate coefficients for nutrient rich and nutrient poor sites.

Emission calculations are based on averages for the years 2017-2025, assuming the timber harvesting rates remain at the same level as in previous five years. Negative values correspond to sinks and positive values correspond to emissions.

# Example 2

In Lappeenranta, plans are underway for what would be the largest solar power project in Europe. The solar power project has been in preparation in collaboration with the project initiator, and from the early stages of planning, several open public events and online surveys have been organized. These events have representatives from urban planning and the solar power project, providing answers to landowners' and the public's questions. Residents have had the opportunity to express their opinions through a separately arranged online survey.

# Example 3

Climate and environmental issues have been prominent in the environmental and urban art projects carried out by the city of Lappeenranta. Lappeenranta's urban planning department participated in the project "Kamalan hienoa! – Kestävät teot näkyväksi ympäristötaiteen keinoin," which was funded by the Ministry of the Environment. This project made visible the diverse sustainable development work done by the city in the urban environment through environmental and urban art.

As an example of one completed initiative, the city organized an art competition inspired by participatory budgeting, where residents had the opportunity to propose an environmental art piece and receive €2,000 for its realization. Sustainable development has also been strongly reflected in the works of LAB University of Applied Sciences students hired by the urban planning department, who have made the importance of the environment visible to residents and visitors to the city.

# 1 Introduction

As part of the Horizon Europe programme, the EU has launched a Mission "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030". The objectives of the mission are to achieve 100 climate-neutral and smart European cities by 2030 and to ensure that these cities act as experimentation and innovation hubs to enable all European cities to follow suit by 2050. The City of Lappeenranta has been selected as one of these 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities. The choice by the European Commission strengthens Lappeenranta's position as one of the pioneering European climate cities.

Cities play a key role in achieving climate neutrality by 2050, the goal of the European Green Deal. They take up only 4% of the EU's land area, but they are home to 75% of EU citizens. Furthermore, cities consume over 65% of the world's energy and account for more than 70% of global CO2 emissions.

Since climate mitigation is heavily dependent on urban action, EU has decided to support cities in accelerating their green and digital transformation. In particular, European cities can substantially contribute to the Green Deal target of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030 and, in more practical terms, to offer cleaner air, safer transport and less congestion and noise to their citizens.

The city of Lappeenranta has joined to the EU mission, because it supports the city climate actions. City has already committed to be climate neutral by 2030. Opportunity to join the EU mission gives more tools to reach the goal in the future. In the city strategy to year 2037 city has committed to be carbon neutral by 2030. The strategy is named as - Sustainable Succes Stories -. It means that city aims for sustainability and the city provides success stories for all kind of different stakeholders. In the climate work city has a long tradition. The work has started more than 20 years ago.

The best achievements in climate work have been in the energy sector. The city has changed its energy production totally in the last 15 years. First from natural gas to sustainable bioenergy in 2010, then changing its city's own electricity provider to climate neutral EKO energy. Later the smaller energy production unts have been switched from fossil to renewable energy. Energy efficiency in buildings has been a long-term target for the city owned buildings.

City has been awarded by WWF as a Climate Capital of Finland. The city has also received recognitions from Natural Protection Agency of Finland, Finnish Association of Municipalities and Finnis Environmental Institute of its work in Climate Actions. In 2020 the City of Lappeenranta won the highest nomination of the cities by EU commission receiving the EU Green Leaf title. After that city has been selected to the EU City Mission in 2022.

City has committed to the climate neutrality target in 2030 when joining the national HINKU network (carbon neutral municipalities) in 2014. City is also a member in the Finnish Sustainable Municipalities (FISU). Internationally city has joined Covenant of Mayors and the ICLEI networks. City is also an active member in the EU Green Leaf network. In 2022 City joined the Glasgow Declaration for Tourism. It is a global climate program for the sustainable tourism. The Declaration strengthens the actors in the climate work in the city. In the latest city strategy, one of the main goals is the carbon neutrality for the city by 2030.

The city actions in the climate policy have provided energy security for the citizens and a solid action towards sustainable energy production and energy infra to the future. There has been a lot of actions for the carbon neutrality targets such as mobility, waste management, energy efficiency of the buildings and the diverse energy actions. Luckily, we have been able to connect to the best energy university in Finland – LUT University. It provides us a continuous flow of new solutions to the area.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

The city of Lappeenranta has been ambitious for the climate actions during last 10 year when the city committed to the climate actions by joining several networks and accelerating the climate work.

The emission reduction target is a minimum of 80% and the emission compensations and additional carbon sinks are a maximum of 20% of the emissions.

City Council has decided that city is aiming for the climate neutrality by 2030 10.12.2020 and climate positive by 2035. Target is for the whole geographical area of the city, including all the sectors excluding scope 3 and emission trading private companies.

The climate program consists of several main topic such as communication, energy system, land use, transport and mobility, sinks and compensations, public green procurements, sustainable consumption, waste handling and circular economy, buildings, climate risks and adaptation. The program can be found in finish from https://kestavyysvahti.lappeenranta.fi/ilmasto.

The co-benefits are improvements on public health, new jobs and business opportunities, increase in nature-based solutions and increase of biodiversity at the area.

Lappeenranta has a lot of climate and circular economy related regional, national and European projects that can distribute new ideas to all cities in Europe. City has also a contract with state (Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment of Finland) about regional development. The topic of the contract is Green Electrification. In the contract Lappeenranta is developing together with Imatra municipality and Universities new greener solutions to the world. The topics are renewable electricity production, hydrogen economy, small and modular nuclear reactors.

The main challenge for the city climate neutrality is in the mobility sector. As a small and partly rural city the distances are long to the jobs and services. Because the population is small the effective public transport is difficult to organise. Also the transformation to electric vehicles is slow. In the sustainable mobility program there are targets to increase public transport as well as to increase a use of cycling and electric charging stations.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

The climate program has ten different topics for the different actions. In the Mission program the main priorities for the city climate program are:

Climate neutral **energy system** for municipality, citizens and companies. Every sector run by the city in the energy system will be climate neutral by 2030. This includes district heating, city premises, city owned companies and subsidiaries.
**Climate neutral mobility** and transport. Actions will be made towards climate neutral and low emission mobility and transport including biogas production. Target is difficult because of the city structure and the vast green areas. Actions are electrification of the traffic and transport, biogas production, renewable fuels.
**Building sector climate neutrality and energy efficiency** for all sectors in the city area. Energy efficiency actions, climate neutral energy and planning towards hydrogen economy in building sector are the targets.

# 4 Principles and process

Achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 requires significant changes in the energy system, movement, land use and consumption choices of residents. To steer the climate program city has established a transition team, which includes the city's various industries, group companies and the most important stakeholders, such as key companies and communities, universities and residents of the area.

Lappeenranta's action plan has been prepared in cooperation with stakeholders, and the transition team monitors the implementation of the action program and investment plan and guides their development as we advance. The action and investment plans are constantly updated programs, and the transition team monitors the implementation every six months. The climate city contract as a whole is updated every two years.

The action plan development began by reviewing the city's current climate programs, goals and policies/practices. Based on this report and the latest emissions calculation, the city has determined the level of additional measures needed. New significant additional measures were mapped out in spring 2023 in four thematic workshops cooperating with stakeholders and residents. The themes discussed were transport, construction, nature-based solutions and sustainable tourism. A portfolio of the most important and urgent actions to be implemented by 2030 was drawn up with the help of the measures defined in the workshops and the Finnish Environment Institute's scenario tool.

City stakeholders such as citizens, companies and institutions can join this program and announce their contributions as well as wishes for the city to help the each individual organization to achieve targets.

City of Lappeenranta has separate boards for citizen participation, elderly and disabled groups as well as youth parliament. A separate group for young to participate in climate work was founded in 2020.

To increase the participation the city has opened a website of the Mission and produced a video that describes for the citizens the aims and benefits of the EU Mission of Climate Neutral and Smart Cities.

Additional examples of the citizen and stakeholder participation has been included as an attachment to the Acion plan.
