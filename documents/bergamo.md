# Summary

## Textual element

After the pandemic that affected the city very seriously making Bergamo the very first European city to face the emergency with horrendous effects, the City of Bergamo reacted in a very strong and powerful manner showing a very interesting period of resilience and high involvement of the entire territory on crucial aspects such as cultural, environmental, and social matter, to mention few.

The increasing awareness of the territory on environmental and climatic issues and the desire to act have paved the way for a strong and solid co-planned Climate City Contract.

The decision taken by the City to join the NZC path toward neutrality, showed on one hand the Municipality's interest in involving more and more, together with the stakeholders and the civil society, into a solid climate transition for the territory and, on the other hand, highlighted the enthusiastic interest of the entire city eco-system that, together with the Municipality, wrapped up a very interesting portfolio of actions for the climate neutrality also looking at barriers and opportunities.

Following the NZC methodology (https://netzerocities.app/ClimateTransitionMap), the implementation of the CCC, and in particular of the Action Plan, was based on the transition map that has the main pillars of:

Building a strong mandate
Understanding the system
Co-designing a portfolio
Activating an inclusive ecosystem for a just climate transition.

The document, based on the NZC Action Plan model, details the path toward neutrality of the City of Bergamo, the first results achieved putting the base for a continuous improvement and guaranteeing the all eco-system involvement.

Part A set the base for the emission gap calculation, analyzing the most recent and accurate plan of the City of Bergamo for Sustainable Energy and Climate Actions (SECAP) and filling the gap between the SECAP baseline calculation and the NZC methodology.

An in depth analysis of the most recent policies and strategies enabling climate neutrality within the territory is presented, highlighting the relevant role the Municipality of Bergamo had and still has.

Starting from a description of the urban systems, the systemic barriers, and related opportunities, main core of the second part of the document (module B), is the "Portfolio of actions".

During the co-planning phase, 217 actions were collected from 40 stakeholders divided as follows:

85 actions in the Buildings sector
32 actions in the Transport sector
5 actions in the AFOLU sector
30 actions in the Waste sector
65 actions transversal sectors

The contribution of these actions, together with the strategies outlined by the Municipality of Bergamo (most of which have been the subject of a detailed analysis in terms of potential for emission reduction and related costs) and with the actions already quantified in the SECAP, leads to achievement of the 2030 emissions reduction target.

The last part of the Action plan is dedicated to the capacity of the City of Bergamo to enable Climate Neutrality by 2030 by means of relevant governance and social innovation interventions.

i equivalent to 80% of the baseline value with baseline emissions equal to 372,516.24 tCO2eq and the remaining 20% identified as residual emissions to be reduced with the strengthening and development of strategies.

# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

The City of Bergamo, which was Italian Capital of Culture 2023 with its neighbour Brescia, is a continuously evolving city in terms of culture, society, the development of research and scientific technologies and, last but by no means not least, the ever-increasing attention it pays to the environmental and energy sustainability of its territory.

The Italian Government was quick to back the bid to be designated Italian Capital of Culture (approved on 16 July 2020) by these two cities, both symbols of resilience to the terrible impact of the coronavirus pandemic in Italy. The dossier submitted in their bid to become Italian Capital of Culture focuses on the theme of "the illuminated city": this expression has various meanings, such as tolerance, creativity and the development of research and technologies, as well as the concept of a "lighthouse city", namely a point of reference and leadership.

The City of Bergamo's bid to join the European Mission "100 intelligent cities with zero climate impact by 2030" is also based on this concept of the "lighthouse city".

The municipal administration recognises the absolute importance of climate change and is intensifying its commitment to integrating aspects of climate change mitigation and adaptation into its municipal policies, strategies and plans. Its objective is not just to meet the required Italian milestones, but also match those of its European partners.

The Climate City Contract (CCC) is rooted on a city's main strategic plans, the CCC fitting into these with a logic of complete synergy and non-overlap.

The Climate Transition Strategy (Strategia di Transizione Climatica - STC): funded by the Cariplo Foundation and the Region of Lombardy, this focuses on 7 sectors and addresses climate change mitigation and adaptation with 19 priority actions.

The Circular Economy strategy (Strategia di Economia Circolare): currently being finalised, this is supported by the European Investment Bank (EIB) through its Circular City Centre (C3), a competence and resource centre within the EIB which aims to support cities Europeans in their transition to the circular economy. The Circular Economy Strategy of the City of Bergamo focuses on three main sectors: food waste, construction sector, consumer goods (repair and reuse).

The Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (Piano Urbano della Mobilità Sostenibile - PUMS): this strategic planning tool develops a medium-long term (10 year) vision of the urban mobility system by setting achievable objectives for environmental, social and economic sustainability. It does this by identifying actions aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the mobility system and its integration within the urban and territorial structure and developments.

The Territory Government Plan (Piano di Governo del Territorio - PGT): this is the city's town planning tool with targets within the municipal territory falling under three main headings: Attractive Bergamo, Sustainable Bergamo, Inclusive Bergamo.

The Sustainable Energy Action Plan (Piano d'Azione per l'Energia Sostenibile ed il Clima - SEAP): the Municipality of Bergamo joined the Covenant of Mayors in 2009. The first Action Plan for Sustainable Energy (Piano d'Azione per l'Energia Sostenibile - SEAP) was drawn up in 2011. In 2023, with the support of TerrAria Srl, the Municipality drew up its Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP).

The SECAP is the starting point for calculating the CCC baseline. In order to give continuity to the plans, avoiding their becoming two parallel and disjointed tools, the city of Bergamo's Mission started

with the analysis and baseline in the SECAP (drawn up at the end of 2023). The waste sector was added to this, as per NZC guidelines¹, in order to establish the CCC baseline inventory.

The Municipality of Bergamo started its pathway towards neutrality by engaging with stakeholders through an initial expression of interest (see Module C), which was then followed by a workshop to present the pathway towards neutrality. This expression of interest should be considered an action of innovative governance: it ensured the incisive and inclusive engagement with stakeholders, in full compliance with the transparency principles of Italy's new law on public contracts (Codice dei Contratti Pubblici, D.Lgs 36/2023).

Following this workshop, a series of one-to-one meetings was organised to collect the action sheets. In order to guarantee the synergy with the stakeholders needed to achieve synergistic co-planning of the CCC, specific memoranda of understanding were also prepared (e.g. with the healthcare sector and for the launch of CACER (Self-consumption configurations for sharing renewable energy), see Module C).

The Transition Team, described in detail in Module C below, has enabled the co-design process involving the entire urban ecosystem. Together, we have worked on developing actions with the potential to reduce emissions in our territory, analysed the pertinent direct impacts and co-benefits, and explored the barriers, risks and possibilities for mitigation.

The entire pathway is permeated by governance innovation activities (see, for instance, the expression of interest and the whole stakeholder engagement process), as well as social innovation actions. A good example of this are the district networks created to promote and spread practices of involvement towards citizens. Then there is the "Clic.Bergamo" project, focused on strengthening social cohesion as an enabling factor for transition and new urban welfare, and the involvement of the institutional figure known as the Guarantor of Children's Rights (Garante dei diritti dell'infanzia) in order to extend sustainable good practices to minors and families.

Throughout the Climate City Contract process, three documents – the Action Plan, the Investment Plan and the Commitment Plan – were developed and perfected in a synergistic manner following a single pathway of systemic and sustainable co-planning.

The ForImpact digital platform is an innovation tool, introduced with the Mission and made available to the Municipality of Bergamo. This has been implemented to ensure the continuous engagement of the Mission's partners, to facilitate governance of the Climate City Contract by monitoring the various actions, their direct and indirect impacts, developments over time and achievement of the City's objectives.

Together with the permanence and envisaged strengthening over the next few years of the Transition Team and continuous optimisation of the project and the pathways started during this initial year of co-planning, this platform is another useful tool to guarantee the sustainability of the project by 2030, by continuing to engage the entire urban eco-system.

# 2 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

## 2.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

The Municipality of Bergamo first adhered to the European Covenant of Mayors campaign in 2009, in the firm belief that it needs to play an active part in the fight against climate change. It therefore drew up its Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) in 2011, estimating the baseline emissions for 2005. This inventory has since been updated periodically with subsequent monitoring data. The most recent version refers to the year 2021 and forms an integral part of the Municipality of Bergamo's Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), drawn up in 2023 by TerrAria S.r.l.

The creation of the baseline inventory as per the Climate City Contract (CCC) is, therefore, a further step forward in the process of establishing local emissions and is based on the SECAP inventory, although this has been calculated using the methodology defined at an European level by the Covenant of Mayors. There are, however, certain methodological differences in the two approaches (Covenant of Mayors / Mission 100 Carbon Neutral and Smart Cities) that have called for some changes and additions. As a result, the baseline inventory of the Climate City Contract has had to be altered to reflect the calculation method indicated in the documents made available to the Net Zero Cities consortium.

The differences with the 2021 SECAP baseline are listed below:

**Emission factors**: when calculating emissions linked to the "Buildings" and "Transport" sectors, different emission factors to those used for the SECAP baseline have been applied, also in view of the contribution of non- $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ greenhouse gases (GHG) to total emissions. Therefore, while the emission factors of the standard IPPC approach ($\mathrm{CO}_{2}$) were applied to get the SECAP baseline, the emission factors of the IPPC GHG approach ($\mathrm{tCO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$) were applied when calculating the CCC baseline. These technical considerations refer to the 2006 methodological framework developed by the IPCC in order to create common methods for estimating GHG emissions. This means that different figures for overall emissions are obtained, despite starting from the same initial values of final energy consumption.

**Additional emission domains**: this integration is necessary as it is explicitly requested within the 100 Carbon Neutral Cities Mission. The additional domains (or 'sectors') are the following:

**Waste** This sector calculates the emissions linked to waste management that are released directly into the atmosphere, especially those arising from wastewater treatment, which takes place in a plant located within the borders of the Municipality of Bergamo. The emissions linked to the disposal of municipal waste and special waste have not been considered here to avoid double counting. Indeed, the waste-to-energy plant in Bergamo where all such waste is delivered produces heat (district heating) and electricity that have already been accounted for in the "Buildings" sector. The same goes for the emissions linked to the Montello composting plant, which receives the compostable fraction of the city's waste collection and recycling scheme, as this plant has a methane (natural gas) collection and biogas production system. Its emissions are therefore considered net zero. This methodology is consistent with the indications provided by the JRC as part of the Covenant of Mayors campaign. Finally, emissions from energy end-use, namely plant operation

and the collection and movement of waste (vehicle fuel), have already been included in the calculation of stationary energy emissions from Private Transport.

Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) This sector includes GHG emissions from industrial activities producing emissions other than those energy consumption and the use of specific products. In this specific case, we have been estimated the emissions coming from two steel production plants within the municipal area. These emissions are indicated in the next chapter, but will not be included in the CCC baseline as their value is less than  $5\%$  of overall emissions (c.f. NZC "GHG-Inventory-Baseline-Guidance_note-to-cities" guidelines). This choice was taken in order not to differ too much, at this time, from the values of the newly drawn up SECAP. Nonetheless, all the analyses of the IPPU sector have been explained here both to justify the value below  $5\%$  of overall emissions and to be able to possibly integrate it into the CCC baseline in the future.

Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) This sector calculates the emissions directly released into the atmosphere and not connected to energy end-use in the agricultural sector (e.g. manure management, use of fertilisers, the spreading of farm slurry, etc.) and changes in the land use. In this specific case, emissions linked to livestock farming and soil fertilisation have been estimated, while it has been decided to ignore absorption by deciduous wooded areas and permanent meadows. As for the IPPU sector, the emissions in the AFOLU sector are indicated in the following chapter, but will not be taken into account in the CCC baseline as their value is less than  $5\%$  of the overall emissions (c.f. NZC "GHG-Inventory-Baseline-Guidance_note-to-cities" guidelines). This choice was taken in order not to differ too much, at this time, from the values of the newly drawn up SECAP. Nonetheless, all the analyses of the AFOLU sector have been explained here both to justify the value below  $5\%$  of overall emissions and to be able to possibly integrate it into the CCC baseline in the future.

The tables below divide the emissions according to the model provided by the Net Zero Cities consortium: the sector appears in the rows and the type of energy vector in the columns. Emissions are categorised using the "Scopes" framework, where "Scope 1" refers to emissions generated by combustion processes or GHG emissions within the boundaries of the system in question (in our case, within the municipal area); "Scope 2" refers to emissions generated by the consumption of energy distributed through networks (e.g. electricity and district heating), but where the consumed energy is generated outside the city (e.g. a thermoelectric power station that produces electricity); and "Scope 3" refers to emissions generated outside the city, but which are linked to processes that take place within the city (e.g. the production of waste/wastewater within the municipal area destined for waste-to-energy/treatment in another Municipality.

Emissions by sectors at 2021 [tCO2eq]
Figure A.1: Breakdown of emissions in 2021 by sector [tCO2eq]

This graph shows how the majority of the emissions within the Municipality of Bergamo (roughly  $80\%$ ) are linked to the "Buildings" sector. These include emissions due to final energy consumption associated with the use of buildings and pertinent plant and equipment within the municipal area of Bergamo.  $18\%$  of emissions are, however, linked to vehicular traffic. Finally, the "Waste", "Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)" and "Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU)" sectors, which also include emissions not directly linked to energy consumption in these sectors, account for just over  $2\%$  of total emissions. For this reason, the IPPU and AFOLU sectors will be excluded from the CCC baseline as per NZC guidelines.

equipment. In this case, the tertiary sector also includes municipal buildings, and the industry sector also includes agriculture. The picture that emerges shows that final energy consumption in the residential and tertiary sectors is substantially equivalent (responsible for  $32\%$  and  $30\%$  of total emissions respectively). The "Buildings: industry and agriculture" and the "Transport" sector (private, public and municipal fleet) are the third and fourth most important sub-sectors, both responsible for  $18\%$  of emissions.

Figure A.4: Breakdown of emissions at 2021 by energy vector and emission gas

The histogram in Figure A.4 shows the emissions of the Municipality of Bergamo divided by emission vector: the two main sources are clearly the consumption of natural gas and electricity. Using the Pareto curve in the graph above, we can deduce that these two energy vectors are responsible for  $80\%$  of total emissions.

# A-1.6: Description and analysis of the GHG baseline inventory

The values provided above are mostly taken from the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan - SECAP of the Municipality of Bergamo for the year 2021. To integrate the SECAP template, contributions from the additional sectors (WASTE, IPPU and AFOLU) not found in the SECAP have been calculated and added to the SECAP template. As mentioned above, of these three sectors only the Waste sector has been included in the CCC baseline.

# CCC BASELINE RESULTS

The Bergamo CCC baseline for 2021 was estimated as 465.645 tCO₂eq.

The overall picture has the majority of emissions falling within Scope 1 (emissions generated directly within municipal boundaries). The rest of the emissions fall within Scope 2, namely energy end-use (electricity). As regards the breakdown by sector, the majority of emissions (approximately 377.960 tCO₂eq) are found in the "BUILDINGS" category. This effectively corresponds to the Stationary Energy sector, which, together with the "TRANSPORT" sector, amounts for all emissions in the 2021 SECAP inventory. The majority of emissions in the "BUILDINGS" sector are attributable to the Residential and Tertiary sectors.

In the "TRANSPORT" sector (the second biggest contributor to GHG emissions), Private Transport is responsible for 80.417 tCO₂eq, equal to approximately 18% of total emissions. The AFOLU, IPPU and WASTE sectors account for the other emissions (just over 2% of total emissions).

|  BASELINE - 2021 EMISSIONS | tCO2eq | Weight %  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  BUILDINGS: tertiary sector (including municipal services) | 143.596 | 30%  |
|  BUILDINGS: residential sector | 149.314 | 32%  |
|  BUILDINGS: industry and agriculture | 85.050 | 18%  |
|  TOTAL BUILDINGS | 377.960 | 80%  |
|  TRANSPORT: municipal fleet | 105 | 0%  |

The consumption data in MWh contained in the 2021 SECAP emissions inventory template have been used for energy end-use. However, some changes have been necessary when preparing the CCC baseline in order to comply with the methodological indications contained in the "Infokit for Cities" guidelines.

The differences between the SECAP baseline and CCC baseline are as follows:

IPCC emission factors in tCO₂eq/MWh as proposed by the Covenant of Mayor Office (COMo), in ANNEX 1 - Fuel Emission Factors Database, have been applied to the consumption in MWh. Worth noting here is the fact that the SECAP methodology only refers to the IPCC standard emission factors for CO₂.
As for electricity consumption, the national emission factor for 2021 has been adopted, equal to 0,285 tCO₂eq/MWh (source: National and European Emission Factors for Electricity Consumption NEEFE, jrc-com-neefe_1990-2021). In the SECAP, however, the emission factor used is 0,255 tCO₂/MWh, as indicated by the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA) in its document entitled "Efficiency and decarbonization indicators in Italy and in the biggest European Countries" published in 2023.
The same emission factor used for the SECAP calculations has been applied to district heating consumption, namely 0,114 tCO₂eq/MWh. In fact, where cogeneration or district heating/cooling systems exist, the SECAP Guidelines require the adoption of a local emission factor representing the energy mix used for heat production.
As already indicated in the Introduction, the contributions from the WASTE, IPPU and AFOLU sectors have indeed been calculated (see calculation instructions below) but, of these three sectors, only the contributions from the Waste sector have been included as per the NZC guidelines.

## WASTE SECTOR

The Waste sector only takes into account those emissions directly released into the atmosphere coming from the wastewater purification process, whereas those relating to waste-to-energy and composting systems are not taken into account in order to avoid double counting. In accordance with the JRC methodology for the calculation of the emissions inventory as part of the European Covenant of Mayors campaign, these emissions have already been considered as stationary energy in the "Buildings" sector.

The waste-to-energy plant within the Municipality of Bergamo uses non recyclable residual municipal waste for fuel (i.e. all waste not suitable for separate waste collection and not recyclable). This plant lies in the industrial area of the city and uses cogeneration processes to produce electricity and heat, which is then distributed through the city's district heating network.

The food and garden waste coming from the separate waste collection scheme is sent to the composting plant in the Municipality of Montello: this is equipped with a system for capturing biogas for use in a cogeneration system (15,8 MWe total power output) for the production of electricity and simultaneous heat recovery.

Therefore, as already indicated, in order to avoid counting these emissions twice, the contribution of these plants in the "Waste" sector is considered to be equal to zero, as this has already been calculated as stationary energy in the "Buildings" sector.

The municipal wastewater treatment plant lies in the south-west corner of the city. The CH₄ and N₂O emission values linked to the treatment process have been provided directly by the water utility company, Uniacque, which prepares an annual emissions report using the IPCC 2006 methodology. Most of the sewage sludge is sent to the Montello composting plant and so the related emissions have not been counted.

# AFOLU SECTOR

$\mathrm{CH}_4$  and  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  emissions directly emitted into the atmosphere within the Municipality of Bergamo by the agricultural sector have been estimated for livestock farming and soil fertilisation. A simplified approach has been adopted due to the limited incidence of the AFOLU sector on total emissions. Absorption linked to the presence of deciduous wooded areas and stable meadows within the municipal area has been ignored, as this category is extremely variable and any analysis of the current situation is especially complex. A precautionary approach has therefore been adopted to estimate the Municipality's emissions. In any case, absorbed emissions amount to roughly  $1.000\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{eq}$  and are therefore negligible.

Below are the characteristic data for the municipal area.

Figure A.6: Livestock as of 31 December 2021 and ecological/environmental resources of the Municipality of Bergamo

The livestock farms within the Municipality of Bergamo have roughly 1.370 animals in total, most of which are cattle, sheep and goats. This figure has been taken from the Animal Identification and Registration Database set up by the Italian Ministry of Health within the CSN at the "G. Caporale" Institute in Teramo. The number of farms and livestock in each Italian municipality is updated on a six monthly basis.

The emission factors proposed by the Italian National Inventory Report (NIR) drawn up by ISPRA have been used to estimate emissions. These emission factors are specific for each type of animal and refer to the year 2020. Although the baseline year is 2021, these have been used as they were the most up-to-date values available at the time.

Meanwhile, it was decided to use simplified calculations for direct emissions of  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  linked to aggregate sources, and the use of fertilizers on cultivated soil in particular, to guarantee consistency with the current situation within the territory. This calculation makes it possible to respond to changes in the sector and to provide the cognitive elements needed to consider possible specific actions. The total land used for agricultural purposes is based on the data in the Territory Government Plan of the Municipality of Bergamo; the "arable land" category has been divided into the subcategories "Winter wheat and spelt", "Barley", "Maize" and "Other" on the basis of the provincial distribution of crops using ISTAT data for 2021. Each category has then been associated with the

## IPPU SECTOR

Emissions linked to the metallurgical sector have been considered in the Industrial Processes and Product Use sector, as there are two production plants in the municipal area. As there are no detailed data available, the ISPRA 2019 database of national emissions database has been used to estimate their emissions, reparametrizing the emissions within the province of Bergamo on the basis of sector employees. In the future, it should be possible to refine this evaluation using more detailed data, especially if the two plants are directly involved in the CCC with actions aimed at reducing the emissions from energy end-use and, above all, as in the present case, emissions directly emitted into the atmosphere.

## 2.2 Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

The Municipality of Bergamo started introducing a series of policies aimed at reducing its greenhouse gas emissions several years ago.

After approving its Environmental Energy Plan in 2000, the Municipality of Bergamo joined the European initiative known as the Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy in 2009. Then, in 2011, it approved both its Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) and its Municipal Energy Plan (Piano Energetico Comunale - PEC). To date, the SEAP has been monitored three times: in 2014, 2019 and 2020. The transition from the SEAP to the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) was completed in early 2024. Thanks to its involvement in the New Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy and the drafting of its SECAP, the Municipality of Bergamo is no longer limited to just the energy sector when it comes to mitigating CO2 emissions, but can now also introduce actions regarding adaptation to the effects of climate change, such as the risk of floods, heat waves and drought.

Moreover, the city of Bergamo adheres to the Declaration on Climate Adaptation for the Green Cities: this document makes cities and local administrations central stakeholders regarding the issue of climate change. The city has subsequently created an environmental observatory in collaboration with local environmental associations to evaluate the policies and operational actions aimed at achieving the European Commission's and its own Climate Mission objectives.

City Council Resolution no. 135 was passed on the 8th of November, 2021, in view of the Cariplo Foundation Call for Ideas "Climate Strategy" ("Cli.C. Bergamo! - CLImate. Change. Bergamo!, developed by the Municipality of Bergamo, in partnership with the Parco dei Colli di Bergamo, Legambiente Lombardia Onlus and ERSAF (Regional Agency for Agriculture and Forestry Services). This resolution approved a proper Climate Transition Strategy (Strategia di Transizione Climatica - STC), the main aim of this being to reduce and mitigate the risks linked to climate change and, at the same time, to exploit the possibility of redeveloping the territory and restoring the healthy conditions needed for elements such as water, the soil and plant-life can provide ecosystem services, while also organising projects capable of integrating ecological, economic and social issues.

Finally, the Municipality of Bergamo is currently drafting its own Circular Economy Strategy. This establishes a series of good practices at the local level regarding the construction industry, consumer goods and the food sector in order to create support for the replicability of such practices.

Unlike previous plans, the Climate City Contract (CCC) calls for the involvement of the entire city ecosystem, including public and private stakeholders, the Administration as a whole (i.e., its technical, administrative and political parts), investee companies and local citizens. All these have come together to share details of their ongoing and future actions within the municipal area. The drafting of this CCC has afforded the city a good opportunity to align the main municipal planning documents that may have an impact on local greenhouse gas emissions such as, for example, the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (Piano Urbano per la Mobilità Sostenibile - PUMS) and the Territory Government Plan (Piano di Governo del Territorio - PGT).

The following list of relevant policies, regulations, strategies and plans that have all contributed and continue to contribute to the drafting of this CCC (section A-2.1) provides a general idea of all the work leading to the compilation of this document at the local, regional and national levels. The aim of this document is not just to consolidate pre-existing strategies, but also to create ever greater synergies between central and local administrations to allow for the increasingly stronger multi-level governance needed to achieve the objective of climate neutrality.

Table A 2.2., on the other hand, shows the most recent policies and strategies where the Municipality of Bergamo has more direct involvement. These policies and strategies are a crucially integral part of the City's strategy to achieve climate neutrality, as will be further explained in Part B of this document.
A-2.1: Description & assessment of policies

The list that follows seeks to highlight the main policies, strategies and regulations relating to the Mission that are being applied by the Municipality of Bergamo. The focus here is on two levels of analysis: local and regional, followed by a brief reference to national policies and their respective possible impacts within the local territory.

Local policies

### Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (PUMS)

The Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (Piano Urbano della Mobilità Sostenibile - PUMS) is a strategic planning tool which develops a medium-long term (10 years) vision of the urban mobility system (preferably referring to the metropolitan city area, where defined) by setting achievable objectives for environmental, social and economic sustainability. It does this by identifying actions aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the mobility system and its integration with the urban and territorial structure and developments. The objectives and strategies identified in the Bergamo PUMS work in synergy with the requirements of the Mission to move towards climate neutrality. The Municipality of Bergamo approved its new Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (PUMS) with City Council Resolution no. 0014-22 dated 05/07/2022. Planned monitoring activities are currently underway which, it is hoped, will soon result in the positive achievement of the Plan's objectives and the drafting of a report on the three-year monitoring campaign.

### Urban Mobility Plan for Cycling Strategies (PCSMC)

The purpose of the Urban Mobility Plan for Cycling Strategies (Piano comunale strategico per la mobilità ciclistica - PCSMC) is to promote cycle mobility, identified as an effective and sustainable solution to mobility needs in the urban and peri-urban area of Bergamo, by planning interventions at a local level so that the cycle and cycle-pedestrian network is seen as an integral element of the regional/provincial level network, as well as connecting the major traffic hotspots at a local level (schools, shopping centres, industrial zones, the public transport system and, more generally, places of social, historical, cultural and tourist interest for public use).

After taking into due consideration the planning guidelines contained within the Regional Cycling Mobility Plan (Regional Cycling Mobility Plan - RCMP), the Provincial Plan for the cycle route network and some local planning tools, including the PUMS, the Municipality of Bergamo approved the new “UMPCS - BiciPlan 2022” with City Council Resolution no. 0471-22 of 09/22/2022. The aim of this is to update the contents of the previous 2015 Plan, incorporating the achievements made in the 2015-2022 period, the recent regulatory changes introduced by Italian Decree-Law dated 19th May 2020, no. 34, new predictions using municipal planning tools, as well as directions from the Municipal Administration regarding sustainable mobility. The objectives for cycling mobility are of strategic value for the Mission and include actions strongly linked to sustainable mobility (an expansion of the existing cycle network, improvements in the safety of this network, connections with the collective mobility system, etc.).

### Climate Transition Strategy (STC)

The purpose of the Climate Transition Strategy (Strategia di Transizione Climatica - CTS) is to reduce and mitigate risks linked to climate change, while also exploring the opportunity of redeveloping the territory by organising projects capable of integrating ecological, economic and social issues and restoring those healthy conditions needed so that elements such as water, the soil and plant-life can provide essential ecosystem services. The strength of this project is the fact that it involves the participation of numerous partners and stakeholders with a view to collaboration and the distribution of resources. More specifically, these partners are expected to perform 23 actions, including de-paving and urban forestation works which can then be replicated thanks to a consolidated adaptation strategy. At the moment, the STC has reached PHASE III (running from late 2021 to late 2025): the actions envisaged by this strategy are expected to be implemented within this time span and the

results will be constantly monitored. The STC was introduced by the Municipality of Bergamo with City Council Resolution no. 135 dated 8/11/2021.

## Circular economy strategy

This establishes a series of good practices at the local level regarding the construction industry, consumer goods and the food sector in order to create support for the replicability of such practices. Still being drafted, this will consolidate a series of actions working in synergy with the objectives of the Mission and the various stakeholders operating within the municipal area.

## Urban Traffic Plan (PUT)

Article 36 of Italy's new highway code (Nuovo codice della strada) provides for the drafting of an Urban Traffic Plan (Piano Urbano del Traffico - PUT). This is mandatory for municipalities with more than 30,000 inhabitants. Such a plan comprises a coordinated set of interventions for the improvement of road traffic conditions within the urban area, benefiting pedestrians, public transport and private vehicles alike. These measures should be introduced and operational within a short space of time, providing that the infrastructure and means of transport remain substantially unchanged. The Municipality of Bergamo approved the most recent updates to its Urban Traffic Plan (PUT) with City Council Resolution no. 0045-13 dated 07/10/2013.

## Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP)

The Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP, in Italian: Piano d'Azione per l'Energia Sostenibile) is a document drawn up by Municipalities who have signed the Covenant of Mayors to demonstrate how their municipal administrations intend to achieve the objectives of reducing  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions. The SEAP had set an objective of  $-20\%$  of emissions by 2020. The Municipality of Bergamo approved its the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) in 2011. This is due to be replaced by the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP, in Italian: Piano d'Azione per l'Energia Sostenibile ed il Clima) in 2024.

## Territory Government Plan (PGT)

The Territory Government Plan (Piano di Governo del Territorio - PGT) is the city's town planning tool, introduced by Regional Law no. 12 dated 11/3/2005. The drafting of the new Territory Government Plan (PGT) is regulated by Regional Law no. 31 dated 11/28/2014. The PGT organises the objectives to be achieved within the municipal territory under three main headings: Attractive Bergamo, Sustainable Bergamo, Inclusive Bergamo. Planning for the city's future is based on these three strategic lines.

Together with the climate Mission, the PGT identifies 5 macro-objectives for the future of Bergamo:

Self-transformation of the city;
Infrastructure and public spaces at the centre of any development;
Enhancement of the environment;
Existing public services as the basis for new urban welfare;
Culture as the driving force for development.

To ensure the Bergamo of the future, general awareness of the theme of sustainability will be achieved by enhancing the environment, strengthening the Green Belt project, protecting agricultural land and developing a climate change adaptation plan.

The PGT requires the approval of regulations to encourage building projects that respect criteria linked to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to prevent climate change.

The Municipality of Bergamo first approved its PGT in 2009. A new PGT for the City of Bergamo was adopted by means of Resolution no. 59 dated 16/10/2023.

## Structural green plan

In December 2023 the city council approved its Structural Green Plan with resolution no. 724 Reg.G.C. dated 21/12/2023. This is a framework document that, based on an initial overall assessment of the state of public greenspace and the practices implemented in recent years, lays the foundations for the definition of strategies and future actions in this regard. It also provides for the
EST.2019.01.01 17:15:03

COMUNE DI BERGAMO

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

subsequent drafting of the Operational Green Plan. This plan is the tool that defines the principles and establishes the policy criteria for the creation of public green space within the general town planning policy. It also encourages investments in new works and maintenance work, as well as setting management priorities for the urban public green infrastructure system. There are currently 2,665,000 square metres of urban greenery managed by the city of Bergamo (an average of 22 square metres per citizen). This green space is spread extremely unevenly between the various districts of the city: the objective is to make it possible for all citizens to easily access nearby urban green space.

## Memorandum of Understanding for the Health Sector - "Health services and ecological transition: an alliance between institutions"

This is a memorandum of understanding concerning the health services sector that has been signed by the Municipality of Bergamo, the Order of Surgeons and Dentists - Bergamo (OMCEO), the Health Protection Agency (ATS), the local health authorities (ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, ASST Bergamo Est and ASST Bergamo Ovest), the University of Bergamo and the Mario Negri Institute of Pharmacological Research in Bergamo. This document foresees for the need to identify actions to reduce the ecological footprint of the healthcare sector: given that the healthcare sector as a whole is responsible for producing a significant amount of CO2 emissions (at least 5%), actions that go beyond the energy efficiency of the buildings and structures used in this sector are necessary. These should involve all healthcare professionals and the entire healthcare services management process in order to reduce their ecological footprint and improve the quality and safety of the care they provide. Private healthcare companies, too, will soon be given the opportunity to sign this memorandum of understanding.

## Memorandum of understanding for REC

During the council meeting held on the 21st of December 2023 (Resolution no. 741 Reg. G.C.), the Municipality of Bergamo approved the outline of the memorandum of understanding entitled "Protocollo d'intesa volto ad attività di studio, analisi e lo sviluppo di CACER sul territorio comunale di Bergamo" (Memorandum of understanding for the study, analysis and development of Self-consumption configurations for sharing renewable energy activities within the territory of Bergamo). The purpose of this is to analyse the technical, economic, financial, social and governance issues for the CACER, in line with changes to the regulatory and legislative framework at a European, national and regional level. The memorandum of understanding was proposed by the Municipality of Bergamo and signed by - CERESS S.r.l, A2A Calore &amp; Servizi S.r.l. and ENI Plenitude.

## Regional policies

## Regional Energy, Environment and Climate Programme (PREAC)

The purpose of the Regional Energy, Environment and Climate Programme (Programma Regionale Energia Ambiente e Clima - PREAC) is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 43.5 million tonnes by 2030 (excluding the sector subject to the ETS, Emissions Trading Scheme). In other words, a reduction of 43.8% compared to 2005. The objective of reducing GHG emissions can be achieved thanks to a 35.2% reduction in energy end-use demand and the production of energy from renewable sources equal to 35.8% of final energy consumption. This can be achieved by strengthening the quantitative objectives already indicated by the Guidelines of the Regional Council in line with policy developments at a national and European level. The Region of Lombardy approved the PREAC in 2022. The direction taken by the PREAC of the Region of Lombardy supports the actions undertaken by the Municipality of Bergamo as part of the "100 Carbon-neutral and smart cities" Mission and will act as a benchmark for the actions described in this Climate City Contract.

Regional Law 23 February 2022, no. 2 for the promotion and development of a system of Renewable Energy Communities (REC) in Lombardy. Towards energy autonomy.
RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR MONTHLY CENTRE DI BERGAMO
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Regional Law no. 2/2022 establishes certain measures for energy transition in the regional socio-economic system. It has set an objective of net carbon neutrality by 2050. More specifically, in order to encourage the production of energy from renewable sources, the Region of Lombardy supports the self-consumption of renewable energy and the creation of energy communities. It also identifies, among the various bodies within the regional system, the entity called the Comunità Energetica Regionale Lombarda (CERL) as responsible for providing technical assistance for the promotion and development of CERs. In 2022, the Municipality of Bergamo commissioned the Bergamo-based company Ceress to carry out a feasibility study concerning the creation of a Renewable Energy Community (REC).

## Regional Environmental Energy Programme (PEAR)

The Regional Environmental Energy Programme (Programma Energetico Ambientale Regionale - PEAR) is the regional strategic planning tool for energy and environmental matters. The Region of Lombardy will use this to establish its own energy saving and development objectives for renewable energy sources (RES) in line with the mandatory quotas for the use of RES assigned to each Region as part of the so-called "burden sharing" decree, and new Community Roadmap 2014-2020. The Region of Lombardy approved the PEAR in 2015.

## Regional Air Quality Intervention Plan (PRIA)

The Regional Air Quality Intervention Plan (Piano Regionale degli Interventi per la qualità dell'Aria - PRIA) is the planning and programming tool used by the Region of Lombardy to control air quality and reduce airborne emissions to protect the health of the population and the environment. The Region approved the PRIA in 2013 and the later updated version in 2018.

## Regional Strategy for Sustainable Development

This strategy sets out the objectives of Agenda 2030 and the National Strategy according to the characteristics, needs and opportunities of Lombardy. Taking into account the objectives set by European, national and regional policies and the current positioning of the region, it sets out the strategic objectives that the Region of Lombardy has undertaken to pursue in order to implement the principle of sustainable development, namely to satisfy the needs of present generations, without compromising its possibility of doing the same for future generations. The Region of Lombardy updated its Strategy for Sustainable Development in 2023 (drawing on the services of FLA and PoliS-Lombardia): approximately 70 targets have been identified, based on regional plans and programmes, together with over 200 indicators regarding the current progress towards each Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) in the region.

## Regional Mobility and Transport Programme (PRMT)

The Regional Mobility and Transport Programme (Programma Regionale della Mobilità e dei Trasporti - PRMT) is a tool that provides the framework for the future development of the infrastructure and services needed to ensure the mobility of people and goods within Lombardy. More specifically, this document provides guidelines for making infrastructural choices and reinforces the integrated planning of all services (rail and road transport, navigation and cycling mobility) in order to improve the quality of the offer and spending efficiency. The end goal is a Lombardy "connected with the world", that is competitive and accessible. The Region of Lombardy approved the PRMT in 2016, valid until 2020. The Municipality is involved in various actions in this area, including: the development of tariff integration, the adoption and spread of electronic ticketing, measures to promote sustainable mobility by reducing the circulation of high-impact vehicles, and initiatives to promote cycling (c.f. the Regional Cycling Mobility Plan).

The Regional Council approved its Regional Waste Management Programme (Programma Regionale Di Gestione dei Rifiuti - PRGR) by means of Regional Decree no. 1990 dated 20/06/2014. The PRGR includes the Regional Polluted Areas Programme (Programma Regionale delle Aree Inquinate - PRB) and relevant documents foreseen by the Strategic Environmental Assessment (Valutazione Ambientale Strategica - VAS). The technical implementation standards of the PRGR were updated by Regional Decree no. 7860 dated 12/02/2018, which also incorporates the provisions of the new Water Protection and Use Programme (Programma di Tutela e uso delle Acque - PTUA) and Flood Risk Management Plan (Piano di Gestione Rischio Alluvioni - PGRA), as well as other more recent regulations. Lastly, the Regional Council approved the revised PRGR, including the Regional Polluted Areas Programme (Programma delle Aree Inquinate - PRB) by Resolution no. 6408 dated 05/23/2022.

The aim of this programme is to favour the implementation of community strategies for sustainable development, and to act as a programming tool for the Region of Lombardy, allowing it to finalise and integrate all its policies relating to the prevention, recycling, recovery and disposal of waste, as well as the management of polluted sites requiring reclamation.

The most recent national policies and strategies of importance for the purposes of achieving climate neutrality that have been adopted by the Municipality of Bergamo are indicated in the table below. These have allowed the Municipality to take direct beneficial action.

The table above shows how – net of the contributions due to the “Reduced emissions through other existing Action Plans” (column 3) and the “Reduced emissions through the CCC” (column 5) – further reductions in emissions are required in order to reach the 80% reduced emissions target. More specifically, the difference in CO₂ emissions between the total emission gap in column 4 and that in column 5 amounts to approximately 89.130 tCO₂eq. The strategies identified to entirely reduce this quantity of emissions are described in detail in paragraph B-2.3.

Furthermore, it should be underlined that the AFOLU and IPPU sectors are not considered within the baseline as highlighted in column (1) Emissions from baseline in the table above: as reported in the GHG Inventory Baseline Guidance, they can be considered insignificant, and therefore excluded from the baseline, the sectors that do not exceed 5% of overall emissions. Since AFOLU and IPPU together account for 2% of the total, they were not included in the calculation of baseline emission.

# 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

Form A-3 details the stakeholders involved in drafting the document. All stakeholders who responded to the calls for an expression of interest by the Municipality of Bergamo in September and October are included here, the first addressed to internal stakeholders, the second to external stakeholders (non-municipal bodies). The events aimed at the stakeholders do not impose any constraints regarding adhesion to the Mission: the Municipality's prime goal is, as always, the large-scale spread and promotion of the project aimed at sparking a virtuous bottom-up participation process in future years. Not all the stakeholders, therefore, have presented actions that fall within the scope of this Action Plan and which will be presented in detail in the table below.

## A-3.1: Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

Below are details of the main barriers encountered by the individual partners participating in the Mission, as expressed during the process of collecting actions and investments using the specific forms.

Reflecting the sectors expressed by the NZC, these barriers are split into structural, political, economic and financial categories, both with regards to the process of reducing emissions and the use of capital to finance the Mission. Possible solutions are indicated for each barrier, with details of the specific actions that the Municipality and/or stakeholders are engaged in to achieve these.

## Transversal barriers

This section contains all those barriers that affect one or more of the relevant sectors within the Mission, i.e. across the board.

One of the most relevant barriers affecting all NZC sectors is that relating to the constantly changing political and regulatory framework for energy and climate transition at the European, national and regional levels.

This uncertainty makes it particularly complex for local actors to plan and finance any transition that requires wide-ranging planning and a long-term perspective. A good example of this is the implementing decree presented by the Italian government to the European Commission two years ago regarding self-consumed energy production within the so-called Renewable Energy Communities. The European Commission gave the green light to the decree in November this year, however we must wait to see what the Ministry's next steps will be when it comes to formally promulgating this decree.

Furthermore, unlike other European countries, Italy still has no specific Climate Law that defines, sector by sector, the actions and tools required at a national level in order to achieve climate neutrality. So there are currently no national provisions regarding the transfer of the various forms of economic development support for activities and actions that currently worsen the climate crisis to activities and actions aimed at climate change mitigation and adaptation. This reflects the low levels of interest in sustainability and the need for a shared, synergistic vision of the environmental problem.

In terms of possible solutions, the Municipality of Bergamo is working on developing effective multilevel governance to respond efficiently to the challenges posed by the Mission: this objective is pursued by all the cities involved within the Mission through the "Let'sGov" project, the aim of which is precisely that of identifying and overcoming the barriers that disregard the skills and potential offered by local actors and depend on supra-local levels, such as the political and regulatory framework.

The way stakeholders have been directly involved in the drafting of this document clearly shows how the actors have adopted a sectoral approach, both in terms of 'public' and 'external' sectors. The

complexity of creating synergies between different sectors that historically have a silo mentality is a real barrier for the Municipality of Bergamo, and it clearly needs to face this challenge if it wants to overcome sectoral logics and achieve effective and inclusive climate transition.

Another significant and critical issue is linked to the development of the electricity grid: indeed, at a national level, the current infrastructure is not capable of meeting the objectives of electrification of consumption and the production of renewable energy in line with the prospect of climate neutrality by 2030. This is why urgent action and investments are now needed to massively upgrade the electricity grid. Discussions are ongoing at a national level, involving all sector players, including Terna S.p.A., responsible for operating Italy's high voltage electricity grid and meeting the European objectives (including those of promoting the integration of renewable sources, increasing the level of security and resilience of the electricity system and investing in the digitalisation of the grid). Various problems are posed by the grid responsible for powering the city of Bergamo, with vast areas deemed to be 'critical' and/or at risk of saturation. This represents a considerable obstacle for local authorities, businesses (including agricultural firms interested in agri-voltaic initiatives) and citizens wishing to install photovoltaic systems of all shapes and sizes, as this risk being subject to delays and critical issues due to difficulties in connecting such systems to the electricity grid.

The Municipality of Bergamo wishes to minimise the impact of this problem by encouraging effective dialogue not only between all institutional levels and the institutional operators of the electricity grid, but also with private operators. In fact, the city has adopted bilateral agreements with private partners, for example that with A2A for district heating. Furthermore, there is the feasibility project that FRI EL GEO is currently involved in within the municipal area of Bergamo in order to provide the city with a geothermal energy source.

At a transversal level, it is worth remembering that economic and behavioural barriers have an additional impact.

Historically, Italy has shown little interest in the environment, meaning that the resources allocated for ecological transition are limited and hard to find, especially within local municipal budgets. It is only as a result of the interest shown at a European level since 2020 that considerable funds have now been allocated. The PNRR is just the most recent, aimed at the development of large infrastructures based on the principle of sustainability and cost-effectiveness. At a local level, the Municipality needs to boost its internal capacity to attract European and national public funding, such as through public and private partnerships aimed at creating notable synergy at a public and private level. Moreover, the activation of innovative financial instruments, such as self-financing in the case of RECs, also represents an opportunity for individual citizens to contribute to the ecological transition of the community as a whole.

The limited spread of a climate culture among our citizens and a lack of inclination to change lifestyle is, perhaps, the most alarming 'hidden' barrier on the path to achieving climate neutrality in the city. Indeed, although they may express their concerns and perplexities regarding climate change, citizens do not always seem willing to actually change their lifestyles. This lack of inclination should also be taken into account when preparing communications concerning ecological transition, as the language is often highly technical and not always immediately accessible. Here the Municipality should provide correct information and suitable education for all segments of the population, primarily within the school system by means of teaching and awareness-raising activities focussing on ecological transition, making savings and the circular economy.

Finally, another critical issue that has emerged at the transversal level is data availability: this is particularly so at the municipal level owing to the difficulties met in planning and monitoring energy transition at a local level. This barrier has the same urgency at both a public and private level. One such barrier is the designation of role managers: in the mobility sector, for example, the role of Mobility Manager has been mandatory at a public and private level since 2020 for municipal bodies with over 50,000 inhabitants and private companies with more than 100 employees. When it comes to planning activities relating to mobility, the Mobility Manager needs to access data and provide estimates within

the specified scope. Moreover, many Mission partners who are private companies have presented digital platforms and software for monitoring consumption and industrial processes: at a production level, the adoption of such solutions on a digital scale may prove useful in reducing consumption levels and improving production process efficiency.

## Barriers in the Buildings sector

As is the case in many Italian cities, Bergamo's historic town centre contains a large number of buildings subject to landscape and architectural restrictions, and therefore subject to specific authorisation procedures and the opinion of the competent executive department (Soprintendenza Archeologica, Belle Arti e Paesaggio). Any energy efficiency intervention that may affect the load-bearing structure of such 'listed' buildings becomes highly problematical, as does the installation of photovoltaic panels on their roofs. In order to avoid disturbance of the visual character of historic buildings, the Municipality should promote a new approach to the redevelopment of historic buildings, one that combines the preservation of the cultural and architectural heritage with good design practice to allow for the installation of renewable energy production plant.

To make such interventions faster to complete and more efficient, it might be a good idea to review and modify current regulations (local and regional regulations, at least).

As is widely known, energy efficiency interventions involve huge investments, with very little chance of short-term returns. This represents a barrier both for public authorities and for individual citizens and producers. The national economic incentives known as the "Bonus facciate" and the "110% Superbonus" (tax relief schemes for renovations) have failed to offset the general increase in prices and exorbitant expenses that have, in some cases, led to the suspension or even cancellation of redevelopment projects due to a lack of funds. Certain national construction constraints based on sustainability principles (the so-called Minimum Environmental Criteria - CAM) and linked to the broader sector of Nearly Zero Energy Buildings must be respected during the design and construction phases, resulting in a further increase in the overall costs.

The public system of subsidies and incentives aimed at improving energy efficiency needs to be strengthened in order meet the Mission objectives. This means economic aid in financing the transition to renewable sources and, at a cognitive level, campaigns to raise public awareness and provide information regarding the possibilities and what incentives are available.

## Barriers in the Mobility and Transport sector

The major barriers here are behavioural and cultural: resistance to change and a lack of awareness of how a person or entity's behaviour can have repercussions on the effectiveness of projects aimed at boosting local public transport and the development of soft mobility infrastructure. Mere economic incentives are often not enough to make more people use public transport: crowding, safety and punctuality are the most common faults mentioned by private citizens as the reasons why they prefer not to use public transport.

Alternatives to local public transport (such as car sharing) are not themselves problem free (e.g. availability during rush hours, integration in the use of IT platforms, road safety, etc.).

Citizens will play an active integral part in any transition involving all stakeholders: the Municipality and public bodies should promote public awareness campaigns, education in the schools, innovative sustainable mobility projects and intermodality, as well as bolstering alternative mobility services. All this should go hand in hand with a firm commitment on the part of the institutions to improve travel conditions and increase the availability of local public transport. The local transport company (ATB) will prove crucial in ensuring that the sustainable mobility goals are met at a municipal level. It will be required to act in synergy with all the local players in order to raise awareness of the issues at stake (including public employees, students and employees in the private sector).

The cost of making improvements to local infrastructure are often very costly: local administrations are only too well aware of this and are often unable to act due to high investment costs and their inability to find major sources of long-term financing. This barrier is linked to the one already discussed affecting the Buildings sector: both are linked to European, national and regional policies and governance aimed at supporting climate and energy transition, and to the ability of local governance to attract investment in ambitious long-term projects. Time constraints for the completion of financed interventions is a further challenge for local administrations planning innovative projects in this sector, as there are often long and complex bureaucratic procedures involved.

What is more, some of the barriers indicated by the local transport company (ATB) are rapid technological change and the high rates of replacement and servicing for electric, hybrid or hydrogen vehicles. Indeed, the life cycle of batteries is still a costly process in economic and environmental terms: it is hoped that this will become more efficient in the future, thanks also to technological innovation.

## Barriers in the Waste and Wastewater sector

The healthcare sector, in particular, produces huge amounts of waste: by its very nature it requires the use of disposable products and materials that then call for expensive disposal processes. Despite current **technical and procedural difficulties**, this sector is committed to reducing its use of disposable products and to purchasing more sustainable green products, as set out in a memorandum of understanding signed by all local entities with the Municipality. Even individual citizens can contribute in this regard by reducing the amount of waste they produce and adhering to the rules of the now mandatory door-to-door separate waste collection scheme run by the subsidiary Aprica S.p.A.

**Behavioural barriers** affecting citizens across the board have a major impact the effectiveness of waste disposal schemes. It is hoped that communication (public education and awareness campaigns) and support (appropriate tools and widespread actions across the territory, including in schools and companies) may improve this situation. It is also important that the Municipality encourages and introduces good reuse and recycling practices as this can break down barriers and increase awareness of the benefits of a circular economy.

In terms of waste water treatment, the Municipality of Bergamo benefits from having a highly valued partner: Uniacque S.p.A. This utility company operates both inside and outside the municipal territory and has made significant innovative advances in wastewater treatment processes despite all the red tape that often leads to delays in obtaining authorisation and undertaking projects dependant on public funding, and **laws and regulations** that sometimes create obstacles for hi-tech experimental plants. Added to this are the **barriers of technical and plant complexity**, which are not always predictable.

## Barriers in the IPPU sector

Given the reduced importance of the Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) sector within the municipal territory, only one main barrier is worth mentioning here: **the availability of funds** for projects often involving huge investments, production stoppages and a quantifiable medium-long term return on investment. Only a few of the actions in question here are actual plans: the majority are feasibility studies due to these difficulties in getting approval for projects, even in the private sector.

## Barriers in the AFOLU sector

Given the urban nature of the city of Bergamo, there are clear physical and territorial limits for the development of projects related to Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Uses (AFOLU): historically, the city mostly dates back to an era when green spaces were all kept outside the city limits.

Consequently, re-greening schemes must include concrete spaces and buildings (e.g. green roofs and green walls) in order to increase green spaces and peri-urban forestry. Areas such as these within the urban fabric can help minimise the problem of heat islands.

As with the other sectors already considered, it is again crucial that private stakeholders are involved in re-greening schemes and the planting of new plants and tree species.

The table below lists the various external stakeholders and municipal departments and their respective areas of interest. Overall, XX municipal departments and XX external stakeholders are involved. Most of the external stakeholders are involved as the result of the call for an expression of interest in creating territorial synergies and tackling the challenge of climate neutrality together that was intended for all local actors whose actions have a direct or indirect impact on the municipal area of Bergamo. The role to be played by citizens should also not be overlooked: widespread involvement of the population is a key element for the success of the Climate Mission. The Municipality of Bergamo is actively engaged in involvement, engagement and training initiatives aimed at various segments of the population, starting with primary schools.

To guarantee the transparency of the Climate City Contract project, the Municipality has entered into a partnership a Bergamo based provider of technological solutions for sustainable digital transition, SuperUrbanity, for the creation of a platform to ensure visibility for the citizens, the actors involved and the projects still in the pipeline that fall within the Climate Mission.

# 3 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

This module presents the various impact pathways that the actions contained in the Action Plan will help create within the territory of the city of Bergamo in each sector (Energy systems, Mobility and transport, Built environment, Waste and the circular economy, Green infrastructures and NBS). The objective of the Theory of Change, on which this section is based, is to show the transversal effects that individual actions can have, starting with the systemic levers of change set out in the Theory itself. The impact pathways are organised by the levers of change to which the various actions refer. These levers are: Technology, Governance, Social Innovation, Democracy and participation, Finance and investments, Training and information.

# 3.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

In order to shed light on the synergies between the various actions and their respective impacts, the table below includes details of the expected short/long-term changes and how these are directly/indirectly linked to other initiatives within the same sector or other sectors. The chosen layout shows any causal connections between each expected change and the necessary preconditions for each change. The systemic development of the Theory of Change is a demanding challenge for the Administration and all the bodies involved in the Mission compared to the development of just a single project or programme, as it necessarily involves different organisations and groups of actors working across different sectors and in different contexts.

## B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

All six levers set out above are pertinent to their corresponding fields of action. Nevertheless, the impact of each lever may vary substantially depending on the particular field of action and even more so as the prevailing conditions change in the future.

Indirect impacts concern a complex mix of impacts, ranging from improvements in quality of life to improved air quality, better competitiveness of specific sectors, the spread of sustainable practices among the population and reduced dependence on fossil fuels. These are some of the benefits that such actions offer.

## 3.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

The Municipality of Bergamo has been engaged for some time now in planning and implementing concrete actions within its municipal territory aimed at mitigating GHG emissions by means of specific plans and strategies.

This chapter shows the individual actions that the stakeholders involved at a territorial level have contributed to the Mission. The added value of the CCC compared to the plans already in place is the identification of the individual actions planned since 2021 (SECAP baseline year) and lasting until 2030. To provide a full picture of each stakeholder's contribution, we have included an analysis of any future actions currently being considered. Indeed, the broad time horizon of this document means that these can be deemed to all intents and purposes as actions that contribute to a reduction in the city's GHG emissions.

The action portfolio is the result of a co-planning process initiated by the Municipality of Bergamo together with stakeholders active in the area, as described in detail in Module C-1. This work, conducted in a synergistic manner between all actors, has led to the identification not only of the actions and impacts on the city, but also the barriers and opportunities for the specific sectors involved within the territory, as illustrated in Module A-3.

Overall, the Municipality has attracted the involvement of 40 public and private stakeholders, operating both within the city itself and in the peri-urban areas. One specific characteristic that has emerged is the presence of a large network of companies and stakeholders who operate within the city of Bergamo or in partnership with it, but are physically based outside the municipal border. To take into account those who have expressed an interest in the Climate Mission and provided contributions consistent with the objectives of climate neutrality, Table B-2.2d details all the actions presented by stakeholders operating outside the municipal boundaries without considering their actual contribution in terms reduced $\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{eq}}$ emissions, precisely because they are based outside the city limits.

Following the indications of the Net Zero Cities platform, the actions will now be divided into the following sectors: Buildings, Transport, Waste and Wastewater, IPPU (Industrial processes and product use) and AFOLU (agriculture, forestry and other land uses). The Transversal sector has also been included for the sake of completeness, as this includes actions and initiatives with impacts on more than just one of the above sectors.

Each action is also categorised, according to the NZC convention, as a measurable, behavioural or policy/governance action. Measurable actions are those directly quantifiable in terms of GHG emissions and/or at an economic level. Behavioural actions, on the other hand, are related to training and/or sociocultural events which can lead to changes in lifestyle and increase sensitivity and awareness of issues linked to the objectives of the Mission. Finally, policy/governance actions are those that directly impact the policies, rules and innovation of the governance of the municipal territory.

To provide a fuller picture of each action, the attached Table B-2.1 will contain an extended description, dividing them by sector as above.

The actions presented in Table B-2.2A are measurable, while those in Table B-2.2B are also measurable, but still under consideration or in the process of being implemented, taken into consideration in the overall $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reduction budget and fully included in the pathway towards reduced $\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{eq}}$ emissions within the broader timeframe envisaged by this document; Table B-2.2C, on the other hand, is dedicated to behavioural actions, including both actions by the Municipality of Bergamo and those presented by Mission partners. Finally, Table B-2.2D lists the actions of partners located outside the city that do not contribute to reduced CO2 emissions within the municipal border.

These tables indicate the intervention timeframe for each intervention. These actions may have already been approved by the respective actors, are close to being introduced, or still in the process of being implemented. At an impact level, evidence is provided for each action of the equivalent reduction in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, calculated according to the Net Zero Cities methodology. The value indicated in the "CO₂eq reduction" column is the result of using the methodology that, starting with the action data provided by the stakeholders, expresses the contribution of each single action to a reduction in baseline emissions on the basis of the conversion factors already explained in Module A. In some cases, the value of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$ reduction indicated by a stakeholder has been adopted after checking the calculation methodology used.

"N.A." (Not Available) or "-" refers to the fact that the specific value has not been provided by the relevant stakeholder, but the action has still been taken in consideration because deemed relevant. More precise data should be available after monitoring these projects until 2030.

This document does not mention the investment per action by external stakeholders, as this will be detailed in the Investment Plan, which will indicate the actual amount of investment (where available) made by each stakeholder and for each action. Investments by municipal departments are always reported (where available).

Overall, the city has collected 217 total actions, split as follows:

85 actions in the Buildings sector
32 actions in the Transport sector
5 actions in the AFOLU sector
30 actions in the Waste sector
65 actions in the Transversal sector

The individual actions are listed individually and analysed in the following tables. The actions proposed by the Municipality of Bergamo are expressed by referring directly to the competent departments, namely the Mobility, Ecology and Environment department, the Schools/Sports Facilities department, the Education, Instruction and Youth Project department, the Major Works and Redevelopment department, the Health and Safety in the Workplace department, the Public Green Space department, the Educational Services department and the Guarantor for Children's Rights.

The table below lists the behavioural actions by public and private stakeholders for which it has not been possible to estimate a direct reduction in emissions. This means that the table only provides the name of each action followed by a brief description. As will also be indicated in Module C, given the commitment shown by the municipal administration and the stakeholders to awareness and training actions for citizens, this type of action will be calculated on the basis of the Environmental Energy Agency methodology (https://www.eea.europa.eu) as representing 20% of the city's CO₂ emissions reduction target.

neutrality by 2030. The reason why the Municipality has decided to include the individual actions and their respective stakeholders as signatories of the document – despite not contributing to the overall reduction in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions as they do not satisfy the territoriality requirement – is that it wants to create an inclusive virtuous ecosystem where the actions of each subject can stimulate and share good practices for all subjects, regardless of whether they operate inside or outside the municipal borders.

# B-2.3: Summary action strategy for reaching the reduction target emission of the SECAP baseline

This paragraph introduces the main strategies that the Municipality of Bergamo intends to implement over the next few years in order to achieve its climate neutrality objectives by 2030. Where possible, the corresponding emissions and costs have been quantified for each of these strategies. Please refer to the results of future monitoring of this document regarding the costs and emissions of strategies not estimated here.

# Strategy for the installation of photovoltaic systems to generate green energy

The total surface area of the roofs on civil and industrial buildings within the territory has been analysed in order to estimate the potential for the installation of photovoltaic systems within the city limits. Accordingly, within the municipal territory of Bergamo, the total surface area of roofs on industrial building is approximately  $1.2750000\mathrm{m}^2$ , while that of roofs on civil buildings amounts to approximately  $2.906.000\mathrm{m}^2$ . It is estimated that  $30\%$  of the roofs in this second subset are on listed buildings, and so excluded from our calculations of those potentially suitable for the installation of photovoltaic modules. As a result,  $30\%$  of the surface area has had to be subtracted from the overall figure for roofs on civil buildings.

The scenario that the Administration expects to achieve by 2030 is based on the following hypotheses:

$80\%$  of industrial roofing and just  $33\%$  of the roofs on civil buildings (i.e., net of listed buildings) are suitable for the installation of photovoltaic modules;
The net surface area of the roofs currently occupied by photovoltaic modules is  $47\%$  (industrial buildings) and  $52\%$  (civil buildings) of the total suitable surface area.

Given the aforementioned hypotheses, the estimated scenario envisages a net surface area occupied by photovoltaic modules equal to  $38\%$  of the total roofs on industrial buildings and  $17\%$  of the total roofs on civil buildings.

Using the methodology mentioned above, we can use this scenario to calculate that the total power that could be installed on the roofs in the city of Bergamo, net of the systems already in place in 2021, will amount to approximately  $174.000\mathrm{kW_p}$ , which corresponds to an estimated annual production of roughly 208.820 MWh/a, having considered an hypothetical average annual output of 1.200 kWh/kWp.

Therefore, the estimated potential saving in terms of tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{eq}}$  comes to 59.514 tCO $_{2\mathrm{eq}}$ /a.

# - Electrification of consumption in the tertiary and residential sectors

Excluding the interventions already included in the SECAP, the strategy for the electrification of the tertiary and residential sectors also involves the installation of heat pumps based on the targets in the Regional Energy, Environment and Climate Programme (PREAC) to reduce annual heat consumption by  $2.9\%$  per annum in the tertiary sector and  $0.7\%$  per annum in the residential sector. According to PREAC predictions, the replacement of conventional boilers with heat pumps will generate savings of approximately 69.000 MWh/a in natural gas (methane) and other fossil energy sources. The installation of heat pumps will necessarily lead to an increase in electricity consumption, estimated to be about 23.000 MWh/a. Changes in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions are linked to these consumptions, which we have estimated as follows:

Reduction in emissions linked to fossil energy sources (methane, LPG and diesel): 10.569 tCO $_{2eq}$ /annum in the tertiary sector; 3.532 tCO $_{2eq}$ /annum in the residential sector.
Increase in emissions due to increased consumption of electricity: 5.436 tCO $_{2eq}$ /annum in the tertiary sector; 1.636 tCO $_{2eq}$ /annum in the residential sector.

In light of this, the net value of overall reduced  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions through the electrification strategy in the Tertiary sector comes to 5.633 tCO $_{2eq}$ /annum. Likewise, the Residential sector will see a reduction in overall emissions of 1.896 tCO $_{2eq}$  per annum.

# Increased energy efficiency of the industrial sector

In order to increase the energy efficiency of the industrial sector, the municipal administration has a strategy to meet the scenario envisaged by the regional energy, environment and climate programme (PREAC), which foresees a  $35\%$  reduction in natural gas consumption and an  $8\%$  increase in electricity consumption (excluding the increase in installed photovoltaic power, already considered in the strategy above). Starting with the consumption data for this sector indicated in the SECAP baseline, the Municipality envisages various types of interventions, such as measures to increase the energy efficiency of processes, interventions on the outer surfaces and other aspects of systems and plant, and the electrification of consumption. It estimates that these will lead to an overall reduction in consumption of approximately 68.323 MWh/a, net of the increase in electricity consumption as a result of the electrification interventions.

In view of this, the overall net reduction in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions in the industrial sector will be roughly 13.000 tCO $_{2eq}$ /a.

# - Strategy for waste management in the municipal area: new call for tenders in order to award the waste management service contract

In the spring of 2024, the Municipality of Bergamo intends to launch a call for tenders in order to award a contract for the municipal waste management service and ancillary cleaning services. This contract will have a duration of seven years, with the option of renewal every two years thereafter, taking into account the minimum environmental criteria for the awarding of municipal waste management services set out in the current national action plan on green public procurement (PANGPP). Among the most relevant elements of the tender, which all form part of the Municipality's strategy for efficient and transparent municipal waste management, are the following points:

One of the contractor's obligations is to guarantee a minimum percentage of separate waste collection of  $78\%$  within the first calendar year and  $80\%$  in the second year.
Based on the regional waste plan, the following recovery goals are envisaged from 2027 onwards:

EU municipal waste recycling  $&gt;67.8\%$
packaging recycling  $&gt;78.7\%$
separate waste collection  $&gt;83.3\%$
municipal waste reduction  $&gt;8.9\%$
residual municipal waste production per capita 73 kg/inhabitant per annum;
selection waste  $&gt; - 30\%$
recycling waste  $&gt; - 20\%$

In the event of any failure to achieve these objectives, which will also be verified by means of product analysis, the contractor will be asked to come up with an improvement plan, agreed with the Municipality, in order to optimise the collection system by reducing the quantities of non-compliant material. This might include measures to optimise the distribution of bins, increase collection frequencies, strengthen the collection control plan, adapt the communication plan for users and anything else deemed necessary. Other obligations for the contractor will be communication and awareness activities for citizens regarding, for instance, how to prevent waste production by pointing out how following the correct methods for conferring particular types of waste can be useful and add value.

The contractor's vehicles and equipment must also meet efficiency criteria, particularly when it comes to tackling fine dust particles.

The overall annual cost of the contract amounts to €21.111.170 (including VAT), with a seven-year starting price of €147.781.900.

No specific studies have been conducted regarding reduced emissions: please refer to later monitoring versions of this document for evidence of this, if available.

E-Plan: development of private electric mobility and related infrastructure
7

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

A negotiated procedure was published in July 2021 for the assignment of the task of drafting a plan for the development of electric mobility (Piano per lo sviluppo della Mobilità Elettrica) in the Municipality of Bergamo based on the indications already set out in the PUMS. The plan includes the following specific interventions:

Installation of infrastructure for charging electric vehicles: approximately 90 EV charging points are to be installed within the municipal area in 2024-2026
Installation of EV charging points in the transport hub car parks around the edge of the municipal territory
Pre-installation of private charging infrastructure (Wall Box)
Incentives for the installation of EV charging points at private company headquarters
Subsidies when adopting e-mobility for company, logistics and goods vehicles

These actions are, to all intents and purposes, a very important strategy for the city, one that is being promoted heavily by the municipal administration, as can be seen in the SECAP and the actions collected during the drafting phase of the CCC. For this reason, no further reductions in emissions have been estimated to avoid double counting of reductions in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions. The electrification of private mobility is a key element in the Transport sector and the Municipality will be focusing on this in the coming years, through direct incentives and the strengthening of sharing platforms.

**Strategies for the digitalisation of municipal public services**

As part of the PNRR Mission "Digitalisation, Innovation, Competitiveness and Culture", the Municipality of Bergamo is planning interventions to boost the digitalisation of its services and enable digital applications and so improve public access to public administration data. As for the PNRR deadlines, the budgeting period only goes as far as 2026. Some of the interventions presented below are in the process of being started, but will only be implemented properly in the two-year period 2024-2026 (apart from the action concerning the migration of local PAs to the cloud, as this task is yet to be assigned). No estimate of the potential reduction in $\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{eq}}$ due to these digital innovation and digitalisation actions is currently available.

|  Intervention | State of play | PNRR funding  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Enabling cloud migration for local PAs | Not started | €1.031.574  |
|  Citizen experiences of municipal public services | Started | €398.397  |
|  Pago PA platform adopted | Started | €96.145  |
|  IO App adopted | Started | €45.060  |
|  Digital notifications platform | Started | €69.000  |
|  Total |  | €1.640.176  |

In addition to PNRR actions, the Municipality of Bergamo is also engaged in various digital activities in several sectors in order to optimise its management of services (for example waste and the heating of buildings), with a secondary, but no less relevant, result being a reduction in emissions.

**Partnerships with companies, A2A and REA for the recovery of thermal heat from industrial processes**

Project to recover heat from the Dalmine waste-to-energy plant: in order to increase the amount of heat that can be supplied by the overall city's district heating system, a connection is planned between the Bergamo district heating plant and the REA waste-to-energy plant in Dalmine in order to fully exploit the heat produced there. Timeline: activation of heat recovery starting in the 2024-2025 thermal season (October 2024) Target: an incremental increase in the amount of heat produced as a

function of the number of buildings connected to the network (upon completion of the expansion of the district heating network, there will be a 50% increase in heat compared to 2020).

Owing to the strategic value of this action, not enough data has been collected to estimate the potential reduction in CO₂ emissions. This is a virtuous action that the Municipality will monitor in future editions of this document and, where possible, will provide quantitative evidence in terms of reduced emissions.

**Strategy for the development of the circular economy**

The Municipality has a long history of environmental policies, as has been amply described in the sections on policies. The move away from a linear economy towards a circular economy is of fundamental importance for anyone, including the city of Bergamo, wishing to pursue ambitions regarding climate action, nature protection and sustainability. It is equally important in benefiting innovation, growth and employment.

The concept of circularity touches on various points, such as: the reduced use of resources, with less material used to create products or provide services; the extended use of resources, by optimising resource use and increasing product life through durable design; the use of materials and services capable of extending the life of goods, together with their reuse, repair and regeneration; the use of regenerative raw materials to replace fossil fuels and non-renewable materials with renewable energies and materials, thus safeguarding the natural capital and ecosystem services.

The current vision of the city's Circular Economy Plan has a time horizon of eight years, meaning it goes beyond the end of 2030, in line with the deadlines of this document and the objectives of the Climate Mission.

The city's circular economy plan focuses on three main areas:

Construction (recovery and re-purposing of existing property, new buildings with especial attention on those undergoing de-construction and demolition, as well as on the design and choice of materials and in situ technologies);
Food (production and disposal of waste, reduction of upstream losses, and maximised downstream circularity);
Consumer goods (recovery, reuse, repair and resale of objects)

The document has a purely strategic value, but provides strong guidelines for the projects planned both by the Municipality and by the external partners involved. Many of the actions included in the Circular Economy Plan have been included in the CCC (for instance, the "Chorus Life" and "Porta Sud" regenerative building interventions, the requalification of the new "Palazzetto dello Sport" indoor stadium and the "GAMeC" modern art museum, the various projects to reduce food waste including "Food Trails" and the new city food policy, and interventions to boost the recycling and reuse centres). Where possible, their impact on reduced emissions has been quantified.

The whole circular economy strategy is not quantifiable in terms of CO₂eq. However, this represents a growth model for the city to well beyond 2030.

In light of this strategy (not currently directly quantifiable in terms of reduced emissions) and the digitalisation strategy, not to mention the other strategies above (for which their impacts on emissions are known but not easily quantifiable), we estimate an overall additional reduction in emissions equal to 15% of the value of these strategies.

In the future, these strategies, together with the adoption of new strategies or the strengthening of current strategies, will also lead to a gradual reduction in residual emissions for which a specific "hard to abate" project is not currently possible. Nevertheless, they still affect those sectors with the most impact on local emissions: buildings and transport.

Therefore, after analysing the strategies presented here, the Municipality of Bergamo estimates a quantified reduction of 80.043 tCO2eq per annum plus a further  $15\%$  for those strategies that are not, at present, directly quantifiable.

This contributes to the reduction in the initial baseline: the graph below illustrates this reduction and its specific components.

SECAP actions: a reduction of 111.903 tCO $_{2eq}$  per annum thanks to actions implemented within the SECAP time horizon of 2030;
CCC actions: a reduction of 96.985 tCO $_{2eq}$  per annum through actions collected from stakeholders within the Municipality and externally through the Climate City Contract.
Behavioural actions: based on the NZC guidelines, the potential energy savings arising from behavioural measures can vary from a minimum of  $2\%$  to a maximum of  $20\%$ , in agreement with the European Environment Agency; the Municipality of Bergamo, as per Module C of this document, has presented actions and initiatives of such a kind that it has decided to estimate their weight as equal to  $20\%$  of the emissions reduction target (80% of the baseline total).
Municipal strategic actions: as indicated in the paragraph above, these account for an estimated reduction in emissions of 92.050 tCO $_{2eq}$  per annum.
Delta GAP: zero.

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)
Figure B.1 Composition of the SECAP Baseline reduction

With the strategies implemented for 2030, the Administration exceeds the climate neutrality objective of reducing baseline emissions by  $80\%$ : the result is higher than the baseline emissions reduction target, effectively decreasing a part (2,925 tCO2eq) of  $20\%$  of residual emissions.

# 3.3 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

The following table shows the reference target values for 2025, 2027 and 2030: these are an estimate of what might be expected in terms of improved technology, infrastructure and awareness of the entire city ecosystem towards the issues of carbon neutrality.

Rather than present a macro-estimate for each individual sector, the Municipality has preferred to list just some of the strategic projects for the specific sector.

B-3.1: Impact Indicators

Further details of the individual indicators specified above are provided below.

The bike sharing service indicator has been taken directly from the ATB website. In partnership with the German company nextbike, ATB (Bergamo's local transport company) was entrusted with running the sharing service in January 2022, including the creation of 68 docking stations and the provision of both conventional push-pedal bicycles and electric pedal-assist bicycles aimed at encouraging bike travel between the town centre and the old walled city (Città Alta). The role played by bicycles within the territory is considerable not just for citizens, but also tourists: the city saw a significant increase in tourist flows in 2023 when it was Capital of Culture 2023. In fact, there were just over 2,5 million visitors to the city and the province of Bergamo as a whole during the first 10 months of 2023.

The use of alternative mobility goes hand in hand with the development of adequate cycling infrastructure: the city's strategic plan for cycling mobility (Piano strategico per la mobilità ciclistica - also known as "Biciplan") published in September 2022 contains the cycling guidelines that the municipal administration first introduced in 2012. Indeed, existing cycle infrastructure has increased from 77 km in 2014 to 90 km in 2022. The administration wants to boost the cycling infrastructure in order to increase its usage in the city. An equally important element in this regard is the safety and maintenance of the existing infrastructure.

The Municipality of Bergamo is focusing on the electrification of the territory, as can be seen from the installed photovoltaic power targets. Added to this, another crucial element is the electrification of transport, and private transport in particular: the target is to install a minimum of 30 EV charging points every year. This figure is deliberately conservative, given current technological and regulatory barriers. However, the city is also committed to be simplifying the rules and regulations, and plans to make various interventions to ensure adequate provision of electricity throughout the territory.

ATB Servizi S.p.A., the local public transport operator in Bergamo, recorded 26 million passengers in 2022 (21 million in 2021) on its road and funicular network. This figure also includes those lines that cover the extra-urban area, as it has not been possible to separate the purely city data from the extra-urban data. Furthermore, according to its corporate turn over plan, this company expects that all its vehicles will be electric by 2030 (58,6% of the fleet is currently diesel free). This electrification goal involves the purchase of 131 new buses, of which 52 will be electric, 63 methane (bio-gas) and 16 methane/electric hybrids. This plan started in 2022 with the delivery of the first 2 electric buses. A further 17 methane buses will be added in the coming months. Most of the new electric buses will be purchased between 2025 and 2030.

With regard to green space planning, design and management, the figure for green square metres per inhabitant comes from the city's own green space plan (Piano del verde comunale): these data are inclusive of the "Parco dei Colli" area, in the north-west of the city, and the "Villaggio Sposi" area, at present an undeveloped area but which is earmarked for the construction of buildings used for ERS after a change in use. Finally, in order to improve air quality, the municipal administration has planned the planting of 20.000 new trees over the next 7 years.

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

The purpose of this section is to outline the enabling interventions, i.e. those relating to organisational or collaborative governance models and social innovations designed to support and enable the portfolio of proposed climate actions and to achieve the co-benefits already described in the impact pathway.

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

This module describes the governance innovations that the city of Bergamo has put in place to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The innovations in institutional planning, leadership and the collaboration and awareness processes are detailed below. These include both internal interventions regarding the municipal administration and those concerning external stakeholders involved in the Mission.

We will begin by shedding light on the participatory governance model that the city has adopted in order to facilitate the goal of climate neutrality, known as the **Transition Team**. This working party has guaranteed horizontal involvement between city institutions and the various municipal sectors involved, as well as ensuring the accountability of the main levels of city government.

Below are the main interventions of social innovation that are classed as actions with a direct impact on our ability to meet the goals of the Mission.

### C-1.1: Description or visualisation of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

The construction of a solid mandate for the transition to zero emissions by 2030 requires the involvement of the entire territory. Multiple actors, both within and outside the Municipality, have been involved in the process. The first step taken by the Municipality of Bergamo regarding the Mission was to set up the **Transition Team**.

Responsibility for the governance of the Mission within the municipal administration lies with the Ecology and Environment Department, with four officials and a manager already actively involved. The Ecology and Environment Department also provides the **Climate Transition Manager**, in the person of the Head of Department, as already indicated in the Climate Transition Strategy (STC). In addition to this figure, the **Mobility Manager** and the **Energy Manager** of the Municipality of Bergamo are also members of the Transition Team.

The other departments of the Municipality were involved by appointing a **contact person for each**. These departments include: Mobility and Transport, Public Green, Botanical Garden, Buildings and Monuments, Technological Systems, School and Sports Buildings, Major Requalification Works, Contracts and Tenders, Planning of administrative activities and public works, Network structures and hydraulic works, Housing Service, Heritage, and European Planning. The Mayor directly has involved all the sectors to ensure full engagement. At a political level, both the **Mayor** and the **Councillor** for the Environment and Mobility are actively involved.

The Municipality of Bergamo also drew on the external support of the **NetZeroCities Platform**, **TerrAria** and **AESS**.

NetZeroCities advisors provided support during the drafting of the documentation, involving discussions and remote working sessions to better direct the drafting process.

TerrAria, an external consultant for the Environmental, Energy and E-Government departments, acts as the Energy Manager for the Municipality of Bergamo and has been responsible for drafting the Municipality's own Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP).

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

AESS (the Agency for Energy and Sustainable Development) was tasked with supporting the implementation of the Action and Investment Plans, including all document drafting actions, which involved, by way of example, one-to-one meetings with stakeholders, creation of the portfolio of actions and their analysis in terms of emissions reduction and investments, identification of barriers and opportunities for transition to zero emissions, identification of lines of governance and overall planning (including strategy) for climate neutrality, and analysis of impact pathways.

The Transition Team, when extended to all actors within the city involved in the Mission, becomes the Urban Ecosystem. It includes: citizens, the public and private sector, trade associations, and the world of research and education.

As a first step, the internal sectors of the Municipality of Bergamo likely to have the greatest contribution to achieving climate neutrality were invited to join the Transition Team, a move that was also of crucial importance in consolidating the Team's impact within the Municipality.

On the 13th of September 2023, the selected sectors (the Environment Directorate, the Public Green and Mobility Directorate, the General Directorate, the Buildings and Systems Directorate, the School and Sports Construction and Public Requalification Works Directorate, the Tender Management, Procurement, Public Works, Infrastructure and Roads Directorate, the Human Resources, Associated Safety in the Workplace Department, Heritage and Public Housing Department Directorate, the Urban Planning and Private Construction Directorate, and SUEAP) were invited to an event at the Bergamo Council Chamber for a presentation of the Climate City Contract, the working methodology, the first macro actions to be identified and the involvement of the Municipality's sectors in the co-creation of a portfolio of actions and the analysis of barriers and opportunities for climate neutrality.

Details of these presentations were then sent to each sector, together with an action collection form which they were asked to fill in with behavioural and measurable actions, strategies, plans and guidelines which would then become part of the portfolio itself.

AESS supported the Municipality during this phase and during the subsequent one-to-one in-depth analysis with each sector.

On the 30th of August 2023, the Municipality passed a managerial resolution to approve its Public Announcement of an Expression of Interest for the identification of stakeholders (large companies, SMEs, startups, third sector bodies, universities, research centres, etc.) to sign the Climate City Contract of the City of Bergamo, within the "100 carbon Neutral &amp; smart cities" EU Mission. This Expression of Interest, published that same day, required potential stakeholders to express their willingness to join the pathway and invited them to a public event to be held on the 11th of October 2023.

Said meeting duly took place on the 11th of October 2023 in the Council Chamber in Palazzo Frizzoni, and was attended by 16 local organisations, including companies, third sector bodies, associations and public bodies.

This event was followed by in-depth one-to-one meetings for the co-creation of the action portfolio.

Some stakeholders (such as A2A S.p.A., Edison next and ATB – Azienda Trasporti Bergamo), that is those who play an important role within the territory and who immediately showed strong interest in becoming part of the Mission, were involved from the very beginning of the process, as their actions are deemed to have a strong impact on the territory in terms of innovation and reduced CO2eq emissions. Actions concerning the development of the city's district heating network, the electrification of public transport and climate-neutral urban regeneration.

This Expression of Interest can be considered as an action not only of innovative governance, in full compliance with inclusion and transparency principles and the New Code of Public Contracts 2023 (Legislative Decree no. 36 dated 31/03/2023), but also of social innovation due to the involvement of local actors across the board.

## Citizen involvement

The current Regulation no. 22 of the Municipality of Bergamo which regulates the methods of participation, recognises civic participation as a fundamental method for taking urban transformation decisions and for promoting social inclusion. Participation here means the maximum involvement of individual citizens or associations, social groups and economic actors, according to criteria for adequate diffusion, continuity and structuring, whilst still respecting the needs for the speed and transparency of procedure.

Involvement also means co-planning with citizens. This occurred when drafting the climate transition strategy (STC). As part of the participatory process for the Malpensata district, citizens living in the area were involved in designing an area that would turn from a car park into an integral part of a city park thanks to land reclamation and subsequent de-paving activities.

This initiative is an example of the participation process for urban planning tools, as variously foreseen by state and regional regulations, by the implementation tools referred to in the Transformation Areas in the Plan Document, by integrated programmes, by district contracts, by urban recovery plans and sector plans of urban or territorial relevance. This means that the involvement of external stakeholders hoped for by the Municipality of Bergamo is transversal, i.e. it cuts across the specific municipal tools. The participatory model will also involve plans/programmes that have already been approved, but are subject to substantial variant modifications. It will need to be commensurate with the territorial scale in question: in the case of the Malpensata district, citizens living within the area itself were involved, while projects of a broader scope will see more transversal involvement.

Finally, careful comparison with the work carried out by TerrAria regarding the SECAP is needed to find the points of contact between the SECAP itself and the CCC. AESS performed all the technical activities required to establish the baseline, calculate the emission gap, identify potential scenarios for climate neutrality, analyse the potential for innovative governance models, and pinpoint levers and barriers in close collaboration with the Municipality of Bergamo.

The action portfolio was, as mentioned above, co-created by the overall Urban Ecosystem.

The Municipality of Bergamo was also able to involve a large number of stakeholders totalling 40 private entities and 10 municipal sectors through the work carried out by the Transition Team.

Due to its unique existence at a national level, the involvement of the Guarantor of Child Rights is of special importance, together with the specific involvement of the local healthcare sector through a memorandum of understanding between the healthcare bodies and the Municipality of Bergamo.

The Guarantor of Children's Rights is a figure within the Municipality that is committed to promulgating sustainable practices aimed at minors and families through a website designed in collaboration with the Municipal Administration itself and other awareness campaigns for paediatricians and schools.

More specifically, there is already a specific section called “Environment and Health” on the website (https://bambiniegenitori.bergamo.it/ambiente-e-salute) where documents and proposals, leaflets or posters for use by the families of minors can be posted for information purposes. The contents of this section are consistent with the themes of the Mission. These include, for instance, the actions undertaken by the Municipality to improve air quality in the city; a letter from Italian paediatricians to promote the importance of access for minors to natural environments and the need to rethink and plan our cities to guarantee this right; an appeal by the Italian associations of paediatricians, and signed by the Guarantor, to stimulate local administrators to make decisions to protect children and the environment against air pollution.

There is also a close look at the Memorandum of Understanding for the healthcare sector that the Municipality of Bergamo agreed and signed together with seven other sector players within the territory. These partners are listed below. Some of them are also signatories to the CCC, being responsible for actions and contributions consistent with the objectives of the Mission.

Ordine dei Medici Chirurghi e Odontoiatri di Bergamo (Order of Surgeons and Dentists - Bergamo)
ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII (Local health authority - Hospital)
ASST Bergamo Est (Local health authority - East)
ASST Bergamo Ovest (Local health authority - West)
ATS di Bergamo (Public health service - Bergamo)
Bergamo University
Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri (Mario Negri Institute of Pharmacological Research)

The urgent need to address the climate emergency with concrete actions has raised awareness in the healthcare sector, especially since this sector contributes significantly to air emissions. The aim of the memorandum of understanding is to go beyond the work to make buildings more energy efficient which, although necessary and commendable, represents just a small part of the overall emissions in this sector (around 10% of the overall total). In this regard and by virtue of this memorandum of understanding, the parties have undertaken to draw up a specific road map setting out the actions they intend to pursue in order to achieve the goals of international climate agreements. On the basis of the relative environmental impact and their importance according to the scientific community, 6 specific areas of work have been identified. The healthcare companies undertake to appoint a manager for each of these and to establish the concrete actions they intend to implement in order to reduce the ecological impact of healthcare treatments:

Building management: heating, cooling and lighting
Transfers and mobility of staff, patients and visitors
Medical waste
Healthy and sustainable nutrition
Use of anaesthetic gases, drugs and medical devices
Appropriateness of care (20-30% of healthcare services are pointless or inappropriate).

Furthermore, the University of Bergamo contributes to the project by collaborating in training initiatives and establishing specific indicators and adequate measurement tools to quantify the main sources of emissions and monitor results.

The Mario Negri Institute of Pharmacological Research intends to initiate study and research activities with the aim of discovering and making known the consequences of a poor diet for human health and the health of the planet. It will then also provide details of which improvements in eating habits may have a concrete impact on reducing air pollution, land consumption, ocean acidification and the level of phosphates in land used for agriculture. The documentation centre at the Mario Negri Institute will critically monitor everything being published on climate warming and mitigation activities, as well as on potential action in the province of Bergamo in order to prepare citizens for the consequences of global warming, which is already predicted to start having an impact on our general well-being now and overs the years to 2050.

The city's engagement process also aims to involve the most expert and specialist sectors in energy transition. With this in mind, the Administration signed a CACER Memorandum of Understanding in January 2023 with three operators: CERESS, Eni Plenitude and A2A. The aim of this is to develop common models of statutes and pathways for the implementation and spread of Communities for Renewable Energy (REC), Collective Self-Consumption Groups (AUC) and for remote individual self-consumption (AID): three forms of development of the electricity network, called CACER in the document. The involvement of this sector will result in the maps of public buildings being updated to indicate those suitable for renewable energy sources (FER), as well as encouraging advantageous public-private partnerships for managing the requalification, maintenance and adaptation of buildings, and developing training and dissemination spaces for citizens (such as one-stop shops on municipal premises to support citizens and stakeholders in adopting responsible and effective energy efficiency actions). The purpose of this initiative is to stem the phenomenon of energy poverty, a term used to define the widespread difficulties in accessing basic energy services. This issue is of significant importance at a local, national and even international level: the strategies adopted to date have found that, in order to address the problem, constant contributions and collaboration between subjects of different natures and social characters are needed, in both the public and private spheres. Therefore, with this agreement the parties undertake to:

carry out a study to assess the activation of CACER aggregation initiatives within the territory of the Municipality of Bergamo;
set up a round table attended by the Municipality of Bergamo (supported by AESS and ENEA), Eni Plenitude, Ceress and A2A, with the aim of evaluating and proposing new forms of governance between public and private entities, and so try new methods of collaboration between different subjects with expertise in the matter.

Another Innovative Governance action is the participation of the Municipality of Bergamo in the pilot project known as Let'sGOv - GOverning the Transition through pilot actions (Horizon 2020 Grant Agreement program no. 101036519), co-ordinated by the Municipality of Bologna and whose partners including the 9 Italian cities participating in the Mission, the Energy Center of the Polytechnic of Turin, the University of Bologna and AESS. Thanks to Let'sGOv, cities will have the opportunity to benefit from training sessions and work on specific clusters focused on governance and the best involvement of internal and external actors on three specific themes: Engagement, Data and Finance.

Although these might not seem likely to have an impact in terms of reducing direct emissions, such training, awareness and promulgation activities are in all respects a fundamental element of ecological transition and its positive outcome.

The first results of this important participatory process appear even before the official delivery of the Climate City Contract on 15 March: three partners of the Mission joined together in a memorandum of understanding as part of the analysis of possible actions for the impact of daily behaviour regarding the use of energy sources at home, in particular where the sources are shared in a condominium or co-housing environment.

The project aims to use consumption data from direct measurements, bringing quantitative information about the private behaviours and habits in relation to the season and the internal and

external environmental conditions. This quantitative information is collected thanks to energy and environmental sensors and is transformed into values and indicators on which the managers of the shared residence will base the information campaign to improve the efficiency of the accommodation, reduce consumption and guarantee better quality living in terms of temperature, humidity and air quality.

The information produced will develop the communication flows based on both economic and cultural leverage to raise user awareness of more sustainable behavior in relation to the well-being of the lived environment.

# C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

This section presents actions at both a public and private level aimed at increasing social innovation, involvement and training.

Note that the behavioural actions of individual public and private stakeholders have already been presented in Table B-2.2c, classified according to the NZC methodology. These are also classed as social innovation interventions as they represent additional actions with respect to the core business of the individual stakeholder proposing them.

In addition to some of the Governance Innovation actions already mentioned (and linked closely to Social Innovation, such as the Expression of Interest for the involvement of stakeholders and the various memoranda of understanding drawn up by the Municipality, e.g. CACER and the Healthcare sector), below are details of major innovative social actions forming part of the virtuous actions that the municipal administration has put forward in support of the city of Bergamo's candidacy for the Net Zero City project of the Climate City Contract.

The modes of participation implemented by the Municipality of Bergamo are a fundamental method for urban transformation decision making and for promoting social inclusion. Participation here means the maximum involvement of individual citizens or associations, social groups and economic actors, according to criteria for adequate diffusion, continuity and structuring, whilst still respecting the needs for the speed and transparency of procedure.

The Municipality of Bergamo has set up a department called "District Networks" aimed at supporting, promoting, building and enhancing the city's district networks and encouraging dialogue and the virtuous process of mutual recognition between departments, the municipal structure and social subjects, educational bodies, committees, associations, groups, etc. District networks comprise representatives from each residents group, association and committee, whether formal or informal, responsible for communicating with officials from other bodies, institutions and organisations in their territory. District networks are non-partisan and non-denominational, they share and have at heart the common good, and play close attention to ensuring the social cohesion of the district. They have a strong propensity for participatory democracy and the creation of widespread co-responsibilities. The District Networks working model promotes the active participation of residents and dialogue between the various departments, services and bodies in a district, as well as encouraging collaboration and facilitating the planning and implementation of joint actions to meet shared goals. The municipal administration recognises the figure of "district operator" (operatorie/operatore di quartiere) to support, promote and enhance the work of all district networks. The District Networks department supports other municipal departments in implementing various kinds of participatory processes involving citizens in specific projects (e.g., the requalification of spaces or services, the Territory Government Plan, etc.).

One of the many objectives of the Cli.C.Bergamo! Climate Transition Strategy (a project co-financed by the Region of Lombardy and the Fondazione) is the desire to strengthen social cohesion as a central factor for a new level of urban welfare. This can also be achieved through urban regeneration actions involving the creation of high quality infrastructures, public spaces and shared services, and aimed at promoting the development of local communities and at structuring networks of surveillance, collaboration and social solidarity. Citizen awareness, involvement and participation therefore plays an important role in the decision-making processes, planning and implementation of these interventions. A recent example of a participatory process is that involving the Malpensata district, during which citizens were involved in designing an area which, thanks to land reclamation and subsequent de-paving activities, would turn from being a car park into an integral part of a city park. During the 3 scheduled meetings, participants discussed the environmental and socio-economic functions that might characterise the new area, recognising the important role that green areas and plants have in counteracting the effect of climate change and in providing basic ecosystem services. At the end of the participatory planning process, a Master Plan was drawn up by the University of

Milan and presented to the citizens. This incorporated all their requests where compatible with the restrictions dictated by the reclamation intervention. A fourth meeting will also be held, to present and explain the executive project.

In general, the participatory process concerns urban planning tools, as variously foreseen by state and regional regulations, by the implementation tools referred to in the Transformation Areas in the Plan Document, by integrated programmes, by district contracts, by urban recovery plans and sector plans with urban or territorial relevance. The participation project also concerns plans/programmes already approved but subject to substantial variant modifications. The participation process will need to be commensurate with the relevant size of the territory concerned and, depending on the plan/programme in question, may involve a single district, several neighbouring districts or the entire city.

The Municipality of Bergamo has also relied on a procedure for the outsourcing of consultancy services in order to finalise a Framework Agreement for engineering and architectural services relating to the energy requalification of heritage buildings for a period of 2 years. The services covered by this contract include the following activities:

Energy performance diagnosis of buildings, also preparatory to and needed for the energy requalification, renovation, demolition and rebuilding of municipal properties
Energy Performance Certificates for buildings, also preparatory to and needed for the energy requalification, renovation, demolition and rebuilding of municipal properties.
Support activities aimed at obtaining GSE funding for "Conto Termico" initiatives, including, among others, the following activities: assessment of the possibility of accessing GSE funding, preparation of an initial estimate of how much funding might be obtained and drafting of a plan of works; assistance and indications for the architect/system engineer regarding the technical choices to be adopted in order to achieve the energy performance needed to obtain GSE funding; preparation of the documentation and the compilation/uploading of the application for funding on the GSE portal; support to the works management regarding the practicalities of obtaining GSE funding; collection of all the documentation needed to report back to the GSE and the compilation/uploading of the same on the GSE portal.

The procedure was announced in August 2023 and outsourced with a maximum total fee of € 138.000 for reliable services with individual contracts. A person in the Environment, Public Green and Mobility department has been made responsible for managing this procedure on behalf of the Municipality: it is expected that management will be extended to other services in the coming years, especially in the context of climate actions benefiting the environment. This action can be considered both one of social innovation, as it involves specific external engineering and architecture sectors for the energy component, and of innovative internal governance, as an internal figure of reference has been appointed.

The jewel in the crown of the Municipality of Bergamo's actions for social innovation and digitalisation is the ForImpact platform, a digital tool for the involvement, monitoring and dissemination to all citizens of the commitments that the Administration and its partners are making regarding its 2030 neutrality goals.

Thanks to this platform, and by signing of concrete commitments such as the CCC, the Municipality is able to bring stakeholders together and steer their digital collaboration, engaging them through the means of common agreements.

ForImpact ensures the transparency of the governance of the City Contract, as well as allowing for the engagement of all citizens through storytelling and data visualization functions. This story-telling is facilitated by using a code system for the planned interventions, adopting the UN's SDGs framework (Agenda 2030) and through Artificial Intelligence. This step is of fundamental importance, as it combines the outputs of the CCC with the SDGs of the UN's Agenda 2030, creates new synergy and facilitates the interpretation of the Climate City Contract actions from an SDGs point of view.

ForImpact uses aggregate data visualization and soft data management to indicate the number of stakeholders involved, explain the planned actions, show the progress made in CO2 equivalent reduction and describe the indirect impacts of each action. Moreover, the data is clustered by sector of intervention, thus providing detailed understanding of which areas need extra attention in order to achieve the objectives.

The ForImpact platform is the digital tool that will also support the Municipality of Bergamo during the subsequent phase of continuous evolution and monitoring of the pathway towards neutrality by making it easier to update the process on a continuous basis.

Below are some screenshots of the platform. In Annex 2 is presented a more comprehensive view of the platform.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the CCC Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for refining the CCC Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract in future iterations.

## Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iteration

The iteration of the Action Plan, and in general of the entire pathway towards climate neutrality by 2030, will be guaranteed by all the governance and social innovation actions introduced and systematised by the Municipality of Bergamo. The internal Climate, Mobility and Energy Managers will continue to act as co-ordinators, strengthening the Transition Team.

Fruitful and diligent collaboration between all municipal employees and the central nucleus of the Transition Team, i.e. the Ecology and Environment Department, will guarantee a fluid internal process for the gathering of information, exchange of opinions and experiences, adding to the ever-increasing upwards curve in collaboration and the optimisation of intra-sectoral governance.

The ForImpact digital platform will play a key role in the continuous involvement of all present and future partners of the Mission, and should also establish itself as a key tool for citizen communications.

Relations with the stakeholders will continue, both through the already established round tables (see the various memoranda of understanding described in this chapter) and possibly future ones, both through direct discussions and via the digital platform specifically created for the Mission.

# Raggiungimento neutralità climatica nel settore dell'edilizia pubblica e privata

Attraverso il Climate City Contract la città ha intrapreso un ambizioso percorso per ridurre le emissioni di gas serra nel settore degli edifici, comprendendo l'importanza cruciale di questo settore nel contesto della città al cambiamento climatico. Nicodossomida che gli edifici sono responsabili di una significativa quota di emissioni di CO2 a livello locale. La città si impegna a promuovere l'efficienza energetica e l'uso di energia rinnovabili attraverso una serie di politiche innovative e sostenibili.

Fra le iniziative principali, il Consum ha introdotto azioni per la riqualificazione energetica degli edifici esistenti, tecnologicamente l'installazione di isolamento termico, finestre ad alta efficienza e sistemi di riscaldamento e raffrescamento più efficienti.

Fiscaldamento, per i nuovi edifici, vengono promossi standard elevati di efficienza energetica, spingendo verso la realizzazione di edifici a energia quasi zero (IGES) che producono ferite energia quanto ne consumano grazie all'uso di fonti rinnovabili integrate, come pannelli solari e pompe di calore.

Il Consum sta anche investendo in tecnologie innovative come le reti di termiscaldamento alimentate da fonti rinnovabili e il recupero del calore dai processi industriali, riducendo ulteriormente la dipendenza dal combustibile fossili.

Vengono inoltre promosse pratiche di sensibilizzazione alla sostenibilità per regaggiare nello sforzo condiviso enti pubblici e privati e singoli cittadini.

# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

Bergamo embraces the EU Mission Climate neutral and smart cities challenge with great conviction. Having seen a considerable rise in collective awareness of general environmental issues over the years, and efforts to curb global warming in particular, it feels fully engaged.

Its candidacy for the Mission has also provided a major stimulus for it to enthusiastically relaunch the capacity for action and vision of a city that was so severely affected by the 2020-2021 pandemic. Indeed, Bergamo was the first European city to face a COVID-19 emergency of horrendous and unexpected proportions. In order to beat the resulting paralysis, it needed to engage in a European policy of regeneration and rebirth with climate transition a central priority.

The Climate City Contract has been and continues to be a sign of hope for Bergamo and a project for a better future, one that involves all stakeholders within the territory.

Finally, the Mission was immediately viewed as the ideal framework to link and rationalise the many ambitious environmental policies already in place, and hopefully break down the traditional walls between municipal departments, making the climate challenge the interpretative paradigm shaping every public policy.

The city had already joined the Covenant of Mayors in 2009 and has carbon footprint reduction commitments within its SEAP. These commitments were fully respected over the course of the following decade, with CO2 emissions cut by roughly 37% compared to the 2005 baseline.

A more recent and more innovative initiative has been the strategic project known as Cli.c Bergamo (Climate Change Bergamo) created in response to the Fondazione Cariplo's "Climate Strategy Call". This is a call for ideas for the development and implementation of a Climate Transition Strategy for the local context, with financing for the chosen pilot projects. The Municipality of Bergamo presented a complex, articulated project comprising various actions that also involves several areas outside the city limits that fall within the territorial system known as the "Parco dei Colli di Bergamo". The plan includes both mitigation goals and adaptation actions.

The theme of limiting global warming is also a major characteristic of the most recent sector planning tools, such as the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (PUMS), the Structural Green Plan, and the Territory Government Plan (PGT) in the process of being approved, among others. The PGT, for example, provides for a drastic reduction in land consumption and the regeneration of abandoned areas within the city; it also plans to provide the Municipality with regulations aimed at encouraging forms of sustainable construction with reduced CO2 emissions.

The salient points of the pathway to carbon neutrality involve various sectors within the Municipality. Sustainable mobility policies play an important role, resulting in policies for reductions in private traffic, for public transport innovation and electrification. These include a new tram line, the new Electric Bus Rapid Transit (E-BRT) line, new railway infrastructure and the renewal of the local public transport fleet. Other aspects of fundamental importance are the energy and thermal efficiency of public and private buildings and an increase in the production of energy from renewable sources. Bergamo expects to see substantial development of its district heating network (+50% heat available) with the involvement of private stakeholders, and its decarbonisation. Major impetus for renewable energy production is needed, which the Municipality intends to provide by promoting photovoltaic systems and using the REC (Renewable Energy Communities) tool. A memorandum of understanding has recently been signed by the Municipality with private sector players operating in the field of renewable energy aimed at the development of governance models for the development of forms of shared energy whose main objective is to tackle the issue of energy poverty and ensure the inclusion of disadvantaged citizens. This desire to pay special attention to the most vulnerable sections of society is the direct result of an awareness that these are also the most affected by the effects of climate change. In 2022, the Municipality of Bergamo commissioned a study to identify the priority areas for the development of energy communities. This started with an analysis of the
6

municipal areas most affected by energy poverty. The various actors to be involved were then identified and public meetings were held in each district to provide more information on the possibilities for shared collective self-consumption of energy.

This is just one of the many examples showing how participatory processes are closely linked to actions within the territory.

Other important actions are also envisaged to promote research into forms of circular economy and the production of energy and heat by means of the recovery of renewable sources (such as waste heat valorisation and the development of geothermal plants). To promote a circular economy, a recycling and re-use centre is currently being created based on the active participation of citizens: they will now be able to drop off their unwanted objects and buy second-hand items, thus recovering valuable resources and avoiding further emissions of CO2 into the environment. Last but not least, an invitation to tender for the management of urban waste will shortly be published that has environmental sustainability as its key characteristic.

The Municipality's current commitments regarding the reduction of its carbon footprint are contained in the strategic instruments already approved, or about to be approved, by the municipal administration. The Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) is a point of reference here. By inheriting and expanding the goals of the previous plan (SEAP), the Municipality has set itself the challenge of reducing baseline emissions by 55%. The other tools already mentioned will contribute greatly to meeting this goal.

The Mission is of fundamental usefulness when it comes to broadening the context of these objectives to the city, its actors and its stakeholders. It is the very concept of CCCs that makes this new level of innovation possible: the principle of co-responsibility means that the whole community accepts the climate challenge and adopts the targets that the city sets itself.

The context of Bergamo is that of an area rich in businesses, associations and civic life. These worlds have already largely accepted the need for climate change mitigation with specific objectives within their governance strategies.

Unfortunately, the links between these different initiatives are still weak, as is the link with what the public administration is attempting to achieve. This is why the CCC represents the ideal context to overcome these limitations and break down the barriers, and so integrate as far as is possible the various actions into a common framework supported by all the actors involved. A good example here is the recent memorandum of understanding signed between the Municipality and companies operating in the healthcare sector, an important part of the local economy. The various healthcare companies, the public and private hospitals in the city and the Ordine dei Medici (order of physicians) have agreed the objectives of the future CCC with the municipal administration and undertake to be part of it: by setting up an "inter-institutional green table" the representatives of the healthcare companies will have the chance to discuss, compare and exchange good practices in order to meet the challenging goals of the Mission.

The "Garante per i diritti dell'infanzia" (children's rights guarantor, an institutional figure within the Municipality of Bergamo) is also a member of the round table and is committed to promoting awareness-raising initiatives and measures to protect the health of mothers and children against from the effects of climate change.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

## Goal

The goal is to achieve net neutrality by 2030, i.e. an 80% reduction in CO2eq emissions and a compensation rate of 20% thanks to strategic actions that also include outlying areas outside the city limits.

The objectives for 2030 affect the entire city: no parts of the city are exempt. In fact, the stakeholders hold that the scope of these actions should not finish at the city limits, but cover the entire province. The territorial context is that of a relatively small city, both in terms of population and in terms of surface area compared to the general urban area. This provincial capital has 120,000 inhabitants and forms the core of a highly urbanised, densely populated metropolitan area of at least 350,000 inhabitants in a province with 1.1 million inhabitants. The territory is also very fragmented (243 autonomous municipalities). The municipality of Bergamo has an area of just 40 square kilometres. One must therefore assume that, as far as possible and as much as possible, the scope of any policy should reach beyond the narrow limit of the city itself to include larger territorial areas and all subjects within the province. Bergamo lies in the most populous region of Italy (Lombardy, with approximately 10 million inhabitants) and the geographical context of the Po Valley, i.e. a highly urbanised, densely inhabited area, with a strong economy and marked environmental problems, particularly with regard to air quality.

The objective of the CCC, as far as possible, should be to broaden the limits of the project to a far larger area.

Climate change mitigation actions and the decarbonisation of the local context will certainly enjoy co-benefits.

First of all, the actions envisaged in the CCC provide for obvious improvements to the city mobility system by virtue of a reduction in the use of private vehicles and the major development of public transport systems, including the electrification of the fleet. These policies will then allow for actions aimed at improving the quality of public space: more pedestrian areas, and more green and permeable areas by reducing the amount of asphalt and concrete surfaces. This will then result in an improvement in the quality of life for citizens, a reduction in road accidents, and a better chance of adapting to climate change, especially with respect to the issues of water management and heat islands. More green areas and greater soil permeability will gradually introduce for the idea of a "sponge city" and a shaded city.

A positive side effect of any improvement in the quality of public spaces will, of course, be an increase in the commercial and tourist attractiveness of the city, with positive repercussions on the local economy. Of course, tourism needs to be managed with special care in order to prevent it from turning into something erosive and unsustainable. However, it still represents an interesting opportunity for economic growth. Climate policies will boost the city's reputation and make it better known and recognisable within Europe. Again, this will increase its economic attractiveness and draw potential investments by large international players. The highly innovative nature of climate policies has a positive return in terms of research and development in all the sectors involved. The actions in the CCC can also help drive the local economy, representing an opportunity for appreciable innovation in the work sector, thus resulting in new specialised jobs.

Better mobility and greater energy efficiency make it possible to improve air quality, i.e. cut pollution levels. The CCC actions aiming to reduce greenhouse gases will also lead to a reduction in harmful emissions (PM 10, PM 2.5, NOx, etc.). This theme is all the more relevant when one considers the critical context of the Po Valley, as already mentioned. Better air quality results in better health for citizens and, especially, those most at risk (children and the elderly).

Circular economy actions have close links to the Food Policy and other more general food policies. The fight against food waste and the search for environmentally sustainable menus also generates

Commitments

positive effects for public health, starting with children and their relationship with school canteens. Food education and environmental education are mutually supportive.

The energy policies envisaged in the CCC will also have a clear impact on society, as they are effective energy poverty mitigation tools. Improvements to building efficiency and the activation of RECs are two actions with financial benefits, as they can help those sections of the population most exposed to fluctuations in energy prices. Energy efficiency is a way to reduce public spending and reallocate resources that would otherwise still be used to support the fossil fuel economy.

Climate policies are therefore intergenerational equity policies, as they endeavour to guarantee secure comfortable living conditions for future generations. They are also equity policies of a more general nature (generational, gender, etc.): in line with the logic of the SDGs, they are policies that pursue different objectives simultaneously, and in synergy.

The CCC clearly pursues the objective of fair and just climate transition, according to the principles of environmental, economic and social sustainability.

There are two ETS plants within the municipal territory (the district heating heat production plant and the plant for the new Bergamo Hospital). These plants are not included the target to avoid counting their emissions twice.

# 3 Strategic priorities

## Strategic priorities

The main strategic lines identified by the Municipality of Bergamo to achieve neutrality by 2030 and which will have a profound impact on the reduction of CO2 emissions are as follows:

a) Promotion of energy efficiency in public and private buildings. The Municipality's SECAP activities provide good examples regarding public buildings and public administration actions. These include the introduction of Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs) to improve the efficiency of approximately 120 public buildings. Other actions include the "Conto Termico" incentives for renewable heating and REC development. As regards the private sector, there are numerous stakeholders who have proposed building redevelopment actions or consumption monitoring systems.

b) Increase in the production of energy from renewable sources. Examples include the extension of the city's district heating network and the production of heat using increasingly more renewables, the spread of photovoltaic systems on roofs (the Municipality is currently in the process of drafting a Masterplan for the development of photovoltaic systems on public roofs) and measures to facilitate the development of forms of shared collective energy self-consumption (the Municipality has signed a memorandum of understanding with private players in the energy sector to identify new forms of governance that prioritise energy poverty mitigation).

c) Electrification of final consumption. Examples include the rollout of EV charging points, the creation of new local public transport infrastructure powered exclusively by electricity, the electrification of the existing local public transport fleet and the promotion of the use of electric vehicles for last mile delivery within the city.

d) Implement forms of circular economy and food waste reduction. Public actions implementing this strategic line include the approval of the circular economy strategy (under development) and the publication of a new call for tenders for the management of the separate waste collection system. Food policy actions will also be developed in collaboration with the private sector.

e) Sustainable land management and reduction of land consumption. The new Territory Government Plan of the Municipality of Bergamo is in the process of being approved: this provides for a marked reduction in land consumption, urban regeneration, the expansion of
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

protected municipal areas and the approval of regulations to encourage green building and the reduction of CO2 emissions in the construction industry.

These strategic lines are therefore expressed as commitments in the Action Plan by sector:

|  Sector | Commitment  |
| --- | --- |
|  Buildings/Energy | Strategic lines a), b) c) and d)
Promote and create energy efficient buildings using cladding and other suitable systems capable of guaranteeing reduced emissions, while also exploiting renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels.
Promote sustainable construction by exploiting secondary raw materials, recovering building materials and generally deploying the circular economy in the construction sector.  |
|  Transport | Strategic lines b), c) and d)
Produce and use renewable energy for transport by championing the electrification of public and private means of transport.
Promote and boost public transport, cycle routes, electric micromobility and low-emission vehicles in general.  |
|  Waste | Strategic line d)
Promote and roll out schemes for separate waste collection, waste recovery and the recycling of goods, drawing on an efficient waste management service and public information and awareness campaigns.  |
|  Production | Strategic lines a), b) c) and d)
Promote and boost the energy efficiency of industrial sites, both in terms of buildings and structures, and production processes.
Reduce consumption and waste during production, including the introduction of forms of circular economy.
Reduce air emissions or prevent their dispersion.  |
|  Agriculture and Land Consumption | Strategic lines a) and e)
Promote and implement the production and use of renewable energy in the agricultural sector.
Conserve undeveloped areas, and promote and introduce “zero kilometre” agriculture.  |

Over the course of the next 2-3 years, the priority objectives will be the following:

## Electrification of end-use consumption

Electrification of local public transport through:
the construction of the Electric Bus Rapid Transit (E-BRT) line that will connect the city to the municipalities to the west with strategically important services, such as a university centre and a scientific centre (Kilometro Rosso);
the construction of the second electric tram line (TEB2) that will connect Bergamo with Val Seriana;
For both these interventions
Timeline: start of operation by 2026
Target: completion and inauguration of the two lines within the set time frame
the conversion of the local public transport fleet into a low-emission fleet (diesel free)
Timeline: launch in 2024; completion by 2026
Target: 100% of the fleet to be diesel free within the set time frame

Development of the charging network for electric vehicles: to date, there are 49 public access EV charging points in the municipal area.
Timeline: launch in 2022; completion by 2024

Target: installation of a further 16 charging points

## Increase in the production of energy from renewable sources

Heat recovery project for the Dalmine waste-to-energy plant: the Bergamo district heating plant and the REA waste-to-energy plant in Dalmine are to be linked in order to fully exploit the heat produced and increase the amount of heat that can be supplied by the city district heating system.
Timeline: activation of heat recovery starting in the 2024-2025 thermal season (October 2024)
Target: an incremental increase in the amount of heat produced as a function of the number of buildings connected to the network (upon completion of the expansion of the district heating network, there will be a 50% increase in heat compared to 2020).

Extension of the city district heating network to city buildings to fully exploit the heat being produced.
Timeline: by 2026
Target: annual extension of the network (3-5 km/year)

## Promotion of the energy efficiency of public and private buildings

The Municipality of Bergamo has entrusted the energy requalification of approximately 120 public buildings to a third party with a ten-year EPC contract.
Timeline: as per the schedule of works
Target: as per the tender specifications

Development of the first CACER project promoted by the Municipality of Bergamo.
The Municipality has signed a memorandum of understanding that foresees a round table with private sector players to discuss the development of the most suitable forms of governance for the city and with the aim of mitigating energy poverty.
Timeline: conclusion of the CACER round table by 2025; launch of CACER by 2026.
Target: conclusion of the round table and start of the CACER

## Implement forms of circular economy and the reduction of food waste

Creation of a new separate waste collection centre for urban waste, and a new recycle and re-use centre
Timeline: publication of the call for tenders by 2024; completion and opening by 2026
Target: completion of works and opening of the centres

Publication of a new call for tenders for the management of the separate waste collection system
Timeline: publication by 2024;
Target: awarding of the contract

## Sustainable land management and reduction of land consumption

Extension of protected city areas and inclusion of the same in the "Parco dei Colli di Bergamo"
Timeline: by 2026
Target: 50% of the municipal territory to be included in the "Parco dei Colli"

Needless to say, these strategic intervention priorities must be developed systemically and involve the relevant public and private stakeholders, such as the local public transport company (ATB), local multi-utility companies, "Parco dei Colli" and other private stakeholders operating within of the municipal territory. Of especial importance are those stakeholders linked to the field of research and development (e.g. universities and research centres) as these can speed up the decarbonisation process and spread these principles across society.

Last but not least, the goals envisaged by the strategic lines can be met by implementing and strengthening systems to engage and involve the population (especially the more vulnerable members of society) with interactive dissemination platforms, public meetings and campaigns to raise awareness and encourage the active participation of residents in CCC actions.

# 4 Process and principles

# Process and principles

In order to meet the climate neutrality target, the Municipality of Bergamo has adopted a continuously evolving and modulating work process. Just as when drafting the CCC, it is essential that the whole urban ecosystem (public and private stakeholders, members of society and the institutions, and the various municipal sectors) is involved in order to release the full potential of the territory.

To attract and involve stakeholders, the Municipality of Bergamo has published an Expression of Interest on its website, posts news on its social media and sends newsletters to keep people updated on the progress of the project. To allow people to understand the enormous potential of this project and further engage stakeholders, plenary workshops and individual meetings have been held so that the objectives of the Mission can be explored in depth.

A plenary conference will also be held following submission of the CCC on the NZC platform, the purpose being to bring together all the stakeholders involved and promote the creation of new synergies.

Last but not least, the ForImpact.AI digital platform project is well under way: this will allow Municipalities to work together with their stakeholders to ensure an impact on a local scale. This platform offers an opportunity for public interface to involve citizens in territorial transformations and sustainability policies, as well as being a valid collaborative and data management tool. It is also a collaboration, monitoring and communication tool that simplifies the process of understanding current works and investments through the means of storytelling and data visualization. It informs citizens of all that is happening in the area thanks also to a Data Driven approach, boosting the efficiency of each decision by virtue of dynamic data monitoring.

The process includes continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of the actions so as to recalibrate the efforts as and when required, and assess whether to continue in the current direction or take the decision to direct resources towards other more successful actions. It is also expected that the strong network created with the other 8 Italian cities participating in the EU Mission and the main Ministries involved (a memorandum of understanding was signed in September 2022) will contribute substantially to the smooth running of the process, as it will make it easier to overcome any critical issues at the project or implementation stages that might hinder the pursuit of the Mission. Likewise, the sharing of good practices, activities of particular importance and innovative projects developed by the network will allow for the creation of a knowledge base that will be of benefit to other Municipalities, public administrations or public bodies who might themselves decide to "join" the cause and so catalyse and spread the guiding principles of the Mission.

Monitoring will also be made possible thanks to the platform currently being finalised: this will allow for stakeholder collaboration, public communications and the monitoring of the impact of each action.

The principles that have guided and will guide the implementation of the CCC are as follows:

Co-responsibility and multilevel governance: the city has accepted an extremely complex challenge requiring the development of an active and collaborative urban ecosystem, comprising entities from both the public and the private sectors who jointly feel the need to tackle climate change as the guiding principle behind their every choice, decision and action. The only way to overcome this challenge is for everyone to assume responsibility for their own actions.
Inclusivity – people at the centre: for climate transition to be truly useful to society, it must be ethical, fair, inclusive and accessible to all. This principle must guide all choices so as not to leave anyone behind and to ensure that transition is sustainable from every point of view, and not just in terms of the environment.
Innovation: the only way to successfully implement such a challenging and new project for the entire society is to create new forms of governance among local stakeholders and

welcome innovation as a transition driver. The envisaged actions should also result in substantial social, technical and governance innovation.
