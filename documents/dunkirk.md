# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CCC Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses, and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

As mentioned, Greater Dunkirk is a region particularly affected by climate change for numerous reasons, including high industrial CO₂ emissions, air quality issues, and vulnerability to marine submersion.

This is why Greater Dunkirk has committed early and strongly to decarbonizing its living area and industrial zone.

In France, the Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth (LTECV) has strengthened the role of local authorities in the fight against climate change through the Territorial Climate Air Energy Plans (PCAET), which serve as both a territorial project and a tool for driving that project forward.

The PCAET is participatory, co-constructed by decision-makers, local government services, and territorial stakeholders (local authorities, socio-economic actors, associations, companies, universities, residents...). It aims for consistency between territorial actions by filtering all decisions and policies through a "climate-energy" lens, transitioning from scattered initiatives to a coherent, collaborative, and ambitious climate-energy policy.

The region has embraced this planning and action tool, establishing a PCAET recognized as one of the most ambitious for a locality of this size.

Thus, its actions cover all sectors and functions of the territory; it involves all major local stakeholders in a collective effort and is designed as a lever for ecological and energy transition.
It sets clear ambitions:
Mitigate climate change (reduce GHG emissions)
Develop renewable and recovered energy
Prepare for adaptation to climate change
Preserve air quality

And it sets actions addressing all territorial challenges:
The exemplary conduct of the local authority in climate and energy transition
Mobilization of public forces on the climate, air, and energy policy
Air quality
Building insulation
Mobility
Energy
Waste
Water...

Armed with this collectively developed document, within the framework of its Climate City Contract (CCC), Greater Dunkirk sought to go further in climate protection and especially to accelerate the transition to carbon neutrality.

Indeed, while Greater Dunkirk’s CCC builds on the PCAET’s axes and actions, it has enabled the territory to consider new approaches that had not been previously envisaged or explored.

For example, while the PCAET planned actions that were assumed to be beneficial and thus reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it had not been considered to measure the reduction by action.

Similarly, residual emissions had not been fully considered.

Thus, the document was revised in light of these new perspectives.

It was also enhanced because the overall situation of the region has changed. In two years, major industrial projects and the establishment of gigafactories have altered the region's landscape, with, for example, 20,000 new jobs expected to be created within a few years. This means that new activities must not undo previous efforts. Once again, there is a need to adapt and accelerate, with innovations such as factories without parking lots or the establishment of a structure bridging the decarbonization of the living area and the industrial zone.

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the implementation of the CCC has motivated Greater Dunkirk to increase the involvement of stakeholders in the overall decarbonization effort, relying on its major awareness-raising and popular education facilities, but also by creating new governance tools such as the social conference and the Co-Mission Zero.

With the CCC's action plan, Greater Dunkirk has thus chosen to accelerate and further mobilize territorial actors to achieve its goals of reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
# 1. Introduction

The City of Dunkirk, situated along the picturesque northern coast of France, stands at a pivotal moment in its quest for climate neutrality by 2030. As we embark on crafting the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan, it's imperative to delve into our local geographic and policy context, as well as the significant gap we endeavor to bridge.

Dunkirk's landscape, both geographically and industrially, shapes the contours of our climate aspirations. Historically entrenched as a significant energy consumer and emitter of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, particularly within our industrial basin, our territory bears the weighty responsibility of transforming its consumption and decarbonizing across all dimensions. Currently, the industrial sector within our territory alone contributes to $21\%$ of France's industrial $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions and a staggering $85\%$ of our region's greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, industry accounts for nearly $80\%$ of our energy consumption.

Recognizing these challenges, Dunkirk has embarked on a robust territorial climate and energy strategy, underlined by the recent adoption of the 2022-2028 Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan (PCAET). This strategic roadmap sets forth ambitious targets, aiming to slash energy consumption by $46\%$ and greenhouse gas emissions by $79\%$ by 2050.

Aligned with our commitment outlined in the Cities Mission Expression of Interest, Dunkirk's 2030 climate neutrality target remains steadfast. Our ambition is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, signaling our resolve to combat climate change at the local level. This target reflects our recognition of the urgent need for action and our responsibility to future generations.

Achieving our 2030 climate neutrality target requires the active involvement of various stakeholders across sectors. This includes but is not limited to local government entities, industrial stakeholders, community organizations, academic institutions, and residents. Collaborative partnerships and engagement are essential to fostering a shared commitment to sustainability and driving meaningful change.

Dunkirk has established formal planning frameworks, such as the Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan (PCAET), to guide climate action initiatives. The CCC Action Plan must align seamlessly with these frameworks, ensuring coherence and synergy in our approach to climate mitigation and adaptation. The CCC Action Plan serves as a pivotal component of Greater Dunkirk's existing climate action planning efforts. It builds upon previous strategies and commitments, such as the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), while also providing a cohesive framework to integrate and streamline future initiatives. By consolidating and aligning our efforts under the CCC, we can maximize impact and effectively address the emissions gap towards climate neutrality by 2030.

Climate change is already affecting the entire world. Extreme weather conditions such as drought, heatwaves, heavy rains, floods, and landslides are becoming more frequent, including in Europe. Sea level rise, ocean acidification, and biodiversity loss are other consequences of rapid climate changes. There is an urgent need for action. At this pivotal moment, Europe has decided to mobilize. Thus, the European Union has committed to an ambitious climate policy. Under the European Green Deal, it aims to become the first continent to eliminate as many $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions as it produces by 2050.

Under the European Climate Law, and in line with the Paris Agreement objectives, the European Union is committed to reducing its emissions by at least $55\%$ by 2030 and achieving climate neutrality by the mid-century. In this context, the role of cities is crucial. Although they occupy only $4\%$ of the EU's land area, they are home to $75\%$ of European citizens. More broadly, cities consume more than $65\%$ of the world's energy and are responsible for over $70\%$ of global $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions. Working with cities can and must enable both faster decarbonization and a fair and equitable transition to build a livable society.

To support its Green Deal, the European Union has launched a program called NetZeroCities under "Horizon Europe" for the 2021-2027 period, aiming to assist "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030". This EU Mission has a triple objective: to support the transformation of cities to meet the Paris Agreement target, to boost the implementation of the European Green Deal, and to demonstrate that achieving climate neutrality by 2050 is a credible goal.

Each of the 100 selected cities is tasked with developing a climate contract tailored to its strengths, weaknesses, realities, and urgencies through a mobilizing process that enables collaboration and co-creation with all local stakeholders. This contract will detail the strategy, transformations, and solutions implemented to achieve climate neutrality. Thus, it serves as both a roadmap and a clear commitment from the territory—morally, technically, and financially—to all stakeholders.

This contract was designed by Greater Dunkirk with the participation of numerous public and private actors to meet the demands of the European Cities Mission and achieve climate neutrality. It is based on a simple analysis: if the territory of Greater Dunkirk continues the trends of past years, energy consumption will increase by 49% in 2030 and triple by 2050, while GHG emissions will increase by 15% in 2030 and nearly 58% in 2050. The conclusion is clear: change is needed. The ambition is clear: to maximally reduce emissions.

In collaboration with all partners, community elected officials have defined a strategy and action program to achieve GHG reduction objectives. This action program covers many areas: residential, tertiary, mobility, waste, climate change adaptation, etc., emphasizing the community's exemplary role. It fully relies on all local actors, each contributing ideas, needs, urgencies, contributions, and actions as citizens, associations, institutions, unions, universities, businesses, and media.

The Dunkirk area has three notable characteristics:

Proximity, in all respects, between the city and the industrial-port platform.
A strong tradition of partnership.
High public support for initial climate decisions, particularly the implementation of free public transport.

The contract was developed using these key elements to facilitate its adaptation to the specific needs of the territory and its appropriation by all actors, especially residents. The plan was also designed with a triple objective: to build on our strengths to go further, to identify areas for improvement by addressing what has not yet been done or what has not worked sufficiently, and to be adaptable, evolving according to its progress.

It outlines key actions, methods, and objectives in each intervention area (housing, transport, waste, etc.). It aims to:

Develop renewable and recovered energy, serving as a true lever for ecological and energy transition.
Prepare for climate change adaptation, integrating actions across all sectors and functions of the territory.
Preserve air quality by reducing energy consumption, changing our transportation and consumption modes, and reducing CO₂ emissions, thereby also reducing pollutants in the atmosphere and improving residents' health.
Co-construct the future, involving all local actors in a collective effort and engaging the population in an educational and participatory approach to evolve consumption and usage behaviors.
Enable the replicability of its actions in other cities.

# 1.1 Work Process

To develop the CCC, Greater Dunkirk has decided to follow the transition roadmap. The action plan therefore includes the 3 main stages of construction:

Building a strong mandate
Understanding the system
Co-designing a portfolio of actions

Greater Dunkirk understands that concerted effort from all sectors is vital to achieving climate neutrality. By joining the 112 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, the municipality signals its strong commitment to this goal. The Climate City Contract will serve as a roadmap to align local initiatives and investments with this ambitious vision.

|  Build a strong mandate | Within city government | Set up / strengthen the internal team  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |   |  Mobilise ressources and capacity  |
|   |  Within the local ecosystem | Develop a multi-aco Transition team  |
|   |   |  Build new collaborative governance structures and networks  |
|   |  With the other government levels | Strengthen buy-in
Clarify mutual commitments  |

Greater Dunkirk is fully committed to the ecological transition. Thanks to a structured organization centered around a department dedicated to sustainable cities and a specialized service for climate, air, and energy transition, it has already raised awareness among a large portion of its employees about the challenges of climate change. The Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan (PCAET) has strengthened this dynamic by integrating all the services of Greater Dunkirk.

While the industrial and port area, already targeted by numerous initiatives, has been temporarily excluded from the direct scope of the CCC, this in no way signifies a disinterest in these issues. On the contrary, Greater Dunkirk is aware of the interconnections between the different sectors of the territory and aims to ensure a just and inclusive transition for all inhabitants.

The 'Climate, Air, and Energy Transition' service plays a central role in supporting operational services and promoting a systemic approach. The territory, recognized as a decarbonization hub, has a dense partnership network, facilitating the implementation of innovative projects. The initial actions of the CCC have focused on urban challenges, but Greater Dunkirk plans to strengthen collaboration with actors in industrial decarbonization to ensure overall coherence of the transition.

In short, Greater Dunkirk has established a solid framework to support the ecological transition of its territory. By prioritizing a balanced approach between urban and industrial challenges, it aims to contribute to improving the quality of life for all its inhabitants.

French government at other levels provide significant and multifaceted support to local authorities, including Greater Dunkirk. In the context of the CCC, the region Hauts-de-France and the France Ville Durable association are acting as key partners of Greater Dunkirk. The 'transition team' is designed as a dynamic structure, intended to adapt to the evolving needs of the project. Given the tight deadlines imposed by the drafting of the CCC, Greater Dunkirk has had to set priorities. With a workforce of nearly 3,000 employees, the establishment has a vast pool of internal expertise.

The CCC gave new thinking perspectives, and the idea is now to create new partnerships that will last longer than the political cycles.

## The National Allocation Plan (NAP) and the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)

The National Allocation Plan (NAP) is a key instrument of French climate policy, designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It is part of the broader European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), a market-based mechanism aimed at limiting CO₂ emissions by allocating tradable emission allowances to companies.

## What is the NAP?

The NAP defines the maximum amount of CO₂ that a French industrial or energy site can emit each year. This allocation is determined based on several criteria:

Emission reduction potential: Sectors with significant room for reducing emissions are allocated fewer allowances.
Growth forecasts: Growing sectors are allocated more allowances to accommodate their development.
Reduction technologies: Companies investing in clean technologies can benefit from a more favorable allocation.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
How does the EU ETS work?

The EU ETS is a market where companies can buy and sell emission allowances. The price of allowances is determined by supply and demand. If a company exceeds its annual quota, it must purchase additional allowances on the market. Conversely, if it reduces its emissions beyond its quota, it can sell its surplus.

This mechanism incentivizes companies to invest in cleaner technologies to reduce their costs. Indeed, it is often more profitable to invest in less polluting equipment than to buy additional allowances.

The NAP is closely linked to the EU ETS. The allowances allocated under the NAP are tradable on the European emissions market. Thus, the NAP contributes to implementing the EU ETS at the national level.

## The regulatory framework

The EU ETS is governed by a European directive and national laws. Directive 2003/87 establishes the fundamental principles of the system. In France, these provisions are transposed into the environmental code. The NAP is also subject to a specific regulatory framework that defines the modalities for allocating allowances and the obligations of companies.

In Dunkirk, biggest emitters are:

# Identification of barriers:

The ecological transition of local authorities is a complex challenge, faced with multiple obstacles. Budgetary constraints are often significant, with the most virtuous solutions requiring substantial initial investments. Administrative procedures, which are often lengthy and complex, significantly slow down the implementation of projects. Furthermore, the prioritization of projects, a deep understanding of territories and their specific challenges, as well as considering land and regulatory issues are all challenges to be overcome.

However, these difficulties should not overshadow the opportunities offered by this transition. A better understanding of territories and their challenges allows for solutions to be tailored to local realities. Moreover, communication about these issues is essential to foster the support of citizens and local stakeholders. Finally, while conflicts of interest may arise, it is possible to find solutions that reconcile economic and environmental interests.

# Levers of change :

While the levers for ecological transition within local authorities have been identified for some time, financial support mechanisms, whether European, national, regional or departmental, now offer concrete opportunities to implement ambitious projects. Faced with the complexity of the challenges, it is essential to promote a cross-cutting approach, allowing for the pooling of expertise and resources between different themes. This collaborative dynamic makes it possible to identify innovative solutions and strengthen the effectiveness of the actions undertaken. Furthermore, the growing consideration of environmental impacts in the evaluation of projects marks a significant turning point, by integrating a broader economic and social dimension.

Greater Dunkirk has proactively implemented climate actions since 2009. The comprehensive climate plan, encompassing 80 actions across 12 key areas, serves as a robust foundation for achieving net zero by 2050. This plan fosters collaboration between Greater Dunkirk and its partners. The inclusion of 326 performance indicators within the climate plan underscores Greater Dunkirk's commitment to rigorous monitoring and evaluation. The Net Zero Cities theory of change facilitated the development of innovative approaches and a shared vision for the future, to reach the goal on 2030.

Financial resources represent the most significant hurdle in the path towards climate action. Without adequate funding, even the most ambitious plans remain theoretical constructs. Therefore, securing financial support is paramount to transforming climate strategies into tangible realities.

# 2. Part A – Current State of Climate Action

## 2.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

To provide a comprehensive understanding of Greater Dunkirk's environmental dynamics, we've presented a detailed analysis of the territory, including industries. While the CCC specifically targets the living area, the 2018 GHG inventory covers the entire territory. Given the interconnectedness of industries and residential areas, we've included industrial emissions to offer a holistic view of Greater Dunkirk's carbon footprint. Additionally, we'll present a breakdown of emissions generated solely by citizens.

To limit the rise in temperatures to 1.5°C, the implementation of mitigation measures aimed at reducing GHGs to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 will be necessary to stabilize the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere and therefore the climate.

These actions must be accompanied by adaptation measures to reduce the effects induced by global warming: impacts on biodiversity, rising sea levels and coastal erosion, changes in rainfall patterns and extreme weather events, and urban heat island phenomena. Above all, it will be about adapting our lifestyles and development to the foreseeable effects of global warming.

ADEME (Agency for Ecological Transition) scope 1 and 2 emissions (regulatory framework) were considered in the reports. This includes, on the one hand, emissions physically emitted within the territory (excluding the energy industry), and on the other hand, emissions associated with the production of electricity and heat consumed in the territory.

Scope 3 emissions (emissions during the manufacturing of goods and services consumed in the territory) were also considered. These are emissions released at the end of a transformation or production process. For example, the production and transportation of fossil fuels to their place of consumption generate greenhouse gas emissions. Another example is the consumption of food products (fresh vegetables, industrial cakes, canned goods, etc.), which indirectly generates greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from agricultural production processes and the energy used to transform and transport these products.

The greenhouse gases (GHGs) considered in this study are defined by the Kyoto Protocol. These are the following gases:

Carbon dioxide (CO₂);
Methane (CH₄);
Nitrous oxide (N₂O);
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs);
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs);
Sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆);
Nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃).

These gases have different origins (transport, agriculture, heating, air conditioning, etc.) and do not all have the same effects on climate change. Indeed, some have greater warming potential than others and/or a longer lifespan. The contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect is measured by its global warming potential (GWP). The GWP of a gas is defined as the radiative forcing (i.e., the radiative power that the greenhouse gas returns to the ground), accumulated over a period of 100 years. This value is measured relative to CO₂, the reference gas.

The diagnostic results are expressed in tons of CO₂ equivalent (tCO₂eq), the reference unit for accounting for greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. Taking the GWP into account provides a unit of comparison for greenhouse gases and indicates the cumulative impact of each gas on the climate. Expressing the emissions of different sectors and territories in a common unit makes it possible to estimate the relative contribution of each sector and each type of housing to the overall volume of emissions.

## 2.1.1 The "Bilan Carbone Territorial*" Measurement Tool

The methodology is detailed here. The Bilan Carbone* tool is a French software (Excel spreadsheet) developed by ADEME to calculate greenhouse gas emissions from an activity, product, service, raw material, etc. The method is based on emission factors, which convert observable and measurable data into GHG emissions using average values published annually by ADEME.

One of the distinctive principles of this method is to account for both direct and indirect emissions (i.e., emissions associated with the extraction, manufacturing, transformation, transport, destruction, etc., of the product or raw material). The main emission categories considered include:

The use of fossil fuels (gas, oil, coal, etc.)
The consumption of electricity or steam (district heating networks)
Physico-chemical reactions excluding combustion (leaks, refrigerants, etc.)
Transport of people and goods
Basic materials used for community activities (steel, aluminum, plastic, paper, etc.)
End-of-life treatment of waste, including wastewater
The use of fixed assets (buildings, machines, tools, etc.)
Purchased services (insurance, cleaning services, etc.)

The tool is available in a territorial version, updated in October 2019. This version estimates the emissions of a territory across the following sectors:

Energy industry
Industrial processes
Tertiary sector
Residential
Agriculture and fishing
Goods transport (freight)
Passenger transport (travel)
Construction and roads
Waste
Inputs

The unit of measurement for Bilan Carbone® is the ton of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalent.

## 2.1.2 GREATER DUNKIRK internal context

Following the signing of the Covenant of Mayors in April 2008, Greater Dunkirk (Dunkirk Urban Community) embarked on developing a voluntary Territorial Climate and Energy Plan (PCET). Subsequently, it initiated the creation of a Climate-Air-Energy Plan (PCAET) in line with the energy transition law for green growth.

Greater Dunkirk's various initiatives support efforts to combat and adapt to climate change. The table below outlines the main initiatives that structure the Community's "energy/climate" policy.

## 2.1.3 Updating Greater Dunkirk GHG emissions report

Greater Dunkirk has developed its Territorial Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (BEGES) for the years 2008, 2011, and 2015. The results presented in this report provide an update of these assessments to analyze observed changes.

These changes should be interpreted with caution, as methodologies and databases may have varied between the reference years. Where possible, these modifications are detailed by activity category. The recent update of the Bilan Carbone® tool and the ongoing updates of emission factors also help explain the changes in certain categories.

This inventory was conducted for the year 2018 (or 2017 when data were not available), using version V8 of the Bilan Carbone® tool wherever possible.

Detailed results by position

# 2.1.6.1 Industrial processes

It is important to note that the Dunkirk industrial-port zone is excluded from the CCC. To provide context, the GHG emissions from the industrial sector in this area are substantial. However, for the purpose of this report, the focus will be on presenting a brief overview of these emissions to illustrate the territory's profile. This approach helps to justify the decision to exclude the industrial-port zone from the CCC, as its emissions profile is distinct and requires separate consideration in our strategic planning.

Industrial processes: 16.4 million  $\mathrm{teqCO_2 \pm 2\%}$

&gt;  $64\%$  of the GHG emissions balance
&gt; 13 industries subject to the PNAQ in the territory
The steel industry represents  $90\%$  of the volume of emissions

Emissions linked to industrial processes are estimated at 16.4 million tons  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  equivalent. Emissions linked to the direct accounting of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  (table 1) represent almost  $98\%$  of the volume of emissions. The remainder is due to electricity consumption and other industries in the region. industries. ArcelorMittal's factories alone account for  $85\%$  of industrial emissions, and and  $54\%$  of the region's emissions (but also  $3\%$  of French emissions).

Emissions are concentrated in Dunkirk and the other towns in the industrial and port zone: Loon-Plage, Grande-Synthe, Gravelines.

Figure 14 : Traffic data on highways and other main roads. Annual daily average and percentage of heavyweight trucks

Freight totals 2.23 million tons of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  equivalent of which  $91\%$  is attributable to maritime and river traffic. Although these modes of transport are more efficient by relating emissions per ton transported, the very large volumes passing through the port explain this distribution. Road freight is responsible for  $9\%$  of emissions, of which  $31\%$  is due to road transit and  $69\%$  for transit entering and leaving the territory. Rail freight represents only  $0.11\%$  of GE freight emissions in 2017.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
Figure 15 : Types of freight transport

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
.
Emissions from passenger travel amount to 691 kteqCO₂, or 3% of the territory's emissions. 64% of these emissions concern road traffic, a quarter concern ferry travel, 10% come from air traffic and 1% from rail traffic.

Emissions are again largely driven by the municipality of Dunkirk, which is home to the port, and by the most populated municipalities, or located on a major route.

The emissions generated by movement of people increase by 53% compared to 2014, with the new consideration of ferry movements, and the slight increase in resident road traffic (+3.4%) and the very significant increase in transit road traffic, probably due to the modification of the methods and databases used.

# 2.1.6.5 Inputs

Inputs: 332 kteqCO₂±49%

1.3% of the GHG emissions balance
98% of these emissions are associated with food products consumed on the territory

Inputs are at the origin of the emission of 332 kteqCO₂, including 98% for food, 1% for paper and cardboard, 0.9% for plastic and 0.4% for metals. The territorial distribution follows the distribution of inhabitants.

These emissions are up slightly by 2.7% compared to 2014, but down by 6% if we consider the climate correction. This can be explained by the construction of new, more efficient housing, and by the renovation of old housing.

## 2.1.6.7 Tertiary

Tertiary: 146 kteqCO₂±9%

0.6% of the GHG emissions balance
44% of emissions due to gas, and 44% to fuel oil

# 2.1.6.10 End of life of waste

End of life of waste: 36 kteqCO₂±41%

0.1% of the GHG emissions balance
78% of emissions due to the treatment of household waste

The data from 2019 shows that activities within our living area contribute significantly to the territory's greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 71.3% of the total. Excluding industrial emissions, the tertiary, residential, transportation, and waste management sectors are the primary contributors. Personal travel and household waste play a major role. These findings highlight the urgent need for local action to reduce our carbon footprint.

# GHG Emissions Baseline inventory

Our city has reported a GHG emission inventory for 2019 on MyCovenant. It also appears in the annex of our CCC. While the inventory aligns with the Cities Mission's Info Kit requirements, there's a mismatch between the inventory's 2019 timeframe and our climate plan's 2050 target. We plan to update the inventory every 3 years but are considering more frequent updates to align with our CCC actions.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 27 : Greenhouse gas emissions repartition in waste sector

The inventory highlights transport, waste, energy, and buildings as major pollution sources, informing our focus areas and ecologic vision. Its data also supports the key strategic priorities outlined in our 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments, thanks to the Madrid economic model.

## 2.2 Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

Those policies are focused on most GHG emissions sectors (buildings, transportation, waste and energy). While they all focus on the climate objectives of 45% reduction for 2030, they have an impact on the 3 scopes.

For your information, the PCAET must fit into a hierarchy of "framework" documents and must respect the following links:

&gt; Consideration of national laws and strategies:
&gt; - Energy Transition for Green Growth Act of August 18, 2015;
Energy and Climate Act of November 8, 2019;
National Low Carbon Strategy (SNBC2) of April 23, 2020;
Multi-year Energy Programming approved in November 2019;

&gt; Compatibility with regional and local strategies:
Regional Planning and Sustainable Development Scheme of the Hauts-de-France region adopted by the Regional Council on June 30, 2020;
Air Protection Plan (PPA) of the departments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais by the prefect of the region on March 27, 2014. This document is currently being revised.

As a reminder, the local urban development plan (PLU) and Intercommunal Local Urban Plan (PLUi) must be compatible with the Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan, while the latter must consider a possible territorial coherence scheme (SCoT).

It should also be noted that, because of the "Elan law", Ordinance No. 2021-744 relating to the modernization of territorial coherence schemes was published on June 17. In summary, the ordinance significantly revises the scope, content, and structure of the territorial coherence scheme (SCoT), which is evolving to reaffirm the coherence between the themes addressed and to make the strategic project more readable. The ordinance provides for the capacity for this new SCoT to be worth a Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan (PCAET), thus allowing for greater coherence between these two strategic documents. However, it will remain possible to update the PCAET (and related documents) without it being necessary to revise or modify the entire territorial coherence scheme.

The Energy and Climate Law

Enacted in November 2019, the Energy and Climate Law strengthens certain ambitions of national climate policy. The objective is to enshrine the ecological and climate emergency in law, with a particular focus on achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. It focuses on four main areas:

&gt; The gradual phase-out of fossil fuels and the development of renewable energies:
&gt; - A 40% reduction in fossil fuel consumption by 2030 compared to 2012;
&gt; - The cessation of coal-fired electricity generation by 2022;
&gt; - The mandatory installation of solar panels on new warehouses, supermarkets, and parking lots;
&gt; - Reaching 33% of renewable energy in the energy mix by 2030;
&gt; - Support for the hydrogen sector.

&gt; The fight against energy-inefficient buildings:
&gt; - Renovating 100% of energy-inefficient buildings (classes F&amp;G) within 10 years;
&gt; - From 2021, restrictions imposed on owners of unrenovated energy-inefficient buildings on rent increases;
&gt; - From 2022, an energy audit will complement energy performance diagnoses for the sale or rental of a property;
&gt; - From 2023, extremely energy-consuming housing will be classified as unfit for habitation, forcing owners to renovate or no longer rent them;
&gt; - By 2028, renovation work in energy-inefficient buildings will become mandatory.

&gt; The establishment of new tools for steering, governance, and evaluation of climate policy:
&gt; - Establishment of a High Council for the Climate responsible for evaluating France's climate strategy and the effectiveness of measures implemented to achieve its ambitions;
&gt; - Confirmation of the National Low Carbon Strategy as a tool for steering climate change mitigation actions;
&gt; - From 2023, major energy objectives set by a five-year programming law (Multi-Year Energy Programming);
&gt; - Implementation of a "green budget" (analysis of the environmental impacts of the draft finance bill).

&gt; Regulation of the electricity and gas production sectors:
&gt; - Gradual end of regulated gas sales tariffs by 2023;
&gt; - Reduction of dependence on nuclear power;
&gt; - Strengthening controls to combat fraud in energy savings certificates (CEE).

## 2.2.2.4 Multi-Year Energy Programming

The Multi-Year Energy Programming (PPE) 2019-2023 was approved in 2019.

The PPE sets out the priorities for public authorities in the energy sector to achieve the energy policy objectives defined by law. The plan thus sets targets for final energy consumption, primary consumption of fossil fuels, greenhouse gas emissions from energy combustion, renewable heat consumption, renewable gas production, installed renewable electricity generation capacity, and nuclear electricity generation capacity.

# 2.2.2.6 The National Plan for Reducing Air Pollution Emissions (PREPA)

The PREPA sets out the State's strategy for reducing air pollutant emissions at the national level and complying with European requirements. It is one of the tools for implementing climate-air-energy policy. It combines the various public policy tools: sectoral regulations, fiscal measures, incentives, awareness-raising and mobilization actions for stakeholders, and actions to improve knowledge.

The regulatory texts establishing the PREPA, provided for by the LTECV presented above, were published in the Official Journal of 11 May 2017:

Decree No. 2017-949 of 10 May 2017 setting the reduction targets for 2020, 2025 and 2030 for the five pollutants targeted (SO2, NOx, NH3, NMVOCs, PM2.5);
The order of 10 May 2017 establishing the PREPA. This text sets out the reduction actions in all sectors for the period 2017-2021.
A new order of 8 December 2022, detailing the 2022-2025 plan and defining new measures to be implemented for the period 2022-2025

|  Pollutants | 2025-2029 | À partir de 2030  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Sulfur dioxide SO₂ | -66 % | -77 %  |
|  Nitrogen oxide NOX | -60 % | -69 %  |
|  NMVOC | -47 % | -52 %  |
|  NH₃ | -8 % | -13 %  |
|  PM 2.5 | -42 % | -57 %  |

# Tools to support local authorities

## Contractualisation between State and territories: Contract for a successful ecological transition (CRTE)

One of the tools for ecological planning is the contract for a successful ecological transition, which aims to implement the national plan in each territory. Contracts for a successful ecological transition are a joint roadmap of actions to be carried out at inter-municipal or multi-municipal level to provide a crosscutting response to the challenges of territorial cohesion and ecological transition. This document is signed between the State (prefect) and a metropolitan area, and not with a city.

The aim is to facilitate understanding of existing strategies and plans by bringing them together into a single roadmap.

Each metropolitan area is free in the elaboration of the CRTE. There is no mandatory item. However, there are recommendations to help them drafting CRTE with the following elements:

Bringing knowledge about the territory with a territory project for instance
Defining strategic orientations
Building a multi-year action plan and describing the commitment of partners involved in the contract
Adding annual financial protocol
Projects from CRTE can be financed by the French recovery plan (called France relance), or French Green Fund, European funds, etc.

## Financing tools for ecological transition

### Green fund

One of the tools of ecological planning is the Green Fund which was created in 2023 to support local authorities in their fight against climate change and the protection of biodiversity. The budget in 2023 was 2 billion euros and it is the same in 2024. The fund is guaranteed until 2027. The priority of the Green Fund is to finance ambitious projects concerning ecological transition. The green fund can finance projects from the contract for a successful ecological transition (see above 5.1). A third of the projects financed by the Green Fund were part of these contracts but only a quarter of the Green Fund budget is dedicated to contracts for a successful ecological transition. The fund is the main tool of the French Ministry of Ecological Transition to help territories and cities in their transition.

### Other tools

They are other tools and financial aid for ecological transition of territories in France. The National Agency for Territorial Coherence (ANCT) gathers on a website all the financial aid available for cities and local authorities.

The French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME) offers financial aid to local authorities such as a heat fund, circular economy fund or France 2030 (recovery fund). The aim of this financial aid is to support the planning of the ecological transition of territories, supporting change, studies, implementation, investments, innovation and the sharing of solutions between territories.

The Bank for territories (Banque des territoires) has a lot of offers concerning ecological transition. The specificity of this bank is to be exclusively working with territories. They offer loans or engineering assistance and the EIB is financing partially the bank for territories.

All these tools are not enough to finance ecological transition of French cities.

## Support in defining strategies and action plans

### Data and evaluation

The Regional Energy and Climate Observatories (OREC) are the local authorities' point of contact for local energy and climate data. Their role is to support local authorities in implementing their energy and climate strategies, by producing status indicators and dashboards at regional and inter-municipal levels. All regional observatories are part of the network of regional energy and environment agencies (RARE). The network has initiated a project with its members and partners to work on the convergence of OREC calculation methodologies, to have local energy and climate indicators that can be compared and added together at a national level. The project is financed by the Ministry of Ecological Transition, the Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME) and Régions de France (an association gathering all French regions).

## Certification: Territory committed to ecological transition (TETE)

The French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME) created a certification 'territory committed to ecological transition' (TETE). It is not a mandatory program but cities or metropolitan areas that are involved in the process must build a four-year action plan. After the implementation of the action plan, the agency undertakes an evaluation and delivers the certification. Cities or metropolitan areas receive a score out of 5 (5 is the highest) based on the level of ecological transition. The certification aims to highlight the evolution and the commitment towards ecological transition. The program can finance ecological transition experts and it helps in implementing the action plan.

Scores of French Mission Cities: Dunkerque (5), Bordeaux (5), Nantes (5), Angers (4), Grenoble (4), Lyon (4), Dijon (3), Marseille (1).

The Regional Framework

## 2.2.3.1 The Regional Planning, Sustainable Development, and Territorial Equality Scheme (SRADDET) of the Hauts-de-France region

Approved in 2020, the SRADDET of Hauts-de-France aims to define regional objectives that will contribute to national ambitions to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (LTECV).

In application of the regulatory framework, the SRADDET sets quantitative targets for energy efficiency, climate change mitigation, and air pollution control by the mid-year of the most distant carbon budgets, i.e., in the years: 2021, 2026, 2031, 2050.

Based on the initial scenarios of the SRCAEs, the updated and harmonized scenario work at the scale of Hauts-de-France has made it possible to define a trajectory for reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions around four hierarchical benchmarks:

Energy sobriety;
Energy efficiency to control energy consumption;
The development of renewable energies in the regional energy mix;
The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through capture, in particular through the preservation and improvement of carbon sinks.

General rules 7 and 8 set the quantitative targets to be achieved by 2031 by the PCAETs:

Rule 7: "PCAETs must have a quantified strategy, overall and by sector of activity (industry, residential, tertiary, transport, agriculture) in order to contribute to the regional objective of reducing energy consumption by at least 30% by 2031 compared to 2012, and by at least 40% for GHG emissions."
Rule 8: "SCoTs and PCAETs contribute to the regional objective of prioritizing the development of renewable energies and recovery other than onshore wind. The territorial strategy, quantified within the framework of PCAETs, must make it possible to achieve a production of renewable energy and recovered energy of at least 28% of the final energy consumption of their territory in 2031. It takes into account their local potential and the capacities for exchanges with neighboring territories and respecting ecosystems and their functions as well as the ecological quality of soils."

Article 85 of the Mobility Orientation Act (LOM) requires certain intercommunal authorities (EPCI) to include in their Climate, Air, and Energy Territorial Plans (PCAET) an "air pollution reduction action plan" setting biennial emission reduction targets from 2022 onwards, at least as demanding as those of the national plan for reducing air pollution emissions (PREPA). This plan must include a study on the creation of a low-emission mobility zone (ZFE-M). The obligation applies to EPCIs with more than 100,000 inhabitants and EPCIs with more than 20,000 inhabitants that are wholly or partly covered by an air quality protection plan (PPA). Greater Dunkirk must therefore implement this enhanced air plan.

In Greater Dunkirk, the local plans, or the local declinaison of regional plans are :

## 2.2.3.2 SCoT : Territorial Cohesion Plan

The territorial coherence plan is a strategic urban planning document, which defines the spatial organisation and main development guidelines of the territory. The SCoT serves as a framework for sectoral policies, such as those focusing on spatial organisation and urban planning, housing, mobility, commercial development, environment, including biodiversity, energy and climate. The SCoT plan must follow objectives from the SRADDET but it also influences other local plans such as PCAET, which has to consider the SCoT.

In Greater Dunkirk, the SCoT is linked to another collectivity, a different territory, but the synergies are the same. It was approved on march 2020, and entered into force in July 2022.

## 2.2.3.3 PLUiHD : Intercommunal Local Town Planning Plan Housing and Transport

The intercommunal local urban development plan is a local document for urban planning that sets out the rules for land use and development. The conditions for land use must respect the principles of sustainable development. The SCoT remains the major document concerning local urban planning, and the PLUI must consider it.

In Greater Dunkirk, the PLUiHD was approved at the end of 2022, implemented since 2023. No studies have been made to assess the impact of this plan on Greater Dunkirk GHG emissions.

The aim of the Program of Guidelines and Actions (POA) of the PLUIHD, is to translate the general guidelines for transport and travel into more operational terms. After a trend over the last 20 years towards increased car use (between 1991 and 2015) to the detriment of other modes of transport, the aim is to encourage greater use of walking, cycling and public transport, while advocating a shared and more rational use of the car.

### THE 8 AXES ARE THEREFORE ORGANIZED AS FOLLOWS:

Develop and manage public space considering all uses and promoting safety in general, especially for the most vulnerable.
Strengthen walking through comfortable, direct, and legible routes and improve accessibility for all.
Promote cycling as a mode of transportation by improving the continuity, legibility, and quality of facilities, calming traffic, and developing the public parking supply.
Maintain the attractiveness of public transport.
Encourage the shared use of cars and act on parking.
Better understand and organize the transport of goods and urban logistics, promoting modal shift.
Better communicate and animate the territory.
Implement a travel plan for the industrial and port area.

For the housing part of the PLUiHD, the 2014 ALUR law enabled intercommunalities to merge housing and transportation planning into a single document. By adopting this approach, Greater Dunkirk has created a more comprehensive and coherent urban development strategy. Housing projects are now evaluated considering factors such as mobility, land use, amenities, and their impact on the overall social and geographic balance of the area.

The PLUiHD has a development axis on health with air quality and decarbonization of activities, and with the integration of nature in the city.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
As a part of the PLUiHD, Greater Dunkirk deploys a walking plan.

More trips by bike and on foot, both for commuting and leisure, contribute to reducing CO₂ emissions and greenhouse gases. Overall, the mobility component of the PLUiHD includes 6 work axes:

Axis 1. Planning and managing public space
Axis 2. Promoting walking and improving accessibility for all
Axis 3. Encouraging cycling
Axis 4. Maintaining the attractiveness of public transport
Axis 5. Encouraging car-sharing
Axis 6. Organizing freight transport and urban logistics

## Planning and managing public space

As part of Greater Dunkirk's commitment to sustainable development, we have launched a large-scale program to improve our environmental practices in terms of road infrastructure and public space development. A dedicated team has been set up to conduct an in-depth diagnosis of our activities and identify the most relevant levers for action. This approach will enable us to implement innovative solutions and strengthen our position as a reference in sustainable development.

With each road refurbishment, the question of the right place for different modes of transport is raised, with the aim of prioritizing pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users.

## Promoting Cycling

Concerned about the quality of life of the inhabitants of Greater Dunkirk and committed to improving their health, Greater Dunkirk has made mobility a priority. This is how, in continuity with the cycling debate carried out in 2020 (with more than 1500 responses to the survey), the "Vélo+" Plan was adopted in April 2021 with the ambition of accelerating the development of everyday cycling so that this active and virtuous mode reaches 6% of the share of trips in 2025.

To meet the expectations of the inhabitants, the "Vélo+" Plan prioritizes the creation of new dedicated lanes to better connect the municipalities as well as the development of a parking offer adapted to each use while promoting the emergence of a true cycling culture. Inscribed in the "eco-winning" approach, it offers various services and aids allowing inhabitants to change their practices while making savings.

The monitoring of the implementation of the action program now allows 3 years after the adoption of the plan, to draw up a positive assessment:

Increase in the use of cycling facilities by 17% compared to 2019
410 km of facilities, i.e. 25 km of additional links in 3 years
More than 10,000 grants for the purchase of a bicycle and €1 million in grants paid to residents

The document in the annex (Vélo + plan / end of 2023 report) details the main progress by axis and by action and indicates the remaining path to make the territory even more cycle friendly.

The cycling committee set up in 2020 ensures the follow-up of the implementation of this plan. It brings together elected representatives responsible for cycling from each municipality as well as associations and professionals (sellers, renters, repairers) working around cycling. Meetings are held 2 to 3 times a year with an annual cycling trip.

Strengthening walking and improving accessibility for all Our territory gives a large place to its inhabitants, by focusing on guaranteeing a good quality of life for all, regardless of age, difference or disability.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
Since the early 2000s, even before the 2005 law, Greater Dunkirk has been committed to accessibility for all, with, over the years, an increasingly important consideration within the various public policies (roads, transport, waste, culture, tourism, commerce, etc.) and increasingly upstream of projects.

Greater Dunkirk has developed its Accessibility Plan for Roads and Public Spaces (PAVE) in a collegial manner with the various owners and managers of roads but also with the help of associations. This PAVE constitutes the roadmap for the territory with a view to better accessibility of roads for all.

Adopted in December 2019, this PAVE makes it possible to highlight what has already been implemented by Greater Dunkirk and the municipalities for more than 10 years (notably in terms of design) but above all, to give a framework and an action plan to continue to improve the accessibility of public space by working more on its daily use by involving more inhabitants, businesses, technicians. The aim is to guarantee accessibility over time. The work axes are as follows:

The design and construction of new developments
The accessibility of existing roads
The use of the road / waste management
The use of the road / street furniture and green spaces
The use of the road / parking
The use of the road / terraces and advertising furniture
The use of the road / construction sites and events

This plan is monitored annually within the Intercommunal Commission for Accessibility. The Walking Plan, adopted in June 2024, further strengthens the PAVE and additionally integrates the notions of comfort and quality (see annex).

The main objective was to develop a walking plan that meets the needs and expectations of residents. To this end, in addition to identifying existing actions in favor of walking in the territory and benchmarking, Greater Dunkirk launched a large survey (1,400 usable responses) supplemented by focus groups and working groups.

Elected officials "referents for cycling and walking" from the municipalities, associations, representatives of the national education system, the police, the Nord Department, and technicians from the relevant departments of Greater Dunkirk were associated in order to share the results of the survey, the synthesis of the focus groups and to allow them to express themselves on the subject: their vision, their feelings.

Three main expectations emerged:

More comfort and attractiveness
Better cohabitation between modes of transportation
Better information

Before its adoption, the draft Walking Plan was also presented to the Mobility Partners Committee, the Intercommunal Commission for Accessibility and the Conference of Mayors (a monthly meeting with all mayors of the territory).

Based on all the contributions, five priorities were selected to make the city walkable (see Annex). The aim is now to implement the Walking Plan adopted on 14 June 2024.

This plan is consistent with other plans and initiatives underway. It includes joint actions with the Vélo+ Plan (development of greenways, bike racks, etc.). It also integrates the accessibility of the road network without reproducing all the measures detailed in the PAVE (Accessibility Plan for Roads and Public Spaces) adopted in 2019. The PAVE can thus be considered as an annex to the Walking Plan on the accessibility component.

# 2.2.3.4 PPA : atmosphere protection plan

An area must implement an Air Quality Protection Plan (AQPP) if it falls into one of the following three categories:

It experiences exceedances of air quality limit values and/or target values.
It is at risk of experiencing exceedances.
It includes one or more agglomerations with more than 250,000 inhabitants.

In Hauts-de-France, two AQPPs are deployed: the interdepartmental AQPP for Nord-Pas-de-Calais and the AQPP for the Creil region. The Urban Community of Dunkirk is covered by the Nord-Pas-de-Calais AQPP.

This AQPP was approved in 2014 but is currently being revised. It is built around 14 regulatory measures, broken down into 46 concrete actions, and aims to bring the territories of the former Nord-Pas-de-Calais region below European thresholds by 2025. They cover 9 major areas of action to restore satisfactory outdoor air quality:

Wood heating, boilers, collective heating plants, and industrial installations: prohibition of installing non-performing wood heating equipment, emission limits, information for boiler inspection professionals, and awareness-raising among individuals (wood heating)
Burning of green waste and construction waste in the open air: reminder of the prohibition
Mobility and transport: travel plans made mandatory for the largest establishments (companies, administration, schools), carpooling, speed reduction, vehicle fleets, less polluting modes of transport, urban travel plans, "CO₂, transporters commit" charter
Land use planning: taking air quality into account in planning documents (SCoT, PLU, PDU, PLUi) and impact studies related to development projects
Use of phytosanitary products: ecophyto scheme, awareness-raising and training
Adjustment of soil working equipment (agricultural machinery, forestry machinery, machinery used for green spaces and roads): passage on engine test bench
Industrial emissions: emission limits, improvement of knowledge and monitoring
Pollution episodes: implementation of the inter-prefectural procedure for informing and alerting the population
Long-term public awareness

# 2.2.3.5 RLPI: inter-municipal advertising regulations

Another plan, not focused on direct emissions, but on citizens' consumption is the inter-municipal advertising regulations. The RLP(i) provides a local framework for advertising, signs, and pre-signs. The local advertising regulation (RLP) makes it possible to adapt certain points of the national regulations applicable to advertising, signs, and pre-signs at a local level.

The Restricted Local Production Initiative (RLP(i)) seeks to combat overconsumption by limiting the exposure of citizens to excessive and often unnecessary advertising. By restricting advertising for products from abroad or those not locally produced, the RLP(i) encourages citizens to prioritize local consumption and reduce reliance on imports, while simultaneously discouraging unnecessary consumption by limiting advertising for non-essential items. This approach aims to promote sustainable consumption patterns and encourage a more mindful approach to consumerism. However, it's crucial to consider potential limitations, such as potential impacts on consumer choice and the overall economic landscape.

This strategy recognizes that excessive advertising, particularly online, plays a significant role in driving consumerism and fueling demand for non-essential goods. By reducing the influence of such advertising, this plan seeks to create a more sustainable consumption model that prioritizes local production, reduces environmental impact, and fosters a more mindful approach to consumer choices.

Figure 38 : Prospective assessment of emissions in Nord-Pas-de-Calais area between 2008 and 2015 (ATMO Nord-Pas-de-Calais)

When presenting the 2018 GHG inventory results and aiming for 2030 climate neutrality, it's important to focus on the status of this plan: it is undergoing revision in September 2024, and Greater Dunkirk is no longer included in the territory designated for this plan. As a result, we are no longer required to adhere to it.

To assess the carbon footprint and optimize budget allocation for our projects, we employed an economic model originally designed by the University of Madrid. This model has been successfully implemented by Net Zero Cities, providing a robust framework for quantifying carbon emissions and identifying cost-effective mitigation strategies. By leveraging this established tool, we were able to gain valuable insights into the environmental impact of our initiatives and make data-driven decisions to achieve our sustainability goals.

https://netzerocities.app/group-capabilitybuildingprogrammebuildingastrongeconomiccase

The documents mentioned above, the climate plan, and the CCC all share the same goal: reducing, adapting to, and mitigating GHG emissions. The key actions outlined in these documents can be found within the climate plan and the CCC's action portfolio.

The Greater Dunkirk BAU scenario was constructed by considering existing policies and plans, such as the PCAET and the PLUiHD. The model calculates the incremental effect of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan. This means that any decarbonization effects, costs, and benefits are evaluated in comparison to a business-as-usual scenario where the plan was not implemented. By focusing on the additional impacts resulting from the plan, we can accurately assess its effectiveness in reducing emissions and achieving climate neutrality goals. We assumed a continuation of current trends in energy consumption and economic development, while incorporating the measures already planned in these plans. However, it is important to note that the BAU scenario does not account for the potential effects of new, more ambitious policies that may be adopted in the future. We have taken care to avoid double counting by assigning different weights to the various measures and by transparently documenting our methodology. The results of the BAU scenario clearly show that it is necessary to strengthen actions in favor of the energy transition to achieve emissions reduction targets.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
The goal of climate neutrality by 2030 poses a major challenge for Greater Dunkirk due to its significant industrial sector. Our analyses, based on the latest Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (BEGES), reveal that 64% of GHG emissions originate from industrial activities. That's the main reason why the Greater Dunkirk's CCC strategy is to exclude industries, to focus of the living area. According to the economic model, which excludes the industrial zone, the gap between our reduction trajectories (-62%) and our targets (-80%) is mainly due to the transportation and building sectors.

The overall remaining gap to achieve climate neutrality in Greater Dunkirk by 2030, excluding the industrial port area, is 28%. This Action Plan prioritises emissions reduction in residential, waste, energy, transportation, and public building sectors, aiming to significantly bridge this gap. Grounded in the existing Climate Plan and enhanced by the CCC's innovative strategies, this plan reflects a steadfast commitment to our climate neutrality mission. While acknowledging current challenges and trajectories, we actively seek opportunities to accelerate progress through participation in this initiative.

Indeed, 45% of the investments required to achieve climate neutrality rely on citizens. To bridge this gap, the idea is to support them through various means (support, subsidies, awareness-raising, etc.) to encourage them to adapt their homes and change their travel and consumption habits. As these changes can be considerable and not always feasible, our action plan will be structured around several strategic axes:

Developing sustainable mobility: By promoting public transport, cycling, walking and encouraging the electrification of vehicle fleets.
Energy renovation of buildings: By supporting owners to improve the energy performance of their homes and promoting the construction of low-energy buildings.
Developing renewable energies: By deploying renewable energy projects in the territory, particularly offshore wind and solar power.
Strengthening territorial cooperation: By working closely with local, regional and national actors to implement large-scale projects.

Greater Dunkirk is fully committed to the energy transition, despite the challenges of dynamic economic and demographic development. Our current emissions and the targets set, many actions are underway to gradually reduce it.

## Controlled and sustainable development

Greater Dunkirk supports economic and industrial development while ensuring that its environmental impact is limited. The creation of many homes on wasteland, in compliance with the most demanding standards, testifies to this desire. However, we are aware that the technological advances needed to drastically reduce emissions come at a cost and require significant investment.

## Climate change adaptation and environmental preservation

Faced with climate challenges, Greater Dunkirk is implementing several strategies:

Prevention of natural risks: Development of risk prevention plans (PPRI, PICS, GEMAPI), reinforcement of infrastructure to better withstand extreme events.
Sustainable land use planning: Development of green spaces and wetlands, preservation of sensitive natural environments. Greater Dunkirk is also a candidate for the TEN (Territory Committed to Nature) label. It aims to support and recognise local authorities' progress in favour of biodiversity. The 3 axes of this label are:
Axis 1. Improvement of knowledge and integration of biodiversity in management
Axis 2. Maintenance and restoration of natural areas and local biodiversity
Axis 3. Raising awareness and mobilizing stakeholders

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
&gt; Food transition: This resilient region, despite previous failed attempts at local online marketplaces, has adapted by focusing on promoting the tools that consumers already use to support local food businesses. The development of an ambitious Territorial Food Plan (PAT) to promote short circuits, organic farming, and reduce food waste is also a key component of this strategy. As part of the growing "eat local" and "food transition" movement, a new food hall is set to open in 2025. Located in the city center, adjacent to the weekly market to maximize its impact, the hall will host approximately 20 local vendors and food artisans, prioritizing fresh, high-quality products from local supply chains and organic agriculture. This project aligns with a commitment to environmental sustainability and consumer health.
&gt; Support for collective catering: Implementation of innovative tools (AI, waste weighing) to optimize food waste management and raise awareness among stakeholders.

## Strengthened collaboration with local stakeholders

To accelerate the energy transition, Greater Dunkirk wishes to strengthen its collaboration with the main players in the territory (energy companies, industrialists, etc.). The objective is to develop concerted actions to reduce residual emissions.

## An evolving context

In a context of economic and demographic development, it is important to keep in mind that reducing the 18% of residual emissions will be a gradual process. However, Greater Dunkirk is committed to implementing all necessary means to limit the impact of its activities on the environment and preserve the quality of life of its inhabitants.

## Conclusion

The energy transition is a major challenge for Greater Dunkirk. Thanks to a comprehensive and ambitious strategy, in collaboration with all the stakeholders in the territory, we are convinced that we can meet this challenge and build a more sustainable future for our community.

At the same time, the implementation of the RE2020 environmental regulation in the building sector will contribute to significantly reducing building-related emissions in our territory. Greater Dunkirk, by aligning itself with these new requirements, promotes the construction of energy-efficient housing and public buildings, thus reducing our collective carbon footprint.

While industry is a driver of the local economy, it also accounts for a significant share of emissions. Greater Dunkirk works closely with industrial players to support them in their energy transition and encourage them to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. We are aware of the specificities of certain sectors, particularly those that employ vulnerable populations (single-parent families, employees outside the territory). This is why we are developing appropriate support systems to facilitate this transition, while preserving employment and the local economic dynamic.

Recognizing that Greater Dunkirk cannot achieve climate neutrality by 2030 on its own, the collectivity is dedicated to fostering strong relationships with stakeholders, including businesses, industries, associations, organisations, academia, and citizens. It is crucial to involve these groups, as they are responsible for a significant share of emissions within the territory and will be key players in implementing actions to combat climate change.

These actions will also be implemented thanks to European, national, regional funds, and drawing on the skills of Greater Dunkirk's companies, associations, institutions, etc. We are aware of the scale of the task, but we are determined to achieve our carbon neutrality objectives. We have put in place regular monitoring of our actions to ensure that they are effective and to adapt to changing circumstances.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
Our initial assessment indicates a potential residual GHG emissions level of 20% by 2030 based on the NZC objective. However, a more detailed economic model suggests a figure closer to 38%. This discrepancy primarily stems from the challenges associated with decarbonising certain sectors, such as buildings and transportation, within the given timeframe. While significant progress can be made, it is anticipated that some level of residual emissions will persist due to technological limitations and the complexity of system-wide transformations. Nevertheless, we are actively exploring innovative solutions and investing in research and development to minimize these emissions and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

As outlined in Table 8 of the investment plan, a substantial 45% of investments required to curb GHG emissions rely on citizen participation. While the Greater Dunkirk's territory can support certain sectors through subsidies, grants, and public awareness campaigns, achieving our emissions reduction targets remains highly dependent on citizen engagement, presenting the most significant uncertainties for the future.

In the future, the Transition Team will convene workshops and roundtable discussions with key stakeholders, including local government officials, industry leaders, community groups, and academic experts. These gatherings will serve as platforms to review and assess the progress of our climate neutrality plans.

By engaging a diverse range of stakeholders, Greater Dunkirk aims to:

Identify areas of success: Pinpoint strategies or initiatives that are yielding positive results.
Address challenges: Discuss and find solutions for obstacles or weaknesses in the implementation efforts.
Foster collaboration: Strengthen partnerships and build consensus among stakeholders.
Continuously improve: Gain valuable insights to refine and enhance our climate action plans.

These collaborative discussions about regulatory framework will be instrumental in ensuring that our efforts are aligned with the needs and aspirations of the community and contribute to a more sustainable future.

Residual emissions consist of those emissions which can't be reduced through climate action and are being offset. Residual emissions may amount to a maximum of 20% as stated by the Mission Info Kit.
Emissions reduction target percentage for "Other" sector is assumed to be the same as for the other 4 main sectors unless updated by city. Activities and commitments to reduce these emissions are documented in the Climate Neutrality Action Plan.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
The emissions of the industry sector are not currently considered within the CCC framework. This is because the industrial sector's decarbonization ambition is set for 2050. This inset outlines the project, along with an explanation of the major initiative being undertaken by a consortium of stakeholders to achieve the 2050 carbon neutrality goal.

# PRESENTATION OF THE DKARBONATION PROJECT

## DKarbonation

## A. The territory: the Dunkirk industrial port zone (ZIP)

The Dunkirk territory in the Hauts-de-France region is structured around the 7,000-hectare industrial port platform. The port industrial zone is located within the perimeter of Greater Dunkirk).

## The zone is structured around:

The territory of the Grand Port Maritime de Dunkerque (GPMD), which is the main area of concentration of industrialists in the territory;
Other industrial zones of Greater Dunkirk, the majority of which are directly interdependent with the port and which are confronted with the same problems.

The territory is intended to bring in its wake the entire Region, which is in fact the hinterland of the port.

## This territory has many assets:

A maritime façade giving access to the most frequented strait in the world by commercial ships;
Areas available for the establishment of major new activities, some of which are currently being developed (Large Industries Zones; Industries of the Future Zone; Dunkirk International Logistics)
Major infrastructure projects, including the doubling of the port's container capacity (CAP2020 project), and the construction of the Seine Nord Europe Canal, which should facilitate the link between the port of Dunkirk, the Paris region and the inland ports of the Hauts-de-France region.
The presence of industry giants, world champions, such as ArcelorMittal, Aluminium Dunkerque, AstraZeneca, BASF, etc.
Access to first-class energy resources.

These different elements contribute to making the Port of Dunkirk the 3rd largest port in France. It is renowned as a port for large bulk goods destined for its many industrial sites. It is also making a name for itself in other segments such as cross-Channel ro-ro to Great Britain, containers, fruit, etc.

Ranked 7th in the Northern European Range which stretches from Le Havre to Hamburg, it is also the 1st French port for importing minerals and coal; 1st French port for the import of fruit in containers; 1st French rail freight hub; 2nd French port for trade with Great Britain and Ireland; 1st river port in the Nord/Pas de Calais.

Through these various projects, the GPMD aims to strengthen its position on a national and international scale, and this ambition is reflected in the arrival of new first-rate industrial sites (Clarebout, H2V, Verkor, SNF - Flocryl, Prologium, XTC New Energy / Orano, etc.).

The territory is also a major energy platform, through its infrastructure and by the companies in the territory.

# For example:

The most powerful nuclear power plant in Western Europe - 5.4 GW;
Its LNG terminal – the 2nd largest in Europe;
A combined cycle electricity production plant for gas from the recycling of steel gas (DK6) - 790 MW;
A pipeline to import gas from Norway - 19.6 billion m³ per year of capacity;
The future offshore wind farm, with a capacity of 600MW;
The largest consumer of electricity in Europe (Aluminium Dunkerque);
The largest consumer of coke in France (ArcelorMittal);
Biofuel producers (Ryssen, Daudruy).

This context has a direct impact on the Dunkirk economy and ecosystem. The Greater Dunkirk territory has more than 460 industrial companies.

Industrial employment accounts for more than 23% of jobs in Greater Dunkirk (compared to 12.8% nationally). With a very high density of Seveso factories, the Dunkirk population has a real industrial culture and expertise, which makes it an attractive area for new industries; Skilled workforce, easier acceptability.

The turnover of industrial production in the region is more than €4,000 million (excluding energy). Energy consumption amounts to 33.4 TWh, or about 10% of the final energy consumption of industry.

Historically, the territory has always capitalised on its difficulties to bounce back and move forward, and even today has the desire to turn a problem into an opportunity for development. The local authority, through Territoire d'Innovation, has generated the momentum and federated private partners towards the transformation objectives, in particular of the industrial-port platform. This transformation will create the necessary conditions for the reception of new low-carbon activities and the transformation of those already in place towards a sustainable economy.

The entire project has one purpose: to improve the quality of life in the territory(ies) by combining environmental preservation, economic development and social cohesion. The aim is to move from a territory with major challenges to overcome to a leading territory in industrial decarbonization, cited as an example throughout Europe.

## b. The levers of decarbonization

All levers are being used to achieve the objectives of the European Green Deal:

Efficiency and energy sobriety
Circularity
Electrification and transformation of production processes
The use of low-carbon hydrogen or green gases to replace fossil fuels
CO₂ capture, transport and storage
The use and recovery of CO₂

## c. The strategy

To carry out the decarbonization of the ZIP, ÉcosystèmeD with the industrialists, the Regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) and the Grand Port Maritime de Dunkerque wish to implement a dual strategy:

A "bottom-up" strategy: the idea is to start from individual industrial projects to identify their problems and build an initial vision of reducing CO₂ emissions.
This strategy will be complemented by a "top-down" strategy to envisage and implement common infrastructures allowing manufacturers to decarbonize their processes.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
# Dunkerque, Territoire d'industrie décarbonée

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

This strategy is already at work in the first projects in the territory:

&gt; Industrialists have identified their resources and needs for heat and asked the territory to take up the subject. At the instigation of the latter, a "heat highway" study was conducted by Pôlénergie.
&gt; An CEI has been launched to build the common infrastructure needed to carry out the project. Consultation between the actors will be permanent thanks to the governance tools put in place.

## d. Actions

The actions deployed within the framework of the "DKarbonation" project are of several types:

&gt; Actions to coordinate the strategy by Greater Dunkirk, the CCI, the GPMD and the ÉcosystèmeD sponsor;

The six barriers identified —finance, communication, time, land use, regulatory, and social—are common challenges faced in various fields, from business and technology to community development and environmental protection.

|  Finance | Adopting virtuous practices, whether it involves ethical products, renewable energy, or sustainable production methods, often entails a significant additional cost. For example, investing in green technologies, such as solar panels or electric vehicles, requires a higher initial capital compared to traditional solutions. Moreover, for businesses, adopting more virtuous practices can reduce profit margins, making it difficult to remain competitive in the market. In summary, while virtuous choices are beneficial in the long term for the environment and society, their higher initial cost constitutes a financial barrier that limits their widespread adoption. | This lack of consideration for ecological impacts in the prioritization of political agendas results in delays in adopting essential measures to combat climate change. Projects with direct environmental impact, such as ecosystem protection or energy transition, are often relegated to a secondary priority. This creates a situation where inaction or delayed action exacerbates ecological crises that, in fact, require immediate responses. | The insufficient technological maturity of solutions for achieving climate neutrality, combined with high costs and regulatory uncertainties, makes investments in these technologies less profitable in the short term. To overcome these challenges, it is crucial to support innovation through favorable public policies, subsidies, and financial incentives that encourage the development and adoption of essential climate technologies.  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Communication | Climate neutrality communication campaigns, while essential for raising public awareness about environmental issues, have a major limitation: they primarily reach an already aware audience. This tendency to target individuals and groups who are already conscious of climate issues significantly limits the potential impact of these initiatives. By remaining confined to a narrow audience, campaigns risk not reflecting the diversity of perspectives and needs within the broader population. This can lead to less effective strategies that are not well-suited to the varied realities of different social groups. In conclusion, climate neutrality communication campaigns need to go beyond the circle of already aware individuals to maximise their impact. It is crucial to adopt communication strategies that address broader and more diverse audiences, using tailored messages and varied channels to effectively engage all segments of society. Achieving climate neutrality requires collective mobilization, starting with communication that successfully reaches and convinces a wider and more diverse audience. | Communication about climate neutrality faces a major challenge: the variation in perceptions of territorial issues among different stakeholders. Citizens from diverse social backgrounds, as well as public and private entities, have distinct views on climate impacts and priorities. For example, environmental concerns may differ between an urban community dealing with air pollution and a rural area affected by extreme weather events. Public and private institutions may also have divergent priorities, influenced by their specific missions and interests. This diversity of perceptions complicates the formulation of coherent and effective communication messages. To overcome this obstacle, it is essential to tailor messages and communication strategies to reflect the specific realities and concerns of each stakeholder group, to build consensus and encourage collective mobilization towards climate neutrality. | Achieving climate neutrality is hindered by a lack of coordination among the various stakeholders involved, such as elected officials, technical services, businesses, and citizens. These groups may have divergent interests and priorities, making it difficult to align actions necessary to meet climate goals. For example, elected officials might focus on short-term projects to address immediate voter concerns, while businesses may prioritise economically viable solutions without always considering long-term climate objectives. Technical services might be constrained by budget limitations or existing protocols, and citizens may have varied expectations depending on their understanding and local needs. This lack of coordination creates inefficiencies and conflicts, preventing the coherent implementation of integrated climate strategies. To overcome this challenge, it is crucial to establish effective collaboration mechanisms, clarify common goals, and encourage proactive cooperation among all involved stakeholders. A coordinated approach is essential to mobilize resources and efforts effectively and to achieve climate neutrality goals in a successful manner.  |
|  Time | The implementation of climate neutrality is hindered by complex and time-consuming administrative procedures, which significantly slow down the process. These processes involve numerous levels of approval, increasing costs and deterring investments. Additionally, fragmentation among different agencies and slow decision-making compromise the effectiveness of climate actions. To overcome these obstacles, it is essential to simplify and expedite administrative processes to facilitate a quick and coordinated response to climate challenges. | The process of thinking about climate neutrality requires a significant investment of time and is hampered by a lack of qualified personnel. To overcome these challenges, it is crucial to allocate sufficient resources to the training and recruitment of environmental specialists, while establishing support mechanisms that facilitate effective planning and implementation of climate initiatives. |   |

|  Land Use | A major obstacle to achieving climate neutrality is the conflict between private and public interests. Projects aimed at improving the environment, such as creating green spaces or optimising land use, may conflict with the individual needs or desires of citizens. People may support ecological initiatives in theory, but oppose those that directly impact their personal comfort or property. This mismatch between collective objectives and individual concerns complicates the implementation of effective environmental policies. To overcome this challenge, it is essential to find a balance that reconciles private interests with collective benefits, by engaging in constructive dialogue and proposing solutions that minimise the negative impact on individuals while achieving environmental objectives. | Developing large-scale projects is particularly complex because of the limited amount of land available. Urban density and geographical constraints limit the options for expanding infrastructure and creating new spaces. This scarcity of land makes it difficult to allocate the space needed for initiatives such as urban renewal projects, green spaces or sustainability facilities. Local authorities therefore must navigate a tight space while balancing the needs of economic growth, sustainable development and quality of life for residents. | Ageing buildings represent a significant barrier to urban development, especially in city centers where many buildings are old and not energy-efficient. Renovating these structures poses major challenges due to their complexity and high cost. Older buildings may require substantial upgrading to meet modern energy efficiency standards, which involves heavy and costly work. In addition, heritage preservation constraints and strict renovation regulations further complicate these projects. This double burden of cost and complexity limits the ability of cities to modernise their building stock while meeting their sustainability and energy efficiency objectives.  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Regulatory | Energy transition policies, while necessary to achieve climate objectives, can sometimes penalise certain players, particularly those who have already invested in ecological approaches. These actors, who have anticipated regulatory changes by adopting sustainable practices, may find themselves disadvantaged by changes in policy or regulation that favour other forms of transition. For example, new regulations may introduce stricter standards or eligibility criteria for subsidies that do not take previous efforts into account, forcing these actors to make costly additional adjustments to comply with the new requirements. This can discourage early investment in green solutions and create a sense of injustice among those who have taken proactive initiatives to protect the environment. | Another major difficulty in the energy transition is the link between the different levels of governance, in particular national, regional and local. To be effective, the energy transition requires coherence and coordination between the policies developed at these different levels. Objectives and strategies can vary considerably from one level to another, leading to inconsistencies and conflicts that complicate the implementation of initiatives. For example, ambitious national policies may not be aligned with local capacities or priorities, while local plans may lack the support or resources to comply with regional directives. This disconnection between levels of governance can slow progress, create duplication of effort or gaps in policy implementation, and reduce the overall effectiveness of energy transition actions. It is therefore crucial to develop robust coordination mechanisms and integrated frameworks to ensure that policies at each level are mutually supportive and contribute harmoniously to overall objectives. |   |
Social

Social barriers to the energy transition are often linked to social inequalities, as the most modest households are generally the most vulnerable to these changes. These households have limited financial resources, which makes them less able to finance the renovation work needed to improve the energy efficiency of their homes or to acquire energy-saving equipment. As a result, they may find themselves disadvantaged by policies that require high initial investment, despite the potential benefits in terms of energy savings and long-term cost reductions. This situation accentuates social disparities, as less well-off households are often forced to live in less comfortable and less energy-efficient conditions, while being less able to reap the benefits of energy transition policies. To overcome these barriers, it is crucial to put in place financial support schemes and targeted subsidy programs to help the most vulnerable households access the necessary improvements and benefit fully from the energy transition.

Resistance to change is a major barrier to the energy transition. Residents may be reluctant to change their energy consumption habits or to accept the constraints imposed by new environmental policies. This resistance can stem from a number of factors, including comfort with established habits, fear of the costs associated with change, or a negative perception of new technologies and practices. For example, individuals may be reluctant to invest in more energy-efficient equipment if they perceive such investments as costly or complicated to implement. What's more, the changes may require adjustments to everyday life, such as changes to temperature management or reductions in energy consumption, which may be perceived as an additional discomfort or constraint. To overcome this resistance, it is essential to put in place effective communication strategies that clearly explain the benefits of the changes, offer financial incentives to facilitate the transition, and propose appropriate solutions that minimise disruption to residents.

Our city's ambition for climate neutrality can be accelerated by leveraging existing and emerging assets, resources, and processes. One key opportunity lies in harnessing the decarbonization efforts already underway in local industries. By scaling and replicating these successful initiatives across residential and commercial sectors, we can reduce emissions more effectively. Additionally, we can optimise the use of renewable energy infrastructure, invest in energy-efficient technologies, and promote green building practices. Collaborating with local stakeholders, including businesses, government agencies, and the community, will ensure a comprehensive and inclusive approach to achieving a sustainable and resilient urban environment.

To gain a collective understanding that embraces diverse systemic perspectives, it is essential to adopt approaches that foster inclusivity, collaboration, and reflection on power dynamics.

# Facilitated Dialogue and Discussion

Imagine a room filled with individuals from all walks of life—community leaders, educators, scientists, and activists—gathered to address a complex societal challenge. The goal is to allow every voice to be heard, and a facilitator, trained in neutral moderation, guides the conversation. This inclusive forum provides space for people to openly share their experiences and views. Active listening is emphasized, encouraging participants to genuinely hear and consider perspectives that differ from their own. The facilitator's role is key in keeping the discussion balanced and constructive, ensuring that no single voice dominates the conversation and that the dialogue remains productive.

# Interdisciplinary Collaboration

To deepen understanding, the dialogue expands beyond a single field of expertise. Experts from social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences collaborate, bringing their unique lenses to the table. By sharing knowledge across disciplines, the group begins to uncover insights that would have remained hidden in isolated silos. Together, they work to identify common ground—a shared goal of improving community health, for example—that can unite their efforts. This interdisciplinary approach enhances creativity and encourages participants to view problems from new, broader perspectives.

# Systemic Thinking and Mapping

To further illuminate the complexities of the issue, the group turns to systemic thinking and mapping tools. Visual diagrams and models are created, illustrating the interconnectedness of various factors—social, economic, environmental. As they map out feedback loops and explore how elements within the system influence one another, they gain a clearer understanding of the ripple effects of proposed interventions. Scenario planning allows them to consider multiple potential futures, weighing different assumptions and variables to anticipate both intended and unintended consequences.

# Cultural Sensitivity and Adaptation

The discussions and solutions that emerge are not one-size-fits-all. The group recognizes the need for cultural sensitivity. Messaging is tailored to resonate with different audiences, with careful attention paid to local customs, values, and contexts. Whether addressing rural communities or urban populations, the group ensures that the language they use is inclusive and avoids reinforcing harmful stereotypes. By grounding their solutions in specific local realities, they make their work more relevant and meaningful for those affected.

# Power Dynamics and Equity

Throughout the process, the group remains mindful of power dynamics. They acknowledge that some participants come from positions of privilege, while others may feel marginalized or less empowered. To address these imbalances, they prioritise equity-focused approaches. Marginalized communities are not just invited to share their perspectives—they are given a central role in shaping decisions. By consciously empowering these groups and making space for their leadership, the group moves toward solutions that reflect a more just and equitable vision for the future. A description of some activities can be found on page 177.

Through these approaches—facilitated dialogue, interdisciplinary collaboration, systemic thinking, cultural sensitivity, and a commitment to equity—the group moves closer to a collective understanding that accounts for diverse systemic perspectives. The solutions they propose are richer, more inclusive, and better equipped to address the complexities of the world.

To effectively monitor these systems, Greater Dunkirk needs to establish a unified framework for data collection and analysis. Currently, we are harmonizing the indicators across all directorates of Greater Dunkirk to ensure consistency in monitoring and evaluating progress. The city should collect data on key metrics such as energy consumption, emissions levels, renewable energy usage, and the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives. This data can be analysed using advanced tools such as predictive analytics and real-time monitoring systems to track trends, assess performance, and adjust strategies as needed. Regular reporting and transparent sharing of results will further support informed decision-making and community engagement in our climate efforts.

# 3. Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

## 3.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

### B-1.1 Impact pathways

Recognizing that late outcomes will significantly impact various actors and citizens, their successful implementation requires their active involvement. Due to the project timeframe, achieving a comprehensive analysis of both early changes and late outcomes within the initial phase proved challenging. As late outcomes will be rigorously examined during the first or second iteration of the CCC, we strategically prioritized the development and monitoring of early changes to ensure their timely implementation. A dedicated workshop on late outcomes is scheduled for the summer, facilitating the alignment of late outcome indicators and metrics with those of the early changes for optimal project impact.

This table will be enhanced soon through a major initiative: Optimization of public policy evaluation indicators at the territorial level.

Greater Dunkirk has chosen to work on a research and development action led by the Institut Efficacity, funded by the French National Research Agency, to support the operational and strategic management of the territorial project. This action stems from the observation that the territorial project is an "integrative" document that federates and enhances all the community's roadmaps. However, the current siloed operation complicates reporting and access to data. The needs identified by the services are strong, both in terms of needs, expectations, and requests. Indicator reports can be random or confined to the service with a regulatory duty, while sharing or making data available remains marginal. The implementation of a support tool for "reconnecting indicators" should help to contribute to the technical and political management of the territorial project in synergy with the other roadmaps of the community. This approach aims for more efficient data management to meet a process of sharing and mutualization, but also to target relevant macro-indicators for Greater Dunkirk.

Several steps are necessary in terms of methodology:

Analysis of needs to contribute to technical and political management
Rationalization of existing reference frameworks and processes
Definition of a tooling strategy adapted to the needs of the community Imperatives will be declined in the mission:
Map and analyze the main data flows (sources and contributors) that feed the territorial project,
Work to strengthen the animation and transverse strategic governance between the departments
Meet the expectations of elected officials and residents by helping to identify key indicators ("macro-indicators") and "markers" of the territory in connection with the territorial quality of life barometer that must be set up.

Several hypotheses will be proposed and will be the subject of collective feedback. This experimental action is expected by other local authorities.

Recognizing that late outcomes will significantly impact various actors and citizens, their successful implementation requires their active involvement. Due to the project timeframe, achieving a comprehensive analysis of both early changes and late outcomes within the initial phase proved challenging. As late outcomes will be rigorously examined during the first or second iteration of the CCC, we strategically prioritized the development and monitoring of early changes to ensure their timely implementation. A dedicated workshop on late outcomes is scheduled for the summer, facilitating the alignment of late outcome indicators and metrics with those of the early changes for optimal project impact.

Many of these indicators are already being tracked as part of existing initiatives, such as environmental certifications or local plans. For those indicators that are not currently being monitored, dedicated awareness-raising sessions will be conducted by the project manager. These sessions will inform relevant colleagues about the importance of these indicators and provide them with the necessary guidance and support to ensure accurate and timely data collection.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

The unique strength of these pathways lies in their ability to reconcile short-term demands with long-term sustainability goals. Some initiatives offer immediate benefits, like improving energy efficiency or public transportation. Others focus on building a foundation for a low-carbon future through sustainable infrastructure and technological advancements. This balanced approach ensures that Greater Dunkirk's climate actions are both proactive and responsive, preparing the city for future challenges while delivering tangible results today.

In embracing these impact pathways, Greater Dunkirk is more than just responding to the urgent call of climate action; it is charting a course towards a resilient, sustainable future. This journey towards climate neutrality is a testament to the Greater Dunkirk's vision, determination, and commitment to creating a thriving, green community that will endure for generations to come.

Impact pathways offer a structured approach to achieving ecological transition and reducing GHG emissions. They provide clear, measurable goals and strategies, allowing for efficient resource allocation and progress tracking. By focusing on specific areas, these pathways enable Greater Dunkirk to maximise its impact on climate change while also fostering collaboration and managing potential risks.

To be effective, impact pathways must align closely with the current state of climate action. They should identify gaps in existing strategies, build upon existing strengths and opportunities, and propose solutions to overcome identified barriers. By analyzing Greater Dunkirk's climate action plan, decision-makers can prioritise pathways that address the most critical challenges.

The effectiveness of the presented impacts hinges on prioritizing actions that will yield the greatest results, while also considering the existing policies within Greater Dunkirk's territory. The CCC has undoubtedly invigorated the region's ecological transition, building upon the president's pre-existing commitment to sustainability. The "Net Zero Cities" framework has provided a clear roadmap for Greater Dunkirk to enhance its projects and align them with climate goals.

Furthermore, impact pathways are deeply integrated with Greater Dunkirk's long-term climate neutrality commitments. This ensures consistency, prioritization, and adaptability. By aligning with broader strategic goals, pathways can demonstrate their contribution to the overall vision for a sustainable future.

Finally, it's essential to consider both short-term and long-term perspectives when selecting impact pathways. While quick wins can generate early momentum, it's equally important to focus on actions that contribute to the territory's long-term sustainability goals. A balanced approach that combines immediate and long-term actions will create a robust and resilient climate strategy. Additionally, certain strategies require minimal financial investment, making them readily implementable and capable of delivering swift results.

By following these principles, Greater Dunkirk develops effective impact pathways that drive ecological transition, reduce GHG emissions, and build a sustainable future for its communities.

While we've presented only initial outcomes in this iteration, our future plans include a more comprehensive exploration of these findings. We aim to delve deeper into the early results, refining our understanding and developing them further. Additionally, we're committed to identifying and addressing potential limitations, and exploring the long-term implications of our work. By continuing to iterate and expand upon our research, we hope to achieve a more complete and nuanced picture of the subject

|  Context of the action | The local authority formulates a heritage strategy that makes it possible to plan and phase its development over 5 or 10 years (extension, rehabilitation, demolition, reassignment, sale, etc.), in line with the objectives of reducing GHG emissions and energy consumption of its buildings. This strategy is more specifically broken down into a renovation programme taking into account:
ambitious climate-air-energy performance criteria
Optimising the use of assets (pooling/grouping)
monitoring methods to maintain performance over time
Anticipated costs and savings
the date of completion
the person responsible for the implementation
Contracting methods such as the energy performance contract (global energy performance contract or public energy partnership contract)
the expected gains in terms of climate change mitigation, adaptation to climate change, improvement of indoor and outdoor air quality
The local authority carefully studies the needs of the buildings to avoid any oversizing of heating, hot water, ventilation and, where appropriate, cooking and refrigeration equipment during equipment replacements and building renovations.
The CUD has recorded the political will to set up a heritage strategy or a renovation plan (political deliberation; budgetary decision (works budget or engineering envelope for external service to develop the strategy); allocation of human resources internally). It has also implemented a strategy to rationalise its assets (technical inventory, strategy, control of the surface areas of the local authority's assets or even reduction)  |   |   |

|  Action 25 | Continue education and awareness-raising activities in schools and early childhood centres  |   |   |
|  Objectives | Awareness-raising (energy/climate/air culture of elected officials, services and residents)
• The local authority is developing education and awareness-raising actions on the climate-air-energy issue in schools, nurseries and daycare centres. These actions are varied (form and content), and involve students, teachers and staff. As far as possible, they are integrated into an overall educational project and are planned over the year or even the entire cycle. Some actions are directly aimed at reducing energy and water consumption and pollutant emissions linked to the use of premises and school travel.
• The OUICHANGE association has submitted a contribution under the PCAET by proposing various actions to raise awareness of our carbon footprint. - "Convinced that the ecological transition can only be achieved with the mobilization of citizens and in particular the enthusiasm of young people, the OuiChange association, whose objective is to contribute to reducing everyone's carbon footprint, is mainly aimed at the school environment. OuiChange has developed an inclusive program from PS to CM2 based on the national education programs (ESD 2030) with themes around food, waste, consumption... It supports teachers (training materials, projects, workshops), students (putting them into action via challenges) but also parents (conferences, participation in challenges and projects) in a joyful and sustainable ecological transition. In addition, collective catering can be involved in developing healthy, diversified meals that use local production. This program, which was already implemented in Lille schools at the start of the 2021 school year, after a pilot school test in 2020, is giving very exciting results. Having joined the association as a referent in Dunkirk, I wish to develop this approach in Dunkirk schools to contribute, or even accelerate, the ecological transition in which the CUD is already strongly committed."  |   |   |

|  Action 27 | Plan the renovation of residential buildings and sustainable construction on the territory  |
|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Energy sobriety  |
|  Context of the action | Residential buildings
The residential stock is responsible for 2/3 of GHG emissions from the building sector. The integration of climate-air-energy issues and objectives within the PLUiHD/PLH makes it possible to mobilise housing stakeholders and to be consistent with the renovation and sustainable construction objectives set out in the Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan. It is necessary to encourage all the players in the territory to stimulate the launch of energy-efficient rehabilitation and construction projects for the private sector.
The local authority has one or more mechanisms structuring the construction and renovation policy of buildings (residential and tertiary) on its territory, aimed at promoting climate-air-energy performance. This policy prioritizes actions and sets operational and territorial quantified objectives (number, type of buildings and level of performance, optimization of surface areas to reduce the need for new buildings and improve the use of existing buildings, etc.), in accordance with national objectives (the implementation of the energy renovation plan for housing).
The local strategy is formalised: in a local housing programme (PLH), in a tertiary sector renovation strategy or in the framework documents of a FAIRE advice centre, for example. It is built in a transversal and integrated way with travel planning, land use planning, urban planning and the territorial climate, air and energy plan.  |
|  Sub- actions | • Considering climate, air and energy issues in the "housing" strategy
• Build the building policy in a transversal and integrated way with other themes and actors
• Setting high performance levels to be achieved for building construction and renovations
• Involve in the planning of operational and financial arrangements

|  Action 28 | Supporting and controlling construction and renovation work  |
|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Energy sobriety  |
|  Context of the action | The planning authorisation and works control procedures aim to promote the emergence of better-quality construction and renovation in the territory, in terms of climate-air-energy performance. Petitioners are made aware of and supported in this regard, as it is essential to guide individuals and builders, even before the building permit is filed, towards sustainable construction to avoid "coup partis". The petitioners' contacts with the local authority during their administrative procedures make it possible to raise their awareness of energy efficiency and the development of renewable energies outside the usual events for the public and in a more targeted manner. The detailed monitoring of urban planning authorisations makes it possible to collect data and check whether all the awareness-raising actions and aid (financial or technical) are bearing fruit in a diffuse manner in the territory.

|  Action 32 | Supporting tertiary sector players in the renovation and sustainable construction of their premises  |
|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Energy sobriety, Awareness-raising (energy/climate/air culture of elected officials, services and residents)

The ELAN law (Evolution of Housing, Development and Digital Technology) has included in the Construction and Housing Code an obligation to reduce the energy consumption of buildings under public procurement

s. Decree No. 2019-771 of 23 July 2019 on the obligations to reduce final energy consumption in tertiary buildings specifies the terms and conditions for the implementation of the obligation to reduce energy consumption in tertiary buildings. This applies to buildings with a surface area of more than 1,000 m2. They will have to reduce their consumption by at least 40% in 2030, 50% in 2040 and 60% in 2050 compared to 2010.

The local authority has a role to play as a territorial facilitator to give impetus to the territory to act indirectly on energy losses from tertiary buildings. Players in the private tertiary sector are encouraged and supported to improve the energy and climate performance of their premises. As part of the call for contributions launched by the CUD under the PCAET on the platform Changing life together, the University of the Littoral Côte d'Opale (ULCO) proposed a contribution that could be related to this action. Indeed, ULCO has been committed since 2021 to the development of a sustainable development and social responsibility (DDetRS) reference framework whose objectives are to include the establishment in an ecological transition approach. Thus, all the university's missions are concerned: research, training as well as social and environmental policy. As part of its DDetRS commitment, ULCO is committed to moving towards a rational use of energy in its buildings.

Have visible and accessible climate-air-energy information services for tertiary actors
Go beyond one-off advice for the sustainable renovation of the private tertiary sector (In partnership with specialised players (consular chambers, etc.), provide concrete support to companies in the tertiary sector (VSEs/SMEs and traders in particular) and craftsmen to improve the climate-air-energy performance of their premises, if possible through renovation work with high energy and environmental performance; Specific support for tertiary companies > 1000 m² subject to the obligations of the "Tertiary Decree")
Rationalize and pool the construction of new tertiary premises
Encourage the limitation of specific electricity consumption specific to the tertiary sector: help to set up an energy management system and encourage the certification of companies (ISO 50 001, ISO 26 000) then raise awareness and disseminate good practices
Cooperate with other public tertiary sector players in the territory (education, hospitals, administrative services, etc.)

|  Action 33 | Setting up energy and GHG emissions accounting for public buildings  |
|  Objectives | Reduction of air pollutants and population exposure, Awareness-raising (energy/climate/air culture of elected officials, services and residents)  |
|  Context of the action | Indoor air quality is an issue that is little known to residents but a major one for health. The CUD territory is also affected by exceedances in the concentration of certain atmospheric pollutants. In addition to the measures taken to improve air quality (Dunkirk air quality working group, creative energy, industrial actions, Low Emission Zone for mobility, etc.), the dissemination of air quality indices and the right actions to take during pollution peaks should make it possible to reduce the population's exposure to degraded air. As part of the call for contributions launched under the PCAET on the "changing life together" platform, SUEZ has submitted a contribution that will help fuel this action: SUEZ proposes to implement a demonstrator for an innovative air quality monitoring solution with high spatial and temporal resolution. This decision-making tool will provide a better understanding of air pollution in connection with economic activities and then support stakeholders in their actions to improve air quality.  |
|  Sub- actions | - Implement the "SUEZ demonstrator"
Study the results of this monitoring and deduce the priority actions to be carried out
Supporting territorial stakeholders in their actions to improve air quality
Improve communication with residents on air quality (indoor and outdoor) and the actions to be taken in the event of peaks

|  Action 34 | Improving knowledge of the links between air quality and health and involving the population  |
|  Objectives | Reduction of air pollutants and population exposure, Awareness-raising (energy/climate/air culture of elected officials, services and residents)  |
|  Context of the action | On average, each human being breathes about 14,000 liters of air per day. Many scientific studies agree on the impact of air pollution on human health. Thus, a study by Santé Public France estimates that the impact of air pollution represents 48,000 premature deaths per year (i.e. 9% of mortality in France) and a loss of life expectancy at age 30 that can exceed 2 years (source: https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/).

As part of the call for contributions launched under the PCAET on the "changing life together" platform, the Local Health Observatory (OLS) has submitted a contribution that will improve knowledge on the links between air quality and health and involve the population.
As part of the implementation of the OLS, various actions are carried out in order to better understand the state of health of the population, but also to develop new data on the links between air quality and health.
To do this, the OLS works with the various local actors, whether they are the structures recognized for their expertise in health: ARS, CPAM, hospitals, OR2S, but also with universities (ULCO and University of Pharmacy of Lille) for the implementation of research work to improve knowledge of air quality at the scale of the CUD and the CCHF, but also on the impact on health. At the same time, the work of the OLS is geared towards residents in order to better understand how they perceive air quality, in order to see which are the most relevant modes of communication to make them actors in their health and to encourage them to adopt the right actions in order to limit their exposure and their impact on air quality, both indoor and outdoor.  |

|  Context of the action | Urban planning documents are consistent with the community's climate-air-energy strategy, they allow for spatial translation, in a logic of circular economy and rural/urban solidarity. Incentives and enforceable provisions are provided in particular to promote bioclimatic design, narrow urban forms, the reduction of daily travel distances, sustainable mobility, energy sobriety, energy efficiency and renewable energies, heating/cooling networks, the limitation of emissions and the impact of atmospheric pollutants on the population, and adaptation to climate change. The fight against land artificialisation and the maintenance of natural, agricultural and forest areas are an integral part of the strategy put in place. By the end of 2022, the CUD will have finalised its PLUiHD, which considers Climate-Air-Energy issues. A land observatory will make it possible in the short term to promote the implementation of urban renewal projects; thus making it possible to exceed the objectives of 2/3 in urban renewal and thus protect agricultural land from artificialisation.  |   |   |

° the development of knowledge of existing water flows (quantity and quality) for a better anticipation of the needs or impacts of climate change,
° the development of a vision of the economy and the circular ecology of water and its by-products in close interface with potentially impacted public policies (maritime, agricultural, industrial, etc.),
° the formalisation and coordination of water governance in the territory,
° the restructuring, development and strengthening of an integrated vision of water at a supra-territorial level on drinking water, flood risk and environmental quality.
Developing and strengthening wealth management
The overall heritage in the field of water is substantial. These are the assets related to the drinking water, sanitation and external fire defence (DECI) competence, but also the assets that protect the territory, property and people against flood risks (mainly continental due to the polder territory).
The challenges of water resource scarcity are leading us to renew and readapt existing assets:
to avoid losses related to leaks (water and sanitation networks),
to fight against continental floods (IIW heritage) which will be increasingly strong and regular in view of the current climate change.  |   |   |

|  Action 40 | Setting up energy and GHG emissions accounting for public buildings  |   |   |
|  Objectives | Adaptation of the territory to climate change  |   |   |
|  Context of the action | Observations confirm that France has already been impacted by climate change for several decades, by a warming of the average annual temperature. Climate models indicate that these trends will continue. There is not a field or sector of activity that will not feel the effects.
To prepare for it as well as possible, each actor (public, private, economic, social, etc.) will have to analyse the impact of climate change on its activity. This analysis should make it possible to put in place an action plan to reduce vulnerability to expected changes and to increase the climatic robustness of socio-economic and natural systems.
Adaptation to local scales is therefore essential. Beyond their legal obligations, municipalities and local authorities have a definite role to play in improving knowledge of impacts and vulnerabilities at the local level as well as in the implementation of adaptation actions.  |   |   |
|  Sub- actions | • Call ANEL/CEREMA on integrated coastal management
• Develop a heritage management of the protection structures in a logic of overall cost and maintenance of the protective structures in good condition
• Formalize the interest of the community in its desire to reduce the vulnerability of the territory to climate change
• Know the vulnerability of the territory to climate change
• Adopt an adaptation action programme and integrate the effects of climate change into community competences and policies

|  Action 46 | Reducing the impact of professional mobility  |   |   |
|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Energy sobriety, Reduction of air pollutants and population exposure  |   |   |
|  Context of the action | In terms of mobility, limiting mobility needs is a lever that helps reduce travel. There are two types of mobility:
Forced mobility: all travel required by a professional and/or supply activity that takes place during defined and limited time slots.
unconstrained mobility: all travel related to free time.
Among the range of solutions that reduce the need for travel, there are also telecommuting or coworking solutions, allowing workers to work from places other than their workplace (home, third places, coworking spaces, etc.). To do this, there is still the challenge of raising awareness of teleworking among workers and employers to make it sustainable, but also to guarantee access to digital technology in order to offer all inhabitants the optimal conditions for its practice.
For example, EDF CNPE in Gravelines has put in place numerous measures to reduce the impact of mobility on its employees (200 electric charging stations for the site's employees travelling in electric light vehicles, reduction in the size of public transport vehicles for employees, implementation of a booking application, adaptation of routes to the right need, etc.). the deployment of teleworking in all teams which makes it possible to limit travel to the Centrale, the extension of a cycle path to connect Gravelines by bike, the conversion of some of the service vehicles to electric vehicles, etc.  |   |   |
|  Sub- actions | • Inform companies about their levers of action to reduce the carbon-intensive mobility of their employees ("sustainable mobility" package? Bicycle mileage allowances, etc.) and available assistance
• Support the implementation of company/inter-company travel plans
• Encourage teleworking
• Set up electric terminals, secure bicycle parking spaces in company parking areas
• Convert service vehicle fleets
• Implementation of a low-emission mobility zone (ZFE-m)  |   |   |

|  Action 55 | Supporting the decarbonisation of industry through Dunkirk, creative® energy and the decarbonisation roadmap for the port area  |
|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Energy sobriety  |
|  Context of the action | As part of the call for contributions launched by the CUD under the PCAET, Euraénergie proposed an action to contribute to this action Dunkirk Creative Energy is a collective and territorial dynamic whose aim is to transform the Dunkirk ecosystem in order to succeed in the transition to a decarbonised and energy-sustainable world, in order to meet the major climate, economic and social challenges of our time. The ZIBAC call for projects is part of the strategy to accelerate the decarbonization of industry, one of the objectives of which is to promote the development of Low Carbon Industrial Zones (ZIBaC).

Through this program, the State aims to support industrial territories in their ecological and energy transformation to gain competitiveness and attractiveness to support the resumption of economic activity. This program will also make it possible to promote French technologies, innovations and industrial know-how on an international scale. Projects must aim to accelerate the decarbonisation of their industrial zone, by implementing a set of investments, experiments, synergies and innovations. They must be ambitious regional projects in terms of decarbonisation, climate resilience and ecological transition and which experiment with and support organisational or technological solutions and innovative processes that contribute to responding to the problems they face. These industrial zones must therefore integrate a training strategy with a view to their enlargement or their diffusion to other territories. This programme also aims to create a national network of industrial zones that emit particularly greenhouse gases (GHGs) and that wish to accelerate their decarbonisation. This network will make it possible to provide each member industrial zone with a macroscopic and interregional approach to decarbonisation actions by, for example, sharing joint operations.

EDF Gravelines nuclear power plant has also submitted a contribution under the PCAET which makes it possible to contribute to CO2 reduction actions and energy projects in the region, in particular through the massive production of carbon-free electricity  |
|  Sub- actions | Implement the Ecosysteme D roadmap, which is broken down into several combined actions: - Decarbonization of electricity (offshore wind, ground-mounted photovoltaic farms) - Energy sobriety (buildings, lighting) - Strengthening the circular economy (heat highway) - Reduction of industrial water consumption - Creation of a hydrogen hub and a CO2 hub - Valuing CO2 as a resource - Host new activities that are already decarbonized or working towards decarbonization - More virtuous company travel policy - rely on the call for projects “Promoting the development of Low Carbon Industrial Zones (ZIBaC)” Examples of actions carried out by Arcelor Mittal: - Steel roundness project: Double the volume of post-consumer steel (2 Mt/y in the long term) recycled in our steelmaking processes, thanks to investment in resized logistics, innovation in terms of steel processes and the development of recycling channels - Innovative DRI: reduce the site's CO2 emissions by 44% by changing the steel production process and replacing blast furnace 3 with a direct reduction unit associated with electric furnaces and hydrogen. - Electrical steel production project: To support the needs of its automotive manufacturer customers in the development of their electric vehicles, the ArcelorMittal group plans to increase its production of electrical steels by creating an electric steel production unit in Mardyck (5 new lines). This unit, with an annual capacity of 200,000 tonnes, would complement the existing unit in Saint-Chély-d'Apcher, in Lozère, which produces 100,000 tonnes per year, production insufficient to meet future demand from the automotive sector. These electric steels are used to form different parts of the vehicle's electric motor (stator and motor rotor). The construction of the production capacity at Mardyck must be done in a short period of time (mid-2024) to be ready to meet European demand. This project represents an investment of more than 300 million euros and the creation of more than 100 direct jobs.  |   |   |

|  Action 57 | Supporting the transition of the Grand Port Maritime de Dunkerque  |   |   |
|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Energy sobriety
The transport of goods, particularly by sea, represents the second largest GHG emissions item in Dunkirk after industrial emissions. Freight transport emits nearly 2.2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year, 91% of which are emitted by sea and river traffic around the Grand Port Maritime de Dunkerque. With the prospects for industrial and port development, it will be essential to contain emissions linked to the transport of goods in order to succeed in the region's ecological transition.  |   |   |
|  Context of the action | More broadly, as the GPMD territory is the support for industrial establishments, it will be necessary to support the industrials present on its territory to enable the GPMD to make the transition to more sustainable protuary activities, which consume less energy and emit less GHGs or atmospheric pollutants.
The Grand Port Maritime de Dunkerque (GPMD) has submitted a contribution under the PCAET by proposing various actions to decarbonise the port territory. Thus, the GPMD is committed to contributing to:
Decarbonize electricity (offshore wind, ground-mounted photovoltaic farms)
Improve energy efficiency (buildings, lighting)
Strengthening the circular economy (heat highway)
Reduce industrial water consumption
Create a hydrogen hub and a CO2 hub
Develop actions in favour of the ecological transition (quayside electrification for ships, LNG bunkering, alternative fuels)
Valuing CO2 as a resource
Host new activities that are already decarbonized or working towards decarbonization
Mass rail and river transport
Contribute to improving the company's travel policies  |   |   |

|  Action 58 | Promoting local employment  |   |   |
|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Energy sobriety, Awareness-raising (energy/climate/air culture of elected officials, services and residents)  |   |   |
|  Context of the action | The roadmap of the General Assembly on Local Employment is the result of 9 months of work and consultation in 2014 and 2015. This is a unique approach in France at the inter-municipal level.
The EGEL today is nearly 60 actions coordinated by Greater Dunkirk. These actions are implemented by the CUD, Entreprendre Ensemble, Dunkerque Promotion, the municipalities, the GPMD, Maison de l'Europe, etc. and federate an even wider network of partners: ULCO, Regional Council, Chamber of Commerce, Chamber of Trades, Chamber of Agriculture, Pôle Emploi, BGE Flandre Création, Initiative Flandre, companies, business clubs, craftsmen, associations...
With a view to the massive development of industrial employment in the territory, it will be necessary to put in place solutions so that the people of Dunkirk can benefit from the jobs generated by the industrial development of the territory.
As part of the call for contributions launched by the CUD under the PCAET on the platform Changing life together, the University of the Littoral Côte d'Opale (ULCO) proposed a contribution that could be related to this action. Indeed, ULCO has been committed since 2021 to the development of a sustainable development and social responsibility (DDetRS) reference framework whose objectives are to include the establishment in an ecological transition approach. Thus, all the university's missions are concerned: research, training as well as social and environmental policy. As part of its DDetRS commitment, ULCO is committed to training in sustainable development and ecological and energy transition professions.  |   |   |

|  Action 59 | Applying the measures of the master plan for heating networks  |   |   |
|  Objectives | Development of renewable and recovered energies  |   |   |
|  Context of the action | The current Dunkirk network has been the subject of numerous leaks, causing a lot of nuisance for the people of Dunkirk. Its condition requires significant investment, which will be a major challenge at the end of the current PSD.  |   |   |
|   |  The second major challenge will be the supply of renewable energies to the needs of the networks for the years to come. The different potential sources are multiple but also very uncertain, including the current means of production. However, the CUD has control over the decisions that will be taken on the projects associated with the CVE, which is a major asset for the next few years, before the emergence of other projects such as REUZE.  |   |   |
|   |  These 2 main issues will probably be a brake on the ambition to develop the CUD's networks, particularly with the aim of keeping heat prices under control. However, the recent rise in energy prices and the objectives in terms of sustainable development could push the CUD to remain open to developing its networks to benefit as many people as possible.  |   |   |

|  Action 61 | Supporting the development of anaerobic digestion  |
|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Development of renewable and recovered energies  |
|  Context of the action | Faced with the scarcity of non-renewable resources and the need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the energy transition, thanks in particular to a circular economy, is an obvious choice.

In addition to strengthening recycling, the circular economy consists of thinking about the optimal use of local resources in the territories, optimising the management of flows between players and developing renewable energies.

Anaerobic digestion is fully in line with this logic: it makes it possible to treat and reduce the volume of organic waste, to produce local and renewable energy and to create a territorial economic dynamic. The biomethane energy system is organised into short, local loops, specific to a circular economy.

The production of green gas thus makes it possible to recreate value in the economic system from organic matter streams. Anaerobic digestion plants are fully integrated into the territories: inputs are local, and so is consumption. The biomethane energy system is therefore organised into short, local loops, specific to a circular economy.

As such, GrDF has submitted two contributions on the changing life together platform to support the development of anaerobic digestion projects in the territory:
Injection of biomethane into the GRDF network on the anaerobic digestion unit of the Daudruy industrial site
Co-financing of a post-doc for the development of a university thesis on methanation in partnership with ULCO and the region

SAS FLANDRE BIOGAZ has submitted a contribution under the CUD’s PACET by proposing the construction of a methanisation unit in the municipality of Bourbourg.
Support scientific research on catalyst optimization (without noble metal) for the methanation reaction and pilot validation. (2022-2024)
Support the implementation of anaerobic digestion projects:
Commissioning by the industrial company Daudruy of a methanisation unit that will make it possible to inject biomethane, a renewable green gas, into the natural gas network. It will be an injection of 750 Nm3/h - the largest green gas production unit north of Paris (a medium-sized agricultural unit injects 150 Nm3/h of green gas into the gas network). GRDF is supporting the manufacturer in the injection of biomethane into the gas network. (starting in 2023)
SAS Flandre Biogaz will build a biogas plant with commissioning of the site scheduled for September 2023. The site will be used to reprocess agricultural waste and waste from the agri-food industries in the sector in order to produce biomethane that will be injected into the GRDF network. The unit plans to produce 15,000 MWh of biogas annually.

|  Action 62 | Increasing the production of electricity from renewable energies in the territory  |
|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Development of renewable and recovered energies  |
|  Context of the action | The production and consumption of renewable and recovered energy (RE&R) is one of the main pillars of the region's energy transition strategy. In addition to continuing efforts to reduce energy consumption and energy performance, the territory must necessarily decarbonize its energy consumption by diversifying its energy mix. To achieve this, the balance towards renewable and recovered energies must be accelerated by increasing the production of these energies.

As such, EDF Renewables / Dunkirk Offshore Wind Turbines has submitted a contribution on the Changing Life Together platform, which will significantly increase the production of electricity from renewable sources with a project to build an offshore wind farm off the coast of Dunkirk. EDF Renewables France has also submitted a contribution to increase the production of electricity from renewable sources with the construction of a photovoltaic power plant in Loon-Plage.
The Dunkirk Water Syndicate proposed an action to produce electricity from renewable sources with an action called "Hydro-turbines: when the production of drinking water rhymes with electricity production".
The DkWatt association has proposed a contribution under the PCAET to develop renewable energy citizen projects, particularly photovoltaics.
The GPMD also has plans to build two photovoltaic power plants on its territory (see action sheet N°57)  |
|  Sub- actions | - Gradually increase renewable electricity production and diversify renewable electricity production sources:
Implement the various renewable electricity production projects in the territory:
Photovoltaic energy production project in Loon-Plage (EDF Renewables France has been working for about two years on the development of a photovoltaic energy production project in Loon-Plage. The project site is located in the north of the municipality, on land belonging to the Grand Port Maritime de Dunkerque. It is a former storage site operated until October 2010 for the burial of steel waste. As such, it is qualified as a 'degraded' site with regard to the specifications of the calls for tenders of the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) and therefore benefits from points of environmental relevance. Nearly 16 MWp of solar panels will be installed and injected into the grid, equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of 7,860 people.
Offshore wind farm project off the coast of Dunkirk: Development, construction and operation of an offshore wind farm with a maximum capacity of 600 MW, with an estimated annual production of 2.3 TWh/year, equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of nearly one million inhabitants.
Support the GPMD's PV power plant projects (in connection with action 57)
Hydro-turbines: when the production of drinking water rhymes with the production of electricity (the difference in altimetry existing at a point in the network is conducive to the installation of a hydroelectric turbine that can make it possible to recover the energy dissipated from the loss of pressure into electrical energy. The SED therefore aims to install a microturbine at the Grande-Synthe drinking water distribution site to recover this fatal energy and produce electrical energy. A study was carried out to determine the electricity production potential, which amounts to the equivalent of the electricity consumption of 50 households (200MWh/year). The energy produced will therefore cover 100% of the energy needs of the Grande-Synthe site (90MWh/year) and the surplus will be sold back to the electricity grid.

|  Action 63 | Developing innovative low-carbon hydrogen production projects thanks to the SHYMED project  |   |   |
|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Development of renewable and recovered energies  |   |   |
|  Context of the action | Hydrogen is currently used due to its chemical properties in the oil and gas industry and in the chemical industry. However, this molecule has a major energy interest that is not/little exploited today. It can be used for energy production on the grid, or in transport, and it is a solution for energy storage, especially electricity, which will be the challenge of 21st century energy systems. Hydrogen as an energy vector thus represents a scientific, environmental and economic challenge. Thanks to advances in electrolysis technology, it can be produced in a carbon-free and economical way and contribute to the objectives that France has set itself in terms of developing renewable energies, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants and reducing fossil fuel consumption.

In this context, the EDF Group, has submitted a contribution under the PCAET with its SHYMED project for the production of low-carbon hydrogen. The SHYMED project is part of a complete ecosystem for the community territory. The hydrogen produced on site will be used to power buses, ampliroils and household waste collection vehicles (BOMs) from April 2024. The key figures of the project are as follows:

• 1.25 MW of electrolysis, 500 kg of H2/day distributed
• 2 distribution terminals: 350 bar and 700 bar
• Uses: 10 Buses, 4 BOMs and 3 Ampliroil
• 1140 tonnes of CO2 avoided per year  |   |   |

|  Action 64 | Increasing the use of renewable and recovered energy for heat and cooling  |   |   |
|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Development of renewable and recovered energies  |   |   |
|  Context of the action | The potential for using renewable energies for heating buildings, domestic hot water and cooling has been exhausted, with a focus on air quality. Where possible, renewable heat networks are set up. The achievement of the objectives is measured with the percentage of energy of renewable origin in the consumption of heating or cooling in the territory.
Recovery: The heat recovery possibilities of large industrial companies and power plants, including from and for the production of cooling, are exploited.
The potential for cogeneration or even tri-generation (primarily from renewable energies, then natural gas), for example for the heating or cooling sector, is known and exploited. The technologies and energy sources used are chosen in a multi-criteria climate-air-energy approach.
The mobilisation of heat recovery potential is designed in line with the development of heating networks (in connection with action N°59).  |   |   |
|  Sub- actions | • Implement the monitoring of the renewable energy rate
• Using heating networks to achieve renewable heat targets

|  Action 66 | Pursue research projects to promote the development of energy storage  |   |   |
|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Development of renewable and recovered energies  |   |   |
|  Context of the action | Energy storage is the process of preserving an amount of energy produced for later use.
The idea is to ensure a balance between energy production and consumption, to reduce losses and thus optimize costs.
It is on this theme that Eco-Tech Ceram, submitted a contribution under the PCAET with its ProDepVal project for a movable prototype for the storage and recovery of waste heat for various applications: drying, electricity, steam, refrigeration.
This research and development project is financed by Eco-Tech Ceram and 70% subsidized by the Hauts-de-France Region and ADEME Hauts-de-France. The ProDepVAL project aims to develop a fully containerized, movable and modular "pilot" storage unit, making it possible to demonstrate the feasibility of recovering waste heat from various equipment on different industrial sites and for innovative applications. As part of this project, the Arcelor Mittal Dunkirk industrial site will be the first user of the prototype to validate the feasibility of sintering sludge drying. Subsequently, it will be used in other industrial applications and in the development of energy couplings (multi-energy) among others.

Technically, the ProDepVAL project consists of:
develop a "pilot" storage unit that is fully containerized, movable, modular – of sufficient size to limit the influence of boundary conditions;
test the feasibility of drying sinter sludge on the Arcelor Mittal Dunkirk industrial site;
more generally, integrate a thermal storage system into various industrial processes (conventional or innovative) in order to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of coupling to storage.  |   |   |
|  Sub- actions | - Set up the pilot unit

|  Action 67 | Implement the waste prevention and management strategy through the Local Programme for the Prevention of Household and Similar Waste and support companies and administrations for better waste management  |
|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Reduction of air pollutants and population exposure, Awareness-raising (energy/climate/air culture of elected officials, services and residents)  |
|  Context of the action | The local waste prevention and management policy is defined, implemented, monitored and evaluated. It includes the implementation of a local programme for the prevention of household and similar waste (reuse and reuse, local management of bio-waste, the fight against food waste, reduction at source, etc.), the collection and treatment of household and similar waste (separate collection and recycling of packaging and paper, etc.). separate collection and organic recovery of bio-waste, other collection and recycling channels, in particular via waste collection centres, etc.), as part of the public service. Incentive pricing for user service (through tax or fee) should promote waste reduction and recycling channels, and is a tool for optimising waste services.
The objective of the 2023-2029 community PLPDMA is to reduce waste production by 15% (compared to 2010), i.e. 509 kg/inhabitant in 2030.

As part of the call for contributions launched by the CUD under the PCAET, the ECOPAL association proposed two actions to contribute to the reduction and better recovery of waste in the territory:
Provision of Recycle Solution, a tool for better waste management in companies Recycle Solution is a free digital waste management and traceability tool (link to the government tool Trackdéchets) for companies. It allows users to better monitor the evolution of their waste (volumes, costs, percentage of recovery, etc.) in order to improve their management. The tool, via the "Waste Exchange" section, also allows users to put their waste online that can be used as free raw material for other companies (example of wooden pallets that are donated by an industrial company and recycled into furniture by a technical integration centre).
Provision of a shared collection service, "the Ecopal reflex to adopt!" Pooled collections are part of the services that Ecopal offers to its members. They are concretely part of the application of the approaches of Industrial and Territorial Ecology. The association organises with its partners shared waste collections in the region's structures so that this waste can be recycled and recovered, but also to contribute to the development of local employment, to limit transport and finally to protect our environment. Ecopal organises the collection of the following waste: waste electronic and electrical equipment (WEEE), paper and cardboard, ink cartridges, hazardous waste (chemicals, oils, soiled objects, etc.), batteries, conventional and confidential archives.  |
|  Sub- actions | • Implement an ambitious local waste prevention and management policy focused on the circular economy:
Be exemplary in waste management
Raise awareness and promote the visibility of their efforts in favour of waste prevention
Using economic instruments to promote waste prevention
Fight against food waste
Avoid the production of plants and encourage the local management of bio-waste
Increase product shelf life
Implement or strengthen emblematic actions promoting responsible consumption

|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Reduction of air pollutants and population exposure, Awareness-raising (energy/climate/air culture of elected officials, services and residents)  |   |   |
|  Context of the action | Reducing waste at the source is crucial to the preservation of natural resources. In addition, a lot of waste comes from plastic materials, which are extremely harmful to ecosystems and health. The challenge of the PCAET is therefore to continue actions to raise awareness of the reduction of waste at source (limiting packaging, buying in bulk, sorting, etc.), and to optimise the recovery and treatment of waste in order to reduce the environmental footprint and the impact on the health of the treatment chain.  |   |   |
|   |  As part of the call for contributions launched by the CUD under the PCAET, the ECOPAL association and the JOUVE grocery store proposed actions to contribute to this action:
Since 2021, the Dunkirk Water Syndicate (SED) has launched an operation to distribute stainless steel water bottles to all 2,767 students in the second year of the Middle School (CM2) in the area.

|  Action 70 | Developing synergies with a Circular Economy objective  |
|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Reduction of air pollutants and population exposure, Awareness-raising (energy/climate/air culture of elected officials, services and residents)  |
|  Context of the action | • According to ADEME, the circular economy can be defined as an economic system of exchange and production which, at all stages of the life cycle of products (goods and services), aims to increase the efficiency of the use of resources and reduce the impact on the environment while developing the well-being of individuals. It is a transition to a model based on zero waste and an increase in the intensity of resource use while decreasing environmental impacts. This is what the circular economy aims to achieve, which takes into account three fields: the production and supply of goods and services; consumption through demand and consumer behaviour (economic or citizen); waste management with the priority use of recycling which makes it possible to close the loop.
• By adhering to the Territory Committed to the Ecological Transition – Circular Economy (TETE-EC) label, the CUD wishes to commit to developing its circular economy policy and animating a dynamic in the territory that goes well beyond the classic "waste" competence and by orienting its actions towards the axes of the TETE-EC standard:
Definition of a global circular economy strategy and inclusion in the territory
Development of waste reduction, collection and recovery services
Deployment of the other pillars of the circular economy in the territories
Financial tools for behaviour change
Cooperation and commitment
• The ECOPAL association has submitted a contribution on Changing life together for its participation in the PCAET. This action aims to develop synergies with a view to achieving a Circular Economy in the region. Ecopal develops synergies between territorial actors. From deposits to outlets and processing, Ecopal's mission is to identify all the players in a sector and to get them to work together to develop circular economy loops. To succeed in this mission, Ecopal must communicate, federate, coordinate and remove regulatory, technical and financial blockages. Among the projects already identified, there is in particular the recovery of end-of-life joinery, personal protective equipment and shellfish waste (scallops, mussels, etc.).  |
|  Sub- actions | • Aim for a 5-star label with the TETE-EC label by the end of the PCAET 2022-2028
• Identify the different sectors for which it is possible to bring out circular economy projects
• Identify the players in these sectors and get them to work together
• Identify the various regulatory, technical and financial obstacles

|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Energy sobriety, Reduction of air pollutants and population exposure  |   |   |
|  Context of the action | The entire waste treatment chain has consequences for the environment:
Door-to-door collection and transport to the sorting centre, the incinerator and the landfill sites consume energy and emit greenhouse gases and air pollutants. Waste storage consumes space temporarily (in sorting centres) or permanently (in landfills). Landfilling leads to the degradation of landscapes (land use, visual and olfactory pollution, etc.). The decomposition of waste releases methane – a powerful greenhouse gas – and toxic elements, such as heavy metals that contaminate soil and groundwater. Waste incineration releases toxic substances (e.g. persistent organic pollutants such as dioxin) that are dispersed into the air and then found their way into soil and water.
Although incinerators are equipped with high-tech devices that remove dust from the fumes, wash them and neutralize hydrochloric acid (released in particular by the combustion of PVC plastics), toxic emissions cannot be completely avoided.  |   |   |

Carbon sequestration on the territory, Adaptation of the territory to climate change, Awareness-raising (energy/climate/air culture of elected officials, services and residents)  |
|  Context of the action | The agricultural and food system accounts for a third of French territorial emissions (source: I4CE), nearly half of which come from livestock farming (according to the High Council for the Climate - 2020 Report). This figure includes greenhouse gas emissions related to:
agricultural production on French territory. Agriculture emits methane – CH4 (livestock (enteric fermentation) and soil (rice cultivation)), nitrous oxide – N2O (nitrogen fertilisation and management of animal manure) and carbon dioxide – CO2 (energy consumption).
the French food system (food processing, food trade, packaging manufacturing and waste management, transport and refrigeration).

Through its competences, the local authority can support, promote and encourage sustainable agricultural and food practices on its territory and in its supply territories:
by carrying out actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas and particle emissions, and more generally the environmental impacts of the agricultural sector (training in agro-ecological practices, environmental certification of farms, etc.)
by preserving agricultural land through urban planning documents and by supporting the establishment of urban or peri-urban agricultural or gardening areas

|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Energy sobriety, Awareness-raising (energy/climate/air culture of elected officials, services and residents)  |
|  Context of the action | Sustainable food is defined as all dietary practices aimed at feeding human beings in a qualitative way and in sufficient quantities while respecting the environment. Sustainable food guarantees accessibility for all as well as the economic sustainability of the entire food chain (producers, distributors, etc.).
With a quarter of the carbon footprint of the French, food is the main source responsible for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, of the same order of magnitude as transport or housing. The impacts are also significant on the issues of water, soil, air and biodiversity. Most of the impacts are at the agricultural production stage, and therefore depend largely on production methods, but also on the composition of the diet. In terms of health, diet is a key factor in a healthy population, which today contributes strongly to the development of diseases.
The challenge is to ensure quality food production that respects the environment as locally as possible. In an urban area such as that of the CUD, this translates into support for the development of urban agriculture initiatives to structure and develop short supply chains.
The challenge is also to promote a change in dietary practices to bring together health and environmental issues, in particular through a rebalancing between foods of animal and plant origin or through the consumption of seasonal and local products.
Finally, efforts must be continued to combat waste at every stage of the food chain.

As part of the call for contributions launched by the CUD under the PCAET, the JOUVE grocery store proposed an action to contribute to this action:
Local organic bulk grocery store offers to facilitate access to organic, local and bulk products through deliveries to the workplace via an online ordering and payment tool).  |

|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Energy sobriety, Adaptation of the territory to climate change, Awareness-raising (energy/climate/air culture of elected officials, services and residents)  |   |   |
|  Context of the action | Water is one of the most precious resources in the world for the development of life, so it is necessary to preserve it and reduce the pressure on its use, especially for water-intensive activities (agriculture, industry, etc.). In addition, in a context of climate change and increasing water needs, it is necessary to improve water availability, in particular by reducing needs and developing rainwater harvesting and use systems.
The ECOPAL association has submitted a contribution on the platform "changing life together" as part of its participation in the PCAET. As part of raising awareness among companies about good water management, Ecopal carries out free water diagnostics in SMEs, SMIs, craftsmen and shopkeepers in Dunkirk with a view to helping them find more ecological solutions to chemical products, to save water, to obtain a financial gain or simply to see if improvements are possible (rainwater recovery, treatment equipment, ecological products, etc.)
Two types of diagnostics are offered:
• Operation of the facilities
• Control of consumption and emissions
In 2022, these diagnoses are completely free of charge for the structures, thanks in particular to funding from the Artois-Picardy Water Agency. In the following years, these diagnoses will be reserved for members.
This action has a much broader objective, which is to reduce the pressure on the water resources of our territory.  |   |   |
|  Sub- actions | • Supporting ECOPAL in the implementation of the proposed actions
• Identify the companies or sectors that consume the most water
• Communicate to them the existence of the diagnoses carried out by Ecopal and the membership system
• Carry out diagnoses and programmes to reduce the water consumption of the territory's economic actors: water-saving actions, rainwater recovery, etc.
• Work on the circular economy for industrial water consumption (reuse of water from company outlets/WWTPs) as a substitute/supplement to surface water.
• Study the possibilities of using seawater for industrial processes as a substitute/complement to the industrial water network, in particular for the industrial attractiveness of the territory  |   |   |

|  Action 76 | Optimizing rainwater management and promoting its reuse  |
|  Objectives | Adaptation of the territory to climate change, Awareness-raising (energy/climate/air culture of elected officials, services and residents)  |
|  Context of the action | The local authority practices integrated rainwater management, making it possible to control rainwater runoff in the developed areas (at the source), as well as downstream (slowdown, temporary storage, infiltration), decontamination and to adapt to the site. The measure also includes taking into account the impacts of climate change, for example by managing flood risks (limiting the sealing of streets, squares, pedestrian paths, public spaces), by implementing alternative techniques allowing the disconnection of rainwater from the networks and its return to the natural environment as close as possible to the plot by infiltration preferably.

This is a resolutely ambitious policy that is reflected in a programme of investment in specific structures (infiltration basins, drainage roads, vegetated valleys, etc.) and the inclusion of rainwater management in urban planning documents

As part of the implementation of new services for better water management, the Dunkirk Urban Community is supporting local users in changing their behaviour with the Récup'Eau scheme, which allows:
aid for the acquisition of a new rainwater collector
assistance in carrying out an opportunity and feasibility study for rainwater recovery
assistance with work related to rainwater infiltration and recovery

Dunkerque LNG has also submitted a contribution as part of its participation in the Community PCAET with a view to recovering rainwater on its site. The action consists of replacing part of the drinking water consumption used for fire testing with rainwater collected on the site's right-of-way and then treated and introduced into our fire protection network.  |
|  Sub- actions | • Regularly update knowledge of local stormwater and flood management issues on its territory
• Inform the population of the issues and solutions to limit runoff
• Reduce pollutant emissions and runoff at source, beyond the competence of the Dept in charge of rainwater management
• Use sanitation regulations to manage rainwater as close as possible to its point of arrival
• Pursue a firm policy of flood prevention and protection of the receiving environment
• To become exemplary throughout the country
• Call for CEREMA partners on the management of the GéMAPI competence and the management of PEs
• To support DK-LNG in the implementation of the proposed action and to encourage this type of action among other companies/users  |

|  Objectives | GHG reduction, Energy sobriety, Development of renewable and recovered energies  |   |   |
|  Context of the action | Sanitation systems can be optimized to reduce their energy consumption and renewable energy generation and recovery systems can be installed. Regarding the management of sewage sludge, spreading (material recovery) and methanisation (energy recovery) are not opposed and can complement each other. The recovery of sludge in agriculture is of agronomic interest for the soil because it contains a high content of organic matter and fertilizing elements. However, they can also contain undesirable substances such as Trace Metal Elements (TMEs), Trace Organic Compounds (CTO), pathogenic microorganisms and pharmaceutical compounds. This is why the recovery of sludge by spreading is clearly regulated and other solutions can be studied depending on the context (currently, 60% of sludge is spread according to the "Spreading" technical sheet, ADEME, August 2016). In all cases, the choice of recovery or disposal channels for the sludge produced must take into account the existence and sustainability of potential outlets (including for digestate from anaerobic digestion) and try to pool existing waste treatment equipment in the territory (composting platform, nearby energy recovery unit, etc.).

The local authority optimises the energy potential of the sanitation systems:
The energy efficiency of the community's wastewater collection and treatment facilities is high and is measured by indicators.
The potential for heat recovery from wastewater collectors and/or wastewater treatment plants is exhausted.
The potential for the recovery of sewage sludge has been exhausted.  |   |   |
|  Sub- actions | • Regularly update the state of play of the efficiency of sanitation systems and formalize efficiency objectives
• Analyze the potential for heat recovery from wastewater
• Analyze the potential for reuse of wastewater treated by the WWTP for urban uses

B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

The building, transport, waste, and energy sectors are significant contributors to GHG emissions. While various strategies can reduce these emissions, some residual emissions are likely to persist—stemming from construction and building operations, reliance on fossil fuels, and the collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste. To address these hard-to-reduce emissions, several approaches can be explored.

To combat the risk of reversals associated with non-durable residual emissions, Greater Dunkirk will implement a multi-faceted strategy focused on mitigation, monitoring, and contingency planning. First, stringent long-term monitoring systems will be established to regularly assess the stability and effectiveness of natural carbon sinks, such as reforested areas and restored wetlands. These systems will enable early detection of potential reversals, such as carbon release due to land-use changes or environmental events like wildfires.

Additionally, Greater Dunkirk will create buffer reserves within carbon sequestration projects, ensuring that a portion of carbon offsets or captured carbon remains untapped as a safeguard against unexpected reversals. This will involve maintaining a buffer pool of credits in carbon offset programs, which can be drawn upon if any carbon storage projects underperform or face disruptions. Furthermore, Greater Dunkirk will invest in insurance mechanisms and carbon risk management funds to address financial losses and ensure continued compliance with emission reduction goals if reversals occur.

Greater Dunkirk will also prioritise enhancing the durability of carbon sequestration efforts by integrating carbon capture technologies into infrastructure projects where carbon can be stored permanently, such as in construction materials or through biochar application. By combining these approaches, Greater Dunkirk aims to mitigate the risks associated with non-durable emissions and strengthen its overall strategy for achieving long-term carbon neutrality.

Here are the top 8 ideas Greater Dunkirk is considering eliminating residual GHG emissions. Some are already implemented or looked for, but can be improved, and others are ideas to be discussed and potentially developed until 2030:

Urban Carbon Farming

&gt; Vertical and Rooftop Farms: Develop urban vertical farms and rooftop gardens designed not only for food production but also optimised for carbon sequestration through high-density planting, soil enhancement techniques, and biochar application. As part of the PLUiHD, a biodiversity coefficient is being implemented to encourage the construction of green roofs.

Carbon-Negative Materials and Construction Techniques

&gt; CO₂-Sequestering Concrete: Invest in or mandate the use of innovative construction materials like carbon-absorbing concrete or aggregates that incorporate captured CO₂ into their structure, locking it away permanently. 2 companies are working on it: Ecocem, making concrete from recycled materials, and ECOPAL, an intermediary and facilitator of inter-company synergies, to promote industrial and regional ecology.

&gt; Buildings with Carbon-Storing Materials: Explore biobased technologies that use carbon-storing materials like hempcrete, recycled plastic, or other biomaterials, creating structures that sequester more carbon over their lifespan. The company "Batilin" is currently developing bio-based material, with high insulating power.

Localized Renewable Energy Microgrids with Blockchain Integration

&gt; Decentralized Energy Networks: Develop neighbourhood-scale renewable energy microgrids that integrate solar, wind, and energy storage systems. These microgrids can operate independently of the main grid and use blockchain technology for transparent energy trading and consumption tracking. Under development in Téteghem, a city of Greater Dunkirk area, setting up a multi-partner collective self-consumption loop. Installing solar panels on certain public buildings and apartment blocks, which will produce electricity that will be consumed by the buildings themselves.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
&gt; Peer-to-Peer Energy Sharing: Enable residents and businesses to trade surplus renewable energy with their neighbors through blockchain-based platforms, ensuring more efficient energy use and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

&gt; Develop the concepts of "power to heat" and "power to gas" to convert surplus photovoltaic electricity into useful heat for buildings, via heat pumps, and store the rest when these buildings do not need it to product hydrogen from wind power and injecting it into a natural gas network to supply municipal bus fleets and local building gas plants.

## 4. Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)

&gt; Small-Scale BECCS Plants: Deploy small-scale bioenergy facilities that convert organic waste into energy while capturing and storing the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced. This could be integrated with local waste management systems, turning waste into a resource while achieving net-negative emissions. The waste-to-energy plant of Greater Dunkirk produces steam, heat and electricity from the incineration of waste. This production is set to double with the planned second line of the Energy Recovery Centre, which will be able to handle twice as much waste (under study).

&gt; Biochar Production: Expand the use of biochar in urban agriculture and landscaping. Biochar, a carbon-rich product derived from organic material, sequesters carbon in the soil and enhances its fertility, creating a sustainable carbon sink.

## 5. Advanced Circular Economy Initiatives

&gt; Carbon-Neutral Product Lifecycle Programs: Partner with local manufacturers to create products designed with end-of-life carbon neutrality in mind, ensuring that materials are recycled or upcycled without additional emissions. This could include take-back programs where products are reclaimed and remanufactured into new items. Working with the Public Procurement Department: How can we make our purchases more responsible and take life cycle analysis in consideration. Greater Dunkirk is engaged in a scheme to promote socially and environmentally responsible public procurement.

&gt; Urban Mining and Material Recovery: Establish advanced material recovery facilities that focus on "urban mining" – extracting valuable materials from electronic waste and other complex products. These facilities would minimize the need for new resource extraction, thus reducing associated emissions. In France, there is a tax known as eco-contribution or eco-participation. This is an "amount" added to the sale price of EEE, electronic and electrical equipment, sold in France. The purpose of this amount is to offset the costs of collecting, managing and recycling this equipment when it reaches the end of its life.

## 6. Climate-Responsive Urban Design

&gt; Carbon-Positive Urban Zones: Develop districts or zones that are designed to be carbon-positive, meaning they generate more energy than they consume and sequester more carbon than they emit. These zones could feature extensive green roofs, carbon-sequestering building materials, and community renewable energy systems. In Greater Dunkirk, a new urban area under construction, 'Grand Large' a mixed development zone, developers are looking for demanding certification.

&gt; Smart Building Integration with AI: Use artificial intelligence to optimise energy use in real-time across entire districts, learning from patterns to reduce consumption and emissions dynamically. Buildings could be equipped with sensors that track energy, water use, and indoor air quality, adjusting systems for maximum efficiency. In France, households are equipped with Linky smart meters for electricity, Gazpar for gas and for water. Consumption can therefore be tracked for all households equipped (at least 95% of households). Greater Dunkirk is planning to work on this as part of the "RODEO" Interreg project with Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland. The demonstration district would be the Glacis district in Dunkirk.

# 7. Citizen-Led Climate Innovation Hubs

&gt; Local Climate Innovation Incubators: Establish climate innovation hubs that support startups and community initiatives focused on novel ways to reduce carbon emissions or enhance carbon sequestration. These incubators could provide funding, mentorship, and facilities for testing and scaling new ideas. The perfect example for this idea is "ÉcosystèmeD", a tool for coordinating the industrial port ecosystem in the fields of energy transition, decarbonization of industry and the circular economy.

# 8. Rewilding and Urban Ecosystem Restoration

&gt; Rewilding Urban Areas: Convert underutilized or abandoned urban spaces into rewilded ecosystems that support biodiversity and serve as carbon sinks. This could include restoring wetlands, forests, or grasslands within the city limits. The local authority's commitment to biodiversity was acknowledged in 2011 when it won the 'French Capital of Biodiversity' award for its work on "Regional planning and development". This recognition highlighted the city's efforts to create a green and blue network aligned with pedestrian and cycling needs. The concept of residual emissions is a logical extension of these biodiversity-focused policies. Greater Dunkirk's development initiatives always involve collaboration with the local biodiversity office.

&gt; Biodiversity Corridors: Develop green corridors that connect urban parks and natural areas, enhancing their capacity to sequester carbon while also providing resilience against urban heat islands and supporting local wildlife.

Assessing the environmental impact of projects requires the implementation of specific and relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These KPIs enable the measurement of progress and adjustment of strategies accordingly. Here's a proposal for KPIs focused on major environmental challenges, that will be developed and improved in the next iteration of the CCC.

|  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions | Total annual emissions: Overall measurement of the carbon footprint.
Carbon intensity per product/service: Emissions associated with each unit produced or service rendered.
Emission reduction compared to a reference year: Progress towards decarbonization goals.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Energy Consumption | Total annual energy consumption: Quantity of energy consumed by the organisation.
Energy intensity per product/service: Energy consumption associated with each unit produced or service rendered.
Share of renewable energies in total consumption: Progress towards cleaner energy.  |
|  Renewable Energy Production | Installed production capacity: Total power of renewable energy production installations.
Quantity of renewable energy produced per year: Volume of energy produced from renewable sources.
Share of self-consumed renewable energy: Use of on-site produced energy.  |
|  Sustainable Mobility | Share of active travels (bike, walking): Encouragement of low-emission modes of transport.

Number of days exceeding air quality standards: Assessment of the frequency of pollution episodes.  |
|  Biodiversity | Number of species present on the sites: Measurement of biological richness.
Area of preserved natural areas: Protection of natural habitats.
Biodiversity index (e.g., Shannon index): Assessment of species diversity and their relative abundance.  |
To implement an effective sustainable development strategy, it is essential to have reliable and regular data on the environmental footprint. While we have established a solid foundation for our sustainable practices, including the implementation of comprehensive environmental monitoring and data collection, we recognize the ongoing need for improvement. Our goal is to further refine and enhance these strategies, leveraging data-driven insights to make more informed and effective decisions. By continuously evaluating our performance and identifying areas for optimisation, we aim to strengthen our commitment to environmental sustainability and achieve even more meaningful results. Here are some ways we are collecting and working on them :

|  Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory | Clear and uniform methodology: Adopt a recognized methodology (such as the GHG Protocol) to calculate our emissions accurately and reproducibly.
Detailed inventory: Inventory all sources of emissions, both direct (linked to your activities) and indirect (linked to the energy you consume).
Regular monitoring: Conduct annual inventories to track the evolution of your emissions and measure the effectiveness of your reduction actions.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Indicator Summary | Simplification and unification: Harmonize the different indicators used to measure your environmental performance. Be inspired by Frédérique's approach to simplify monitoring and facilitate comparison.
Customized dashboard: Create a clear and concise dashboard that groups together the main indicators (energy consumption, waste production, etc.) and allows for a quick visualization of changes over time.  |
|  Smart Meters | Gradual deployment: Equip the facilities with smart meters to collect real-time data on the energy consumption. In Greater Dunkirk, we equipped all users with smart meters for water consumption on the territory
Detailed analysis: Use this data to identify the most significant consumption items and implement targeted reduction actions.  |
|  Household Surveys | Employee involvement: Conduct regular surveys of your employees to gather information on their daily practices (modes of transport, energy consumption at home, etc.).
Awareness and commitment: Use the results of these surveys to implement awareness-raising actions and encourage more responsible behaviors.  |
|  GIS (Geographic Information System) Visualization | Data mapping: Spatially represent your environmental data (emissions, energy consumption, etc.) to better understand their distribution and identify areas for improvement.  |
|   |  Monitoring changes: Compare maps created at different times to visualize the evolution of your situation and highlight the impacts of the actions.  |
|   |  Communication: Use these visualizations to communicate clearly and effectively about your environmental approach to your stakeholders.  |

By effectively tracking emissions through these KPIs, Greater Dunkirk will gain valuable insights to guide strategic decision-making. These indicators will pinpoint specific areas for targeted action and investment, enabling the prioritization of projects with the greatest potential for environmental impact. This data-driven approach will ensure that all decisions made by Greater Dunkirk are informed by concrete evidence and aligned with the overarching goal of achieving climate neutrality.

## From Observation to Action: A Continuous Improvement Approach

Our organization will implement a robust system for collecting and analysing environmental data. This data will enable us to identify trends in our environmental performance, compare our results with the goals we will set, and adjust our strategies accordingly.

Thanks to descriptive statistics, we will gain an overview of our situation and be able to highlight key issues. The analysis of time series will allow us to track the evolution of our indicators over time and identify interesting correlations between different factors.

By understanding and explaining the observed trends, we will be able to adjust our trajectories and implement corrective actions if necessary. In this way, we will develop a true culture of continuous improvement, based on data-driven decision-making.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
To facilitate the monitoring of our performance and the communication of our results, we will develop a customized dashboard. This tool will allow us to synthesize the key indicators and quickly identify the strengths and weaknesses of our approach.

In summary, our approach will be based on a virtuous cycle:

Collect reliable and regular data.
Analyze this data to identify trends and correlations.
Compare the results with the set goals.
Understand the reasons for any discrepancies.
Adapt strategies and actions accordingly.
Track results and iterate.

This approach will not only allow us to improve our environmental performance but also strengthen our credibility with our stakeholders. The 2026 revision of the PCAET will provide valuable input for the iteration of the Climate City Contract (CCC).

The objectives by the end of 2025 are to simplify the core elements of the CCC to ensure accessibility for all stakeholders, including the public. This increased accessibility will empower stakeholders, enabling the Transition Team to effectively conduct follow-ups, facilitate communication on related topics, and foster a sense of ownership within this dynamic process.

With all actions in the portfolio currently under consideration, development, or implementation, the coming years, beginning in 2025, will see the smooth initiation of necessary steps, such as political decisions, feasibility studies, and even fund-raising, to advance these projects. Notably, some actions were already initiated in 2022, soon after Greater Dunkirk's selection for the CCC, thanks to the successful outcome of the Expression of Interest (EoI).

This collaborative approach of the CCC will involve active engagement with various territorial committees. This multi-stakeholder dialogue will foster a shared understanding of the climate transition trajectories, enabling the identification and proactive mitigation of potential challenges faced by different sectors. By sharing insights and perspectives, we can ensure that the collective understanding of the challenges and opportunities is robust and that the strategies remain aligned with the evolving needs and capacities of the entire territory.

Furthermore, the implementation of the green budget framework in France, coupled with the annual requirement for a multi-year investment plan, will necessitate rigorous monitoring and evaluation of all projects within the action portfolio. This rigorous oversight will ensure that investments remain relevant and aligned with the trajectories and dynamics of a just climate transition.

The Climate City Contract will operate as a dynamic and adaptive roadmap for climate neutrality through an iterative process. This process will prioritize continuous learning and improvement.

A robust learning and evaluation framework will be established to systematically collect, analyze, and utilize data. This data, essential for various strategic frameworks within Greater Dunkirk (including the PCAET and TETE label), will inform decision-making throughout the contract's lifecycle.

Workgroups will be established to address specific topics. By including individuals with diverse backgrounds and levels of expertise, we aim to foster a more inclusive and stimulating conversation, where fresh perspectives and questions can challenge assumptions and drive innovation.

Regular stakeholder feedback sessions will be conducted to gather input on implementation and identify areas for improvement.

Leveraging the established committees with Greater Dunkirk and stakeholders, like the Co-Mission Zero, the industrial or scientific committees, we will work together to closely monitor progress and address any emerging challenges proactively.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
&gt; Learnings from both data analysis and stakeholder feedback will be translated into concrete actions. These may include revising targets, adjusting strategies, reallocating resources, or developing new initiatives to enhance the contract's effectiveness.
&gt; To ensure continued stakeholder engagement in the pursuit of climate neutrality, the Transition Team must proactively identify and implement concrete actions that demonstrate tangible progress and address stakeholder concerns.

## 3.3 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

The first indicators can be found in the table B-1.1: Impact Pathways, they are directly associated with the impact of the actions.

For the next iteration, a substantial effort will be dedicated to refining the indicators. Greater Dunkirk is currently working to compile indicators from various programs, making them accessible and easy to track without repeated inquiries.

A novel approach will be implemented for the CCC: a concrete evaluation of the GHG impact of our planned actions. This method, which we currently neglect, will offer a more precise understanding of our environmental footprint.

# 4. Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

### Governance Approach for Climate Action in Dunkirk

Greater Dunkirk has adopted a comprehensive approach to address climate change, integrating climate action into its governance structures and decision-making processes. Greater Dunkirk's climate agenda is guided by a strong commitment to achieving climate neutrality and is supported by a robust governance framework that involves various stakeholders at different levels. Greater Dunkirk has :

&gt; **Governance Structures and Frameworks**
&gt; - **Political governance**

**Mayors’ conferences**: Established in 2014 in Greater Dunkirk, it has been mandatory in public interest groups since the Commitment and Proximity Law of December 27, 2019. This body brings together all mayors and deputy mayors of Greater Dunkirk's municipalities, as well as vice-presidents. It is a forum for discussion and collective debate on the future and important issues of the territory and strengthens the role of all mayors in this reflection. Greater Dunkirk and the municipalities are committed to the collegiality of this body where all members contribute equally to the debates and projects of the municipality. It meets as often as necessary depending on the reflections or projects underway. It may be held exceptionally depending on current events or emergencies. The agenda is both fed by its members but can also be proposed by the administration or a conference of deputy mayors. Climate neutrality is a frequent subject of discussion among many others.

**Deputy Mayors’ Conference**: Conferences of deputy mayors have historically existed in a formalized manner. However, this mandate is an opportunity to generalize these meetings, whether on subjects specific to our competences or on subjects that go beyond the institutional prerogatives of Greater Dunkirk as a facilitator of networking in our territory. As of the date of this pact, the existing conferences are: Commerce, Culture, Finance, Housing, Health, and Social. The topics discussed at the deputy mayors’ conference can feed into the mayors’ conference and vice versa. It is a place for discussion and exchange on intermunicipal projects as well as municipal projects that could be worked on together, for example to address a shared problem. These conferences also make it possible to work on the interfaces between municipal and intermunicipal interventions to ensure a good handling of missions. For example, the presentation of the analysis of social needs at the level of the municipalities of the agglomeration at the conference of deputy mayors for social action will be an opportunity to discuss topics that could be the subject of coordinated initiatives at the level of the agglomeration or of several municipalities that compose it.

**Association of Municipal Elected Officials**: The elected officials’ seminar aims to bring together all the majority elected officials of the municipalities, both community and municipal. Brought together for the first time on August 30, 2020, this experience will be renewed once a year to share a common vision of community public action. During the mandate, it may be supplemented by tools such as a newsletter summarizing the decisions presented at the community council, etc.

To associate municipal elected officials with community debates over the long term, community elected officials and technicians can also, depending on needs, intervene during municipal councils.

# Administrative governance

Meeting of the General Managers: The DGS of the Greater Dunkirk's municipalities are organized into a network. This collective of 19 executives draws its strength from its diversity and heterogeneity.

A common objective is to successfully implement municipal and community policies, but above all to ensure the coordinated operation of municipal and community public services in the territory.

The general Managers meet in a conference every 2-3 months, alternating between a building or facility of a municipality or Greater Dunkirk.

At each mayor's conference, a flash briefing is organized to provide a technical summary of the discussions and projects to be undertaken.

Focus meetings allow for discussions or presentations on a topic, whether community or municipal, with services or external partners.

A newsletter is sent out weekly to inform and exchange information on current topics and to request contributions from municipalities (identification of referents, preparation of deliberations, feedback on diagnostic elements, etc.).

To facilitate continuous exchanges between DGS within a professional community, various permanent collaborative communication tools have also been implemented (instant messaging groups, agglomeration office suite).

Forum of Directors of Technical Services: This forum is a breakdown at the level of coordination of agglomeration technical services of the DGS network.

It allows for the sharing and harmonization of practices in the design and management of public space, and to carry out reflections on projects for pooling skills around cleanliness, green spaces, buildings or public lighting. This forum is also open, depending on the organization's specific to each municipality, to deputy mayors in charge of public works.

Greater Dunkirk Administration: The administration plays a central role in driving climate action. A dedicated department or unit within the administration is responsible for overseeing climate initiatives and coordinating with other relevant departments.

Climate plan and labels steering committee: Bringing together a diverse range of experts from fields as varied as environment, energy, urban planning, and economics, our climate plan's steering committee provides essential multidisciplinary expertise to address the challenges of climate change in our region.

It complements the momentum generated by the transition team. Faced with the impacts of climate change (rising sea levels, heat islands, air pollution, energy dependency), this committee enables us to develop innovative and tailored solutions. By cross-fertilizing ideas and mobilising everyone's skills, we can achieve our ambitious goals: reducing our GHG emissions, developing renewable energies, and strengthening the resilience of our infrastructure. Thanks to the active participation of elected officials, technical services, businesses, associations, and citizens, this committee will ensure co-construction of the climate plan and better consideration of everyone's expectations.

Municipalities technicians' network: These professionals possess a wide range of technical skills (urban planning, environment, public works, etc.) and are responsible for implementing local policies.

This network serves as a platform for technicians to share their experiences, best practices, and stay informed of legislative and regulatory changes. It also promotes collaboration between municipalities.

As experts, technicians provide support to local elected officials in decision-making. The network allows for the pooling of knowledge and the strengthening of collective expertise.

5
Greater Dunkirk's municipalities: Professional networks are a powerful lever for sharing expertise and harmonizing practices, by taking the best of the practices developed in the municipalities or within Greater Dunkirk; and by ensuring the coordinated implementation of the orientations taken by community and municipal elected officials.

The following are included in this framework:

The deployment of a legal watch tool
The networking of financial directors
The green spaces and natural areas network
The librarians' network
Internal training

&gt; Shared Administration Project

To extend this collaborative work between the Greater Dunkirk and the municipalities as closely as possible to the agents, Greater Dunkirk is committed to initiating a process with the municipalities aimed at spreading a shared professional culture throughout all community and municipal services.

A first step will consist of considering, for example, devices such as:

A systematic mechanism for sharing job offers at the level of the municipalities
Professional immersions
An internal municipalities journal
Etc.

&gt; Transition team: The Transition Team is a dynamic group of stakeholders, primarily from the Greater Dunkirk administration, dedicated to achieving climate neutrality. This team is focused on developing strategies and projects to improve our way of life and public policies. We recognize that implementing complex, large-scale climate actions can present challenges in terms of administration and coordination, especially when coordinating across multiple sectors.

To meet the deadlines of the European Commission for the submission of the Climate City Contract (CCC), Greater Dunkirk has set up a dedicated transition team. Given the close correlation between the CCC's actions and those of the Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan (PCAET), validated in 2023, it was considered more strategic to mobilise internal skills as a priority.

This multidisciplinary team brings together directors and technicians who are experts in the key areas of climate change. The departments involved in the CCC within Greater Dunkirk are:

Public spaces mobility
Quality of life environment
Waste reduction and recovery
Territorial development and partnerships
Local democracy and popular education
Attractiveness and employment
Entrepreneurship, trade and innovation
Water cycle
Housing
Sustainable city

To guarantee broad consultation and co-construction of the project, the referent colleagues of the existing specific committees (industrial committee and scientific committee for example), involving external actors such as scientists, industrialists and the directors of the various departments of Greater Dunkirk, are part of the transition team. These committees ensure a balanced representation of the various issues and promote the emergence of a shared vision.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
By placing Greater Dunkirk at the heart of the CCC's management, we want not only to control deadlines and objectives, but also to secure the process. The creation of this Transition Team makes it possible to anticipate any changes in scope and to guarantee the continuity of the actions undertaken. We are convinced that opening to new partners, while strengthening our capacities, will allow us to accelerate the ecological transition of our territory and achieve even more ambitious objectives.

## Local Democracy and Popular Education Department

In Greater Dunkirk, a dedicated department focuses on citizen engagement. Here are some practical examples of their initiatives.

### Climat Libé Tour: 2 Editions 2023 and 2024

A free festival focused on ecology. For the past two years, the newspaper Libération has organized a nationwide tour of France offering meetings, workshops, and experiences.

**Goal:** Transportation, industrial renovation, urban greening... exploring the challenges of ecological transition through a series of unique events.
**Objective:** Inform and find solutions tailored to real-world situations. Thus, we offer, in collaboration with Libé:

Roundtables and Discussions – open forums with national experts (economists, athletes, business leaders, etc.)
Generation Transitions Parliament – a day dedicated to understanding citizen engagement, debating, and presenting ideas to the elected representatives of the Dunkirk Urban Community in a forum of dialogue and exchange
Festive and Friendly Events like this year’s Climat Comedy Club
Workshops for Middle and Primary Schools – sessions on understanding the issues and finding solutions (e.g., “fresco forum” in 2023, Climate and Journalism Workshop in 2024)
These events also highlight the Dunkirk region at the national level (through Libération's thematic publications). More info
Deliverables: After-movie, photos, social media coverage, and audio recordings in partnership with a video association and students from IMT, who act as one-day reporters. In 2023, we hosted a live exhibition with a graphic facilitator.

Scientific Committee

Composed of researchers, academics, and practitioners with recognized and complementary expertise, the Scientific Committee of France Villes et Territoires Durables (FVD) and the Local Democracy and Popular Education Department of Greater Dunkirk contribute to the association's knowledge on the challenges and causes of the Anthropocene, as well as solutions to accelerate the ecological and social transformation of territories.

This scientific collective, covering numerous environmental, social, and urban disciplines, supports France Villes et Territoires Durables in the following ways:

Regularly updating the shared vision of the fundamentals of sustainable and resilient territories considering the latest publications and experiences in France and internationally.
Recommending priority actions to accelerate ecological and social transformations.
Strengthening dialogue between public and private territorial decision-makers and researchers to inform territorial transition strategies.
Empowering citizens to fully participate in the challenges of these transitions.

This is an opportunity to explore themes, identify trends, and invite experts to enrich the season's programming. The committee meets twice a year and contributes to events like Sustainable Cities in Action.

More info on the event

Facilitator Team

Three facilitators in the Popular Education Department engage with the public at events and specific educational actions.

Example: Collaborating on the 200,000 Residents, 200,000 Winners project, hosting collaborative games at CLUB2024 (Olympic village), and explaining festival projects on energy and local themes.

9
To address these challenges, we aim to leverage existing committees, such as those focused on industry, science, and biodiversity. While the CCC doesn't currently outline the specific structure and operations of the Transition Team and its associated governance structures, the upcoming meeting will focus on defining these aspects and outlining how we will collaborate with external stakeholders daily to implement the Co-Mission Zero initiative.

Given the short timeframe since the CCC project manager assumed its role in late April 2024, the development of these details is a priority.

Climate change awareness: Dunkirk has recently implemented a half-day climate change awareness program for its 3,000 employees. This initiative aims to educate staff on the urgent need for climate action and to equip them with the knowledge and tools to contribute to a more sustainable future. By fostering a climate-conscious workforce, Greater Dunkirk hopes to integrate sustainability into all aspects of its operations. The program covers a wide range of topics, including the causes and impacts of climate change, sustainable practices, and the Greater Dunkirk's specific climate goals
ÉcosystèmeD: is a Public Interest Group (GIP) that supports the transformation of the Dunkirk industrial port area as part of the "Dunkirk, creative energy" project, winner of the "Territories of Innovation" call for projects.

It brings together public, private, associative, academic and civil society actors around common objectives to:

promote the establishment of innovative companies;
attract and support project leaders;
Encourage research and innovation to promote the transitions of the Dunkirk industrial port territory.

ÉcosystèmeD is organised around 4 administrators: Greater Dunkirk, the Community of Municipalities of the Hauts de Flandre, the Grand Port Maritime de Dunkerque and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Littoral Hauts-de-France.

Greater Dunkirk, the CCI and the GPMD have designated ÉcosystèmeD as the leader of the DKarbonation project, winner of the Low Carbon Industrial Zones (ZIBaC) call for projects.

&gt; GREC (Regional Climate Studies Group): The GREC, provides valuable expertise and support to the cities climate efforts. The GREC conducts research, analyses data, and develops strategies to address climate change at the regional level.
&gt; Multi-level Governance: Dunkirk collaborates with other levels of government, including the national and regional authorities, to implement climate policies and initiatives. This multi-level approach ensures a coordinated and effective response to climate change.

Rev3: The Hauts-de-France Region and the Hauts-de-France Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCIR) have been working together for almost ten years to promote a more sustainable and inclusive region.

Energy: how can we switch to carbon-free energies?
Technology: how can we improve our production processes to adapt to technological change (development of artificial intelligence, connection modes, etc.)?
Society: how can we provide better housing, travel, food and consumption?

Territorial Anchoring: One of the pillars of REV3 is to strengthen the local economy by creating jobs directly within the territories. To achieve this, the Region works closely with local authorities, as demonstrated by the "demonstrator territories" initiative. Planning tools such as the SRADDET, PCAET, and NPNRU are also used to effectively guide projects.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
Innovation and Training: Innovation is at the heart of the REV3 dynamic, with a particular focus on transferring research results to businesses. This not only creates new jobs but also fosters the emergence of new economic activities. Training programs are also adapted to meet market needs and the challenges of the energy transition.

Citizen Involvement: The inhabitants of Hauts-de-France are encouraged to play an active role in this transformation. They are invited to get directly involved in projects and to launch their own initiatives. Crowdfunding tools are also in place to support citizen-led projects, thereby enhancing their engagement.

Integration into Regional Policies: REV3 has become a strong identity marker for the Hauts-de-France region. Its objectives are now integrated into all regional policies, and regional staff are trained on the issues of the energy transition.

&gt; Non-Government Actors: Civil society organisations, businesses, and other non-government actors play a vital role in Greater Dunkirk's climate agenda. These stakeholders contribute to climate action through various initiatives, such as advocacy, research, and community engagement.

Non-Government Actors (NGOs) are essential partners in the city's climate agenda. These organisations, businesses, and other stakeholders contribute significantly to climate action through a variety of initiatives.

Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) play a particularly active role. They often serve as advocates for climate-related issues, raising awareness and lobbying for policy changes. Additionally, CSOs can conduct research and analysis to inform decision-making and develop evidence-based solutions. Some may also implement community-based projects, such as tree-planting initiatives, energy-efficiency programs, or sustainable transportation initiatives.

Businesses also have a crucial role to play in climate action. Many companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of sustainability and are taking steps to reduce their environmental footprint. This can involve adopting green practices, investing in renewable energy, and developing sustainable products and services. Businesses can also contribute to climate action by supporting local initiatives and advocating for policies that promote sustainability.

University and research institutions, serve as hubs of research, innovation, and education, contributing significantly to the development of sustainable solutions. Universities conduct cutting-edge research to understand the complexities of climate change, develop new technologies for reducing GHG emissions, and explore adaptation strategies.

&gt; Industries: By successfully integrating sustainability into its economic renewal, Dunkirk can position itself as a leading example of green industrial transformation on the national and European stage. This can attract investment, skilled labour, and tourism, while also providing a blueprint for other industrial regions looking to transition to a low-carbon economy.

&gt; University of Opal Coast (ULCO): A hub of 4 universities in the Hauts-de-France region, with a campus in Dunkirk.

ULCO distinguishes itself through its commitment to cutting-edge research. 14 research units, spread across 3 research centers and institutes on our various campuses, cover a wide range of disciplines: the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences; the Technological and Environmental Transformations Center; and the Humanities and Integrated Territories Center.

The research teams collaborate closely with national and international partners to address the most pressing scientific and technological challenges of our time. Locally, the university is also fully engaged with its socio-economic and institutional partners to address major territorial challenges, particularly on environmental issues and the creation of a decarbonized industry.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
Many public interest topics are being worked on between ULCO and Greater Dunkirk. A prime example, linking industries, decarbonization, and learning, is the "C-DeCIDé" project, led by ULCO. It aims to support the reindustrialization of a zero-carbon territory by developing a comprehensive and diversified training offer ranging from pre-baccalaureate to doctoral level, adapted to different audiences, from initial to continuing education. To achieve this, the university will set up seven technological training platforms, known as "learning construction sites," interconnected within a territorial symbiosis. These platforms will offer a complete and diversified training offer, ranging from micro-certifications to national diplomas and professional qualifications, including skills blocks and MOOC-gradeo programs. The C-DeCIDé project emphasizes the development of transversal skills (soft skills) in parallel with technical skills (hard skills). It also plans to create an awareness module on decarbonization issues, which will then be deployed nationally through the FUN (France Université Numérique) platform. Led by ULCO, C-DeCIDé is the result of a collaboration between various academic, territorial, and industrial stakeholders in the region. An assessment of training needs related to industrial decarbonization at the territorial level was carried out through interviews with regional industries, with the help of actors such as the Greater Dunkirk, the Hauts-de-France CCI, and ÉcosystèmeD. Industrial partners such as ArcelorMittal, Total Energies Learning Solutions, AFPA, and Verkor, all training operators, will work with ULCO on the design of the training modules. This 5-year project aims to provide 2,300 hours of initial training with the goal of training 12,500 students. In terms of continuing education, 1,360 hours will be dedicated to training 10,500 learners.

The governance structure for climate action in Greater Dunkirk is comprised of two tiers. At the strategic level, the President, Vice-President, and Mayors establish the overarching policy framework. The operational level is managed by the General Manager and the General Manager for Ecological Transition, who oversee the implementation and coordination of climate mitigation initiatives.

Engage stakeholders by first identifying key groups based on their potential impact on emissions, such as energy producers, transportation companies, industries, government agencies, and communities.
Tailor engagement strategies to each group through methods like workshops, surveys, and focus groups.
Collaboratively involve these stakeholders in setting GHG reduction targets and developing action plans, fostering a sense of ownership and commitment to shared goals.
To encourage participation, Greater Dunkirk works on offering incentives such as financial benefits, tax breaks, or regulatory advantages, and create market-based mechanisms like emissions trading to drive innovation and efficiency.
Facilitate knowledge sharing among stakeholders through conferences, webinars, and online platforms, promoting the exchange of best practices and lessons learned.
Establish mechanisms to connect systems linked to emissions sources by developing standardized data collection protocols and reporting standards, ensuring data accuracy, reliability, and comparability across different systems.
Implement integrated emissions monitoring through real-time tracking and remote sensing technologies, like satellites, for large-scale observation.
Use advanced data analytics and modeling to identify emission hotspots, trends, and predict the impact of various mitigation strategies.
Secure platforms should be created to share emissions data among stakeholders, enabling collaboration and informed decision-making.
Combine stakeholders' involvement with system connectivity by co-developing monitoring systems that engage stakeholders in their design and implementation, ensuring these systems are relevant and widely accepted.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
Collaborate with stakeholders on research and development projects to foster innovation and create new technologies and solutions.
Use performance-based contracts to link stakeholder incentives to emissions reduction achievements, encouraging continuous improvement and accountability.

With the unwavering support of our political leaders in the Greater Dunkirk administration, we'll be able to discuss about funding key priorities to tackle this complex issue. Over time, our understanding of the problem has deepened significantly, and it will allow us to develop more targeted and effective strategies. As the initial challenges are daunting, our persistence and adaptability will pave the way for a smoother path forward.

In future iterations of our climate neutrality plan, we aim to foster greater collaboration with additional stakeholders focused on living areas. By leveraging these synergies, we can accelerate our progress towards our goals. The transition team will actively engage with existing committees representing the economic, industrial, residential and scientific sectors of Greater Dunkirk for example.

As mentioned before, three primary strategies are being implemented to involve citizens and rally their support for achieving carbon neutrality.

&gt; The first is the Eco-winning program. The concept is straightforward: rather than imposing restrictions or making people feel guilty, we aim to incentivize individuals to adopt more environmentally friendly habits and reduce their carbon footprint. In Greater Dunkirk, local leaders have decided to prioritise increasing purchasing power as the primary motivator for encouraging sustainable behaviors. This additionally offers the benefit of improving quality of life and increasing social equity.

Initiated with the introduction of free public transportation, the Eco-winning program is expanding and is increasingly touching various aspects of daily life: housing, water, active mobility, waste, etc. It ranges from financial assistance for home insulation to the free provision of water recovery systems and the regular organization of 'repair cafes' to extend the lifespan of household appliances.

The Eco-winning program is actively promoted through comprehensive campaigns to raise awareness and encourage participation. These campaigns emphasize the program's dual benefits: increased purchasing power and a positive environmental impact.

&gt; The second policy implemented for the climate involves public awareness and information. Greater Dunkirk has three major popular education facilities: La Halle Aux Sucres dedicated to sustainable cities, le PLUS (Palace of the Universe and Science) dedicated to science and technology related to industry and decarbonization, and Biotopia dedicated to biodiversity. Today, these three facilities have adopted decarbonization as their primary educational focus and are coordinating to create truly coherent visitor experiences.

Efforts are also underway to increase the number of "off-site" actions to reach out to residents. This "externalization" is also supported by the many educational and fun events organized by the territory: the fabulous factory to explain the jobs of the future, the Village of the Future to show that one can live well and even better in a decarbonized world with new energies, etc. All these events rely on the participation of numerous partners.

&gt; The third policy implemented is part of the DNA of the Dunkirk territory: citizen consultation. For many years, citizens have been invited to give their opinion on the future of the territory, on their needs, their desires, their opinions. This culture of participation has been further strengthened in recent years with the implementation of votes on issues at the municipality level, local initiative factories (FIL) for issues at the neighbourhood level, major exchanges during the implementation of free buses and the urban developments that this implied, or the drafting of the Local Urban Plan or the Air Climate Energy Plan.

A permanent consultation platform and field actions have been set up: "changing life together" and has made it possible to listen to the opinions of the population on the end of the COVID lockdown, on how to jointly manage the arrival of 20,000 jobs and, recently, on how to achieve carbon neutrality within the framework of the climate contract. This culture of consultation is strengthening and constantly evolving towards co-decision-making mechanisms and broader participation of stakeholders: Co-Mission Zero and social conference.

This process can be divided into three main stages, each of which requires active participation from citizens. These steps are as follows:

## Phase 1: Gathering the voices of inhabitants/users/citizens.

Following the first lockdown, the Greater Dunkirk launched a citizen dialogue initiative on "the world after", to adapt, with the help of the population, the services and the use of public space in a context of deconfinement under constraints. Building on this experience, and with the desire to animate a permanent and continuous citizen approach, the Greater Dunkirk sets up the citizen consultation process "Changing life together". The aim of this process was to gather the opinions of its inhabitants, users, and citizens of the territory to find out what they wanted and needed for the coming years. More than 3,000 contributions were recorded. The entire territory was involved in the deployment of this approach, with particular attention paid to young people and seniors. This survey was supplemented by three workshops. They made it possible to co-create, with the inhabitants, concrete solutions to "Change life together". The role of the citizen was rethought as a driving force in the ecological transformation of the territory. As a starting point for the territorial project, "Changing life together" made it possible to develop roadmaps for our public policies for the first part of the current mandate.

## Phase 2: Co-construction of public policies and processing of citizen contributions

Following the process, and to better understand the expectations and needs of the inhabitants, but also the obstacles that prevent families from adopting more positive habits for the environment, the elected representatives of the Greater Dunkirk decided to support an approach implemented by the University of the Littoral Côte d'Opale (ULCO). Indeed, volunteer families took part in an experiment aimed at building solutions that meet the challenges of climate change and the needs of inhabitants, considering the realities of everyday life (interviews aimed at discussing on the reasons for their choices, on what encourages or discourages them to respect certain rules). To achieve a lasting change in the behavior of inhabitants, the choice was made for an incentive-based approach that highlighted gains in purchasing power and the simplification of procedures, rather than a punitive approach. This is the whole meaning of the eco-winning program which targets 4 areas that cover a large part of household fixed expenses (water, waste, mobility, housing), examples: rainwater recovery, deployment of resource centers, use of the free free public transport, energy renovation of housing. Since then, multiple devices have been initiated:

Going door-to-door to meet the 80,000 households in the agglomeration to explain the challenges of the waste collection system reform and waste sorting.
For young people, commitment to transitions is carried out through a participatory design device "Young Influencers for the Climate".
Mobile initiative devices have been deployed: itinerant bike houses, itinerant project houses, the itinerant Village of the Future during the summer season, etc.
In order not to slow down this dynamic of change, the Greater Dunkirk wished to continue the process to co-construct the solutions and projects of tomorrow. It has therefore imagined several meetings to meet the inhabitants and offer them the opportunity to become even more involved.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
The Citizens' Assembly!

The debate is open to all and focuses on four major challenges:

Climate change
Air, water, and soil quality
Biodiversity
Availability of essential resources The goal is to collectively reach an action plan for the future.

# The Youth Assembly!

As part of "Changing life together", the inhabitants of the agglomeration have massively placed young people as a priority public. It is a great ambition, for a territory, to be able to offer each young person support towards their autonomy and their entry into adult life. Since October 2021, nearly 800 young people have been mobilized by the partners of the Assembly to make their ideas, concerns, and proposals heard in order to collectively build a territory in their image. During about sixty workshops, the youth of the Dunkirk agglomeration were able to propose and imagine concrete solutions to "Change life together".

# PHASE 3: Consultation NetZeroCities: Embarking citizens on the transition(s)

&gt; 1. J.I.C "Young Influencers for the Climate" A call for applications was launched among young people in the territory; the Young Influencers for the Climate continue to meet outside school hours (Wednesday and Saturday afternoons or during the holidays). Concretely, they were able to:
&gt; - Be sensitized to global climate issues through the "Climate Fresco" animation
&gt; - Collectively generate ideas, reflect on the projects they could carry out
&gt; - Meet stakeholders of the territory in terms of ecological transition
&gt; - Act to promote their collective and recruit other members, by preparing workshops and animations. They also worked on an identity (a name, a logo), a communication campaign (form via the "changing life together" site, creation of a flyer, interview of one of the members in the latest community magazine). In addition, they also created their own "Instagram" page and a "WhatsApp" group to facilitate exchanges.

&gt; 2. Pop'Democracy: Raising awareness "Outside the Walls" through an educational and playful approach. In addition to these approaches, multiple sequences are deployed in a logic of "going towards", in favor of transitions centered around popular education:
&gt; - The "Green Village" during the "Gigapuces" in Dunkirk. Dedicated to eco-gestures, the Halle aux sucres (popular education facility of the Greater Dunkirk) sets up meetings with inhabitants/users/citizens for "do it yourself" workshops, repair cafes, "upcycling", awareness of re-use, ... a whole eco-responsible and eco-winning universe,
&gt; - The "Village of the Future" invites all the generations to question the world of energy and discover solutions for a sustainable future in a festive and enthusiastic spirit through exhibitions, workshops, and participatory energy experiences: parental energy carousel, juice bike mixer, climate crisis tumbledown, energy quiz, mini-debates.

Focus "Mobile Parliament": HQ of the sustainable city! PCAET, Decarbonization, Smart City, ... Behind this jargon, there are words that have a precise meaning. Knowing them better is giving oneself the power to act to participate in the collective commitment and transform the territory. This citizen consultation deployed during the "Village of the future" made it possible to collect nearly 600 contributions.

&gt; 3. Supporting elected officials and territorial agents in the methodology of citizen consultation, the "Network of territorial actors of local democracy and popular education" was launched, integrating elected officials of the agglomeration, representatives of neighborhood houses, technicians of the municipalities and Greater Dunkirk.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
In continuity, a focus group "Neighborhood houses in transition(s)" allowed the meeting of 80 agents of the neighborhood houses of A tes côtés and Atouts-Ville. This highlight was an opportunity to generate exchanges around the neighborhood house of the future.

Finally, a third focus sequence "Technicians in Transition(s)" developed with the Urban agency of Dunkirk (AGUR), aimed at municipal and community agents, was organized.

From now on, these networks of actors linked to the climate to "embark" their members in the transition.

## Ambition: Co-construction; Deployment of an Augmented Participatory Territorial Contract

Consolidating the offer of service in Pop'Democracy: A phase of updated assessment of the needs/ expectations in citizen involvement engineering was carried out by the popular education and local democracy department with the Greater Dunkirk's departments. As a result, 11 departments were met. Following the interviews, a form "Methodology &amp; Support - Citizen Involvement" was sent to each of them to refine their requests for strategic and methodological support.
Prototyping new collaborative models at the service of the territory's projects: Following this census and the deployment of the three awareness-raising phases, a "training-action" cycle was co-constructed with the national center for territorial public service (CNFPT). It was an opportunity for the agents of the city of Dunkirk and Greater Dunkirk to be initiated to the conduct of participatory projects in a concrete and operational way (animation methodology, tools for citizen consultation, simulation).

Building on a tradition of consultation and co-decision-making, on the CCC, Greater Dunkirk and its partners wish to structure and anchor this permanent citizen dialogue to enrich the Co-mission Zero contract and involve as many people as possible in the approach.

# 4.2 Module C-2 Social Innovation Interventions

These innovative approaches empower stakeholders to actively participate in shaping Greater Dunkirk's environmental policies, while ensuring compliance with regulatory and financial guidelines. By expanding and refining existing initiatives, we can enhance access to information, foster meaningful engagement, and create a more inclusive decision-making process. These efforts can also stimulate the creation of green jobs, improve overall well-being and environmental quality, and cultivate a sense of ownership among stakeholders in the development and implementation of public policies. How do these innovations lower barriers for marginalized groups to participate?

To ensure the success and long-term impact of any innovation, a structured approach that encompasses robust planning, strategic partnerships, adaptability, scalability, effective communication, and sustainability is essential. Below is an outline of key principles that will guide our innovation process:

## Robust Planning and Evaluation

**Clear Goals**: Establishing clear and measurable objectives is the foundation of a successful innovation. These goals should be specific, achievable, and aligned with the broader mission of Greater Dunkirk and the stakeholders. By setting defined targets, teams can focus their efforts and resources effectively.
**Rigorous Evaluation**: Implementing a comprehensive evaluation framework is crucial for tracking progress and identifying areas that need improvement. Regular assessments allow for real-time insights, helping to ensure that the innovation remains on course and achieves its intended outcomes.
**Data-Driven Decision Making**: Using data to inform decision-making is a critical component of a successful innovation strategy. By relying on empirical evidence, rather than assumptions, organisations can make informed adjustments to their strategies, ensuring that they remain relevant and effective in a changing environment.

## Strong Partnerships and Collaboration

**Diverse Stakeholders**: Collaborating with a wide range of stakeholders, including government agencies, industry partners, and academic institutions, enriches the innovation process. Each partner brings unique perspectives, expertise, and resources, which are vital for overcoming challenges and accelerating progress.
**Shared Vision**: Ensuring that all partners are aligned with the overall goals and objectives of the innovation is essential for cohesive and effective collaboration. A shared vision fosters unity and a collective commitment to achieving the desired outcomes.
**Resource Sharing**: Leveraging the resources and expertise of partners is a key strategy for accelerating innovation. By pooling resources, organizations can overcome limitations and create synergies that drive faster and more impactful results.

## Adaptability and Flexibility

**Continuous Learning**: Staying informed about industry trends, technological advancements, and changing market conditions is crucial for maintaining the relevance of our innovation. Continuous learning enables teams to anticipate changes and adapt proactively.
**Iterative Development**: Being prepared to adapt the innovation based on feedback and emerging opportunities is essential for success. Iterative development allows for the refinement of ideas, ensuring that the final product or service meets the needs of its users and remains competitive in the market.
**Risk Management**: Developing strategies to mitigate risks and uncertainties is a fundamental aspect of innovation. A proactive approach to risk management ensures that potential challenges are identified early and addressed effectively, minimizing disruptions.

# Scalability from the Start

&gt; **Modular Design**: Designing innovation to be scalable and adaptable to different contexts from the outset is key to its long-term success. A modular approach allows for flexibility in implementation and ensures that the innovation can grow and evolve as needed.

&gt; **Pilot Projects**: Conducting pilot projects is an effective way to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the innovation on a smaller scale. These pilots provide valuable insights that can inform larger-scale implementations and help refine the innovation before a full rollout.

&gt; **Infrastructure and Resources**: Ensuring that the necessary infrastructure and resources are in place to support scale-up is crucial. This includes securing financial resources, building capacity, and establishing the operational frameworks needed to sustain growth.

# Effective Communication and Engagement

&gt; **Stakeholder Engagement**: Keeping stakeholders informed about the progress of the innovation and actively seeking their input fosters trust and collaboration. Regular updates and transparent communication ensure that all parties remain engaged and supportive.

&gt; **Public Relations**: Developing a public relations strategy to raise awareness and build support for the innovation is essential for gaining public and stakeholders buy-in. Effective public relation efforts can help to highlight the innovation’s benefits and attract the necessary attention and resources.

&gt; **Storytelling**: Communicating the benefits and impact of the innovation in a compelling and engaging way is crucial for gaining support and driving adoption. Storytelling helps to humanize the innovation, making it more relatable and easier to understand for diverse audiences.

# Sustainability and Impact Measurement

&gt; **Long-Term Sustainability**: Developing a plan to ensure the long-term sustainability of the innovation is vital for its continued success. This includes securing ongoing funding, building capacity, and embedding the innovation into existing systems.

&gt; **Impact Assessment**: Continuously measuring and assessing the impact of the innovation on its intended beneficiaries is essential for understanding its effectiveness and value. Regular impact assessments allow for adjustments to be made, ensuring that the innovation remains aligned with its goals.

&gt; **Social and Environmental Responsibility**: Considering the social and environmental implications of the innovation is not only ethically important but also enhances its acceptability and success. Innovations that positively contribute to society and the environment are more likely to gain widespread support and endure over time.

# To illustrate our goals, we're considering these specific actions for Greater Dunkirk

&gt; **Anchoring Eco-winning in Time and Territory**: As previously mentioned, Greater Dunkirk has opted to incentivize local actors to adopt more environmentally friendly behaviors and reduce their carbon emissions through purchasing power incentives. This initiative is known as Eco-winning. It is increasingly impacting various aspects of household life: mobility, housing, water, energy, waste, etc.

While each new action has been widely communicated, to further strengthen its impact and benefit the greatest number of people, it has been decided to continue diversifying the program (housing, green private gardens), reinforce communication, and create a true Eco-winning portfolio for families. This means providing comprehensive communications summarizing all the assistance or services to which residents are entitled through various communication tools (web, app, newspapers, etc.). This communication will be relayed by Greater Dunkirk but also by the municipalities within the territory. An app will also be created on the subject and will include monitoring energy and water consumption.
&gt; Leveraging Existing Partnerships: Many Eco-winning initiatives have been created thanks to strong partnerships with public service delegates, such as the public transport delegate. The same is true for water, with the implementation of a pilot eco-solidarity pricing scheme. For these partners, Greater Dunkirk has become a place to pursue their own evolution and test new solutions. This generates new innovations and strengthens existing ones; for example, with the mobility partner, to consider new services to implement parking-free factories. With the water service delegate, the aim is to go further in fair billing linked to actual consumption, especially by better considering household size.

&gt; Working with New Partners: To continue innovating, it is also necessary to bring new partners to the table. Housing is a major issue for many people. Various Eco-winning initiatives to fund home insulation have been implemented. However, the ambition is to go further and, to this end, to involve social landlords, as well as property developers and landlords. Similarly, for the maximum number of families to be able to participate in Eco-winning initiatives, they must be visible in their daily lives. Greater Dunkirk provides families, free of charge, with rainwater collectors or composters. To ensure that everyone is aware of this and can benefit from it, it is planned to work with DIY stores which, in their departments, will promote the initiative and bill the product to the community.

&gt; Working with New Audiences: In France, we often talk about a category of inhabitants called "Bobos" for bourgeois bohemians; and simplistically, one might think that this category is the most sensitive to climate change and is interested in the initiatives put in place. The idea is to involve all audiences; this is why discussions have begun with neighborhood centers and social centers in the cities of Greater Dunkirk so that awareness-raising, discovery, information, and sharing actions can be carried out by the staff of these facilities towards residents.

&gt; Imagining Ever More Ambitious New Initiatives: For a transition to be carried out and adopted by all, it must be fair; this is why it must also adapt and consider all audiences, including those in great difficulty. Greater Dunkirk is working on the implementation of Universal Public Service for Essential Needs. This could involve, for example, creating meals with fresh and local products. This action will associate all municipalities in a solidarity pact.

&gt; Communicate, Communicate, Communicate and Listen, Listen, Listen: For these actions to reach the maximum number of inhabitants, and especially those who need them most, everyone must be aware of the initiatives implemented; these initiatives must also meet their needs. As mentioned in the commitment, Greater Dunkirk wishes to strengthen its communication on carbon neutrality, as well as on good practices and purchasing power; but also, to strengthen the mechanisms for exchange with stakeholders in the territory (Co-mission Zero and social conference) to better align with the reality on the ground and the expectations of residents.

Even though some actions are still under review, the following examples provide tangible illustrations of these social innovation ideas.

## Time banks for skills exchange

### The Turbine

Marked by a strong culture of salaried employment inherited from the historical presence of large industrial groups in the territory, Dunkirk has been engaged since 2014 in a process aimed at nurturing the endogenous creation of companies, making it possible to further diversify its economic network.

In this context, La Turbine opened its doors in November 2020 and is home to all the local players in entrepreneurship: Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Chamber of Trades and Crafts, BGE Flanders creation, Initiative Flandre, Groop and Adie. Our partners such as Nord actif, the Toerana cooperative, Tilt, CARSAT, 60,000 Rebounds, etc. also hold regular sessions. The idea is to be able to provide an answer to all questions related to entrepreneurship in a single place.

These structures are housed free of charge at La Turbine, a community building, and are for the most part subsidized by Greater Dunkirk to provide project leaders with a quality and free service.

A project to extend the existing site (led by the Idéel group with S3D (Dunkirk Development Company) in co-promotion of the project) is currently being considered. It seems necessary to develop a tertiary real estate offer in the immediate vicinity of La Turbine by offering accommodation to young companies and business service activities in a residential logic.

Regarding the awareness of young people in schools, a territorial animation around the OPTE platform (a digital platform to encourage young people to set up their own business) has been launched to further accentuate the dynamic around La Turbine and strengthen the links between the world of education and companies. The objective is also to meet the needs of teachers on entrepreneurship but also more broadly to questions related to the professions of the future and the promising sectors of activity in the Dunkirk area, in connection with the Dunkirk Creative Energy actions already carried out and the Educational Pact.

Another structure found in La Turbine is the CCI (Chamber of Commerce and Industries) which carries out general actions in favour of all companies and territories to facilitate their commitments and ensure their success in a context of profound change. It is in this context that the CCI HdF offers (thanks to the Hauts-de-France Region and Europe) a support called "Ecological Transition Booster", which aims to:

Take stock of a company's environmental performance: its practices, its management tools and its management method.
Identify and analyse its different flows: energy, waste, discharges, materials, procurement, responsible purchasing, etc.
Formalize priority actions to control energy consumption, reduce the carbon footprint, optimize the company's costs and promote environmental actions to your customers.

### Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE)/ Social Entrepreneurship

Since its creation in 2017, the SSE club has brought together 26 leading structures of the Social and Solidarity Economy with common values and principles: social utility, cooperation, local anchoring and adaptation to the needs of the territory and its inhabitants. They embody a wide range of fields of activity (communication, construction, reuse, sport/health, logistics, active mobility, etc.).

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
This SSE club was initiated, piloted and animated by Greater Dunkirk instituting a group dynamic focused on the economy. Cooperation between these actors has been strongly dynamic in recent months, with the emergence of significant collective projects:

Structuring of a new PMCB (extended producer responsibility of building construction products and materials) EPR sector called "BTP Progr'ESS" from cleaning to reuse
A local collective support system "integration project workshop" towards Integration Company
The creation of a "better food for all" consortium
The new "TIMS" eco-mobility project
The project to create a concierge service in the city center of Dunkirk or the project to create a second-hand shopping center in the area.

To give a boost in terms of social innovation in its territory, Greater Dunkirk launched a new call for Social and Solidarity Economy projects in 2024 to encourage this mode of entrepreneurship which combines economic activity and the search for a social and environmental impact.

Three projects have been selected for a total amount of subsidies of 25,000€ in the operating section and 30,000€ in investment. These are for example Cargo Elan and DK Clean up. They will also be able to benefit from technical support via La Turbine.

Cargo Elan : Cycling logistics operator in Dunkirk
Dk Clean Up : Founded in 2019, DK Clean Up is committed to cleaning up the beaches and natural environments of the Dunkirk area by fighting plastic pollution. Their mission is based on three fundamental pillars: raising awareness to reduce plastic at source, collection actions that enable us to take concrete action on the ground, and recycling waste.

## Repair Cafés and Sharing Economy

Nine "repair cafés" have been set up in the Greater Dunkirk area, with the aim of reducing waste, reusing materials, helping households with financial difficulties and strengthening social links. The initiative is part of the eco-winning program set up by Greater Dunkirk.

The service is overseen by the Greater Dunkirk administration, with an associated organization responsible for managing repairs.

## Development of blue economy and marine conservation

In 2023, the Côte d'Opale Metropolitan Area (PMCO) established a Fisheries Local Action Group (FLAG), supported by the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF). The aim of the FLAG is to fund projects related to marine conservation, fisheries, maritime employment, and coastal culture within its territory, including the coastal communities of Greater Dunkirk. A dedicated full-time resource assists local stakeholders in developing and submitting project proposals to access these funds.

Four projects have already been approved:

A climate and environmental awareness initiative by CPIE.
A study by the local university assessing microplastic concentrations in Dunkirk's waters.
A program to professionalize young people in maritime careers.
A culinary project focused on local fish and shellfish species.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
Intergenerational project, Alliance project

As part of the urban renewal project in the Banc Vert district of Dunkirk, the city has decided to build a new, innovative multi-purpose building. This unique space will bring together two primary schools, a community center, a central kitchen, and a school cafeteria, creating a shared living and learning space for all residents of the district, young and old.

The originality of this project lies in the design of a common space where the various educational and social actors can collaborate closely. The aim is to promote academic success, to promote lifelong learning, and to actively involve the local community in the life of the district.

This ambitious project addresses several major challenges:

Create a place of life and fulfillment where everyone can emancipate themselves and become an active citizen.
Implement the principles of the educational city by strengthening the role of the school, ensuring educational continuity outside of school hours, and involving a wide network of educational partners.
Build a building adapted to the needs of a dynamic and evolving educational community.
Create a facility that is complementary to the existing offer in the district, while meeting local specificities.

This project is part of an ambitious environmental approach, aiming to limit its impact on the environment and promote sustainable development:

E3C1 certification: The building is E3C1 certified, guaranteeing high energy and environmental performance.
Zero endocrine disruptors: The materials used were selected to avoid any endocrine disruptors, substances harmful to health.
Compactness: Thanks to an optimization of the program, the surface of the equipment has been significantly reduced, going from 5,000 m² to 3,500 m², thus limiting its ecological footprint.
Reduction of carbon footprint: Measures will be implemented to minimize GHG emissions throughout the building's life cycle.
Flexibility: The project is designed to be adaptable and evolvable, to meet future needs and changes in use.
Life cycle analysis: An in-depth study of the building's environmental impact will be carried out, from its construction to its demolition.
Ecological materials: Biosourced and recycled materials were favored in construction, thus reducing the use of natural resources.
Reuse: The reuse of existing materials was be considered wherever possible.

Another benefit of this social innovation lies in its consultative approach. Such significant changes naturally raise many questions. To address this, we implemented several strategies:

Seminars: Fostering understanding and collaboration among employees from different structures within the alliance.
Design Thinking: Ensuring diverse perspectives are considered and valued.
Benchmarking: Leveraging external knowledge to inform decision-making.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
However, a major challenge was the high turnover within the co-construction committee during the project's five-year development phase.

A key improvement in this project with a cafeteria is the use of artificial intelligence to monitor food waste. Dunkirk received the Innovative Cities award at the recent International Summit on Innovation in Medium-Sized Cities in Quebec, thanks to its pioneering connected school cafeteria project. The project aims to cut down on food waste and provide healthier meals for children. New software helps staff manage schedules, tasks, and issues more efficiently, optimizes inventory management, tracks food products, and mitigates health risks. It also minimizes waste and food scraps.

## Citizen Science and Coastal Monitoring

The Coast Snap system is a technique for monitoring the coastline using participatory science and photographic monitoring. It involves the installation of poles topped by a base from which a mobile phone can be placed and a photograph taken of a specific location. The post and base are positioned and oriented to capture a particular location, such as a beach or a coastline protection structure. Citizens are then invited to take photos using this base and send them to one of the many possible computer platforms so that they can be sorted and processed. Two stations have been deployed in the Dunkirk area: at Digue des Alliés (12/2022) and at Zuydcoote (01/2023). The system is funded by the PMCO, as part of its coastal monitoring contract with GEODUNES, and by Greater Dunkirk. Between January 2023 and October 2024, almost 1,000 photos have already been taken, making it possible to trace the evolution of the two sites over the months.

## Climate education and awareness

Greater Dunkirk launched a call for projects to support eco-friendly educational initiatives on the territory. The goal is to promote sustainable living and involve residents in environmental projects. Projects could focus on areas like climate change, biodiversity, and waste reduction.

# Overall, the projects aim to:

Educate the public about environmental issues.
Promote sustainable practices.
Encourage community involvement.
Foster creativity and innovation.

# Training

Faced with a profound energy and industrial transition, our region is innovating to support its inhabitants towards sustainable jobs.

By creating local information networks and offering appropriate training (spaces for 20,000 jobs: places for discussion with citizens on current future professions, retraining or return to the job market), we aim to facilitate access to promising jobs, while raising awareness of the impact of each profession on the climate.

The objective here is for the inhabitants to be able to project themselves on the territory, with a presentation of the positions, training, and quality of life (mobility in the territory, childcare, etc.)

Thanks to tools such as the "sustainable employment fresco" and detailed job descriptions (with a score that presents the impact of the job on the climate), Greater Dunkirk helps job seekers to make informed choices and to project themselves into retraining paths.

The dynamic within this department is also to raise awareness among the youngest through interactive interventions in the schools, allowing them to react and creating a dialogue.

Indeed, the ecological and energy transition is impacting the skills sought. The skills and knowledge expected are different from what the territory has been offering for decades. It is therefore necessary to refine the data to support the academic world and training in the adaptation of skills.

In partnership with education and research stakeholders, we are developing new training courses (ULCO C-DéCIDé project) and creating an ecosystem conducive to the emergence of key skills for the jobs of tomorrow.

By participating in national events such as the Produrable fair, where Greater Dunkirk was awarded the "Talents for the planet" award, we highlight local initiatives and inspire new vocations. Our goal? That everyone can find their place in a changing world, contributing to a more sustainable future.

To reach the audience targeted, young people, Greater Dunkirk has developed "La Fabuleuse Factory". It is a free, interactive, and family-friendly event organized by ÉcosystèmeD over four days. Its aim is to explore the decarbonized industry, its impact on air quality, and the jobs of the future.

Resembling a mini-City of Science and Industry, the event offers an immersive experience for all audiences, regardless of age or educational level. It is neither an exhibition, a trade show, nor a forum, but a fun and educational discovery of the industry of tomorrow and its influence on our daily lives.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
Through four domes and a tent, visitors are able to:

Understand the challenges of global warming (Dunkirk accounts for 21% of France's industrial CO₂ emissions).
Discover new industrial jobs, short supply chains, and improvements in air quality.
Interact with professionals, observe cutting-edge tools of Industry 4.0 (including a mobile robotic production line).
Participate in interactive activities: quizzes, tests, hands-on experiments, fun experiences, and mini conferences to learn, test, play, and exchange ideas.
Immerse themselves in the jobs of the future through virtual reality headsets and films.
Discover digital jobs and the importance of women and learning in industry.

In summary, "La Fabuleuse Factory" offers a unique opportunity to understand the industry of the 21st century, its challenges, and its opportunities, in an interactive and accessible way for all.

Thoses dynamics present an opportunity to explore the development of an awareness project on ecological transition in Dunkirk training programs. Here is a list of ideas aligned with the same objectives.

&gt; 1. Integrating Active Mobility on Training Institution Websites

Interactive Maps: Create detailed maps on each institution's website, indicating cycling routes, self-service bike stations, bus stops, and secure bike parking.
Practical Advice: Offer personalized advice based on transports modes (routes, travel time, etc.) and encourage the use of carbon footprint calculators to raise awareness of the impact of each mode of transport.
Partnerships with Local Authorities: Collaborate with Greater Dunkirk to promote local active mobility initiatives and facilitate access to information.

&gt; 2. Creating Personalized Communication Materials

Co-construction Workshops: Organize workshops bringing together teachers, employment stakeholders, and Greater Dunkirk representatives to co-construct communication materials tailored to each training program.
Diverse Materials: Offer a variety of materials (posters, videos, infographics, interactive quizzes) to reach all audiences and encourage engagement.
Addressed Themes:

Link between training and ecological transition: Show how the skills acquired during training can contribute to the energy transition.
Citizenship: Emphasize the importance of civic engagement for a sustainable future.
Concrete actions: Suggest examples of actions to implement daily (sorting, eco-gestures, etc.).

Adapting to the audience: Personalize messages according to the specificities of each audience (young people, adults in retraining, etc.).

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
&gt; 3. Integrating Energy Renovation into Training Programs

Partnerships with Vocational Training Centers: Collaborate with the new vocational training center to develop training modules dedicated to energy renovation, highlighting biosourced materials such as flax.
Site visits: Organize visits to renovation sites to allow apprentices to discover the techniques and materials used.
Skills valorization: Highlight the skills acquired by apprentices in energy renovation to facilitate their professional integration.

&gt; 4. Mobilizing Funding

European funds: Explore funding opportunities at the European level (European Social Fund, European Regional Development Fund).
Partnerships with companies: Mobilize companies in the construction sector to co-finance training actions.

&gt; 5. Monitoring and Evaluation

Performance indicators: Define indicators to measure the impact of the implemented actions (number of people sensitized, reduction of the carbon footprint, etc.).
Satisfaction surveys: Conduct surveys among learners and trainers to gather their feedback and improve actions.

## Skill retraining and upskilling

&gt; The Dunkirk Pact for Education:

Dunkirk is facing several challenges: a declining population, a high rate of young people without qualifications, and a mismatch between education and the needs of the job market.

Signed in September 2022, this pact brings together many actors (government, local authorities, universities, companies) around a common objective: to improve the educational and professional success of young people in the region.

&gt; Main objectives:

Coordination of actions: Implement effective governance to better manage projects and measure results.
Develop an adapted training offer: Anticipate the needs of the job market, promote apprenticeships and offer innovative training, particularly in the field of energy transition.
Improving guidance: Better informing young people and their families about the different educational pathways, developing innovative guidance tools and strengthening links between schools, businesses and local authorities.
Supporting families: Offering parental support and strengthening cooperation between families and schools.
Promote mobility and openness to the world: Allow young people to discover new horizons and develop their skills.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
&gt; Leverage Points:

Innovation in guidance: Creating a real local career guidance ecosystem.
Develop a diversified training offer: Better meet the needs of companies and promote apprenticeships.
Strengthening the level of education from an early age: Supporting families and students, particularly through the Cordées de la Réussite programme.

This pact is a model for other territories. It demonstrates that close collaboration between all stakeholders can significantly improve the educational and professional success of young people.

## Circular economy initiatives

Industrial and Territorial Ecology (EIT): A lever for a circular economy in Dunkirk

Industrial and Territorial Ecology is an innovative approach that aims to optimize the use of resources within a territory. By promoting synergies between economic actors (companies, local authorities, associations), the EIT reduces waste, consumes less energy and makes the most of local resources.

## How does it work?

Win-win synergies: The EIT facilitates exchanges between the actors of a territory. For example, a company can recycle its waste by supplying it to another company as a raw material.
Shared services: By sharing infrastructure, equipment or services, players reduce their costs and environmental impact.
A territorial approach: The EIT is part of a global approach, considering the specificities of each territory.

## ECOPAL, the EIT partner in Dunkirk

ECOPAL is an association that supports companies and communities in the Dunkirk region in their transition to a circular economy. ECOPAL brings together a network of 110 diverse member organisations (local authorities, SSE players, companies of all sizes, etc.).

### 1. Missions:

Raising awareness and informing: Organising events, workshops and trainings to raise awareness of the EIT's challenges.
Accompanying: Carrying out waste diagnostics, personalised advice and tools to implement EIT projects.
Network: Federate local actors and facilitate exchanges between them.

### 2. Concrete actions:

Shared collections: Organisation of joint waste collections to reduce costs and environmental impacts.
Synergy workshops: Facilitation of workshops to identify opportunities for waste recovery and pooling of resources.
Project support: Helping companies develop circular economy projects and find financing.

## Industrial heritage tourism

&gt; Reviving the industry-citizen link: an immersion in the heart of industry

In a context where proximity to companies is increasingly sought, opening the doors of factories to residents has become a major challenge. This initiative not only strengthens the link between companies and the region, but also promotes local know-how and encourages new vocations.

# A new look at the industry

By allowing the public to go behind the scenes of production, companies offer a more transparent and human image.

Guided tours are an opportunity to:

Highlight environmental and social approaches: Many companies are committed to reducing their impact on the environment and contributing to the sustainable development of the territory.
Promoting industrial professions: By revealing the skills required and technological developments, the visits arouse interest in professions that are often unknown.
Create social links: Exchanges between visitors and employees promote better mutual understanding and strengthen the feeling of belonging to a territory.

A flagship event, the Fabulous Visits: Organized since November 2024, this event has already been a great success, with more than 630 visitors discovering the backstage of 31 companies. This is a great opportunity for businesses to gain exposure and for locals to better understand local economic activity.

Tailor-made support: To facilitate the organization of these visits, the tourist office offers personalised support to companies. The teams listen to the needs of each structure to help them define their visit route and set up effective communication.

# Examples of participating companies

The industrial companies, known as emitters, in the territory are implementing technical and financial means to limit their ecological impact. Through these steps, they set an example while showing citizens during these company visits that this is happening at all levels. Many industries in the territory have launched work and procedures in this direction.

The initiatives presented are proof of the commitment of local actors to a successful ecological transition. Whether it's the municipal swimming pool, which prides itself on its reinforced insulation, the public transport network opting for clean vehicles, or the postal service favouring low-carbon delivery methods, all these structures are committed to innovating and reducing their environmental impact. Opening their doors is another way to discuss with the users of the structures/services, strengthening their proximity to the citizens.

# Solidarity Foundation of Dunkirk

To enable residents, associations, and businesses to work together, concretely and innovatively, for the social and human development of the Dunkirk region, individuals from the associative world and the Dunkirk business community, along with Greater Dunkirk, joined forces in November 2016 to create the Fondation du Dunkerquois Solidaire (Solidarity Foundation of Dunkirk).

By taking advantage of tax relief mechanisms benefiting the territory, the Fondation du Dunkerquois Solidaire aims to break down barriers between public and private actors, large companies, SMEs, social entrepreneurs, associations, local authorities, and residents. Its mission is to combat exclusion, discrimination, and poverty. It works to promote territorial solidarity, social innovation, popular culture and education, sustainable development, and youth. It implements innovative programs for access to employment, the fight against unemployment and poverty, by fostering cooperation between public and private actors: "Dunkerquois Solidaire pour l'Emploi" (Dunkirk Solidarity for Employment) and "Dunkerquois Solidaire pour la Jeunesse" (Dunkirk Solidarity for Youth).
The "Dunkerquois Solidaire pour l'Emploi" program mobilizes territorial solidarity to create and finance, for three years, social utility jobs in associations in Greater Dunkirk area. Associations must be the bearers of social utility projects that create social ties, are accessible to the most disadvantaged, and meet an unmet collective need. These jobs are intended for people who have been unemployed for at least two years. Through this program, the Fondation du Dunkerquois Solidaire also aims to experiment with the implementation of innovative integration pathways with the support of a network of citizen and solidarity-based companies. Since the foundation's creation, 15 projects have been supported, and 20 people have benefited from jobs funded by the foundation.

The "Dunkerquois Solidaire pour la Jeunesse" program was launched with the Break Poverty Foundation. Its objective is to support innovative solutions to youth poverty by acting on three axes:

support for early childhood,
the fight against school dropout,
and access to first employment.

After conducting a needs assessment, the Fondation du Dunkerquois Solidaire has selected associative projects that address the identified issues. These projects will support more than 3,000 young people in Greater Dunkirk over three years by mobilizing territorial solidarity once again.

# 5. Outlook and next steps

The windswept shores of Dunkirk, once a battleground for survival, now face a different kind of fight: the fight against climate change. But unlike the desperate struggle of the past, this battle is being waged with a spirit of collaboration and innovation.

The city, steeped in a history of industry and resilience, is embracing its role as a pioneer in decarbonization. A palpable sense of urgency and a growing awareness of the climate crisis have permeated the community. This shared understanding, coupled with a long-standing tradition of cooperation among local stakeholders – the port, industrial giants like ArcelorMittal, and the vibrant community itself – has fostered a fertile ground for climate action.

## Key Strengths &amp; Local Context:

**High Climate Awareness**: A strong local understanding of climate issues and the urgency of reducing GHG emissions fosters a receptive environment for climate action.
**Collaborative Spirit**: A long-standing tradition of collaboration, particularly within the port and regional stakeholders, facilitates efficient information sharing, idea exchange, and accelerated decision-making.
**Innovative Climate Action**: Successful past initiatives, such as free public transport services and eco-solidarity water pricing, implemented through public service delegations, demonstrate a proven track record of innovative climate action.
**Engaged Stakeholders**: Active engagement from local municipalities, with numerous employees acting as internal ambassadors for decarbonization, strengthens the initiative.
**Industrial Leadership**: Major industrial companies, recognizing the imperative of carbon neutrality, are key stakeholders. Fostering collaboration between residential and industrial sectors is crucial, with initiatives like "factories without parking lots" serving as prime examples.

At the heart of this ambitious endeavor lies the Climate City Contract (CCC), a roadmap guiding Greater Dunkirk towards a sustainable future. More than just a document, the CCC is a living testament to the city's commitment to a greener tomorrow.

The CCC is not merely a theoretical framework; it's a practical guide to action, a blueprint for a city-wide transformation. It emphasizes the importance of:

**Forging Strong Partnerships**: Actively engaging a diverse range of stakeholders, including municipalities, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI), the Port Authority, businesses of all sizes, NGOs, and citizens. This requires fostering open dialogue, building trust, and ensuring that all voices are heard.
**Leveraging External Support**: Utilizing the resources and expertise of the NetZeroCities initiative to accelerate the implementation of existing actions and foster the development of innovative projects. This includes accessing funding opportunities, sharing best practices with other cities, and benefiting from expert guidance.
**Developing Collaborative Solutions**: Establishing thematic working groups comprising representatives from diverse stakeholder groups to develop tailored solutions for specific challenges. These groups, focusing on areas such as renewable energy, sustainable transportation, and circular economy, will foster co-creation and ensure that the solutions are locally relevant and effective.
**Enhancing Communication &amp; Awareness**: Developing and implementing targeted communication campaigns to raise awareness about climate change, the CCC, and the importance of citizen engagement. This includes utilizing public education channels, such as schools, community centers, and libraries, to disseminate information and promote climate action initiatives.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
Prioritizing Actions &amp; Monitoring Progress: Utilizing robust data collection and monitoring systems to track progress, identify areas for improvement, and inform decision-making. This involves establishing clear and measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track the effectiveness of CCC actions and measure progress towards carbon neutrality targets.

Quantifying and Communicating Benefits: Conducting comprehensive assessments to quantify the economic and social benefits of decarbonization measures, including job creation, improved air quality, and enhanced quality of life. Effectively communicating these benefits to stakeholders, including businesses, investors, and the public, is crucial for building support and maintaining momentum.

The focus extends beyond the city limits, seeking to harmonize industrial and residential decarbonization efforts. Initiatives like "factories without parking lots" exemplify this commitment to a holistic approach, demonstrating how innovation can bridge the gap between urban and industrial needs, creating a win-win scenario for both the environment and the economy.

&gt; Dunkirk in the spotlight at the Osaka World Expo as a model of decarbonization. Dunkirk has been chosen for its status as a decarbonization laboratory and Europe's leading energy platform, as the theme of the expo this year is "Designing the society of the future, imagining our life tomorrow." World Expos, held every five years, are an opportunity for countries around the world to showcase their know-how, innovations, and traditions. For two days, from May 16 to 18, 2025, events focused on Dunkirk will be organized at the French pavilion, grouped under the brand "Spirit of Dunkirk," a reference to the Second World War. "Cutting-edge and high-tech aspects are the main themes of the exhibition, and Greater Dunkirk is moving towards this technological, ecological innovation, it fits together very well," explains Makita Shimokawa, the Japanese ambassador to France.

The journey, however, is not without its challenges. The rapid economic growth spurred by new industrial developments, including the establishment of Verkor's gigafactory, presents both opportunities and obstacles. The CCC must constantly adapt, ensuring that economic progress does not come at the expense of environmental sustainability.

But Dunkirk, a city forged in the fires of adversity, is no stranger to overcoming challenges. With the support of the NetZeroCities initiative, the unwavering commitment of its citizens, and the collaborative spirit that defines its community, the Greater Dunkirk is poised to navigate these complexities and emerge as a beacon of hope in the fight against climate change.

&gt; The CCC action plan will prioritize several key areas.

First and foremost, the city will accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources. Imagine a Dunkirk powered by the sun and the wind. This vision will be realized through a concerted effort to increase the deployment of solar panels, harnessing the power of the sun, and expanding wind energy generation, tapping into the region's natural resources.

Beyond generating clean energy, the city will focus on improving energy efficiency across all sectors. This will involve initiatives such as retrofitting buildings to enhance insulation and reduce energy consumption, promoting the use of energy-efficient appliances, and optimizing industrial processes to minimize energy waste.

Furthermore, the city will invest in smart grid technologies, creating a more intelligent and responsive energy system. These smart grids will optimize energy distribution, seamlessly integrate renewable energy sources, and ensure a reliable and resilient energy supply for all residents and businesses.

Secondly, the city will prioritize sustainable transportation. Imagine a Dunkirk where cycling and walking are safe and enjoyable, where public transport is efficient and accessible, and where electric vehicles seamlessly integrate into the urban landscape. This vision will be achieved by encouraging active transportation through improved infrastructure, such as dedicated bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly streets. The city will also actively promote the adoption of electric vehicles by expanding charging infrastructure and implementing attractive incentives.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan | Climate Neutrality Action Plan - Greater Dunkirk
Moreover, the city will work to optimize logistics and freight transport, exploring options such as electric trucks, optimized delivery routes, and the consolidation of freight shipments to reduce emissions and improve efficiency.

**Thirdly, the city will embrace the principles of the circular economy.** Imagine a Dunkirk where waste is minimized, resources are maximized, and sustainable consumption is the norm. This vision will be realized through the implementation of comprehensive waste management strategies, including improved recycling programs and initiatives to reduce waste at the source.

The city will actively encourage sustainable consumption patterns through awareness campaigns, consumer education programs, and incentives for sustainable choices.

Furthermore, maximizing the reuse and repurposing of materials will be a key focus, minimizing waste and conserving valuable resources.

**Finally, the city will prioritize climate change adaptation.** Imagine a Dunkirk that is resilient to the impacts of climate change, prepared for the challenges of rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and rising temperatures.

The city will implement measures to increase resilience, such as coastal protection measures, flood mitigation strategies, and the development of early warning systems.

Protecting and restoring natural ecosystems, such as coastal wetlands and forests, will be crucial. These ecosystems play a vital role in carbon sequestration, flood protection, and biodiversity conservation, enhancing the city's overall resilience.

This multi-faceted approach will guide Greater Dunkirk journey towards a sustainable and climate-resilient future, creating a city that is not only environmentally conscious but also economically prosperous and socially equitable.

The CCC is more than just a plan; it's a story still unfolding. It's a story of collaboration, innovation, and resilience, a story of a city determined to shape a brighter future for generations to come. It's a story of Greater Dunkirk rising to the challenge, not just surviving, but thriving in the face of climate change.

The Greater Dunkirk area is now clearly recognised at both national and international levels as a model territory for ecological and energy transition, as well as for carbon-free reindustrialization. This is the result of the convictions and values shared by the stakeholders of our coastal region and the benefits of a strategy that we have collectively implemented over the past 10 years.

A few months ago, the World Economic Forum selected us among 20 sites worldwide to illustrate "the territories that are saving the planet."

Dunkirk, a polder territory long exposed to climate risks, must take the lead in the fight against global warming. It is essential. This is the challenge of the 21st century that we must meet.

## This recognition honors and obliges us.

## Climate change is accelerating. We, too, must accelerate!

We had the immense honor of being selected by the European Union for its NetZeroCities program, which aims to support "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030."

In this context, we are working on the implementation of a climate contract.

Our objective is simple: to take advantage of this opportunity to do better, faster, by involving even more stakeholders in our actions.

The Dunkirk area is unique in that it thrives in symbiosis with major industrial sites, a large port, and one of the leading energy platforms in Europe.

Therefore, we must innovate, change, transform, and imagine new paths—whether through the exploration of new industrial sectors, new energy solutions, or by bringing our 200,000 residents into this daily revolution and ensuring that they are the primary beneficiaries.

In this sense, decarbonization is the ideal triptych that reconciles economic development, the management of the climate crisis, and the environmental challenges of the region.

It is about building both the economy and the city of the 21st century.

Here in Dunkirk, we certainly think about the positive effects that this drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will have on the quality of life for our population.

This ongoing decarbonization, a driving force behind a new development model, permeates all of our public policies, from resource management to housing and education.

Our collective efforts have enabled us to secure new engineering programs and the recognition of our university as the national leader in training for the new industrial decarbonization sectors.

Dunkirk, the European capital of free public transport, is also innovating in terms of decarbonized mobility and is betting on new factories without parking lots!

These commitments are at the heart of our "Climate City Contract" that the CUD (Greater Dunkirk area council) is advancing with the European Union, in collaboration with the Grand Port Maritime (seaport), the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, all economic and institutional stakeholders, as well as our associations and residents—everyone who forms our Dunkirk ecosystem. This "EcosytèmeD" has given its name to our working collective and to a facility dedicated to our new decarbonized development model, which we are inaugurating in this 2024 fall season.

Here, we are ready—ready to work together, ready to commit to the future of our territory, its residents, and its children, ready to put all our efforts into the fight to contribute, at our scale, to preserving our planet and our climate. We are ready to aim for carbon neutrality by 2030 for our agglomeration and by 2050 for our industrial platform.

In my view, this ambition only makes sense if it is shared by the 200,000 inhabitants of our territory. This civic and democratic dimension is at the heart of my commitment.

# 1. Introduction

Our decision to join the EU Mission and develop a Climate City Contract is rooted in a steadfast commitment to combating the climate crisis and enhancing our citizens' quality of life. We acknowledge the urgent need for action and believe cities are instrumental in achieving climate neutrality.

By participating in the Mission, we aim to:

» Accelerate our transition to climate neutrality: Leveraging the EU Mission's framework, resources, and expertise to expedite our ambitious climate goals.
» Enhance our city's resilience: Fortifying our city's capacity to adapt to the significant challenges posed by climate change through a Climate City Contract.
» Drive innovation and economic growth: Stimulating business, job creation, and sustainable development through investments in climate action.
» Engage citizens and stakeholders: Fostering collaboration and co-creation through the Climate City Contract to involve our community in shaping the city's future.
» Learn from other cities: Sharing knowledge and best practices with fellow cities confronting similar challenges through Mission participation.

We are confident that joining the EU Mission and developing a Climate City Contract is a strategic decision that will position our city as a leader in sustainable urban development.

Building upon its previous achievements and strategic focus on industrial decarbonization, the region has amplified its ambitions. As a laureate of the first «low-carbon industrial zones» project call, Greater Dunkirk has implemented numerous concrete actions: improving air quality, expanding public and active transportation, optimizing waste management, and deploying new energy sources. These initiatives, undertaken in close collaboration with local stakeholders, contribute to enhancing the region's attractiveness, improving residents' quality of life, and safeguarding the environment for future generations.

Greater Dunkirk, while driving economic growth, is deeply committed to enhancing residents' quality of life. The CCC label aligns perfectly with this approach, reinforcing a decade-long commitment to making climate change a central focus of our public policies and fully involving citizens in this transition.

Greater Dunkirk has established ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. Our dedication to sustainable development is evident in various initiatives such as renewable energy development, public transportation investments, and waste management strategies.

The economic development of Greater Dunkirk has evolved since the EoI application was submitted, leading to a divergence from the initial vision.

The EU Mission presents a unique opportunity to accelerate our efforts and amplify our impact.
By joining the Mission, we can:

**Leverage additional resources**: Scale up existing projects and explore new decarbonization avenues through access to EU funding and expertise.
**Strengthen our partnerships**: Foster knowledge exchange and innovation by collaborating with other cities and stakeholders.
**Enhance our city’s reputation**: Position Greater Dunkirk as a leader in sustainable urban development, attracting investment and talent.
**Involve citizens more actively**: Deepen citizen engagement and build a shared vision for a sustainable future through the Mission’s emphasis on co-creation.

Ultimately, the EU Mission provides a platform to solidify our position as a resilient and climate-neutral city while enhancing our citizens’ quality of life

## 2. Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

### Greater Dunkirk: Naturally Committed to Carbon Neutrality

To fully understand the broad and deep commitment of Greater Dunkirk and its inhabitants to decarbonization, several contextual elements must be considered.

**Historical Context** Dunkirk has a particularly turbulent history, from a territory reclaimed from the sea (Dunkirk means «church in the dune») to a besieged corsair city and a city 90% destroyed during the Second World War. For this reason, it is often associated with the word resilience, reminiscent of the «spirit of Dunkirk» from Operation Dynamo. Today, its new challenge is decarbonization.

**Social Context** Today, Greater Dunkirk is often talked about in terms of the ecological transition or industrial renewal; but Greater Dunkirk also returns each year to the media for its famous carnival, which dates to the departure of sailors for fishing in Iceland. At the carnival, people stand shoulder to shoulder, and in the lines of the «band of fishermen», the docker rubs shoulders with the boss, the worker, the doctor... This is probably why, in Greater Dunkirk, social relations are both more complex and easier; people talk to each other, they exchange ideas, and the groups formed are not necessarily those one would imagine... Similarly, there is a sense of sharing. In Greater Dunkirk, for example, sports or cultural activities are offered at affordable prices; a way of redistributing the wealth of the industrial settlements of the second half of the 20th century. To understand Greater Dunkirk, one must integrate this very strong proximity and solidarity between its inhabitants.

**Economic Context** It is fluctuating; with golden ages like «steelmaking» on the water and periods of recession when refineries close and the territory loses a massive number of inhabitants; but for more than 100 years, it has been intimately linked to industry (today, 22% of direct jobs but also 21% of French industrial GHG emissions and more than 15 sites classified Seveso)... This explains, on the part of the population, an acceptance of risk but also an awareness of the issues: safety, carbon, air quality...

**Geographical Context** Greater Dunkirk is a coastal area built on a polder and a large part of its territory is located below sea level. This generates different types of vulnerabilities:

The vulnerability of the coastline to the risk of flooding;
The vulnerability of the polder area to inland flooding (existing vulnerability but accentuated by the probable rise in sea level);
The vulnerability of natural environments and various infrastructures to changes in temperature and water conditions... However, by 2100, Greater Dunkirk should experience, if nothing is done for the climate (compared to a reference period of 1976-2005):
an increase in average annual temperatures of 0.9°C to 3.4°C;
a decrease of 6 to 19 frost days per year
an increase of 3 to 43 heatwave days
an increase of 1 to 22 tropical nights per year
a variation of +10 mm to -55 mm of summer rainfall.

# Greater Dunkirk’s Zero Carbon Ambition

In summary, the stakeholders of the territory have collectively observed that:

Greater Dunkirk is particularly vulnerable to climate risk;
Its highly emitting industry was declining, leading to job losses and, consequently, a loss of inhabitants.

At the initiative of the Greater Dunkirk, the territory came together and mobilized to «imagine» the future, starting, for example, with a very broad consultation «changing life together» for the inhabitants, or the creation of a «CO₂ group» in connection with companies, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Port.

It was quickly realized that the main challenge of the coming years is the climate. This implies that we cannot continue to live, consume, and produce in the same way as today; it is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and, more globally, our impacts on the environment.

Thus, two axes have been developed in parallel:

Decarbonizing our existing industry and imagining and developing the industry of the future.
Decarbonizing our living environment through innovation but also by mobilizing a wide range of stakeholders in the territory, particularly the inhabitants. These strategic choices made over the past ten years are nevertheless part of a continuity since Greater Dunkirk, a large energy platform, was among the first territories to mobilize in favor of the climate, transitions, and, in particular, the energy transition. The Greater Dunkirk thus created, in 1999, the «Energy Summits» which became «European Summits of the Energy Transition».

## Living environment and industrial zone, two complementary challenges

As mentioned, the Greater Dunkirk is the leading industrial CO₂ emitter in France (21%); very significant efforts are being undertaken by industries, the territory, France, and Europe to decarbonize these sites; the objective is to achieve neutrality by 2050; this is why the «Mission Zero» contract for Greater Dunkirk could not integrate the industrial platform. This does not mean that there are no links between the decarbonization of the living environment and that of its industrial sites. On the contrary. A structure named EcosystèmeD was even created to promote partnerships, innovations, links... It brings together Greater Dunkirk, the Grand Port Maritime, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Littoral, large industrial groups and various associations and networks. The idea is simple: the actions and ideas of some promote the ideas and actions of others. This is how the idea of «factories without parking» was born. Since Greater Dunkirk will be creating new and important industrial sites in the coming years, it is better if they are virtuous and that their activity does not generate new CO₂ emissions; this is true for processes; it is also true for the travel of employees of these factories.

## NetZeroCities: Accelerating Greater Dunkirk’s Transition

In Greater Dunkirk, preserving the climate has been a major and widely shared concern for a long time, both to protect and prepare for the future and to improve the quality of life for everyone. Indeed, improving air quality, for example, is a fundamental issue for the urban area and the health of its inhabitants.

As mentioned, for ten years, the territory has made decarbonization a major issue and the priority axis of its action.

It should also be noted the strength and commitment of the public authorities, and particularly the local authority.

Many of the actions carried out in the territory are thus created, from the outset, in a concerted manner and with broad support, even when it is provided by a private company. It should be noted that all public service delegates for water, public transport, and waste have implemented major innovations for their activity in Greater Dunkirk: free buses, eco-solidarity water rates, or even robot sorting of waste bags. But this is true in other areas and there are many calls for projects leading to financial and skills support for start-ups, for the social and solidarity economy, for groups of citizens in connection with social landlords (for energy savings, the creation of natural spaces...).

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments | Climate Neutrality Commitments of Greater Dunkirk
And it is quite naturally that the urban area has committed itself, around a broad political consensus with all the municipalities of the urban area, in the Mission of European Cities, in favor of a just ecological transition to combat climate change.

This candidacy of climate-neutral cities has acted, in Greater Dunkirk, as a real trigger to further strengthen and accelerate the transformation and, thus, to keep its «head start» to mitigate and adapt to the climate emergency.

## The territory has clear ambitions:

A «net zero» territory by 2030 (excluding the industrial zone);
Better air quality;
More equity, wealth sharing, and social justice;
Increased attractiveness and quality of life;
Better-preserved natural spaces.

This is how the urban area is building its roadmap to achieve carbon neutrality, the ecological and energy transition by committing to involving a wide range of actors (private sector, academic world, civil society, citizens, and media as well as the different levels of government) and by encouraging and strengthening collective actions, particularly with citizens.

Of course, the Greater Dunkirk urban area has also committed to sharing and transferring the learning and knowledge acquired with the rest of the cities of Europe.

In the actions carried out in Greater Dunkirk, we can distinguish three phases:

Before the NetZeroCities candidacy
During the time of drafting the contract
The ambitions for the future displayed in the contract

## Phase 1

Implementation of innovative actions mainly by Greater Dunkirk:

Free buses
Eco-solidarity water pricing
Eco-bonus scheme
Validation of a SEAP recognized by the State as particularly ambitious and co-constructed with numerous partners

## Phase 2

Launch of the 200,000 trees plan
Deployment and strengthening of the eco-bonus scheme including bonuses for housing transformations
Launch of the «factories without parking» reflection
Creation of Ecosystème D to coordinate industrial and territorial decarbonization and launch, within this framework, of the «social conference», a time for formal and regular exchange with the stakeholders of the territory
Launch of the «NetZeroCities» consultation
Deployment of awareness and information actions for stakeholders (exchange session with institution staff, stands at major events in the territory such as the village of the future, fabulous factory, Gigapuces...)

## Phase 3 (to come)

Study for the integration of private partners in the 200,000 trees plan and to offer residents and actors support to plant trees on their land;

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments | Climate Neutrality Commitments of Greater Dunkirk
&gt; Setting up a specific working group «factory without parking» and launching a line between Greater Dunkirk station and the new industrial sites;
&gt; Desire to create a co-mission zero associating representatives of all actors involved in decarbonization;
&gt; Implementation of the Mission Zero roadmap

In essence, this text outlines Greater Dunkirk’s ambitious goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. The city has undertaken a variety of initiatives, from promoting sustainable transportation to supporting green businesses. The «NetZeroCities» initiative has served as a catalyst for further action, and the city is committed to sharing its knowledge and experiences with other European cities.

Building a «Climate City Contract» is an iterative, evolving process full of lessons. Each study, discussion or action carried out demonstrates the imperative need to implement the roadmap and enrich it on a daily basis.

**Accelerate!** In a context of renewed economic and tourist attractiveness, the roadmap and the actions implemented in recent years are no longer sufficient to achieve neutrality by 2030. New inhabitants, the need to build housing, and the increase in travel imply new emissions. It is therefore necessary to go faster and further by implementing new or reinforced actions.

**Main obstacles to overcome** In the Greater Dunkirk conurbation, significant efforts have been made or are underway to decarbonize energy production. Similarly, reflections and investments are being launched to reduce the impacts of industrial processes. Finally, local authorities have already started working on their own emissions and those of public services such as water, public transport, or waste collection. In all these areas, it is of course a matter of continuing the dynamics initiated and intensifying them. However, three main areas constitute key success factors. The first is habit: «we’ve always done it this way» which must be combated even when the people concerned are aware of the climate. This involves raising awareness, sharing, and mobilizing. The second is the design of the urban agglomeration. Greater Dunkirk and the adjacent cities are the result of reconstruction after the Second World War and are therefore mineral and designed around the individual car. It is therefore necessary to rethink and especially green these spaces. Finally, as mentioned, the new attractiveness of the territory implies new jobs (20,000 planned) and therefore new travel to the industrial zone. It is essential to imagine solutions so that these new trips do not offset the gains of the other sectors.

**Engage even more actors: industrialize decarbonization** Ultimately, the challenge is to industrialize decarbonization: to move from small individual actions to massive actions or actions carried out on a large scale. To this end, one of the axes of the contract and one of its challenges for the coming years is to involve more and more actors and sectors of activity in the approach.

**Decarbonization, a factor of social justice** This is the initial bet of Greater Dunkirk and its elected officials: the ecological transition must not be punitive but incentive-based and a vector of social justice. This is indeed the very principle of the «eco-winning» approach. But in recent years, the renewed economic attractiveness has further increased this requirement. It is necessary to redistribute, share wealth, and ensure that everyone benefits from new jobs, new housing, etc. This is the state of mind of the territory and of this contract.

The expected benefits of Mission Zero In Greater Dunkirk, we asked ourselves very early on whether decarbonization led to an improvement in air quality; and studies have shown that it does. We can therefore speak of «co-benefits» to decarbonize. But in the Greater Dunkirk context, we rather consider all of these benefits as a whole, a global objective that includes:

&gt; Better air quality
&gt; Better health
&gt; Better preservation of biodiversity
&gt; More green spaces
&gt; Better energy efficiency
&gt; More sobriety and circularity
&gt; Shorter circuits
&gt; Quality housing

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments | Climate Neutrality Commitments of Greater Dunkirk
Waste reduction and recycling
A peaceful city and alternative mobility solutions to the individual car
Adaptation of the territory to climate change
Responsible and virtuous economic development
More social justice. And of course, Greater Dunkirk wishes to take its full place in the great regional, national, European, and even global dynamic aimed at leaving a better world for our children by limiting the impact of humanity on the climate.

# 3. Strategic priorities

Aiming for neutrality by 2030 for the living area implies fighting on all fronts and mobilizing as many actors as possible. However, as mentioned, some actions have been launched and are already bringing benefits; and Greater Dunkirk wants to «industrialize» its decarbonization; it is therefore necessary to integrate new actions into the roadmap but also to create the conditions for adapting it according to the context. Thus, for example, in two years, the Greater Dunkirk territory has attracted 4 «gigafactories» linked to electric mobility; obviously, this impacts the organization of the living area, the state of mind of the inhabitants and the priorities for decarbonization.

Four «key priorities» have been defined.

# 1. Involvement of all and social justice: Eco-winner

Greater Dunkirk has launched, in continuity with the implementation of free public transport for everyone seven days a week, the eco-winner device. This is based on the same idea: encouraging inhabitants to adopt behaviors that are more virtuous for the environment (and therefore less $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-emitting) through an incentive in terms of purchasing power. Taking the bus for free limits the use of individual cars and saves on gasoline, car wear and tear, etc. This can even avoid buying a second vehicle for the household. Since then, this concept has been duplicated in many areas: energy renovation of housing, rainwater recovery, reduction of household waste, development of cycling... Since the start of work on the CCC, new actions have been imagined to go further in the same spirit, particularly on an essential subject in Greater Dunkirk: improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock. «Eco-housing» bonuses, free diagnostics have thus been put in place. Today, as part of the signing of the CCC, the project leaders are considering a broad consultation with all the stakeholders concerned (waste, transport, water, housing, biodiversity, agriculture, commerce, and industry) in order to finalize a simplified global «eco-winning» offer, covering all aspects of the daily lives of inhabitants and allowing everyone to live better, to gain purchasing power while reducing their impact on the environment.

It should be noted that this strategy is also based on a study conducted, in conjunction with the University of the Littoral Côte d'Opale, with 40 families called «eco-citizens»; a study that made it possible to define and analyze behaviors, to define priorities, to discover the best ways to explain and get people to adhere to the approach, and then to measure the qualitative impacts of the actions implemented.

This strategy is also based on large-scale communication campaigns implemented by the community to inform residents and explain the devices; the territory wishes to broaden this communication by relying on all its partners.

This strategy is above all based on the deployment, reorganization, and orientation of the three major «popular education» facilities in the territory, which are real places for exchanges with inhabitants and for raising awareness about sustainable development and, more specifically, decarbonization.

The first, the Halle aux sucres, is dedicated to the Sustainable City. The second, the PLUS, to science and technology and industrial decarbonization. The third, Biotopia, to biodiversity. These three facilities have been reoriented in the last two years towards decarbonization and the preservation of the natural and urban environment. Today, the goal is to go beyond and work together to set up real courses, interdisciplinary and inter-equipment cultural programs to put decarbonization at the heart of the debate throughout the territory. It should be noted that work is also being initiated so that the three facilities offer more and more «off-site» exhibitions or events to meet the public on the subject of carbon neutrality.

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments | Climate Neutrality Commitments of Greater Dunkirk
ADDED VALUE: This is an essential element of the Greater Dunkirk territory’s decarbonization strategy for three reasons:

It is based on the most emblematic action: free public transport, adopted by all (+125% frequency) and which is the pride of many inhabitants and part of the territory’s notoriety;
It mobilizes the greatest number – the inhabitants – around a gradual, gentle, concerted, shared, and positive change in behaviors;
It is a vector of social justice and redistribution.

## 2. Nature at the heart of life, at the heart of the city

As mentioned, the most urbanized part of the Greater Dunkirk, the result of reconstruction after the Second World War, is very mineral and leaves little room for nature in the city. During the consultations conducted for the development of the Local Urban Plan, the Air Climate Energy Plan, and more recently, for the implementation of the CCC, residents have expressed their demand for more nature in the city, and in particular for nearby green spaces. To meet this demand, the Urban Community has launched its «200,000 trees plan» which integrates different objectives:

Effectively revegetate the territory;
Create, as soon as possible, nearby green spaces
Modify urban planning to take space from the car and return it to the inhabitants;
Soothe the city
Preserve biodiversity and promote local species. This plan was launched following the candidacy to become a «NetZeroCity»; it is bearing fruit and nature is beginning to be more present in the city; some arteries have undergone spectacular transformations. But we need to go further. This is why different actions are being studied, such as:
Involving private partners in the approach;
Allowing residents to plant trees on their land (as part of the eco-bonus scheme?);
Associating associations for the preservation of natural spaces in the approach;
Conducting a specific consultation to determine priority areas to be green, renaturalized or made pedestrian.

ADDED VALUE: Here again, this action meets major challenges of the territory thanks to three types of induced benefits:

Meeting a demand from residents and providing a real benefit in terms of quality of life: health, living environment, quality of public spaces...;
Transforming the city sustainably by making it more consistent with the requirements of a successful ecological transition (mobility, biodiversity, carbon sinks...);
Integrating nature into the city and preserving biodiversity.

## 3. Creating Symbiosis Between Industrial Decarbonization and Decarbonization of the Living Environment

The Greater Dunkirk accounts for 21% of French industrial emissions; achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 for the industrial zone is an immense challenge that all partners are tackling head-on. It is therefore unthinkable to work on decarbonizing the living environment by 2030 without taking into account the actions carried out by industrial sites and the Grand Port maritime, without working in a coherent and concerted manner to help each other achieve the objectives set. It is in this spirit that EcosystèmeD was created, a Public Interest Group pursuing a dual objective: to animate the economic ecosystem of the territory by promoting circularity and to make industrial decarbonization and that of the living environment coherent.

It should be noted that in a territory like Greater Dunkirk, where industry has played a predominant role for more than 100 years, large companies have a driving role and a real influence on the entire territory; it should also be noted that decarbonization is an essential element, including economic, of almost all the large companies in the territory: the old ones that must reduce their emissions (steel, aluminum...) as well as the new ones (batteries for automobiles)

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments | Climate Neutrality Commitments of Greater Dunkirk
whose one of the commercial arguments is the reduction of emissions. The employees of these companies but also those of the subcontractors are therefore essential relays on «public opinion». Moreover, the economic renewal of the territory implies the creation of 20,000 jobs; obviously, it will be necessary to seek certain skills throughout France and even beyond. But the primary ambition, for reasons of social justice or acceptability, is to allow the inhabitants of Greater Dunkirk and neighboring territories to benefit from these jobs. This implies a very important work of characterization of positions, training, adaptation... Carried out jointly by EcosystèmeD, the Greater Dunkirk and all the actors of the territory (State, Pole Emploi, Region, Entreprendre Ensemble, training organizations, social workers, community centers, Chamber of Commerce and Industry and companies), this action is essential for the two pillars of Greater Dunkirk's decarbonization: that of the living environment with its inhabitants and that of the industrial port zone.

Among the first actions launched by the GIP since its creation, two directly concern the CCC and carbon neutrality in 2030. The first is to launch, over time, a social conference. It aims to bring together all the actors of the territory - including unions and associations - around the challenges of industrial decarbonization and the living environment. For this reason, a first edition is scheduled with three items on the agenda:

Air quality and health
Adaptation to employment
«Factories without parking» (this last subject is in itself a key factor in the decarbonization of the territory).

This first edition of the social conference will lead to the writing of a specific roadmap and the setting up of specific working groups (those mentioned and those that will be requested by the participants); then, the conference in its plenary form will meet several times a year to measure the progress of the actions carried out and to evolve them if necessary. The GIP EcosystèmeD also carries out awareness-raising actions for inhabitants, and in particular young people, about decarbonization jobs with the organization of an event called «Fabuleuse Factory» allowing large companies and energy companies to explain and highlight the jobs of tomorrow. This event takes place at the same time as the European Decarbonization Industry and Territory Meetings (6 editions). In the context of the links between industrial decarbonization and the living environment, EcosystèmeD will soon inaugurate, in its building, a «showroom» explaining industrial decarbonization in the Greater Dunkirk context.

## ADDED VALUE:

Ensure coherence of action between universes that have long ignored each other and that are now pursuing a common objective: carbon neutrality;
Benefit from a strong added value of communication and influence on a large part of the actors of the territory;
Allow the inhabitants of the territory to benefit from the renewed economic attractiveness and the new jobs;
Involve as many actors as possible in decarbonization and create two co-decision-making bodies on carbon neutrality (EcosystèmeD and the social conference).

## 4. A New Greater Dunkirk Innovation: Factories Without Parking

Just two years ago, who could have predicted that several major economic players would want to set up in Greater Dunkirk? Today, it's a reality. It's an opportunity but also a challenge that we must face. 20,000 new jobs are announced. If we refer to the old model, this means that 20,000 people will take their gasoline-powered vehicles to work every morning.

How can we imagine fighting to reduce the emissions of the living environment and those of the industrial zone while generating, suddenly, a huge flow of new emissions? How can we build the industries of tomorrow in an industrial zone that would resemble that of the end of the 20th century: a huge parking lot?

The stakes are enormous. Once again, even people who are most sensitive to the issue of climate change are attached to what they consider a freedom: their individual mobility.

So it is a question of demonstrating that free public transport or soft mobility to an industrial zone works; that it can save time and comfort; that the challenge is worth the effort; that additional services can be put in place...

Several actions are planned as part of the CCC:

Setting up a specific technical group within the framework of EcosystèmeD, in conjunction with the CUD, mobility actors (including soft mobility and public transport) and industrialists;
Setting up a consultation group within the framework of the social conference;
Communication actions in conjunction with partners towards employees and inhabitants;
Setting up a «demonstrator» line between the station and the new industrial sites;
Adaptation work of the industrial zone with the State and the Port including the creation of specific roads, greenways or park-and-ride facilities with a high level of service.

## ADDED VALUE:

Counter the main negative impact of the territory’s economic development;
Carry out an effective, innovative and symbolic action to anchor decarbonization as the territory’s first challenge.
Around a project with high stakes and generating resistance, strengthen the territorial consensus around decarbonization.

## Strategic Axis

Greater Dunkirk is the first voluntary Urban Community in France. In 1968, the elected officials decided to work together to manage the arrival of very large industrial sites on the coast and therefore new inhabitants. Since then, the Urban Community has played a central role in its territory and it is naturally at the initiative of the first transition and decarbonization actions carried out in Greater Dunkirk. It thus has a specific service dedicated to sustainable development and climate.

For 10 years, in accordance with the commitments made by the President of the Urban Community, Patrice Vergriete, with all the mayors of the territory, the ecological transition has become the main axis of community policies.

On the occasion of the work and consultations carried out by the institution on its Local Urban Plan, Housing and Transport (PLUIHD) and on the Climate Air Energy Plan (PCAET), the ecological transition has become a real territorial project, transversal and carried by all the services of the institution, the municipalities and their partners.

On the occasion of this work, solid partnerships have been established with many actors in the territory to define common objectives and an action plan for the PCAET. The pilots of the CCC were able to rely on these organizations to go even further in the decarbonization process.

Thus, an action plan has been defined, collegially. In addition to the key actions, it determines a series of priorities:

Develop renewable and recovery energies, which are real levers for the ecological and energy transition.
Prepare for adaptation to climate change, by integrating actions into all sectors and functions of the territory.
Preserve air quality by reducing energy consumption, modifying our modes of transport and consumption, reducing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, thus reducing pollutants in the atmosphere and improving the health of inhabitants.
Co-construct the future, by involving all local actors in a collective effort and by engaging the population in an educational and participatory approach to change consumption and usage behaviors.
Allow the replicability of its actions in other cities.

This action plan also includes the necessary evaluation of the policies implemented in order to establish a continuous

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments | Climate Neutrality Commitments of Greater Dunkirk
improvement process and to evolve the processes or generate new actions to ensure the success of the mission. In addition, the roadmap is based on and seeks to enrich and develop the fourteen commitments made within the framework of the PCAET to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030:

Axis 1: An exemplary community in terms of climate and energy transition
Axis 2: A mobilized public force, with its partners around decarbonization
Axis 3: Preserved biodiversity
Axis 4: Buildings and urban planning that respect the environment and health
Axis 5: Preserved air quality
Axis 6: A territory resilient to climate change
Axis 7: Low-carbon and low-impact travel
Axis 8: A low-carbon economy and industry
Axis 9: A territory that is autonomous in energy and a producer of low-carbon energy
Axis 10: A territory that produces little waste and optimizes its recovery
Axis 11: More sustainable agriculture and food practices
Axis 12: A preserved water resource

The action plan and its roadmap will be gradually expanded in terms of actors and actions throughout the various revisions and extensions of this CCC. And two additional axes will be added:

Axis 13: Citizen involvement
Axis 14: A just transition

## Organization

Social and political consensus: The CCC, just like the PCAET recently developed and voted on by the Urban Community, is the subject of a broad political and social consensus. As mentioned, decarbonization is «the big issue» in Greater Dunkirk and transcends partisan politics. Thus, the CCC is also supported by all the mayors of the territory as well as by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
A green social pact for a just transition: Greater Dunkirk urban area is known for its resilience; in fact, that of its inhabitants. They are the wealth and life of the territory; public policies are intended for them to improve the life of each and every one. In this context of climate crisis, it is essential to leave no one behind. It is with and for the inhabitants that we will succeed in our transition, taking into account their desires and constraints. This is the very principle of the Greater Dunkirk CCC and, in particular, its eco-winning component. This is also why all the major policies implemented in the territory are preceded by a time of consultation and collective reflection (for example, DK+ mobility before the implementation of the free bus).
The need to play collectively: It is a tradition in Greater Dunkirk, almost an obvious fact: collective success is always preferred to individual destinies. Today, faced with the climate crisis, faced with the need to accelerate, we must intensify our actions and involve as many actors as possible. Playing collectively also means thinking together, sharing to generate ideas and innovation. This is the whole spirit of the social conference and even the exchanges «living environment and industry» carried by EcosystèmeD. The first territory of this size for the free bus, the first territory to develop an eco-solidarity water billing, the first territory to imagine factories without parking... In Greater Dunkirk, we think, we build and we innovate together. This is the spirit of this CCC which must be evolutionary and iterative.
In Greater Dunkirk, co-construction in action: In Greater Dunkirk, the consultation of inhabitants and the devices for co-elaboration of projects or public policies are permanent and concern most of the important subjects of the territory. This way of co-constructing the future is constantly evolving and the work of developing the CCC has been an opportunity to revisit already effective practices. On the issues of adapting the territory to climate change, as early as 2020, 2021, the Urban Community wished to strengthen citizen dialogue at the level of the community territory.

The Co-Mission Zero In addition to the existing bodies and partnerships, the current partners of the Greater Dunkirk CCC wish to set up a co-mission zero integrating representatives of the partners of the social conference, technicians in charge of climate in the partner communities and representatives of the inhabitants (a reflection is underway to

Climate City Contract | 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments | Climate Neutrality Commitments of Greater Dunkirk
determine whether citizens are drawn by lot or if a call is made for volunteering); the principle of the co-mission zero is to reverse the usual roles. Indeed, in general, technicians or elected officials explain their choices and actions to the inhabitants; in this case, citizens will be able to inform themselves continuously but, during the meetings, it will be up to them to present their feelings, opinions and needs to the various actors.

**A continuous learning process** Changing our habits and behaviors, inventing a new way of life, imagining new solutions for housing, transportation, consumption... is undoubtedly one of the greatest challenges humanity has ever faced; This is why we must «learn by doing», that is to say experiment, encourage innovation and the sharing of ideas but also invent new organizations or forms of partnerships ... We must also quickly learn from our successes and failures. It is in this spirit that the Greater Dunkirk CCC is conceived and it will be the role of the elected representatives of the Urban Community but also of the members of the Co-mission Zero to maintain this positive dynamic.

## 4. Process and principles

Greater Dunkirk is committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2030 and has adopted a comprehensive systemic work process to achieve this goal. Here's a breakdown of our approach:

### Systemic Work Process:

**Baseline Assessment**: We conducted a thorough assessment of our current carbon footprint, identifying key contributors and areas for improvement. Although the industrial port area falls outside the scope of our CCC, we recognize the significant contribution of its companies to the region's economic vitality. Every three years, we assess the carbon footprint of the area. Through the CCC, we aim to foster greater transparency and understanding among these companies regarding the impact of our climate action plan and initiatives.

**Goal Setting**: Based on the assessment, we set ambitious but achievable climate neutrality targets, aligned with international standards and local needs. By using the economic model design by the university of Madrid, we had complete information about the reduction of emissions needed to achieve climate neutrality. Our actual climate plan represents 62% of reduction, but with action developed by the CCC dynamic and the transition team, we aim to accelerate the trajectories and reach the 80% goal the European commission aimed us.

**Action Planning**: We developed a detailed action plan outlining specific strategies and initiatives to reduce emissions across various sectors, including energy, transportation, waste management, and building. We intend to prioritize citizen engagement and participation in future phases of our climate action plan. While we have been actively raising awareness among our residents, we now seek to empower them to become active participants in local governance, allowing them to express their concerns and contribute to the development of Greater Dunkirk. Additionally, we are currently establishing partnerships with associations, businesses, and other organizations that can influence climate neutrality.

**Resource Allocation**: We secured funding and resources to support the implementation of our action plan, leveraging both public and private investments. As outlined in our investment plan, our climate budget is increasing annually. We also have a dedicated team focused on securing funding from regional, national, and European sources. We aim to participate in pilot projects, such as the 'Net Zero Urban Industrial Growth' initiative, to secure continued funding for large-scale climate initiatives.

**Stakeholder Engagement**: In developing our climate plan, we engaged a diverse group of stakeholders, including citizens, businesses, NGOs, and government agencies, to foster broad support and collaboration. We intend to adopt a similar approach for the Climate City Contract (CCC), aiming for faster progress and more impactful results compared to our initial climate plan. We have observed a growing awareness among citizens regarding climate change. While our early events focused on explaining the basics, we now discuss mitigation and adaptation strategies. It is time to take action and prioritize the needs of our citizens. With respect to stakeholders, we aim to develop strong partnerships and learn from the experiences of companies and associations that can support our neutrality trajectory.

Monitoring and Evaluation: We implemented a rigorous monitoring and evaluation system to track our progress toward climate goals, identify areas for improvement, and make necessary adjustments. Building upon the existing indicators used for the climate plan and the "territory engaged in ecological transition" label, we developed additional indicators specifically for the Climate City Contract (CCC). Each department responsible for these indicators is tasked with meticulous tracking to enable timely adjustments and optimize our path to achieving 2030 climate targets. As an innovative territory, we anticipate the influx of new businesses and dynamic initiatives that will contribute to the development of projects tailored exclusively for Greater Dunkirk. By closely monitoring these projects, we aim to compile comprehensive reports that can be shared widely to facilitate replication in other cities.

## Monitoring and Updating the CCC:

Regular Reviews: We will conduct periodic reviews of the CCC to assess its effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. At least yearly reviews for the main indicators easy to track.
Data Collection: We will continue to gather data on emissions reductions, energy consumption, and other relevant metrics to inform our review process. Although we are already collecting this data, we will refine our communication strategies both within the Greater Dunkirk administration and externally to ensure ongoing awareness and engagement among the public.
Adaptation to New Developments: We are committed to adapting the CCC to evolving circumstances, such as technological advancements or policy changes. As Greater Dunkirk is undergoing a period of economic transformation, flexibility will be essential. For instance, the recent surge in giga factory projects, which were not fully anticipated in our 2022 economic development strategy, underscores the rapid pace of change and the potential for positive outcomes if we maintain our current trajectory.

## Principles Guiding CCC Implementation:

Collaboration: We will promote collaboration among all stakeholders to ensure a coordinated and effective approach. Implementation is not feasible without collaboration, and during the development of the CCC with the transition team and select stakeholders, the importance of enhanced information sharing and identifying potential synergies for improved outcomes was emphasized
Innovation: We will foster innovation and explore new technologies to reduce emissions and enhance sustainability. Many of our initiatives rely on research to optimize current processes. For instance, we've established a team within the roads sector to investigate ways to improve our operations and minimize environmental impact. We're also exploring social innovation, such as a new strategy for landlords involving coordinated renovation projects along specific streets to reduce labor and equipment costs. This approach will benefit landlords by offering cost-effective renovation options and simplifying the process.
Equity: We will work to ensure that the benefits of climate action are distributed fairly among all citizens. While subsidies may be income-based, counseling and support services will be accessible to everyone. The 'ecowinner program' offers incentives for purchasing water cisterns or composters, promoting sustainable practices and benefiting all residents. through the CCC, we are exploring potential funding mechanisms, such as patronage, to support residents in planting trees in their backyards, allowing everyone to contribute to our environmental goals.
Transparency: We will maintain transparency regarding our progress and challenges and actively engage with the public to foster trust and support. This collaborative approach is crucial for uniting the community around our shared goal of climate neutrality. By encouraging public participation and keeping everyone informed, we aim to create a sense of ownership and involvement in our climate initiatives.
Accountability: We will hold ourselves accountable for achieving our climate neutrality goals and take corrective measures as necessary. Greater Dunkirk has long implemented policies aimed at decarbonizing activities and improving quality of life. As we shift our focus to living areas, our goal is to ensure that by 2030, both industries and residential areas are recognized for their decarbonization efforts. This demonstrates our commitment to becoming an innovative territory where air quality and overall well-being are prioritized.

By following these principles and implementing our systemic work process, the City of Dunkirk is confident in its ability to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 and create a more sustainable future for our community.

# 5. Signatories

The signatures for the Climate City Contract (CCC) are currently in progress.

As a reminder, our CCC aligns closely with our Climate Action Plan (PCAET).

The signatories of the PCAET are the stakeholders who contributed actions to the plan. They are committed to achieving climate neutrality within the territory, encompassing both the living and industrial areas. This collective action demonstrates the interconnectedness of these areas and highlights Dunkirk's collaborative approach.

To formalize this support and ensure contractual compliance, we are currently working to obtain the necessary signatures for the CCC. Once finalized, we will be able to publicly acknowledge and use the support of these key stakeholders.
